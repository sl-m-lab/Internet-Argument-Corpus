   "Well, let's start with what you actually said, that which I actually disagreed with:\n \n \"There's also Sharia Law...convert of I will behead you...we won't wait for God to send you to hell when you die...we'll kill you ourselves if you don't comply.\"\n \n There's lots wrong in there.

   "So, since Jim has not yet decided to respond, I'll ask my own question. What do conservatives want?\n \n While doing some reading on this subject I googled \"islam\" \"convert or die\". The results were mostly references to the conservative blogosphere. Apparently conservatives really want people to accept as fact the disinformation that Islam has a \"convert or die\" agenda. This seems odd. I would have thought islamic terrorists crashing planes into the world trade center would have been enough of a rallying cry for those who had it in for islam. Why invent a bogus rationale? I can't say for sure, of course, but I'll toss out some guesses.\n \n If your opponent has a political agenda, then a solution is possible. Even if their demands are ludicrous, even if you won't talk with them, those forming policy will not always be in charge. Either through old age or more violent means someone else will be forming policy eventually, and they might be more reasonable. Thus, an end is potentially in sight. If your foe has a religious agenda, on the other hand, than no peaceful resolution is possible. If their goal actually was \"convert or die\", and this was an actuall religious duty, then a peacful resolution is pretty much out of the question. Thus, the only solution is a \"final\" solution. If peaceful coexistence is out of the question, then utterly destroying your enemy is your only option.\n \n If genocide isn't what the conservatives are hinting at, then what? I don't know enough about the conservative mind set to know if this is close to the mark or not, but could it be about Isreal? The bulk of the trouble we have with Islamic radicals springs from our support of Isreal. On the one hand, we're stuck supporting Isreal at this point, there's no way that will change any time soon. On the other hand, Isreal is a jewish state, how happy can the religious right be that we're risking so much for them? So if you wanted to win over the R.R. an obivous ploy would be to make it seem like Islam had it in for everyone, even the Christians. If you shift the point of the terrorism from politics to religion then you can guarantee the continued support of the religious right. I'm not pushing this as necessarily true, just tossing it out as something to think about.\n \n Any other ideas? Should this get moved to politics?",

   "Well, it depends on which strawman you're stomping on.\n \n Jim's is so because it extrapolates on what has been pushed forward by some terrorists.\n Reading a call to 'convert or suffer the consequences' (which IIRC were made by the American convert to Islam and here is the 1st link that popped up in my google search ) into comments that have been made. Or interpreting that infidels must die for (xxx) reason into comments that have also been made isn't hard to do.\n \n I mean, an American convert and member of Al Qaeda who states the comments in this particular video...you know, Al Qaeda \"we brought your 9/11 without warning...stating 'today may be your last day' doesn't really sound like the crocodile tear laded messages by some Christians to 'convert...or face eternal hellfire.'\n \n So, I think Jim could be forgiven for jumping to some obvious conclusions.\n I mean, seriously, I've hit people in the faces with Louisville sluggers for less threatening 'threats' by them and I've been arrested myself for less intimidating forms of 'terrorism'.\n \n And, yeah, I think Jim's call of extermination, to more sane ears, would sound a bit knee jerkish and extreme.\n But, this isn't a rose colored world we live in. And while you want to negotiate with obviously insane, bloodthirsty mad men who's 1st reaction to a problem is to blow something up, I really don't think that will work. Seems to me it hasn't in past attempts.\n I find it quaint that you think talking will miraculously solve problems (that really don't exist except to a fringe group).\n \n \n I don't know.\n Jim did state he thought this is what the radicals want and asked for some rebuttal.\n \n Your rebuttal is to state the comments come from conservative blogs...opps sorry, you said 'MOSTLY' come from them. \n Mostly implies not all. \n Mostly is also a (IMO) subjective term.\n And seeing as how most of the Internet sources one would visit in a GOOGLE search in English would bring you to something based in the Western world (and probably not sympathetic to the terrorists due to the 'war on terror' thingy and chance of being raided by the police if it's tracked back to you) I doubt your search (or most of anyone else's 15 sec. search would dig up much from an actual terrorists site to get a real understanding.\n So, your average Joe is left to go by what the terrorists via western media sources like the neo-fascist CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, ABC, CNBC, Reuters or any number of neo-Con sources like WGN and Fox or the BBC push forward.\n \n Stooopid fascist BBC news.\n \"Separately, Palestinian militants who held two Fox News journalists hostage for almost two weeks last month vowed to target all non-Muslims who entered the Palestinian territories. \n \n \"Any infidel blood will have no sanctity,\" the Holy Jihad Brigades group said in a statement posted on the Internet. \n \n The group, which was previously unknown, had forced the captured journalists to convert to Islam at gunpoint, according to one of the released hostages.\"\n \n \n Yeah, yeah. They have nothing on the crusaders from hundreds of years ago (my own strawman for today's post). I'm fondly reminded of one Crusader who had an entire city of 100,000 converts from Islam to Christianity put to the sword...so they would die Christian deaths and not have a chance to back slide.\n But, if religions have a trend to exclaim, from time to time, 'convert or die', made by their radical zealots, it's not hard to look at Islam's 'Jihad' and think that this century, the pendulum is on the other side with similar comments being made towards us.\n \n \n Oh well.\n That's my somewhat disjointed .02\n I've always lived by the ethos of ''Oderint dum metuant'' or, 'let them hate...so long as they fear.'\n But, if you want, you can interpret that to actually mean 'Why can't we all jus' git along?'",

   "I'm not sure going by the letter of the law of the Koran is necessarily the best way to show what Muslims want or don't want. I think it shows what the Koran says they should do, but that's not necessarily the same thing. It's the same idea as holding up the teachings of Jesus to 'turn the other cheek' and 'love your enemies' and say that such texts demonstrate what Christians want--yet Christians don't seem to do that all too often. The same likely applies with the Koran and Muslims; it's a religious morals-type book at the center of a mainline religion, so I cna't think of any reason it wouldn't also play out like that.\n \n Also, I'm also not sure I'd agree that the goals of radical Muslims are limited to getting the US out of the ME and for the US to stop supporting Israel. There have been too many \"we-want-Israel-annihalated\"-type statements to assume their goals are that benign.\n \n If conservative sources aren't good enough, then by all means check out non-conservative sources on this. I did the same Google search and by merely clicking on more than one page was able to find NON-\"conservative\" source reporting of such cases as Muslim convert-or-die cases. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6412453.stm )\n \n But like so many threads of this nature, this is largely about generalization. It's highly unlikely that there aren't some Muslims who don't have a convert-or-die mentality. But I know for a fact many of them don't; I've been around some that are very peaceful and willing to co-exist with Christians. Bottom line: it depends on the Muslim and his individual beliefs.",

That was the gist of your statement. It wasn't a specific claim that such words are not in the Koran, but it was definitely designed to make readers think that you'd covered enough of the Koran to know it's not there.\n \n The terrorists think what they think because of what was in the Koran (is likely still in their version) and what happened after Muhammed died.\n \n \n\n I only said one quote was a bad translation, and then followed that with exactly what you're asking for here; a correct translation from my copy. Did you read what I wrote at all?\nYes...but it was not exactly what I asked for. You posted nothing of a source..except that I know you typed it.

They cut out the part where the man's head actually comes off...and they didn't show the bodies burning..just burnt and being dragged down the street.\n \n No. That's not the only source you will see from me. I plan to have lots more later. I do doubt that we can find an English version of the original text. The history of radical Islamism and the variations in text I have already seen tells me that there are several versions of the Koran just like there are several versions of the Bible. I can imagine there are differing versions of several verses. We've already shown that.\n \n You seem to think I am attacking Islam in general. That is not the case. There is a radical element within Islam that gives Islam a bad rap.\n \n http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/oped/forte/01/islam.html\n \n Try reading this. Maybe you will understand the difference.\n \n Here, I'll print the crucial parts for you.\n \n\n Bin Laden and other Islamic radicals claim they represent ancient Islam. It is true that they do represent one tradition in Islam, but it is a tradition that Islam early on rejected as opposed to the universal message of its Prophet. In the earliest centuries of Islam, a great civil war was fought over who should be the successor to Muhammad. The battle was between the partisans of the assassinated third Caliph, Uthmann, and those who supported the fourth Caliph, 'Ali. This was the conflict that ultimately led to the division between Sunni and Shi'a Islam. But there was a moment when a truce and an arbitration promised a possible peaceful resolution to the conflict. \n \n One group was adamantly opposed to any arbitration and any compromise. Later called the Kharajites, this sect believed that only God could determine who should be the proper successor, and God would let his will be known in battle. The Kharajites withdrew and made war on both factions. They held that any person who strayed from the perfect practice of Islam was ipso facto an apostate and could be killed. And they believed that only they had the true notion of what Islam required. They applied their doctrine with a ferocity against both the developing Sunni and Shi'a traditions of Islam, even assassinating 'Ali. Their tactics were frightfully violent, and it took centuries before they were put down. \n \n Today, radicals like bin Laden replicate that ancient sect that threatened to destroy Islamic civilization at its inception. They copy that sect that stood against what came to be a civilization known in its time for its learning, science, openness and toleration. They engage in tactics that are far beyond what is acceptable in the Islamic moral tradition. They insult the vast multitudes of Muslims who abhor such actions. \n\n \n ****************\n \n There's more in the link. No violent videos either.",

   "It wasn't a refutation, it was a statement. I've read a bunch, and what you claim is there, I haven't seen. I've invited you to show me that it is in there. If it is there it should be trivial for you to show that I'm in error. However, since you have never actually read the Koran, but only snippets fed to you, you have failed to do so.\nNow, Kronus. In response to my statement that it was there, your statement is intended to sway readers toward disbelief...backed up by the knowledge that you have read most of it and haven't seen it. It was more an attempt to sway than to disprove.\n \n But, there's enough said about that already.\n \n \n\n Be honest, you've read none of it at all. Seriously, have you read even one chapter all the way through? Or just quotes that someone tells you supports some claim?\nI am being honest. I have never picked up a hard copy of it. I have read many verses on-line from various versions of it. This is why I am aware of the possibility of seeing different wording for the same verse in each version...similar to what happens on comparison of quotes from The Holy Bible...it matters which version you use. The Koran, The Quran or whatever you wish to call it, or how ever you wish to spell it, at some point in its being manipulated into a modern-day religious rulebook, contained verses favoring the killing of non-believers in the faith (Islam).\n \n \n \n\n I'll grant that \"kill non-believers\" and \"death to infidels\" is pretty much the same thing. Of course, neither one is what you said at first. You said \"convert or die\", which is clearly different from the other two. At least, to those of us that don't think \"most\" and \"all\" are the same thing. Perhaps you can explain to me how \"convert or die\" and \"die\" are actually the same thing? Cause the difference is so obvious to me I can't even imagine how someone doesn't see it.\nI see you want to pick nits some more. My contention that IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONVERSATION REGARDING THE ISSUE OF RADICAL MUSLIMS vs. THE REST OF THE WORLD, all of those phases mean essentially the same thing...the radical Muslims believe we should be killed for not believing as they do. If I leave off \"convert or\" and just say they want us to die, it should be understood that I mean that they want us to \"convert or die\", their basis being that we are unbelievers...and should therefore die.\n \n \n\n Yes you do, unless you're accusing me of lying. However, 10 seconds research gave me a half dozen translations on line. Why are you pretending that checking what I said is so tough?\nWell, to be honest, you should show me a link to the one that has your exact version of the verses quoted. Don't expect me to review multiple links I find in google to verify that one of them says exactly what you typed.\n \n Your point about many versions is well taken. There are likely more versions than I can find. I would venture to say that there may be some other versions that neither you nor I can find without help from someone that is intimately familiar with the history of Islam.\n \n Have you read the David Forte article yet? Do you have any comments or refutations of what he said?\n \n Have you not seen any news clips concerning (and recording) the preaching of extreme hatred by radical Muslims? Did you hear about the one in Great Britain? Do you watch the news?\n \n I think also, we need to get another issue straight. This is not an affront on Islam. I have moderate Muslim friends who share my views about killing the radicals. One sits not ten feet from me as I type...a Turkish friend that I admire and share thoughts with regularly. We don't talk religion much, but when we do, I am just as honest with him as I am with 4forums' readers...I state my hatred of radical Muslims in no uncertain terms. So please don't confuse radical Muslims with non-radical Muslims.\n \n By the way, Turkey has just initiated the hosting of some peace talks between Syria and Israel. I don't know that the talks will generate a lasting peace, but they are trying. Turkey is chock full of moderate Muslims who do not share the idiotic notions that the radicals hold dearly.",

   "\n similar to what happens on comparison of quotes from The Holy Bible...it matters which version you use. \n\n Nope, totally differerent. There is no \"official\" Bible, people can pretty much make up their own version, as you well know. There is only one Koran, and it's in Arabic. What we have are different translations, none of which are considered official, and none of which are evidence of a different root text.\n \n \n\n I am being honest. I have never picked up a hard copy of it. I have read many verses on-line from various versions of it.\n\n Strange idea of honesty you have there. I would have thought an honest answer to the questions I actually asked would have looked more like \"well no, I haven't read a chapter all the way through, I have only read the little bits people have sent me\". Or, perhaps, \"yeah, I have read a couple of chapters all the way through, but mostly just single verses\". You know, actually addressing how much of the Koran you've read, and not acting as if the format were somehow relevant.\n \n \n\n I see you want to pick nits some more.

The two phrase simply don't mean the same thing. Either pick one and stick with it, or say good bye.\n \n \n\n Your point about many versions is well taken.\n\n I made no such point.",
