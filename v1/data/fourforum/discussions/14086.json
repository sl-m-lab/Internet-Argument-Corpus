   "Skeptics of Mark's Gospel claim he is in error in describing various geographical locations. Most conservative theologians and Christians say that's bunk. This thread is dedicated to that debate.\n \n Skeptics? Let's see your claims. Lay out one at a time, please. Arguments concerning the other the Gospel's geographical claims are also acceptable, but please address Mark first.",

   "From Gospel of Mark\n \n \n The author of the Gospel of Mark does indeed seem to lack first-hand knowledge of the geography of Palestine.

The simplist solution, says Nineham, is that 'the evangelist was not directly acquainted with Palestine' (40).\"\n \n \n Let's see you come up with a 'simpler' solution than what Nineham proposes.\n I suspect your proposed solution will violate Occam's razor",

While the phrase is found in almost all manuscripts, it is absent in three of them. It is also missing from the parallel verse in Matthew 21:1, though not from the parallel verse at Luke at Luke 19:29.
