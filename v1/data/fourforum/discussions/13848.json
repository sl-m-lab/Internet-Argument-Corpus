   "I saw this while checking on UN gun treaty any thoughts?\n \n Monday, November 16, 2009\n Obama revives talk of U.N. gun control\n \n Obama revives talk of U.N. gun control: \"Arms Trade Treaty\"\n \n George Bush wouldn't have it, and George Bolton, his Ambassador to the United Nations fought it.\n \n What is it?\n \n It's the \"UN Programme of Action on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\".\n \n Mildly stated as a series of \"Whereas\" and \"Therefore\", and professing the right of the \"individual\" to possess weapons for defense, this measure is cunningly designed to provide justification for 'states' (or nations) to rigidly control the commerce in small arms and ammunition to anyone who doesn't represent a state or a nation. (See UN A/Res/63/23, and UN A/64/228, and pp. 3-5 of A/63/PV41 for example.)\n \n Secretary of State Hillary Clinton isn't Bolton, and President Barack Obama isn't Bush. Between the two of them, Hillary and Obama are deliberately moving this nation toward the signing of a treaty which would force the United States to accept the supremacy of the United Nations to dictate National Policy in regards to the Second Amendment.\n \n Here are the lead paragraphs to the WND article:\n \n Gun rights supporters are up in arms over a pair of moves the White House made last month to reverse longstanding U.S. policy and begin negotiating a gun control treaty with the United Nations.\n \n Secretary of State Hillary Clinton first announced on Oct. 14 that the U.S. had changed its stance and would support negotiations of an Arms Trade Treaty to regulate international gun trafficking, a measure the Bush administration and, notably, former Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations John Bolton opposed for years.\n \n Two weeks ago, in another reversal of policy, the U.S. joined a nearly unanimous 153-1 U.N. vote to adopt a resolution setting out a timetable on the proposed Arms Trade Treaty, including a U.N. conference to produce a final accord in 2012.\n \n \"Conventional arms transfers are a crucial national security concern for the United States, and we have always supported effective action to control the international transfer of arms,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"The United States is prepared to work hard for a strong international standard in this area.\"\n \n Gun rights advocates, however, are calling the reversal both a dangerous submission of America's Constitution to international governance and an attempt by the Obama administration to sneak into effect private gun control laws it couldn't pass through Congress.\n \n This seems to reference to the \"... international transfer of arms\", but in fact it would affect the ability of every American to \"Keep and Bear Arms\". Or to purchase, exchange, trade or give firearms to every other person or merchant.\n \n This isn't a Paper Tiger. You may be asking: \"What's the big deal? The Second Amendment protects our rights. What we agree to in terms of International Trade has nothing to do with us.\"\n \n The problem is that the United States is close to signing an International Treaty, and this is the single move which can immediately and irredeemably counter the U.S. Constitution, or any law.\n \n \n Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution reads:\n \n All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.\n \n This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\n \n The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\n \n In other words, if the United States (in the person of President Obama) signs this treaty, and it is ratified by Congress, then all existing laws ... up to and including the Constitution ... are over-ruled.\n \n Remember the words:\n \n all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\n \n That means exactly what it says.\n \n If we enter into a treaty with the United Nations, and that treaty is or can be interpreted as disallowing the purchase or ownership of Small Arms, then that becomes the Law of the Land and it cannot be reversed by the Constitution, State Law, or any court in America.\n \n This is exactly the kind of tool which any wanna-be Dictator would elect to impose his own private vision of a disarmed citizenry. In fact, I'm unclear on the process ... would it be necessary for this treaty to be ratified by Congress? Can the president sign this treaty and unilaterally impose disarmament on the strongest country on earth?",

Forty-eight states allow people to carry a concealed weapon; all but Alaska and Vermont require a permit.\n\n \n  Feds fight back on Montana made guns lawsuit \n Montana doesn't have the authority to exempt itself from national gun control laws, the federal government argued in new court filings, hoping to beat back a movement from states adopting the Firearms Freedom Act.\n \n The Department of Justice, in a brief filed this week in U.S. District Court in Missoula, said that federal gun control is a \"valid exercise of Congress' commerce power under the Constitution.\"\n \n The lawsuit followed overwhelming support in the state Legislature for an act that declared Montana's sovereignty on the issue. That Montana Firearms Freedom Act was subsequently signed by Gov. Brian Schweitzer.\n\n  Colorado, South Dakota Firearms Freedom Act Introduced \n Introduced in the State Senates of both Colorado and South Dakota last week is a bill known as the &#8220;Firearms Freedom Act.&#8221; If passed, the bill would make state law that &#8220;any firearm, firearm accessory, or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in the state and that remains within the borders of the state is not subject to federal law or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.&#8221;\n \n This now makes Firearms Freedom Acts already passed in Montana and Tennessee, and currently introduced in these 21 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.\n \n According to Gary Marbut of the Montana Shooting Sports Association and author of the original bill that was introduced in Montana, &#8220;It&#8217;s likely that FFAs will be introduced soon in West Virginia, New Mexico, Idaho, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina and maybe elsewhere&#8221;\n\n Who has EVER heard of such a rebellion before?

For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?

   "Guns for me but not for thee even if they break the law, their own charter and charade of small arms control!\n \n \n \nIn February 2002, the Bush administration decided to review the purchase permit given to the United Nations. That review was prompted after a meeting between a member of Annan's security detail and a U.S. government official in New York. \n \n The office of ATF's chief legal counsel then launched a detailed re-examination of the situation, according to bureau sources who spoke on background. \n \n Shortly after the 2002 ATF examination, U.N. security officials tell NewsMax, the MP-5's were removed from Annan's security detail. The guns were subsequently suspended from active service and then secured in a locked facility inside U.N. headquarters. \n \n The have remained there for over a year, say members of the U.N. security department. \n \n Accommodation\n \n State Dept. sources tell NewsMax that ATF and the U.N. never reached an accommodation which would have allowed the rifles back on the streets of New York. In fact, the sources explained that ATF told the U.N. should the guns venture outside its mid-town Manhattan headquarters, it ran the risk of having them seized. \n \n \n Firearms are not covered under the provisions of diplomatic immunity, says the State Dept. \n \n \n Faced with a ban on the use of the firearms outside the U.N. and the possibility of an embarrassing confrontation, the world body and the U.S. agreed on a transfer of the rifles outside the country. \n \n \n Where the guns are headed is a question neither ATF nor the United Nations would comment on. \n \n \"We were told that the guns are headed to U.N. peace keeping operations,\" so claimed one U.S. diplomat. The diplomat explained he had no idea which peace keeping operations, just that they were outside the United States. \n \n The issue of when the arms transfer will take place is now a subject of debate. \n \n Both State Dept. and ATF officials were led to believe the weapons had already left NYC. U.N. security officers tell NewsMax that as of last Friday the guns had not been moved. The officers added that there are no indications the weapons are planning to be relocated anytime in the near future. \n \n An ATF source, speaking on background, still wondered why the guns were even bought to begin with: \n \n \n \"If someone really wanted to attack the U.N. (chief), they could easily use an RPG (rocket propelled grenade, as U.S. forces have seen in Iraq). \n \n \"When something like that happens, an MP-5 is not going to make any difference,\" he explained\n",

U.N. security chief Michael McCann told reporters the NYPD and the FBI had been called in to assist in an investigation.\n \n Veteran U.N. security officers tell NewsMax whether intentional or not, the death on Monday points out serious problems in the United Nations New York security operations.\n \n Currently, U.N. security officers carry 9mm Glock handguns.\n \n The Glocks do not carry safety locks. In fact, NewsMax is told the only device preventing an accidental discharge of the handgun is the holster it is carried in.\n \n \"If that gun is taken out of the holster, watch out\" one U.N. security veteran explained. He added that he and several other officers \"unofficially\" break U.N. rules and do not carry their guns loaded.\n \n Rules mandate that at least one bullet be present in the gun's chambers \"at all times.\"\n \n The U.N. source explained that the Glock issued to U.N. officers requires \"little pressure\" to XXXX the trigger and is too easy to discharge. As such, the source added that he opts to keep his ammunition \"close by\" but not in the gun.\n \n The problem is further compounded by the U.N.'s decision to equip its officers with \"hollow point\" bullets. Such bullets, unlike conventional ones, fragment and spread on impact to cause maximum damage.\n \n Several U.N. officers tell NewsMax the use of such bullets is \"overkill\" and unsuited for use in a heavily populated office building such as the high-rise Secretariat.\n \n \"It is stupid to carry these bullets. It shows that they (U.N. management) do not know what they are doing,\" explained another veteran United Nations officer.\n \n Earlier this year, the U.N. spirited out of New York City a cache of highly controversial sub-machine guns known as MP-5's\n \n Pretty good trick to shoot himself in the ear with the gun \"wedged between his legs\" and his head in the upright position huh?\n \n You wouldn't care to demonstrate just how simple this feat is would you? :)",

That is it in a nutshell, that is your claim; meanwhile the ATF recinded the sale that Bill Clinton, then president, had coerced them into approving. You noticed the original article I posted Feds Pressure Annan To Dump Machine Guns\n \n TEXT: UNITED NATIONS -- Under pressure from the Bush administration, the United Nations security department has decided to move a stache of controversial firearms out of the world body's New York City headquarters. \n The MP-5 sub-machine guns made by Heckler and Koch of Germany, are to be moved to U.N. peace keeping operations overseas, according to State Dept. sources. \n \n As first reported in The Washington Times (February 2002), the UN originally purchased the highly restricted weapons for the personal protection of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his travels around the New York-Metropolitan area. \n \n The guns were often plainly visible in the support van of Annan's motorcade as it moved throughout the concrete canyons of Gotham. \n \n It was unclear why the Annan bodyguards needed such high powered weapons, say sources within the State Dept's. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). \n \n Under a U.S. agreement with the United Nations, DSS bears the ultimate responsibility for Annan's protection within the borders of the United States. \n \n The MP-5 is a strictly regulated firearm and currently can only be purchased by law enforcement bodies. It is popular among specialized police units such as SWAT and CAT (counter-assault) squads. It can easily be modified from a sub-machine to a full machine gun says its manufacturer, Heckler and Koch. Its use is also restricted to U.S. citizens, says the State Dept. **note: yeah, with the flip of the selector switch no other modification required.\n \n The U.N.'s security force does not have \"law enforcement status,\" explained a source at the U.S./U.N. mission in New York. \n \n According to DSS sources, if security concerns warrant, the U.S. is always prepared to increase the protection around Annan, which it has done on numerous occasions in the past. \n \n No such concerns were known to have existed when the UN made the request to purchase the weapons in the late 1990's, says the State Dept. \n \n The decision to obtain the controversial assault rifles was made by U.N. security chief Michael McCann in 1998, according to U.S. government sources. \n \n About a half dozen were purchased by the world body. \n \n McCann, a retired official from the New York City Police Dept., who has been at the U.N. in various posts since his arrival in the early 1990's, refused to respond to repeated inquiries on the subject. \n \n ATF Denies \n \n The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) which regulates the sale and purchase of the MP-5's, originally decided to deny the U.N. purchase permission. \n \n There were several reasons for the denial according to State Dept. sources: \n \n A key factor was the U.N. security department's lack of law enforcement status. \n \n Another was the possibility of non-U.S. citizens being given access to the weapons. \n \n Through political pressure coming from senior Clinton administration officials, the U.N. eventually got ATF to discreetly reverse its denial. \n **My note: legalese to ignore their own policy\n \n In February 2002, the Bush administration decided to review the purchase permit given to the United Nations. That review was prompted after a meeting between a member of Annan's security detail and a U.S. government official in New York. \n \n The office of ATF's chief legal counsel then launched a detailed re-examination of the situation, according to bureau sources who spoke on background. \n \n Shortly after the 2002 ATF examination, U.N. security officials tell NewsMax, the MP-5's were removed from Annan's security detail. The guns were subsequently suspended from active service and then secured in a locked facility inside U.N. headquarters. \n \n The have remained there for over a year, say members of the U.N. security department. \n \n Accommodation \n \n State Dept. sources tell NewsMax that ATF and the U.N. never reached an accommodation which would have allowed the rifles back on the streets of New York. In fact, the sources explained that ATF told the U.N. should the guns venture outside its mid-town Manhattan headquarters, it ran the risk of having them seized. \n \n \n Firearms are not covered under the provisions of diplomatic immunity, says the State Dept. \n \n \n Faced with a ban on the use of the firearms outside the U.N. and the possibility of an embarrassing confrontation, the world body and the U.S. agreed on a transfer of the rifles outside the country (snip)\n \n END TEXT\n \n \n NEXT:\n sinjin: \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Doc Jones \n It is a partial, same meaning.

   "I liked Mr. Barret's Law much better and some of the other companies that joined with the same feelings!\n \n \nJune 30, 2003 \n \n Chairman, Public Safety Committee\n State of California\n Sen. Bruce McPherson\n \n \n Via: Fax (916) 445-4688 \n \n Dear Senator McPherson, \n \n United States defense contractors such as Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc., Murfreesboro, TN USA rely on orders from the US Military as a primary source of income but this government income for most contractors is only part of the necessary income for long term survival. Commercial or civilian product sales are also a main source of income that makes payroll and for good working conditions for their employees. We must support these defense contractors in both peace and war and allow them to operate, market and sell their products under the rules, regulations and law of the Federal Government. There is a balance of customers among defense contractors that is necessary for sound, long term business and by eliminating commercial sales in California this balance is disrupted. To vote against .50 cal rifles puts jobs of your constituents as risk, the lives of your police at risk, and in the end the safety of the State of California at risk. Are you willing to jeopardize this? \n \n The defense industrial base in America is at risk of being unable to fully support our country in time of need without adequate opportunity for commercial sales of various products. In the Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc situation the civilian legal Barrett .50 cal rifle is at risk in the state of California. The attempt to ban a legal firearm not only violates the basic principals of the US Constitution but sets a precedence that endangers many vital defense contractors. In the Barrett case it also endangers California law enforcement agencies from having a proven and important tool in the fight against terrorism. \n \n * W. Hays Parks, Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate of the US Army wrote: \"The M82A1 Barrett... are manifestations of the important historic cooperation played by private citizens and small business in the United States in the development of weapons and munitions necessary for the US Armed Forces to perform their mission to protect the national security interests of the United States by fighting and winning, with as few friendly casualties as possible.\" This statement sums up the vital role both government and commercial business play in the sound business practices of various defense contractors of which Barrett is one. \n \n The Barrett .50 cal rifle was ascertained by the troops on the front lines in Iraq as the best performing small arm and they have the private defense contractor to thank for that weapon. Ban .50 cal rifles in California and you take this tool from your police also. The war on terror is not over! The Barrett .50 cal rifle has been in the hands of competitive shooters, hunters, and collectors for over 20 years and is a mainstay of the long range competitive shooters matches. It also serves on Police SWAT teams as the primary long range anti-sniper weapon. \n \n It is the Barrett position that we choose not to support in anyway state or local governments who are against the US Constitution and the safety and security of this nation. If California were to ban the sale of the Barrett .50 cal rifle we will stop the sale and service of all Barrett products to all State Law Enforcement agencies of the state of California immediately and ask all small arms manufactures to consider similar action. Re-classify the .50 cal rifle and you align yourself and the State of California as being part of the very terrorists who are attempting to destroy this great nation of ours. \n \n Please vote against banning or re-classifying .50 cal rifles. \n \n Respectively,\n\n \n I really loved his later letter to the Chief of Police in Los Angeles emoticon_xgoodemoticon_xhoho",

   "Sinjin's support for his state's unacceptable practice, known as their handgun roster, reminds me a great deal of this article.\n \n Laboratories of Repression - WSJ.com\n \n \nIn 1932, progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis penned one of the most famous passages in American jurisprudence. \"It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system,\" Brandeis wrote in his dissent in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \"that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory, and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\"\n \n Since then, Brandeis' famous words have been quoted or referenced countless times, appearing everywhere from legal documents to campaign speeches. Most recently, they surfaced in the arguments leading up to the landmark Second Amendment case McDonald v. Chicago, which the Supreme Court is set to hear in early March 2010.\n \n At issue in the case is Chicago's draconian handgun ban, a restriction that largely mirrors the gun control law struck down last year by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. The key difference is that Heller only decided whether the Second Amendment secures an individual right against infringement by the federal government (which oversees Washington, D.C.). McDonald will settle whether the amendment's right to keep and bear arms applies against state and local governments as well.\n \n That's where Brandeis comes in. In Chicago's view, the Second Amendment should have no impact on its vast gun control regime. As the city has argued to the Court, \"Firearms regulation is a quintessential issue on which state and local governments can 'serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.'\" Thus, Chicago claims it should enjoy \"the greatest flexibility to create and enforce firearms policy.\"\n \n That certainly sounds like a classic case for federalism and the states as laboratories of democratic experimentation. But look a little closer and Brandeis' celebrated words start to lose some of their shine. The issue that confronted the Supreme Court in New State Ice Co. was a 1925 Oklahoma law granting a handful of companies the exclusive authority to manufacture, sell, and distribute ice. Under the law, anyone that wanted to enter the ice business had to first justify their plans by providing \"competent testimony and proof showing the necessity for the manufacture, sale or distribution of ice\" at all proposed locations. In other words, upstart ice vendors faced the nearly impossible task of securing the state's permission to compete against a state-sanctioned ice monopoly.\n \n That's the \"courageous\" experiment Brandeis got so misty about. What precisely was so \"novel\" about a business currying favor with the government in order to suppress competition? That's one of the oldest tricks in the book. Besides, as the great classical liberal Justice George Sutherland declared in his majority opinion striking down the Oklahoma ice monopoly, \"in our constitutional system...there are certain essentials of liberty with which the state is not entitled to dispense in the interests of experiments.\"\n \n Quite so. In fact, Brandeis himself occasionally shared this skeptical view of state power-at least when it came to state \"experiments\" on the First Amendment. Just one year earlier, in the case of Near v. Minnesota, Brandeis joined the Court in striking down that state's defamation law as a violation of the freedom of the press. So much for allowing a \"courageous\" state the free rein to experiment.\n \n It was Sutherland's majority opinion in New State Ice Co.-not Brandeis' famous dissent-that got it right. \"In [Near v. Minnesota] the theory of experimentation in censorship was not permitted to interfere with the fundamental doctrine of the freedom of the press,\" Sutherland wrote. \"The opportunity to apply one's labor and skill in an ordinary occupation with proper regard for all reasonable regulations is no less entitled to protection.\"\n \n Which brings us back to the Chicago gun case. The Windy City would like to \"serve as a laboratory\" with the \"flexibility\" to ignore the Second Amendment. But there's nothing \"novel\" about that. It's just another case of the government violating our rights. And since the Supreme Court would never let Chicago ban free speech, establish an official religion, or conduct other \"experiments\" on the First Amendment, why should the Second Amendment receive any less respect?\n \n It's time for the Supreme Court to give the entire Bill of Rights its due.\n",
