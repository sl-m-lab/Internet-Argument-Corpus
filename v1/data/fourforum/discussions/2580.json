   "Lance Armstrong fights allegations of drug use:\n http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=CCAC71C5-F7A2-489F-A0672C917356A277\n \n \n \"This is not the first time it's happened to me,\" he said. \"This stuff started back in 1998 when I came back from cancer and finished fourth in the Tour of Spain. Immediately I had questions: How is that possible? When I won the Tour in 1999, even more questions. It has happened every year since then.\"\n\n \n http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/wfaa040615_am_armstrong.2657ef8b9.html\n \nThe book L.A. Confidential, the Secrets of Lance Armstrong was written by British sports writer David Walsh and excerpted in the French magazine L'Express. Walsh quotes a member of Armstrong's cycling team, Emma O'Reilly, as saying she disposed of syringes after a race and delivered pills to Armstrong during a training camp. \n Armstrong said he doesn't know why O'Reilly would make those comments. \n \"This is the first time I've heard from her for years and years,\" Armstrong said. \n In Austin, Armstrong's hometown, cyclists inspired by the champion said they find the allegations hard to believe. \n \"He's been tested as many times as possibly could be done,\" said cyclist Greg Watkins. \n Watkins knows the 33-year-old champion was drug tested each time he won a stage of the Tour de France.\n \n I have to admit that I wondered after he made such a miraculous comeback.\n \n Your view?",

   "I have to admit that I wondered after he made such a miraculous comeback.\n \n Your view?\n\n \n I don't buy it.\n \n My cousin is big into cycling. He explained to me one day why Armstrong was unbeatable. His body processes oxygen at a rate only about 0.1% of the Earth's population can do it.\n \n There is a test for this, I forget what it's called, but it basically measures the body's ability to absorb oxygen and reid itself of CO2 and other wastes.\n \n Basically, every person has an absolute ceiling of body efficiency that this tests measures. The test is largely independent of your physical conditioning believe it or not. It simply measures the body's potential. No matter how hard you work out, you can never go beyond a certain point. I could work out for the rest of my life like a madman, and Armstrong could sit behind a desk and eat donuts, and he would ALWAYS beat me in an endurance test. \n \n Major soccer teams and even some NFL teams are now doing this test as part of their screening process.\n \n Interesting stuff.\n \n Armstrong's score was the highest ever recorded.\n \n Waxy",
