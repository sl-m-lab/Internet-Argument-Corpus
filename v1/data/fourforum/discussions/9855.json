OVERBAUGH, and S. MILLER, 1988 The origin of mutants. Nature 335:142-145) But you don't seem to be aware of research since then, and in fact admissions by Cairns himself.\n \nHe's referring to directed mutations rather than adaptive mutations.\nNo. Actually he is correct. The term is not a reference to random mutations. It is the term used to refer to mutations that are a direct response by an organism to a changed environment. It does not refer to mutations that are acted upon by the environment and are thus adaptive.\n \nBack in the 80s john Cairns used a strain of bacteria with a defect in the gene encoding an enzyme for breaking down lactose....this meant the bacteria could not live on lactose....but Cairns fed the bacteria lactose and looked for cells to appear that could live on it. He found the cells he was looking for, and interepreted this as the following:\n \n \"suggesting that cells may have mechanisms for choosing which mutations will occur\" \nYeah. We all know about all of that. But really quite soon after the publication of his paper, even Cairns concluded that the mutational process was not \"directed\" toward specific targets (i.e., there was no reverse information flow) (FOSTER, P. L. and J. CAIRNS, 1992 Mechanisms of directed mutation. Genetics 131:783-789). Work has continued such that even after only 10 years it has shown that, \"Although recent results show that the mutations that arise during selection are not \"adaptive\" in the original sense, the mutagenic mechanism that produces these mutations may...be of evolutionary significance.\" (FOster, P.L., 1998 Adaptive Mutation: Has the Unicorn Landed? Genetics, Vol. 148, 1453-1459)\n \nThis concept contradicted the dogma evolutionists had lived by up until that point, as it pointed towards lamarckism --\nIndeed it did. But research since then, some of it by the very same researchers, has debunked Lamarckism once again. What is being observed in this case is a greatly increased production of Pol IV that is induced by a protein (sigma-38) that is produced by starving bacteria. Pol IV (Polymerase IV) is a mutation causing enzyme that causes errors in the copying of DNA. The researchers have concluded that what appears to be adaptive mutations is actually due to the fact that the other mutations are not apparent to researchers, since they result in the death of the bacteria either through starvation or because they are lethal.\n \nand IDists do not claim these mutations are directed by \"God\" but from the interaction between the organism and the environment......and that the organism was set up to be adaptive to changing environments.\nActually, some IDists make that claim.

Continue to expose your dishonest style of debating by purposely misinterpreting what is argued while avoiding the real point being made, and not answering it at all.\n \n \nSure, I'll consider that. Given the few actual successful frauds, and given the fact that being caught in a fraud would destroy a scientist's career, I'd be willing to venture that there aren't many.\n \n \n Yes but the glory for furthering the fraud is so great, and things like Tenure and large Grants make the risk worth it. I mean, its all a matter of interpretation anyway. And an evolutionary scientist today has a whole industry of other evolutionists who will cover for them because in the end, defeating Creationism and supporting evolution is all that counts. But as a layman you don't see that and assume that everyone in that INDUSTRY is seeking the truth. But here's the rub, THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE SEEKING TO SUPPORT A PRECONCEIVED OUTCOME AND THAT ISN'T SCIENCE. IT'S A MANUFACTURED BELIEF SYSTEM.\n \n \nAre you including physics, cosmology, geology, nuclear physics, astronomy, paleontology, archaeology and so on in your count? Because there have been some doozy frauds by creationists in other fields of science besides evolutionary biology.\n\n \n No I'm not. And it's discoveries and observations from within all of these other sciences that if you did a research study on, you would find not only contradict, but prove that evolution is a fraud and manufactured belief system. IT MUST BE GREAT TO USE THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS ONES SCIENCE AND BURY WHAT DOESN'T, HUH ? Because that is precisely what evo has done since the beginning. If it conflicts with evo they never publish that connection, but if it can be made to appear to, they will market it like it's the missing link.\n \n \nWhat about it? Please tell us about these volumes of scientific evidence. Are you sure that this \"science\" that you wish to believe isn't fraudulent?\n\n \n You're the evolutionist, you check it out. And here's where to look. In the course of reading and watching news releases about scientific discoveries and observations in many branches of science over the years, discoveries and observations have been made that directly fly in the face of evo claims. And after that initial release by the branch that made the discovery, it is never mentioned, catalogued or added to the volumes of info that disproves evo at all. \n \n No one is keeping that file for public consumption. And evo itself has made many many observations and discoveries that conflict with their preconceived notions and in every case, if it can't be fit into their construct of deceit then it is buried never to be referred to again. That sir is the epitome of deceit and fraud.\n \n \nScience is not a question of truth. It is never claimed to be TRUTH. Science tries to explain the observations we make about our universe. It isn't claimed to be the TRUTH, but only the best explanation we can devise based on current evidence. In science, there is always the presumption that the explanation is tentative and subject to adjustment or rejection if new evidence comes to light.\n\n \n Understood, and with legitimate sciences that principle has worked fine and is even necessary for moving forward and remaining open to new discoveries. Why would you think that I don't get that ? But ask yourself this pandion, what if a science is founded on a completely fictional lie ? How can the evidence support that unless it is manufactured from the very beginning ? And that is why i constantly refer to evo as a fraud because it was founded on false assumptions and preconceived notions that are FICTION. Therefor any info gleaned in support of it is false and manufactured.\n \n EXAMPLE: Islam is a 1500 year old cult where as Jehova Witness is less than 100 years old. But just because islam is older and has more members, does that then make it any less a cult ? Not on your life. They are both founded in lies and deceptions. And so it is with evo. It is a cult based in and founded on lies and preconceived notions. And it is followed like a religion by people like you who place all of your faith in it as truth as you kneel at the alter of this fraudulent science. \n \n \nThe problem is that biblical creationism has been shown to be wrong by many fields of science.\n\n \n This too is a lie. If you really possessed the scientific mind that you claim, and had the ability to honestly discern fact from fiction, you would find that in the volumes of real archeological discoveries made in the Holy Land, completely support what is found written in the bible. Completely, 100%. I don't follow fairy tales pandion. I'm not needy or hungry for lies to fill my life. Every one who ever told me about Jesus before receiving Him myself was told hey, I was born a moslem and I'll die a moslem. All the while I wanted to know the living God but I had no desire to convert to Christ. But I met Him and know that He is alive and well and as real as you are. But He is God and now dwells within me. So I'm not believing a man made fairy tale, but you are my friend.\n \n \nThat's just not true. We mock you for your ignorance and hubris. Moreover, you don't even know enough to realize that you are rejecting science in general, not only a single \"branch\" or science, but physics, cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, geology, archaeology, nuclear physics, molecular biology, population genetics, genetics, and more that don't come to mind. What you reject is science itself in that you reject the scientific method.\n\n \n Again with the judgments and assumptions that you cannot reasonably know. I too am a college graduate and understand the principles of evo. But I insist on asking the hard questions that evo doesn't allow a student to ask so I am a heretic of sorts. What you sheeple don't understand is that as long as you follow the party line and never insist on asking these very legitimate questions then evo can never be considered a true and valid science.\n \n \nSince nobody even mentioned that, what are you talking about?\n \n\n \n And yet in every post, you and (or) your ilk mock me as a backward simpleton who must hold onto myths to sustain my insignificant existence in this life. As if believing a lie is better than facing reality. A more shallow and ridiculous argument I can't even imagine, as the truth is everything to me, and the end result of the search I started as a child. \n \n Absolute truth does exist pandion and I've discovered it. And that is what I share here. Everyone who receives it must decide if I'm a liar, a lunatic, or if I have truly met the living God of Creation. That is what is called personal responsibility on your part. accept and receive or deny and reject. The choice is yours, but as for me, I have shared His truth and that is all that matters to me.\n \n \nHow is that meaningful? What does it mean?\n\n \n Again, by swearing allegiance to the religion of evo, you by definition deny the creation account of our existence. All of these who insist that they are good Christians, who happen to accept evo for how we got here will be held accountable for evey person they have supported that lie to someday. You can't have it both ways pandion. God does not compromise with the truth.\n \n \nNo. We mocked you. Your god isn't relevant to the question of science.\n\n \n The only way God is irrelevant to this conversation is if He doesn't in fact exist. Otherwise every attack you make against the truth I speak is spoken against HIM, not me. Because it's his truth I'm sharing with you, not mine.\n \n \nBy the way, Archy. I have a question for you and StuporSport. Why is it that neither of you actually respond to my posts? All you two do is attempt to insult me. Never do you actually respond with anything of substance. What's the deal? Is it that you can't respond due to a lack of knowledge and you are left with nothing more than insult? I think so.\n\n \n I do respond to them directly pandion. The ones worth answering anyway. I answered every statement you made above. But your offensive remarks to me are responded to in kind in many cases. I don't suffer your mockery well at all. But just because you don't like my answers or the direction they take, don't imply that I don't respond directly as it is very disingenuous and false. I accused you correctly of verbal masterbation, and you responded by accusing me of masterbating on the Holy Bible. You tell me which of us made a valid debate point and which of us committed blasphemy ?\n \n \nI'm not actually all that knowledgeable. It's just that I have basic knowledge and the ability to reason and to do research. The result is that you two are reduced to nothing more than insult.\n\n \n That you're not that knowledgeable goes without saying. Then research the truth about evo if you dare. Find the discoveries and observations within Genetic science, Nuclear science and biological science that directly refute what evo claims and then judge for yourself the inconsistencies that it is rife with. Then ask yourself how reliable your chosen religion is and how well placed your faith is ? And if you stop insulting me, I'll stop reminding you how ignorant one must be to believe as you do.\n \n \nOf course, there is always the \"we'll see who's right when you die\" nonsense. But that doesn't address the question.\n \n\n \n Unfortunately, because I can't prove my God through the prism of your scientific microscope, it will only be after death that you will learn the truth. Unless of course you simply ask God to reveal Himself to you within yourself which is the only way to meet the God of life. If you do that, He has promised that \"If you grope out into the darkness, (of this World) I will find you.\" And \"If you seek the Truth, the Truth will set you free.\" So all we are expected to do by our Father is to SINCERELY seek Him. He will find us, open our eyes and allow us to see Him as clearly as we see each other. But His love is so great that He wont force Himself on us. \n \n He also say's \"Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and KNOCK, if any man hears me and opens up the door, I will come into Him, dine with Him and He with me.\" In three simple passages I have given you the complete Gospel and the way to eternal salvation and it has nothing to do with a church, a minister or any man at all. For Jesus said \"I am the Way the Truth and the Life, there is no other way to the Father but through Me.\" Seek and you will find, ask and you will receive, but you either love me or you hate me, those who are lukewarm I will spew out of my mouth. \n \n So He stands at the door now, if one sincerely seeks him and opens the door of their heart He will most assuredly reveal Himself to them.",

But just because islam is older and has more members, does that then make it any less a cult ? Not on your life. They are both founded in lies and deceptions. And so it is with evo. It is a cult based in and founded on lies and preconceived notions. And it is followed like a religion by people like you who place all of your faith in it as truth as you kneel at the alter of this fraudulent science. \n\n The religions you named are no more a cult than your particular brand of \"Christianity\" that you claim to follow. Evolution is science, pure and simple, whether you want to make the fallacious claim that it is religion or not.\n \n \n I don't follow fairy tales pandion. \n\n Says the guy who blindly accepts known and admitted HOAXES, and believes in the fairy tale of Noah and the flood. :xbanghead The Irony Meters are close to going off the scale right now.\n \n \n \n \n Unfortunately, because I can't prove my God through the prism of your scientific microscope, it will only be after death that you will learn the truth. Unless of course you simply ask God to reveal Himself to you within yourself which is the only way to meet the God of life. If you do that, He has promised that \"If you grope out into the darkness, (of this World) I will find you.\" And \"If you seek the Truth, the Truth will set you free.\" So all we are expected to do by our Father is to SINCERELY seek Him. He will find us, open our eyes and allow us to see Him as clearly as we see each other. But His love is so great that He wont force Himself on us. \n \n\n \n Dude, you just proved the exact point he made in the statement you quoted here.:xbanghead",
