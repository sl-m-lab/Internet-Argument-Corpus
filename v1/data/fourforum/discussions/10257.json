   "2. Why should a candidate be for repealing DOMA? \n \n Because the so-called \"DOMA\" or federal anti-marriage law passed in 1996 was a radical and cruel departure from 200+ years in which the federal government honored the marriages of Americans without discrimination. So-called DOMA creates two classes of marriage, first-class marriages for those the federal government likes, which receive more than 1000 legal protections and incidents, and second-class marriages, for those the government doesn't like, which get no access to this important safety-net that matters to couples, kids, and those interacting with them. In the United States, we don't have second-class citizens, and we shouldn't have second-class marriages, either. Government has no business putting obstacles in the path of Americans seeking to care for one another -- gay or non-gay. \n \n 3. What is Section Three of DOMA, which Senator Clinton wants to repeal, and what would remain if that section is taken out? \n \n Senator Clinton, like all the other Democrats running for president, favors repeal of the worst provision of the federal anti-marriage law, the part that says that the federal government will not honor the lawful marriage of a taxpaying same-sex couple, thereby withholding from the 1138+ federal protections and responsibilities that marriage triggers. These include your family's access to your Social Security, fair treatment for your family under immigration law, fair treatment under tax laws, access to veteran's coverage, etc. What Senator Clinton has not yet addressed is the other part of so-called DOMA, which says that states can dishonor and destabilize marriages of people from other states. People should not have to worry whether their marriage will be honored and their family protected depending on where they are parking that day. \n \n 4. Are the candidates being politically wise in being for civil unions and not for marriage equality and should we support them in that political strategy? \n \n No, and no, as discussed in my Huffington Post pieces above. Civil union, let alone the freedom to marry, doesn't just happen. Support for increments along the way comes through the engine of fighting for the freedom to marry, and the powerful, resonant, humanizing, shared vocabulary of marriage. It's not as if the candidates or society are generously offering civil union or partnership, etc., and we are somehow unreasonably asking for more; rather, it's our engagement -- asking for, fighting for, making the case for -- the full that has moved them on the partial. Marriage is the tug, and when gay people undercut that tug, it doesn't help our cause, or the candidates either. Those who are giving early support to particular candidates may have good reasons for doing so, but when we too quickly say \"it's okay\" for them not to support full equality (and even fudge what full equality is), it's not helpful. You can't get people to care if you begin by saying \"I don't care,\" as in \"I don't care what we call it,\" etc. And if we drop down, if we fail to do the heavy lifting (particularly at this very early stage of an unusually long presidential cycle), we do the candidates, our cause, couples, kids, and the country the disservice of not creating the space in which America (and its politicians) can rise to fairness.\n http://www.davidmixner.com/2007/08/evan-wolfson-ma.html#more",

However, I'm looking at the reality of the religious right and their influence. What is achieveable in the short term and long term? I think people need to be educated. Equal IS equal. You are absolutely right. And eventually, I pray there IS equality for gays. But given the current trend in the US, I doubt very much that it is going to happen. The Religious hate groups are well organized and well funded against us. We have to be smart and make a plan to get to the equal status we are entitled to. New Jersey is just another step towards that equality we want. But it's going to take more states.... one at a time. But IF gays can achieve more and more equal rights along the way, then great.

It will not, in fact, follow, and it is highly unlikely that it will.\n\n \n I concur on this. I think too much hope is being put in the democratic candidate. We got out hopes up with gays in the military with Clinton, and what happened? He was crucified by the right, compromised on a bad policy and the anti-clinton seed was planted that eventually resulted in a superfluous impeachment. I don't think the next dem candidate will make it a priority. They just want the gay vote because they don't want another Florida to happen. But if I do think if a Republican gets in, other than Guiliani, gay rights could be set back. I wish there was a strong 3rd party in the states. It is sorely needed. These two parties are just too polarized. Wasn't it the Republican party that was historically socially liberal and fiscally conservative? Whatever happened?",
