   "Taking guns out of the equation for the first part, I ask, Who are the milita?\n \n \n \"Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms\n each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia.\n Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an\n American ... The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or\n state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.\"\n -- Tench Coxe, 1788. \n \n \n \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from\n time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take\n arms...the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood\n of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n \"Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared\n to take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic\n purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice\n for that freedom.\"\n -- John F. Kennedy\n \n Section 311 of US Code Title 10, entitled, \"Militia: composition and classes\" in its entirety:\n \n \"(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are - \n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and \n \n (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.\" \n \n \n \n \n And so I ask Who are the militia",

   "hmm.. Seems the lunatic fringe does not want to touch this with a ten foot pole....\n\n \n I always laugh every time an anti-gunner uses the militia argument to restrict firearms ownership. \n \n Yipppppie, we are all in the militia. Any anti-gun comments and the militia?",
