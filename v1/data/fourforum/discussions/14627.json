   "Every so often we come across a creationist who is attacking the Theory of Evolution/Big Bang/Science in general based on the notion that people are converting to Atheism (or at least away from Christianity) on the basis of science.\n Only one person (Unkerpaulie) that I've come across has said that science was the reason he converted away from a particular faith;\n \nBenedict, I have to disagree. I was a theist, christian, and pentecostal church member, usher and on the treasury board. I was also a firm believer in creation and the infallability of the bible. \n \n I joined an old yahoo group (back when yahoo groups were actually cool) and argued strongly against evolution and in support of creation. The first thing I learned was that what I was arguing against wasn't evolution, and that I didn't know what evolution was. So I took it upon myself to learn what evolution was so I could arm myself with more effective arguments. The next thing I learned was that evolution was a proven fact that didn't contradict anything in the bible. The third thing I learned was that there was a mountain of physical and scientific evidence that contradicted what I believed the bible said about the origin of the earth. \n \n Once I was faced with the dilema of contradicting options, concerning a decision which I think is of utmost importance, I started to dig for more evidence, for unbiased reports that supported either side. The more I dug, the more it was revealed that what the bible says is in many ways contrary to reality. This was the beginning of my journey into atheism. \n \n Debating evolution with a creationist isn't pointless. Debating with a closed-minded person, regardless of the topic, always is.\n\n More usually conversion (either way) seems to be based on emotion.\n Even Unkerpaulie hints at this, I suspect that his conversion had more to do with him becoming aware that the group he was with, was lying, rather than being swayed by a scientific theory per se.\n Of course this would suggest that the main threat to religion is the lies of the religious.",

   "I might as well chime in here. I agree with bennedict that religion is more a case of delusion than deceit. Even the authors and originators of probably most religious doctrines were deluded, possibly because of their limited knowledge and lack of scientific method, perhaps because of their own proconceived notions, but not necessarily because of malicious intent. \n \n I have found that theism was created to explain the beauty and awesomeness of nature, and to make sense of the destruction and tragedy nature can cause. Particularly for early man, and his limited scope of observation, the way the world works, as you explore more and more, can become so overwhelming wonderful and complex that everything would seem majestic, magical even. It is no stretch to conceive that man would attribute this grandeur to a force greater, wiser and more powerful than himself (and man was the dominator of the earth as it was). When man tried to understand nature, theism was born. \n \n In order to hold on to a theistic viewpoint, you have to become closed-minded and impervious to reality. This is where the lying comes in. The early rulers learned this, and made it part of the doctrine, especially as knowledge of nature started to develop. People were told to not question authority, to stop trying to figure out God, and to accept everything on faith. Converting to atheism is very simple, all you need to do is apply some logic and reasoning to the bible. Ask questions. If the bible is absolutely true, then it should pass any truth test. The only possible way a theist could maintain his/her belief is by resigning the pursuit of knowledge. They must bluntly refuse to learn anything new. They must essentially become defensive of scientific discovery and reject logic. Because as long as you follow the trail of truth, inevitably and without question, you will abandon theism. When man tried to understand God, atheism was born. \n \n Its rare that you find people who would rather learn the truth and be forced out of their comfort zone, than hold on to their familiar lie.",

   "According to a number of polls, it isn't learning about science that tends to dissuade one from creationism, it is learning in general. Several polls (including those by fundamentalist christian Gallup, who was quite upset by the results of his own polls) have shown that the more educated a person is, the more likely it is that they reject religious mythology, such as christian fundamentalist creationism.\n \n Gallup's polls showed that creationists tend to be more rural rather than urban, manual laborers rather than blue collar or white collar, less educated than average, and less affluent (probably co-related to education).\n \n The sad state of science education in this country is highlighted by the fact that many fundamentalist christian creationists think that Mr. Kent Hovind is a great scientist. He claims that he has earned a PhD. In fact, he does not hold a degree from any accredited educational institution (except high school). And yet he claims to have been a science teacher for a number of years. However, while he leaves the impression that he has actually studied science, he has not. His bible college degree, from an non-accredited institution, is in Religious Education. His Master's degree and his PhD are in Christian Education and are from a correspondence diploma mill, Patriot University, then located in a house in Colorado Springs, CO. It has since re-located to a ranch-style house in Del Norte, Co. and has been re-designated as Patriot Bible University. Apparently, Patriot Bible University no longer offers either master's or doctor's degrees in Christian Education. One has to wonder if that has something to do with the bad publicity from the federal prison inmate, Mr. Kent Hovind.\n \n And yet, this is a man that is touted by christian creationists as a great scientist. A man that actually has no science education whatsoever.\n \n Maybe Gallup's polls are right on the button.",
