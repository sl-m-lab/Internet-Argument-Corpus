   "You made it up. Feel free to prove me wrong by showing your argument about how the Republican frontrunner Toomey can beat Specter. \n\n \n Specter almost lost his primary the last time against Toomey - it was 51% to 49%. He's been on an increasing downhill slide with his Republican constituents, in light of his opposition to other Republicans, and his voting for the recent Democrats stimulus package. Recent polls show that if the election were held today, Toomey would win by 51%. Specter has said this;\n \n \"I am unwilling to have my 29-year Senate record judged by the Pennsylvania primary electorate.\"\n \n Specter says party switch driven partly by desire to keep seat - CNN.com\n \n He also said this;\n \n \"I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak.\"\n \n http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003104956\n \n Did he forget to tell Hatch? He knows that the Republican primary electorate has recently grown smaller as more and more Pennsylvanians have switched their registration from Republican to Democrat, costing him more primary votes. All indications are that he is (was) weaker in Pennsylvania Republican primaries than he is in Pennsylvania general elections. \n \n The increasing disdain among all his voters in Pennsylvania is similar to the increasing disdain South Dakota voters had for Tom Daschle in 2004. Do you think there were absolutely no Democratic committee chairmen who predicted Daschle would win that election? I'd bet there were. \n \n Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement: \"Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. (Specter's switch) I am not. Let's be honest: Senator Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record. Republicans look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.\"\n \n His \"left wing voting record\", especially since Obama took office. What Steele (and Specter himself) said makes far more sense to me than what you claim Hatch said. If it doesn't to you then that's your opinion, but you really shouldn't say I'm making things up. You're a new guy, and it's very troll-like. 4forums has quite enough of those right now - we are accepting no new trolls at this time. :p\n \n \nWell obviously, you've never head of the website CQ Politics before. It's non-partisan and it's a website that analyzes Congressional races. They say that Specter is the favorite. Their opinion is non-partisan and informed. Their opinion has credibility. I cannot say the same for yours. \n\n \n Speculation about future political races involves speculation about events that haven't happened yet. Any organization that speculates for a living has some interests that are distinctly different from those of the general public. \n If you're sold on one source for your political information and believe it can do no wrong, that's your choice. I get mine from several, balance them with each other, and sometimes alter my opinions of each accordingly. Not all of mine are paid to give their opinions. No one person or group is perfect, and I suspect CQ Politics isn't changing that fact. I don't claim my opinions are perfect. \n \n \nAgain, you postulate that a man whose job it is to get Republicans into the Senate has been bought by special interests to say that his own parties nominee is likely to fail. I'll just let others determine if that is a sane opinion or not. \n\n \n I never said nor postulated that. There is a difference between being bought, vs. dancing to the tune of the political party that you work for. \n \n \nAgain, if a person who is:\n \n * Loyal to the GOP\n * Ranked highly in the GOP\n * Holds a job to elect GOP's senator\n \n Says that the current GOP challenger in PA has no chance, then he probably has no chance. \n\n \n How about if someone named John McCain is;\n \n Loyal to the GOP\n Ranked highly in the GOP\n Holds the job as GOP presidential nominee\n On November 3rd, is shouting from the rooftops that he is going to be the next president of the U.S., did you believe him? There are similiarites in the displayed hope of presidential candidates a day before the election as there are in partisan vice-chairmen of political committees. \n \n \nThat's because you didn't understand what I said, even after I said it once and then re-explained it again. Again, I take issue with your prediction that Specter could not win the GENERAL ELECTION. Specter would have lost the primary election, but he is now a favorite to win the general election as a Democrat. \n\n \n What you said was very simple - that you believe Specter would have won the 2010 primary, and general election as a Republican.

You've said you don't believe that, so you have to think that he had another reason for switching.

   "Specter almost lost his primary the last time against Toomey &#8211; it was 51% to 49%. He&#8217;s been on an increasing downhill slide with his Republican constituents, in light of his opposition to other Republicans, and his voting for the recent Democrats stimulus package. Recent polls show that if the election were held today, Toomey would win by 51%. Specter has said this;\n \n \"I am unwilling to have my 29-year Senate record judged by the Pennsylvania primary electorate.\"\n \n Specter says party switch driven partly by desire to keep seat - CNN.com\n \n He also said this;\n \n \"I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak.\"\n \n http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003104956\n \n Did he forget to tell Hatch? He knows that the Republican primary electorate has recently grown smaller as more and more Pennsylvanians have switched their registration from Republican to Democrat, costing him more primary votes. All indications are that he is (was) weaker in Pennsylvania Republican primaries than he is in Pennsylvania general elections. \n\n \n Congratulations on spending the first half of your post repudiating a position I explicitly said I was not taking. Again, I take issue with your saying that Specter would loose a GENERAL ELECTION against Toomey.\n \n \n\n The increasing disdain among all his voters in Pennsylvania is similar to the increasing disdain South Dakota voters had for Tom Daschle in 2004. Do you think there were absolutely no Democratic committee chairmen who predicted Daschle would win that election? I&#8217;d bet there were. \n\n \n It is predictable that if you are in a party, that your party will say that you will win. When they say you are going to lose.....you are probably going to lose. It is in their interest to lie on your behalf. If they don't, then that means that your defeat is so obvious, that they cannot even afford to lie on your behalf as they normally would. \n \n \n\n Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement: \"Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. (Specter&#8217;s switch) I am not. Let's be honest: Senator Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record. Republicans look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.\" His \"left wing voting record\", especially since Obama took office. \n\n \n Again, congratulations on repudiating a position I said I wasn't taking. I already told you that I thought Specter left the GOP because he was going to get beat by Toomey. \n \n \n\n What Steele (and Specter himself) said makes far more sense to me than what you claim Hatch said. \n\n \n This is due to your laziness in not investigating what Hatch said, if you doubt my \"claim\" of what he said. \n \n \n\n If it doesn&#8217;t to you then that&#8217;s your opinion, but you really shouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m making things up. You&#8217;re a new guy, and it&#8217;s very troll-like. 4forums has quite enough of those right now &#8211; we are accepting no new trolls at this time. :p\n \n\n \n Indeed, you speak from first hand experience on being troll-like. I don't think you're a troll though, just incredibly dense. You still fail to understand what I've said. \n \n \n\n Speculation about future political races involves speculation about events that haven&#8217;t happened yet. Any organization that speculates for a living has some interests that are distinctly different from those of the general public. \n If you&#8217;re sold on one source for your political information and believe it can do no wrong, that&#8217;s your choice. I get mine from several, balance them with each other, and sometimes alter my opinions of each accordingly. Not all of mine are paid to give their opinions. No one person or group is perfect, and I suspect CQ Politics isn&#8217;t changing that fact. I don&#8217;t claim my opinions are perfect. \n\n \n Nice speech, but still irrelevant. CQ Politics has more credibility than you do. I'll take their findings over your gut instinct.\n \n \n\n I never said nor postulated that. There is a difference between being bought, vs. dancing to the tune of the political party that you work for. \n \n\n \n How is predicting that someone in your party, who is loyal to your party, is going to lose an election an example of \"dancing to the tune of the political party that you work for\"? That makes no sense. \n \n \n\n How about if someone named John McCain is;\n \n Loyal to the GOP\n Ranked highly in the GOP\n Holds the job as GOP presidential nominee\n On November 3rd, is shouting from the rooftops that he is going to be the next president of the U.S., did you believe him? There are similiarites in the displayed hope of presidential candidates a day before the election as there are in partisan vice-chairmen of political committees. \n \n\n \n Of course not. It's in John McCain's interest to say he'll win, just as it in Hatch's interest to say that Toomey will win. The fact that he does not lie on Toomey's behalf shows how badly Toomey's chances are. \n \n \n\n What you said was very simple &#8211; that you believe Specter would have won the 2010 primary, and general election as a Republican. I&#8217;m saying I didn&#8217;t think that, and that was the reason he switched. So you have to believe that he had some other reason for leaving the Republican party, other than winning that election. And yet you refuse to explain it. This violates rule number 5a of the forum rules, and makes me smell dishonesty. \n\n \n No, you're illiteracy and overall slowness in understanding is what's causing the problem with what you're smelling. I said that I believe Toomey would have beat Spector in the primary, and that your saying Spector would lose to Toomey in the general election is \"made up.\" The Congressional Quarterly website predicts Spector as the favorite, as does Orrin Hatch, Vice Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Election Committee. Again, if you could read what I said, it would help, and if anyone's dishonest, it's you.\n \n \n\n Let me make this very legitimate question as clear as I can; Specter switched parties, and he had a reason for doing so. Hopefully we can agree on that. I believe (as does most everyone it seems) that he did it because he believed he would lose the Pennsylvania primary as a Republican. You&#8217;ve said you don&#8217;t believe that, so you have to think that he had another reason for switching. What do you think his reason was? \n emoticon_confused\n\n \n Actually I stated the opposite, and your poor illiteracy has not enabled you to see that. I quote myself:\n \n \"Specter would have lost the primary election\". \n \n See if you can read and understand this.",

You are saying voting is evidence of desire while I am claiming voting a certain way is a strategy to more power. I believe that 3 republicans voted with the democrats because 1) it wouldn't hurt them 2) it was needed to pass the bill which the republicans wanted to happen.

You imply that voting is not sincere, and that voting against something is actually being for it. That shows the insanity of your thought process, but just to make this fun, how about you provide some proof for your theory? \n \n \n\n I'd go into it further but clearly this is over your head.\n\n \n Oh yes, your Ron Paul conspiracy theories are far too deep for me to comprehend. ;)",
