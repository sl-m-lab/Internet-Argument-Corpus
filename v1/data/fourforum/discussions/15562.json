   "Firearms are strictly controlled in Norway, and yet the Norway killer was able to create horrific devastation. \n \n England.   Gunman Derrick Bird killed at least 12 people in a shooting spree in Cumbria and injured another 25 before taking his own life.  \n Armed with two weapons - a .22 rifle and a shotgun \n \n No semi autos, no pumps, no handguns allowed. Period. Strict cradle to grave registration, and locked up guns. Everything that the gun banners say we need in order to stop all of this. And we still have this happen. \n \n Just today, I was reading an article from Australia. \n \n   ACT black market fed by theft of legal guns \n The theft of legal guns is feeding Canberra's black market for firearms as authorities struggle to comprehend the scope of the illegal weapons trade in the territory. \n \n ACT Policing has told The Canberra Times that a black market for guns exists in Canberra, but says its size is unknown.\n \n Estimates put the number of illegal guns in Australia at between 400,000 and 700,000, compared to 2,675,785 licensed firearms.\n \n Experts believe most black market guns have been stolen, either through targeted or opportunistic attacks.\n \n Last week, a collection of 16 rifles was stolen from a locked shipping container in the rear yard of a Fyshwick business. The weapons were all licensed and complied with the ACT's firearm storage laws.  Police say their dollar value is in the tens of thousands.\n\n Population of Australia in 2009 is 21,874,900. My, that is a lot of crime guns available to any criminal who wants them.\n \n Enough gun control to make the American gun controllers totally lose it. So where is the panacea that the gun controllers promise would happen if we Just gave in to their demands?",

   "Cherry picking....[\n \n \n A fact is \"cherry picking\" ? LOL\n \n \nIf it's so easy for criminals to obtain guns in Australia then why are lot less criminals in Australia getting and using guns in crimes?\n\n \n Your crime rate in all catagories have and continue to rise. Obviously criminals don't need them to continue to commit crimes although the theft of guns has risen dramatically so look for it :)\n \n OTOH, guns protect citizens from crime. Probably possible that the crooks are afraid they will still get their selves SHOT. Being Australia, chances are the honest man will be prosecuted and the criminal set free. At least that is how it has always worked there and in England.\n \n How about them riots and burning and looting in London now over a police shooting a subject? Sounds about like the L.A. riots and the armed Koreans came out fine; will the Brits?",

   "Cherry picking.... \n \n \n If it's so easy for criminals to obtain guns in Australia then why are lot less criminals in Australia getting and using guns in crimes?\n\n Well, you heard it from the mouth of the Police Commissioner. \n \n But lets look at their latest figures.\n Graph from the Australian FBI. ==< http://www.aic.gov.au/en/publications/current%20series/facts/1-20/2010/~/media/publications/facts/2010/figure003.png \n \n  Homicide remained low and is 1.3 per 100,000 population, and a violent crime rate climbed to 800 per 100,000.  . \n \n Graph taken from this page.   Recorded crime \n \n For comparison. Murder in the U.S. has always been high, but it was almost in half since our   high in 1991. of 9.4 and violent came rate of 729.6. \n \n In 2009 our murder rate was 5 per 100,000 and our violent crime rate was 429.4.  \n \n And the good news continues.   January to December 2010 Percent Change for Consecutive Years \n 2010/2009 Violent crime = -5.5 and murder rate = -4.4 \n \n So that is what, about 2.something more murders per 100.000 than Australia? 3? We are working on it, but also our violent crime rate is almost half of Australia&#8217;s.\n \n But the point is, why do they have any of this in the first place? Are you contending that if we enact such draconian gun control as they have, that we will STILL have an illegal gun problem, a high crime rate problem, and a Mass Murder problem? \n \n If that is the case, then what is the point? Why not let people protect themselves?",
