Kerry complained when the ad came out against him and demanded that everyone denounce it. But when MoveOn.org comes out with one, he doesn't. Since when did being in Vietnam make one more or less qualified? That's what you seem to imply by saying \"a certain someone else\". The Bush administration is not affiliated with this ad. So stop trying to say they are doing this to distract from their record, because they are not affiliated with this ad!! Why wouldn't you point out Kerry lack of attendance at the Intelligence meetings for a year after 9/11? It just shows the public that Kerry thought the nation's security wasn't that important. How is that not fair game for an ad?",
