   "I'm not sure this is the right forum for this or not; there doesn't seem to be an 'ethics' forum from what I can find. This isn't a mathematical issue, but it does pertain to science, or at least scientists.\n \n I was reading an article today on some scientists that have genetically modified a human embryo (or at least that's what the article title indicated). Of course, it generated some controversy over the question of ethics.\n \n Frankly, I think there's a perception out there that many scientists (particularly in the area of genetics) are just sort of 'free-wheeling' and trying to push the envelope with little regard for ethical implications. But unless most scientists just don't care about ethics, I find that somewhat hard to believe. I think most people have SOME sense of ethics they would go by. And yet, I never see anything put out there for the public to be assured that scientists are going by some code of ethics. In other words, the abuses make the news; the cases (if there are any) of scientists stating their ethics doesn't make the news. But scientists could combat this perception by simply being more forthright about their ethics and how they arrive at them. I'd like to hear from some of the scientists on these forums on the issue of what they do to arrive at whether or not something is ethical or not. Is there a general set of guidelines that some or most scientific organizations promote on this? Or is there no sense of that in the scientific community at all, and the ethics of any given task depends on nothing more than whether or not a given scientist wants to do it? Obviously we assume that the law puts limits on scientists, but ethics and law are not necessarily the same thing.\n \n Just to be clear, I'm not asking for views on whether a given scientific task is ethical or not. I'm asking if there are standards adopted by scientists in a general sense to determine whether or not something is ethical or not, and if so, what are those standards? And it may be that, if there are, they may be a discipline-by-discipline basis. For instance, do most scientists, on their way to an advanced degree, take at least SOME course on scientific ethics? Are there 'ethnicity' tests for a given task before doing it?\n \n I'm asking because, as a non-scientist, I honestly don't know.",

   "jyoshu,\n \n Think that last bit should have been 'ethicality' tests, not 'ethnicity' tests (unless you were purposefully bringing race into the equation).\n \n As for the rest of the question.\n \n I think scientists use the same set of ethical values that any other individual has (ie their own). The only difference between the unethical non-scientist and the unethical scientist is that the scientist has a greater range on non-ethical things to choose from.\n \n I have a degree in mechanical engineering (doesn't give me much scope in the dabbling with DNA stuff, in fact not much additional scope anywhere really). But then, I am a paragon of perfect ethics anyway. emoticon_xclown \n \n Scientists have no special ethics. It is possible that they get to think about it a little more when faced with dodgy decisions. It may even be true that some push the boundaries a little when temptation is before them. Scientists are just people too.\n \n Hope that made sense.\n \n Smiley",

   "Good question.\n \n First, let's clear up the terminology a bit. The general code that people try to live by is called \"morals\". \"Ethics\" are a specific set of rules meant to govern the behavior of a specific group, generally a profession. Thus, medical ethics, legal ethics, and scientific ethics.\n \n So where do scientific ethics come from? Research institutions have commitees that set the rules, and review cases. And in addition the various groups that give out grants might also have ethical standards that they expect recipients to meet. Each institution sets its own standards, but they all know what each other is doing, so a sort of general concensus is reached. No one wants to be thought of as too lax, after all. \n \n So, short answer, if a scientist wants to know if something is ethical they go to their ethics commitee and ask.",

   "I think that the general code of ethics is 'the greater good'. Thus, an activity which can be seen by some to be amoral (for example, stem cell research) can still be justifiable if it might result in widespread benefits (for stem cells, this would be the eventual goal of eliminating diseases such as Parkinsons or Altzheimers). Each individual scientist, of course, is going to have his/her own personal moral beliefs that may overrule the ethics of a situation in their own eyes, but 'only when the ends justify the means' is a good guideline by which to base your morals (whether you are a scientist or not, IMO).\n \n A good example of this would be very early scintists such as Da Vinci, who had to resort to the practice of grave-robbing in order that they might better understand basic human anatomy. Without such illegal and (arguably) amoral work, the entire field of medicine would not have progressed.",

   "All institutions that conduct research that involves humans (in any way), human tissue, information about humans or work with laboratory animals must have their research design approved by an Institutional Review Board before they can start collecting data. There are periodic reviews throughout the process and a closing review. This is federal law in the US (dating from the 70s), and I am sure other nations have similar safeguards. There are general standards, but the IRB's are always local and include a wide range of disciplines: scientists from various fields, lawyers, ethicists, interested community members, etc.\n \n IRB's are extremely strict. There are many hoops to jump through. Just conducting survey (to humans, not lab animals) can be an ordeal. \n \n In addition, every scientist I have know understands and respects the ethical implications of his or her work. It's part of the education.",
