   "Do you ever think about God? Do you ever REALLY and TRULY think about God? What do you think he does all day up there in heaven; people worshipping Him, cherubs playing harps and that kind of stuff, but what does He do? He has to do something to just pass the time. Just what is He responsible for? He can't be responsible for everything. \n \n You know he would never let a war break out where millions of His creations would suffer if He had anything to do with stopping it, don't you? You know that. Just what in the world does He control and what doesn't He control? If He doesn't control people being killed in useless wars by XXXXXX and XXXXXX, taking millions of lives, affecting millions more people; if he doesn't have control over that, if he doesn't exercise responsibility over things like that, then what does he have control over? Maybe it's designing snow flakes like my mother told me? \n \n Now, why would you offer up prayers for something like that? Why would you offer up prayers for the dead? If everything I've been told is true, if everything you tell me you believe, when you're dead, you're dead! If you were a good person you would be up there in heaven with God. If you were a bad person you would be down there in the lake of fire. You know all the prayers in the world wouldn't help after that. Prayers wouldn't change anything would they? Or, do you think the person would get a better seat in heaven? So it's kind of stupid doing that kind of stuff isn't it; incredibly stupid? \n \n I don't pray a whole lot. You know why? Do you think it's because I don't believe in God, because I'm an atheist? You'd be wrong. I wouldn't want to put God in a bad spot. It's painfully obviously there are things He has no control over and things he can't do anything about because I know if he could he would. Things like curing cancer, ending war, eliminating poverty and disease; I know he would if he could. If I was going to take my time and pray and petition God for a change, then I would petition God for something that mattered. Nothing like \"Oh God let me score a touchdown in the ball game; Oh God please let me have a better car\", I wouldn't bother God with that kind of stuff. I would speak to God about serious things; things that mattered, things that would make it a better world to live in and consequently make my life better as a result. My life would be better if cancer went away and poverty was eliminated, disease went away and wars ended. If I prayed for those kinds of things, knowing full well that there wasn't anything God was going to do about them, I think he'd probably feel bad, not being able to answer them. Sitting up there on the throne, cherubs playing the harps; me down here thinking he's all mighty and all powerful asking him to intervene to stop a war or make people better. Maybe he is answering, \"there's nothing I'm going to do about it, nothing I can do about it\". Here, let me help you find that plane wrecking instead, after the fact. Yea, I think he'd feel really bad about that. So I never put him in that position. \n \n I would never ask him to let me score a touchdown. I'd never ask him for stupid things like that; I'd never ask him for a raise, better grades or whatever. Many people do all the time, right? And you know what? You would never ask him for the important things either. And do you know why? For the very same reason I don't. Because you know there is nothing he can do about it. That's why. That's why no one asks for the important things. That's why you pray for good grades, a new car, a new house or that miserable boss with be transferred out of your office. That's the kind of stuff you end up praying for. Or, you end up praying for things you know you'll never know the answer to like praying for the dead. Doesn't that bother you? It should. \n \n We all need to come back to that phrase about where we are, about how we think and behave. . . . .Intellectual honesty; one of the toughest things to master in life, intellectual honesty. Intellectual honesty has nothing to do with me being honest with you; it has to do with me being honest with myself. It's relatively easy to lie to others and it's relatively easy to be honest with others. The consequences aren't really any more silly. I don't have to ever see you again; I don't ever have to talk to you again. Hey, if you can't handle the truth then too bad. But when I'm dealing with myself, intellectual honesty is something I have to live with for ever and ever. And I have to live with intellectual dishonesty for ever as well. It torments me if I am not honest with myself. Doesn't it torment you? If you're not honest with yourself, what do you do it for? What in the hell do you do it for? That's why I don't pray. What's your excuse?",

This simple question has dogged evolutionists for centuries. Try as they might, they never have been able to establish a firm foundation for how living things first appeared-a foundation on which they then could build an evolutionary tree of life.\n \n In the past, the modus operandi was to teach the long-ago-disproved concept of spontaneous generation, hope that no one noticed the question of the actual origin of life had never been answered, and then teach the theory of evolution as if \"somehow\" the origin of life had been established as a fact. As a result, almost every science textbook printed within the last fifty years contains the now-famous Miller-Urey experiment of 1953. In this experiment, Harold Urey and his graduate student, Stanley Miller, tried to simulate what they thought represented the Earth's early atmospheric conditions, in order to determine what products they could generate by adding an electrical spark (i.e. simulating lightening). These same textbooks never fail to mention that Miller and Urey were successful at producing a few simple amino acids-\"the basic building blocks of life.\" From there, the textbooks lead into a new chapter on evolution and the origin of life-allowing the student to draw the conclusion that scientists have thus proven that life can be generated from just a few nonliving chemicals.\n \n It is a logical progression, and one that, admittedly, works well in the classroom. The only problem is that this notion is totally false. Not once have scientists succeeded in producing living material from nonliving material. And yet, year after year the public is led into believing that the very foundation upon which evolution stands has been resolved. Nobel laureate George Wald of Harvard admitted:\n \n We tell this story to beginning students of biology as though it represents a triumph of reason over mysticism. In fact it is very nearly the opposite. The reasonable view was to believe in spontaneous generation; the only alternative, to believe in a single, primary act of supernatural creation. There is no third position. For this reason many scientists a century ago chose to regard the belief in spontaneous generation as a 'philosophical necessity.' It is a symptom of the philosophical poverty of our time that this necessity is no longer appreciated. Most modern biologists, having reviewed with satisfaction the downfall of the spontaneous generation hypothesis, yet unwilling to accept the alternative belief in special creation, are left with nothing. I think a scientist has no choice but to approach the origin of life through a hypothesis of spontaneous generation (1954, 191:46).\n \n So let us consider this problem. Now, there can be no natural selection or mutation involved in the development of the first self-replicating organism, because it is the first! Therefore, it must arise from chance. While scientists have tried in vain to carefully produce any set of circumstances possible in order to produce life, if the first life came about by chance it had no help but formed randomly.\n \n Raw Facts\n \n Scientists who believe in a long age for the Universe tend to believe the Universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old. That computes to about 10^18 seconds.\n \n It is believed that there are about 10^78 electrons in the entire Universe.\n \n If every electron had made one effort to form the first life each second of the supposed span of time of the Universe, that would be 10^96 trials.

   "[snip]\n \n So if, out of the hundreds of millions of Solar Systems within the tens of millions of Galaxies, within the millions of Universes that hold the billions of Planets that most assuredly exist within them, if life truly occurred on Earth randomly through mutations spontaneously from non life, then surely with out technology and active searching for this long with high powered space based telescopes, radio telescopes and space probes that have left our solar system yet still send back observations, it seems we should have easily found evidence of some other life by now.\n\n \n Well those two weren't really connected. The first one appears to be arguing that life is improbable, which is nothing new, though it takes no account of catalysts or the different environmental conditions 4.2 billion years ago. However, if the universe is infinite, then the probability of other life is almost 1, as it's the odds against it v. an almost infinite number of places for it to occur.\n \n \n The second one appears to be having a go at things like SETI. We've been broadcasting signals since 1936 (the German Olympics, I think), yet our signals haven't made it that far even on a Galactic scale. In terms of probes, only Voyager has made it out of our solar system, and that's currently travelling across interstellar space. I have no idea when it'll reach another star. We're only just on the threshold of detecting where there are other planets in orbit of distant stars. You don't seem to appreciate how far the distances are. If we had technologically advanced life within 15 lightyears, maybe it'd be reasonable to assume they could have heard us and responded. What if that life is 200 lightyears away? We might be able to see thier star, but we'd have no idea they were there. As far as the scanning goes, the amount of money spent on SETI has been cut drastically, though you can download a program and use your spare processor power to help!",

So that's most of the universe right off the bat that could have life we don't know about. As for this galaxy, it's still a really huge place. While we do have probes that have left our solar system, they haven't come even vaugely close to reaching another system, so of course they will have told us nothing. And we've only been searching for life with telescopes for a few decades, there are around 300 billion stars in our galaxy. If you could check one a second it would still take 9500 years. And, most importantly, we don't know exactly what to look for. Telescopes are set to \"see\" specific frequecies or ranges of frequencies. We may have pointed a telescope right at a system that was broadcasting at full volume, but if the telescope wasn't reading the right frequency then we wouldn't have a clue. No, we're far, far, too early in the search to be able to assume it should have payed off already.",

We simply don't know the probability of life occurring, nor even whether it is random chance that it occurs.\n\n There's actually no biblical reason to assume that our earth is the only planet with life on it. God could have set up any number of created worlds with adam and eve scenarios and surveyed how many of them he had to curse and how many of them passed the temptation test, if any. Maybe ours is just one of a series of rejected humanity experiments. Its not a large stretch to think that after adam's fall God went back to the drawing board and set up another creation a few hundred light years away. Who knows, maybe the planets that passed will be part of the interplanetary mega-paradise known as heaven. How many creations could God have established if it only takes a week to build one? Even jesus coming to earth for 33 years, he could have well been doing an intergalactic tour of failed sinful creations and earth was just one of the stops along the way. How many salvation ministries could jesus accomplish if it only took him 33 years to do it (unless God is making worlds faster than jesus can save them, then he'll never catch up, which sucks for those planets). \n \n From a scientific perspective, of course its very likely that there is life on planets with similar conditions (or even less harsh) to ours. And like its been pointed out, even if we've contacted a planet that has life with our electromagnetic signals, they'd have to be at least as technologically advanced as we were 50 years ago to receive it. And they'd have to send back electromagnetic signals that would require those amount of years to get back. If the nearest life-inhabiting planet to us is just now going through its \"dark ages\" then it wouldn't matter if our signal reached them already.",

If the OP is influenced by the Christian Bible then I think it would be far more productive to point out that influence and discount it, rather than take it as a given for this discussion.

   "DrD, a few things you said caught my eye in particular. You assume that God ought to stop wars, that he should be responsible for them in some manner. I simply don't see it that way. If our existence is to have any meaning, then we must have free will. We have to be able to make our own decisions and act in whatever way we see fit. The fact that God doesn't step in and stop people from doing things doesn't mean that he can't, or that he approves. It could simply mean that he's granted people free will. It's up to us to figure out right from wrong, without a stern father figure stepping in and scolding us when we get it wrong.\n \n As for things like cancer, you've got me there. I can't explain why a benevolent God would have something like that, or any of the other things that get called \"acts of God\". I've heard the arguments about \"the big picture\", and they have some validity, but of course there's no way we can know for sure.\n \n Prayer? I'm not going to make the claims you did about what God can or can't do, but I will comment on what he does or doesn't do. And all evidence says that God doesn't answer prayers. For whatever reason it seems that we have to get through this life with the materials at hand.\n\n So if God isn't averting natural disasters, curing terminal diseases, controlling actions and consequences, or answering the prayers of his believers, then what exactly is he doing?\n \n There's nothing to suggest that God isn't really isn't just sitting there watching the drama unfold and \"allowing\" everything to happen. I mean, just keeping up with everything that's going on would be a full time job. I could see God in an ergonomically comfortable armchair with various massage settings watching us on massive plasma tvs, eating from a golden bowl of popcorn that never runs dry. Rather than have his angels stand around singing praises to him, he could have them in stategic locations and invisibly follow around key people with their hi-end ethereal video cameras, feeding to billions of hi-def channels that God could select to browse through, or record for later viewing. \n \n On a serious note, one of the problems I have with God is the idea that he requires praise. The bible tells us that he dwells contented amidst the mindless tireless robotic chantings of praises from his cherubims. Really?",

I think of that as the \"God the clock maker\" model. He made the clock, wound it up, and is watching it run. I guess your more high tech point of view would have God playing \"Sim Universe\", but it amounts to the same thing.\n \n It could be that God has a bunch of \"stuff\", let's call it souls, and he needed to sort the good from the bad. So he whipped up a universe to sift the good from the bad, stuck some soul stuff in people to see how well it works, and now he's just letting the universe grind through it's paces while the good souls and the bad souls get sorted out.

   "Have Scientists Created Life?: Examining the Miller-Urey Experiment\n \n How did living cells emerge from nonliving chemicals? This simple question has dogged evolutionists for centuries. Try as they might, they never have been able to establish a firm foundation for how living things first appeared-a foundation on which they then could build an evolutionary tree of life.\nBut at least scientists haven't proposed magic as the answer. While we may not be able to specify the exact steps of the process, some progress has been made in understanding how it may have happened. \"A magical being did it,\" isn't an explanation.\n \nIn the past, the modus operandi was to teach the long-ago-disproved concept of spontaneous generation,\nExcept that spontaneous generation was the explanation offered long before there was a theory of evolution. Of course, spontaneous generation was both believed subsequently disproved by men who accepted creation by a magical being.\n \nhope that no one noticed the question of the actual origin of life had never been answered,\nDo you mean that the religious men who first proposed spontaneous generation for an (incorrectly) observed phenomena were wrong? Imagine that!\n \nand then teach the theory of evolution as if \"somehow\" the origin of life had been established as a fact.\nBut evolutionary theory never did propose that the origin of life was spontaneous generation. The author of the article didn't even bother to learn what he was talking about. The stupidity of such claims is even more apparent since the author doesn't seem to understand that evolutionary theory addresses how life changes, not how it originated.\n \nAs a result, almost every science textbook printed within the last fifty years contains the now-famous Miller-Urey experiment of 1953. In this experiment, Harold Urey and his graduate student, Stanley Miller, tried to simulate what they thought represented the Earth's early atmospheric conditions, in order to determine what products they could generate by adding an electrical spark (i.e. simulating lightening). These same textbooks never fail to mention that Miller and Urey were successful at producing a few simple amino acids-\"the basic building blocks of life.\"\nBut, of course, there was never any claim that this was the source of life. Only that organic compounds necessary for life could arise by natural means.\n \nFrom there, the textbooks lead into a new chapter on evolution and the origin of life-allowing the student to draw the conclusion that scientists have thus proven that life can be generated from just a few nonliving chemicals.\nWow! Creationists infer a lot that wasn't implied. The origin of life is not evolution. At least the scientists have shown that organic molecules do not require magic. In fact, other experiments have shown that many organic molecules necessary for life do arise naturally. Magic isn't required. But that isn't evolution.\n \nIt is a logical progression, and one that, admittedly, works well in the classroom.\nDo you mean that it shows that magic isn't required?\n \nThe only problem is that this notion is totally false.\nWhat evidence makes you think so?\n \nNot once have scientists succeeded in producing living material from nonliving material.\nAbsolutely false. Completely artificial viruses have been assembled from organic chemicals, as have artificial bacteria. Given the proper media, these artificial entities reproduce and are indistinguishable from natural entities.\n \nAnd yet, year after year the public is led into believing that the very foundation upon which evolution stands has been resolved.\nWhat is that \"very foundation\" of evolution. That life exists and that it changes through time?\n \nNobel laureate George Wald of Harvard admitted:\n \n [snip]of a 54 year old incorrect and out of context opinion from an unspecified source.[/snip]\n \n So let us consider this problem. Now, there can be no natural selection or mutation involved in the development of the first self-replicating organism, because it is the first!\nThat's a simpleton's view. Several self-replicating molecules that are not living have been produced in the lab. In their reproduction, they are imperfect. These self replicating molecules follow evolutionary principles, in that, those that are able to more efficiently reproduce in the provided medium become more numerous. While this is not evolution, since there is no life, the principles of mutation and natural selection are applicable.\n \nTherefore, it must arise from chance.\nDo you mean it must arise from errors in reproduction that offer a reproductive advantage? I guess so.\n \nWhile scientists have tried in vain to carefully produce any set of circumstances possible in order to produce life, if the first life came about by chance it had no help but formed randomly.\nExcept that the more successful reproducers were favored. And, of course, evolution is about how life changes, not about how it arose. That is a different field called abiogenesis. Of course, creationists dwell on \"spontaneous generation,\" a belief of creationists that was discredited by creationists.\n \nRaw Facts\nWhich are, of course, worthless in and of themselves. They must be interpreted in a larger context to have any meaning.\n \nScientists who believe in a long age for the Universe tend to believe the Universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old. That computes to about 10^18 seconds.\n \n It is believed that there are about 10^78 electrons in the entire Universe.\n \n If every electron had made one effort to form the first life each second of the supposed span of time of the Universe, that would be 10^96 trials. But electrons are quick moving little things, aren't they? Let us give them 10^3 trials per second. Now we are up to 10^99 trials to form life on Earth if every electron in all of space and all of time tries 1,000 times per second to form simple life.\n \n 10^99 trials to become life. That is a nice, big number!\n.[/quote]How utterly stupid. Electrons don't form life. Thus, the nice, big number is meaningless. I take it that since you are alive (I presume), you believe that you are made up of nothing more than electrons.\n \nSo if, out of the hundreds of millions of Solar Systems within the tens of millions of Galaxies, within the millions of Universes that hold the billions of Planets that most assuredly exist within them, if life truly occurred on Earth randomly through mutations spontaneously from non life, then surely with out technology and active searching for this long with high powered space based telescopes, radio telescopes and space probes that have left our solar system yet still send back observations, it seems we should have easily found evidence of some other life by now.\nTwo words - liquid water. Not vapor and not ice. Given the (geologically) short time from the formation of the earth to the first signs of life, it seems to be a highly probable event. Of course, we have only a single example, but that example happened so quickly under apparently extreme conditions that it seems likely that, out of the probable billions of planets with liquid water in the universe, that there is other life out there.\n \n It is certainly more rational to assume that life is natural rather than a magical effect by an imperfect, vindictive, and invisible being.",

That some people, with average backgrounds, achieve great moral heights? Wisdom garnered from past lives could explain that.\n \n So why not have the memories too? *shrug* To toss out some random guesses: if you knew that this wasn't your only life you might not strive as hard, a clean slate lets you learn new lessons better, if you remembered everything the weight of the ages might stifle your actions in the here and now.

   "Archangel, read this. It may be even interesting. (or at least be kind enough to read the summary at the end, in the quote window. I made an effort to make it interesting to read).\n \n The universe is enormous. Now, the fastest thing in the universe is light. 300000km/second. This is very very fat - in normal life, the delays are not perceptible. However, the second you set out into the universe, this great speed becomes a snail pace.\n \n Within the solar system, it takes 8.3 minutes for light from the Sun to reach the Earth. That's right - you never see the sun where it is, you see it where it was 8 minutes ago. This distance from the Sun to the Earth is called \"astronomical unit\". We'll use it for a bit now.\n \n How big is the solar system anyway? Well, there are many things you could measure from and to, but let's take Puto, the most distant planet (ok, of tradition, anyway). Pluto is about 40 AU form the earth. This means that light itself takes about 5 hours for light itself to get to pluto. Now, there are various debris, gas clous and similar that belong to the Sun further out so this is not even close to the real size of the Solar system. But it's a nice guideline for the solid bits.\n \n So what's a real interstellar distance? The nearest star? That's proxima Centauri, and in AU's, that's 268 000 AU. at this scale, the light year becomes a more useful measure, so that's 4 light years. So that's how far it would be to the equivalent of the next door neighbour.\n \n So what about the galaxy? Give or take, 100.000 light years across and 1000 light years thick. The sun is about 26,000 light years from the center. And that's only the equivalent of the local town.\n \n So, let's turn this around. If there were someone out there, who could see us? And here we notice that almost noone. Almost noone. To anyone more than 10000 light years around, there are no cities on Earth. To anyone more than 200 light years away, there are no industrialized areas. And the nearest neighbour hasn't even heard that Bush got reelected.\n \n The same applies to the rest of the galaxy. Oh, and let's not forget that seeing things from that far away is HARD.\n \n \n \nSummed up: between the stars, the standard unit of distance is a light year - the distance light travels in a year. In this unit, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 0.000016 light years. Ie. the Solar system is tiny. Earth itself even tinier. The whole galaxy (and there's lots of them in the universe) is about 100.000 light years from one end to the other and is about 1000 light years thick.\n \n The nearest star to the Sun is 4 light years away. Since they are 4 years back, they don't know Bush got reelected and think the Geforce 6800 is the best graphics card available.\n \n Everyone else is even further out, and consequently even more behind the times. On Sirius, they still wonder if the Y2K bug will really wipe us out and are about to be disappointed.\n \n On the closest star of the Big dipper (that's what you call the Ursa major, right?), they don't know I was born yet.\n \n And these are the next door neighbours. To most of the galaxy, Human civilization does not exist yet. And to us, any civilizations they might have don't exist yet, either. And evne if they were there already - they're really really hard to see as they are really really tiny viewed from over here.\n \n",

I think that's what you meant.\n \n If Archie believes that there are countless universes, then:\n a. where is his evidence?\n b. if no evidence, is it blind faith, and why?\n \n The problem with the concept of a multiverse - or parallel universes - is that there is a frightening amount of mothers-in-law out there... emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n I never said anything about parallel universes if you mean universes with identical but opposite versions of ourselves and our reality. That is fiction. I'm referring to neighboring but distinct universes with their own physics and chemical structures.\n \n The only reason the concept of the big bang was ever dreamed up originally was because the question arose regarding how the universe came into being. So Man, some say George Gamow came up with the theory in 1948 with his science team. All before the advent of the computer, much less the super computer. Here's an explanation of the big bang, look at the numerical conclusions they came up with to just determine the density and the size of it. Take away the super computer and they would still be doing the math today to come to those conclusions.\n George Gamow can be called the originator of the Big Bang. This is because in 1948, he and his team of scientists thought up the idea of the Universe starting from a small object and then suddenly becoming what it is today. George Gamow thought that the Big Bang created all of the matter in the Universe today, but we now know that only hydrogen, helium, and lithium were created in the Big Bang. All of the other kinds of matter were created in nuclear fusion from stars. This theory is what provides the basis of what we understand about the beginning of the Universe.\n \n The Universe started expanding as soon as it was born in the Big Bang. In just he first trillion-trillion-trillionth of a second, the Universe expanded a hundred million times larger than its original size. As the Universe is expanding, it starts to lose density. At first the density of the Universe is a huge 10 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion grams per cubic inch, but it rapidly starts to fall. As the density falls, the temperature does too. The temperature of the Universe dropped to 10,000 trillion degrees from a temperature that was near infinity.\n \n Throughout the Big Bang, the Universe created antimatter and matter. Whenever the antimatter hit matter, they would both annihilate each other. It took energy to create both the matter and the antimatter, so after annihilating each other, they would \"return\" the energy that they used to create themselves. Why are we made of matter then if the antimatter/matter pairs kept on destroying each other?http://library.thinkquest.org/J0112540/universe/bigbang.html\n \n Garnow was only thinking about the creation of our universe so of course his theory only attempts to answer that question. So interestingly his big bang event only deals with the creation of our single universe. that is why some might reject the concept of multiple universes, because they can't imagine multiple big bang events or that one big bang event led to the creation of multiple universes. To me, all of this just clarifies how little we know for certain, and how much science relies on unknowable answers for questions they don't even know to ask. \n \n But since my God speaks of eternity as a never ending distance. Then that tells me that time and space will never end, ever. That means that if we use universes to define a specific length of distance in space, even if we can't imagine the precise length that it is, then why stop at one universe? I have no reason to believe that universes aren't strung together for as long as the imagination will allow.",

   "But don't you marvel at the fact that these conclusions were arrived at before the ability to compute such massive numbers or the mathematical equations needed to confirm that such theories were in any way possible?\n\n Why is this a problem? Hypotheses were made based on observations. This is how the scientific method works.\n \n \nCan you deny that the big bang is no more a proven reality than my belief that as many universes exist as do galaxies and solar systems?\n\n Well, I deny that the big bang is \"no more\" supported than multiverse theory.\n \n \n... the reason I don't respect the 40 years of experimental research that has taken place Jo, is because it hasn't asked even 1% of the relevant questions that need to be considered in order to get to the actual truth of the matter. In fact, It is totally reasonable to say that our finest minds don't even know the right questions to ask in order to get to the truth regarding the origins of time and space.\n\n But you know which questions are right and which are not? Do you even understand the irony of this statement?\n \n \nWhat if I'm right that our universe in just one of millions of universes. Doesn't that change the whole equation upon which this science is based?\n\n No. Our scientific knowledge is based on the observations we make about our own universe. Why would our universe change just because we realize there are multiverses?\n \n \nNo longer are we the center of time and space as the only universe, but we are one tiny universe in a vast unending cosmos. Now try to imagine the theoretical big bang that formed that body!\n\n Sounds to me like you don't grasp the idea of multiverses very well.\n \n \nYou just assume it because the extremely limited evidence that is visible to us seems to imply that possible outcome. Even what we think we know isn't stated as a fact at any time.\n\n Guh. Where do I start?\n Evidence isn't extremely limited. We have plenty. We use that evidence to formulate conclusions. This is standard operating procedure not just for science but for everyday actions. (In this case, the theory produced specific predictions that are accurate, which is damn compelling.) We've already had the discussion that you don't know \"for a fact\" that the sun will rise tomorrow.\n \n \nBased on what an ant can see of his world, do you think he can comprehend the size of the Earth as it revolves around our Sun, and it's place in our solar system as it fits into our galaxy which then fits into our universe? Of course he can't.\n\n How much of this has to do with body size versus cognitive ability and use of telescopes?\n \n \nWell, when it comes to events that happened an alleged/estimated 14-20 billion years ago, how presumptuous are we as human beings to think that we are asking the right questions that will lead to the right research that will lead to the correct conclusions?\n\n If we're so \"presumptuous\" to think that we're asking the right questions, what does that make you for \"knowing\" that we're not? You're taking hypocrisy to a whole new level.\n \n \nAsk yourself this Jo, if we don't know the state of the pre big bang cosmos, or singularity if you will,\n\n I love when people talk about things \"before\" time.",

   "You do need to ask an astrophysicist, Archie. Because only by intellectually grasping the size of the universe and the methods by which it can be studied will you understand why we have not yet found life out there. And only by intellectually understanding why scientists believe the big bang has happened can you understand why your counterarguments don't work.\n \n Serious people calculating things in equations that are quite beyond me have analyzed the data we have and not only believe the data indicates the big bang, but also indicate what the big bang looked like.\n \n Also, your multiple universe belief is not actually rational. Your belief is \"nothing says there can't be, so they might very well be\". That's not proper thinking. Some scientists have observes some strange phenomena and one possible explanation of them is that if there were in existence many parallel universes, their interaction could result in the observed results. That is rational. Not just \"it might be\".\n \n The problem is, Archie, that you don't understand how we find things out. We don't know everything. We can only observe a little. However, by piecing a little of this and a little of that, we get a bigger picture. It's rather like assembling a jigsaw puzzle without the reference picture. It's rather \"we have these many blue pieces and these many green pieces, and you know, if there's blue and green, maybe it's a landscape? (hypothesis) Let's see, if we put the blue ones together, if they are a sky, there could be clouds or horizons... and if the greens fit together, let's put them together and see if they add up into grass. And if they all do, you start thinking: ok, so if we have sky and grass, the sky is probably on top and grass on the bottom. And you work from there, and you could be right. And then, you find out that it's a picture of a lake, and the sky is actually reflected and the green is above and the blue below.\n \n The problem with you, Archie, is that you keep stepping up to the guy assembling the jigsaw and his friends watching him and you keep saying \"Nah, that's wrong, this piece doesn't fit with that one\" and \"You'll never figure out what is on a piece\" and you refuse to listen to the guy's friends who explain. The guy has long given up and just tries to ignore you while he gets on with his work. And the big problem is you keep grabbing at the assembled pieces to smash them to pieces.",

Suppose that we call our number of viable locations R, and the probability of life occuring at any one of those 1/T. Then the probability of life occurring at only one of these is (1/T)*(1-1/T)^(R-1), and the probability of none at all is (1-1/T)^R. Now if, for the sake of argument, we take T=2R, then as R increases, the probability of no life at all tends to 0.61. The interesting thing, in this particular example, is that the probability of life occurring once and only once is vanishingly small, but the probability of it occurring any other specified number of times is even smaller, by some considerable magnitude.

   "He said that he won't waste his time answering because it's not in our ability to comprehend.\n\n Both you and lyteboy proved that, by reverting to insults rather than being willing to delve into the questions we don't know to ask yet. I didn't say that to paulie. Some of the great minds in history agree with me. For example, Aristotle contemplated a universe without a starting point in time yet still found the necessity of a primary cause. electrolyte mocked me here, just yesterday for saying this same thing from my spiritual perspective. \nAccording to my understanding and world view, God has always existed, and just as eternity has no end, so does it have no beginning either. So time has always existed and has nothing at all to do with the creation of our individual universe. Thinking that is the result of your very limited human perspective that can't see past our own universal existence. But hey, I'm just an ignorant christian, while you have all of this deep scientific insight, huh? You keep teaching high school lyteboy, maybe you can convince kids of your shallow world view, but leave the adults alone until you gain some depth of perspective.\n \n Leibniz's repeated question: \"Why is there anything rather than nothing?\" is not answered by saying that it has always been there. Nor is it answered by saying that space-time has no edge as Carl Sagan suggested. The fact is that the finest minds in science can't even agree on what the right questions are to be asked, much less the answers to those questions. I said this above, to further insults in response to Ripskars question which is quoted below. . Tell me what is shallow or wrong with asking them? \nWhich proves what exactly Ripskar? How does one prove that, that immense energy and heat represents the event that we call the big bang? How do we know that prior to the formation of this universe, all that existed in time and space was immense plasma energy, which is very hot? And when you say \"the mathematical models which project the observed data,\" You actually mean the the theoretically perceived data that we assume is accurate based on how we interpret the available evidence that we think occurred 14-20 billion years ago. Because nothing you are talking about was actually OBSERVED IN REAL TIME, in any way, shape or form, was it. \n \n My whole point Ripskar is that what we assume happened is actually unprovable in reality. The bible say's this: [Hebrews 11:3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible. So not only was this universe created by the Lord, who is the word of God according to the bible, and who spoke everything into creation, but that which we see today was not made out of that which was visible. Does that mean invisible energy that science believes existed prior to the formation of the material universe? And can you say it wasn't? \n \n So isn't it all about interpretation Ripskar? Isn't how we extrapolate the available info everything in coming to the proper conclusions? And if we assume that the big bang really did actually happen, isn't the deeper question, what caused it to happen? Isn't the source of what caused such a huge instantaneous energy release where the true source or power is? These are reasons why the so called big bang event as defined by science, is no more than wishful thinking. Because based on what we can possibly observe, and then extrapolate from the universe we inhabit, we then must determine how to piece it all together in order to make a rational hypothesis that can explain the order by which it came about. And that info just isn't available.\n\n \n \nArchie, here are the questions science asks. Why is it that the universe is expanding? Why is it that light from stars billions of years old is just now reaching us? What happened before the expansion? What caused the universe to begin moving away in the first place? Was there a point when the entire universe was together in a single spot before it started to expand?\n \n What are the answers to these questions, archangel? And what are the questions that science isn't asking?\n\n \n Here is what Ripskar said in defense of science paulie, \n Through mathmatical models which project the observed data into the past to the Planck era at which point General Relativity breaks down.\n The predictions concurr with the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background indicating a time of immense energy and heat.\n It may sound deep and insightful on the surface, but in fact it is very shallow and assuming in its presumption that science knows either the proper equations to run, or the math required to come up with the right answers. \n \n And yet, it is not a trivial question to ask why the universe is amenable to mathematical mapping. Einstein found the question an \"eternal mystery&#8230; which we shall never understand\". If the big bang actually did happen according to unknowable causes, then math shouldn't even be able to calculate the results. \n \n Just last week, Professor Michael Heller, a Polish physicist and priest, an unusual combination. won the \u00a3820,000 Templeton prize, awarded annually for \"discovery in areas engaging life's biggest questions\". Heller suggests that the universe is so comprehensible not just because our minds are fitted to understanding things about it, but for a far larger reason. The comprehensibility reflects, he argues as a theologian, the Logos that has formed it. This Logos, the mind of God, is rational. Among us humans rationality is, Heller argues, a value. Our decision to pursue knowledge rationally, through science or philosophy, is a moral decision. The Logos is the Word that John uses in the sublime introduction to his Gospel: In the beginning was the Word.\n \n As a scientist and theologian, Michael Heller formulates his conclusion in these terms: \"That Christ is the Logos implies that God's immanence in the world is its rationality. In a statement prepared for the news conference, Heller described his position as follows:\n \n Various processes in the universe can be displayed as a succession of states in such a way that the preceding state is a cause of the succeeding one&#8230; (and) there is always a dynamical law prescribing how one state should generate another state. But dynamical laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations, and if we ask about the cause of the universe we should ask about a cause of mathematical laws. By doing so we are back in the Great Blueprint of God's thinking the universe, the question on ultimate causality&#8230;: \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" When asking this question, we are not asking about a cause like all other causes. We are asking about the root of all possible causes.\n \n It is my belief that the only rational singularity that ties all of reality together so that it not only makes sense to humanity, but is rational, conceivable and calculable is the very Logos, or initiator of it which science leaves completely out of the equation when attempting to understand or define it. That is why science will never comprehend the full extent of what we call time and space.\n \n http://www.scribd.com/doc/729/Has-Science-Really-Answered-All-the-Big-Questions\n \n Here are some questions discussed here, and the so called answers just raise more questions.Has the time dilation of distant source light curves predicted by the Big Bang been observed?\n \n This time dilation is a consequence of the standard interpretation of the redshift: a supernova that takes 20 days to decay will appear to take 40 days to decay when observed at redshift z=1. The time dilation has been observed, with 5 different published measurements of this effect in supernova light curves. These papers are:\n \n Leibundgut etal, 1996, ApJL, 466, L21-L24\n Goldhaber etal, in Thermonuclear Supernovae (NATO ASI), eds. R. Canal, P. Ruiz-LaPuente, and J. Isern.\n Riess etal, 1997, AJ, 114, 722.\n Perlmutter etal, 1998, Nature, 391, 51.\n Goldhaber etal, ApJ in press.\n These observations contradict tired light models of the redshift.\n \n \n Are galaxies really moving away from us or is space just expanding?\n \n This depends on how you measure things, or your choice of coordinates. In one view, the spatial positions of galaxies are changing, and this causes the redshift. In another view, the galaxies are at fixed coordinates, but the distance between fixed points increases with time, and this causes the redshift. General relativity explains how to transform from one view to the other, and the observable effects like the redshift are the same in both views. Part 3 of the tutorial shows space-time diagrams for the Universe drawn in both ways.\n \n In the absence of the cosmological constant, an object released at rest with respect to us does not then fly away from us to join the Hubble flow. Instead, it falls toward us, and then joins the Hubble flow on the other side of the sky, as discussed by Davis, Lineweaver & Webb (2003, AJP, 71, 358). In what are arguably the most reasonable coordinates, the cosmic time t and the distance D(t) measured entirely at the cosmic time t, the acceleration is given by g = -GM(r<D)/D2 where M(r<D) is the mass contained within radius D. This gives g = -(4*pi/3)*G*(rho(t)+3P(t)/c2)*D(t). The 3P/c2 term is a general relativistic correction to the otherwise Newtonian dynamics. Galaxies all move under the influence of this acceleration and their initial position and velocity. In other words, F = ma and gravity provides the force. Nothing extra or weird is needed.\n \n Why doesn't the Solar System expand if the whole Universe is expanding?\n \n This question is best answered in the coordinate system where the galaxies change their positions. In other words, no consistent answer applies to the whole uniform universe!The galaxies are receding from us because they started out receding from us, and the force of gravity just causes an acceleration that causes them to slow down, or speed up in the case of an accelerating expansion. Planets are going around the Sun in fixed size orbits because they are bound to the Sun. Everything is just moving under the influence of Newton's laws (with very slight modifications due to relativity). [Illustration] For the technically minded, Cooperstock et al. computes that the influence of the cosmological expansion on the Earth's orbit around the Sun amounts to a growth by only one part in a septillion over the age of the Solar System. This effect is caused by the cosmological background density within the Solar System going down as the Universe expands, which may or may not happen depending on the nature of the dark matter. The mass loss of the Sun due to its luminosity and the Solar wind leads to a much larger [but still tiny] growth of the Earth's orbit which has nothing to do with the expansion of the Universe. Even on the much larger (million light year) scale of clusters of galaxies, the effect of the expansion of the Universe is 10 million times smaller than the gravitational binding of the cluster.\n \n Is the Universe expanding or is it just that our definitions of length and time are changing?\n \n The definitions of length and time are not changing in the standard model. The second is still 9192631770 cycles of a Cesium atomic clock and the meter is still the distance light travels in 9192631770/299792458 cycles of a Cesium atomic clock.\n \n What is meant by a flat Universe?\n \n The Universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic, and there are only three possible geometries that are homogeneous and isotropic as shown in Part 3. A flat space has Euclidean geometry, where the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180o. A curved space has non-Euclidean geometry. In a positively curved, or hyperspherical space, the sum of the angles in a triangle is bigger than 180o, and this angle excess gives the area of the triangle divided by the square of the radius of the surface. In a negatively curved or hyperbolic space, the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180o. When Gauss invented this non-Euclidean geometry he actually tried measuring a large triangle, but he got an angle sum of 180o because the radius of the Universe is very large (if not infinite) so the angle excess or deficit has to be tiny for any triangle we can measure. If the radius is infinite, then the Universe is flat.http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#MX\n \n The sections of the answers that I bolded reveal the obvious weaknesses in what we claim to understand even though we are offering sulutions to problems we are unable to fully define or understand.",

It means \"earlier in the dimension of time.\" You are literally trying to refer to the existence of time \"before time existed,\" which makes no sense.\n \n \nThis is what I said that you said I was lying about. [Archangel] it is your big bang theory that assumes that prior to it occurring that there was nothing. And by nothing I meant that time didn't exist according to you or the big bang theory, and you know that. So how was I lying if you say below that apart from the universe there can be no \"time\"?\n\n Because you're trying to talk about a time when there's no time. Seriously, ask yourself this question: When was there no time? The question doesn't make sense, because \"when\" asks for a time.\n Your only defense against the accusation of lying is admitting that you don't understand why \"before time\" is nonsensical.\n \n \nAnd here you seem to be confirming YOUR lie, if anyone is lying.\n\n I'm not lying. Since you've already lied your little head off, I see that you're not holding back with more by accusing me.\n \n \nBecause you know darn well that your reference to \"after 10^-43 seconds after singularity\" is another way of referring to the big bang event.\n\n No, the big bang event started at time 0, not at time 10^-43.\n \n \nSo you're saying that time didn't exist prior to the big bang event occurring which is, in your opinion the beginning of the universe and the beginning of time.\n\n No, I'm not. I never said that \"time didn't exist prior to the big bang event\" (i.e. prior to the beginning of time) because prior means earlier in time. How can something occur \"earlier in time\" than the existence of time?\n \n \nAnd here is another repeated lie.\n\n You're lying yet again. Nothing I've said is a lie.\n \n \nSo why are \"YOU LYING NOW\" and denying that it is your firm belief that A) the big bang is the event that defines the beginning of the universe,\n\n I'm not denying that. You can't read. (Or else you're lying again, or both.)\n \n \nand B) prior to the universe existing,\n\n I'm cutting off this sentence to make a point: listen to yourself. You're talking about a time comparison. How can you make a time comparison of universe vs. non-universe when time exists only within the universe?\n \n \nNow come back in typical fashion and tell me I don't understand english. Because if I don't, just remember that it's your version of the language that I'm not understanding.\n\n Two points: 1) I never made statement A or statement B. You can't post any quote showing I did. You just think I did because you can't read for comprehension.\n 2) You don't understand because you never developed your critical thinking skills. It might help if you try thinking of time as the fourth dimension.\n \n \nthe so called singularity was void of time and space,\n\n When did I say this?\n \n \nso that time didn't exist pre-universe.\n\n Once again, listen to yourself. No such thing as time \"PRE-universe.\" How can there be \"PRE-\" anything with no time? There's no such thing as \"pre-universe,\" because that would mean \"pre-time.\"\n Imagine the universe (thus time) started at time 0. If this is the case, then there is no such thing as time -1 second, when you allege the \"pre-universe\" conditions existed. There is no \"before time 0.\" That doesn't mean that at time -1 second, there is \"nothing,\" it means that talking about pre-time makes no sense. It's a bit like trying to talk about the depth of a two-dimensional object.\n \n \nOf course since you're stating all of this as fact, then one would expect a supporting link. But as usual you expect me to take your word for this as if a science teacher has a PHD in astrophysics. So if you continue to insist that time is only a result of the Universe existing, I expect solid evidence of it.\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang\n Happy reading.",

The answer is yes to both. \n \n Why isn't the solar system expanding? Because of gravity of course. The solar orbits could only change if the gravitational force of the sun was depleting, among the other factors your paste mentioned. But it doesn't apply to intergalactical motion.

And that no answers are complete in and of themselves.

Is stationary and all other things in space are moving away from us specifically. \n\n \n And yet science say's our solar system doesn't seem to be expanding with the rest of Space, or even our own Galaxy which it resides within. And this answer just raises more questions.Why doesn't the Solar System expand if the whole Universe is expanding?\n \n This question is best answered in the coordinate system where the galaxies change their positions. In other words, no consistent answer applies to the whole uniform universe! The galaxies are receding from us because they started out receding from us, and the force of gravity just causes an acceleration that causes them to slow down, or speed up in the case of an accelerating expansion. Planets are going around the Sun in fixed size orbits because they are bound to the Sun. Everything is just moving under the influence of Newton's laws (with very slight modifications due to relativity). [Illustration] For the technically minded, Cooperstock et al. computes that the influence of the cosmological expansion on the Earth's orbit around the Sun amounts to a growth by only one part in a septillion over the age of the Solar System. This effect is caused by the cosmological background density within the Solar System going down as the Universe expands, which may or may not happen depending on the nature of the dark matter. The mass loss of the Sun due to its luminosity and the Solar wind leads to a much larger [but still tiny] growth of the Earth's orbit which has nothing to do with the expansion of the Universe. Even on the much larger (million light year) scale of clusters of galaxies, the effect of the expansion of the Universe is 10 million times smaller than the gravitational binding of the cluster.\n \nHere's an easy way to answer that question. Take a balloon and draw 2 dots on it. Now blow up the balloon. Are the dots moving away from each other, or is the balloon expanding?

Be it small, it is still moving away from us which implies that it IS IN FACT EXPANDING TOO. http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/moon_mechanics_0303018.html\n \n \nThe last question you asked you already answered so I don't know why its even there. \n \n You keep saying that science cannot answer these questions, so it must mean that God done it. But the truth is that the questions have been answered. I don't see the point, except that they were posted in an attempt to distract from the fact that you didn't answer my questions in the first place. Its ok, you can try again. \n\n \n I'm really not saying that at all paulie. I'm saying that there are two different possible explanations for how all of this came about. And sciences explanations regarding the simple act of the big bang don't contradict what the bible say's at all. The bible say's that everything that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible. That is pretty much exactly what the big bang implies verbatim, just in a much more concise way. All I'm arguing here is that the scientific answers raise questions that are impossible to answer given our vantage point. And yet Man is so pompous as to believe we can actually answer what is unknowable since it happened allegedly billions of years ago.\n \n You must appreciate that I'm not forwarding any alternate theories at all. I'm not claiming any special knowledge for how our universe exists at all. I'm arguing that we just don't know so much in the natural yet science claims to be on the right track in so many of these areas where we can't know what the right questions to ask are because we're dealing with a time span of billions of years ago, allegedly. We don't know what the density of that singularity was, but that doesn't stop us from theorizing around that fact. We don't know what, if any gravity existed, or light, or matter other than what was produced by this unexplained sudden expansion that just happened with no apparent identifiable trigger at all. \n \n So call me the forum spoiler of astrophysics if you like, but all I'm doing here is exposing how little we know in reality, compared to how much science assumes we have learned by observing that which happened so long ago, if it really did happen as long ago as science believes.",

I have no reason to be disingenuous here regarding how I perceive cosmology and astrophysics at all. In fact my position is not only very clear but very simple. The full crux of my stance is that at every level of consideration, what we claim to know regarding what occurred potentially 14-20 Billion years ago is at best wishful thinking. My insistence that we don't know if the pre-universe singularity that existed was soupy, clear, dense of like a misty cloud is valid. It is theorized that a mass of super dense matter the size of a soft ball instantaneously expanded, inexplicably, into an ever expanding universe that we currently inhabit. That theory was derived at based on what we have directly observed. The question I am asking that is impossible to answer is, what haven't we observed because it's beyond the scope of our technology to even know to look for it? So what questions aren't we asking that could further our insight into this distant past event.\n \n How do we know that what existed before the big bang wasn't an singularity full of a solid block of matter that became super heated and exploded into what we now call the universe/time and space, and the resulting dispersal of that matter is what formed all of the celestial bodies we observe today? I mean, my theory contains within it all of the elements that the big bang contains, only in a different order of occurrence. What if the originators of the original big bang theory imagined it that way, can you say for sure that we wouldn't be discussing that original mass of matter that exploded as you defended it and I questioned its existence? \n \n That is what I mean about the unknowable questions to ask in order to come to the correct conclusions now. We don't know for certain what existed prior to the creation of the universe and we don't know what caused this alleged big bang. So if the big bang itself is theoretical, and what caused it is anyones guess, then how can we assume that anything we think we know about that period is based in fact at all? The only rational answer is that we can't. And that is all I'm arguing here. I'm not promoting any thesis at all. I'm just questioning everything man made science accepts based on predictions that evolved from models that are based on our very limited perspective of time and space.\n \n If you look at how much more we know and understand about our universe today, compared to 100 years ago, just imagine what we will know a hundred years from now with the advancing technology that we know is coming down the road?

What we claim to know about the state of the universe 14-20 billion years ago comes from what we've observed and what we infer by extrapolating the data. Its not something somebody dreamed up or hope is true. For you to call it wishful thinking, it shows you don't understand how the theory came about. \n \n \nIt is theorized that a mass of super dense matter the size of a soft ball instantaneously expanded, inexplicably, into an ever expanding universe that we currently inhabit.

I mean, my theory contains within it all of the elements that the big bang contains, only in a different order of occurrence. \n\n If that is the case, test your theory against the data gathered. Use your theory to explain the phenomenon we observe. Science doesn't sit around dreaming up theories. If your hypothesis makes more sense logically and is better supported by the evidence that exists, science will accept it over the big bang thheory that we have today. I guarantee it. \n \n \nWhat if the originators of the original big bang theory imagined it that way, can you say for sure that we wouldn't be discussing that original mass of matter that exploded as you defended it and I questioned its existence? \n \n\n Again you are talking about scientists imagining things a certain way. That's not how it works, and you know it, so let it go.\n \n \nThat is what I mean about the unknowable questions to ask in order to come to the correct conclusions now. We don't know for certain what existed prior to the creation of the universe and we don't know what caused this alleged big bang.

There is no big bang fact; its called the big bang theory for a reason. I don't even know why I have to keep pointing this out when its been explained to you numerous times. \n \n The fact is that the universe exists. We have evidence to suggest that the universe is expanding. The big bang theory offers an explanation as to why the universe is expanding that is consistent with how the universe is today. \n \n How would explain the evidence?",

You don't get a scientific theory without lots of evidence.\n What you are arguing, Archangel, when you declare that our uncertainty means that our other conclusions are untrustworty, is essentially the same thing as arguing that -- since we don't have a complete understanding of the nature of electrons (are they waves? are they particles? both? how can they be both? and at the same time? do they switch back and forth?) -- we must not be able to draw conclusions about shared electrons in molecules. But we have comprehensive understanding of these shared electrons and can confirm that our models are correct by making observations of real-life molecules. If our admittedly incomplete understanding of the specific nature of electrons really did handcuff us when trying to draw conclusions, then we couldn't accurately predict molecular geometry. But we do predict it, and we predict it accurately.\n The fact that we can make these predictions and then learn that our predictions are accurate is very telling. It's one thing to observe something, then repeat what you saw. But these models can provide information that we haven't yet measured. Now, if we go out to gather data, and we find something that we weren't expecting to find, then our model is wrong or needs tweaking. In the case of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the data we found were exactly what our model said it should be. How can you possibly argue that our model isn't reliable when it demonstrably is reliable at explaining things, even those we hadn't yet measured?\n \n \n \nAgain you are talking about scientists imagining things a certain way. That's not how it works, and you know it, so let it go.\n\n unker, I'm not sure he does. You pointed out that he's close-minded; he ignores everything that doesn't boost his current opinion. (Else, he does know and dishonestly pretends not to because he has to keep fighting the \"good\" fight.)",
