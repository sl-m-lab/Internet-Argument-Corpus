   "Authenticity of Bush Guard Docs in Question\n \n Authenticity of Bush Guard Docs in Question\n \n Friday, September 10, 2004\n \n By Liza Porteus\n \n \n \n WASHINGTON - Questions continued to swirl Friday around the authenticity of memos purporting to show discrepancies in President Bush's Texas Air National Guard (search) service over 30 years ago.\n \n Documents aired by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" Wednesday night were described as having been written by Bush's commanding officer during his Guard days. Taken together, they seemed to show that Bush, then a pilot, violated a direct order and tried to avoid his duties.\n \n But since the documents surfaced, many experts who have studied them say the memos' typeface, formatting, paragraph spacing and other attributes indicate that they were written on a modern-day personal computer, possibly using the Microsoft Word word-processing program - not on a 1970s typewriter.\n \n The documents were purportedly written in 1972 and 1973.\n \n The records also show Bush required two passes to land an F-102A fighter (search ) on March 12 and April 10, 1972. His last flight as an Air National Guard pilot was on April 16.\n \n The documents appeared to say Bush ignored a direct order from a superior officer and lost his status as a Guard pilot because he failed to meet military performance standards and undergo a required physical exam.\n \n Meanwhile, Bush's pilot logs, released by the military, show that he began flying a two-seat training jet more frequently and twice required multiple attempts to land a one-seat fighter in the weeks just before he quit flying for the Texas Air National Guard in 1972.\n \n The logs show Bush flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972, including eight times in one week and four of those only as a co-pilot. Bush, then a first lieutenant, flew in T-33s only twice in the previous six months and three times in the year ending July 31, 1971.\n \n Valid Questions or 'Character Assassination'?\n \n Bush's Guard service became a focus of Democratic criticism this week. Democrats and some like-minded groups such as Texans for Truth (search ) say Bush shirked his National Guard duties, a claim Bush denies.\n \n \"Mr. Bush has repeatedly insisted that he did his duty. We now know this isn't true,\" Sen. Tom Harkin (search ), D-Iowa, told a press conference Thursday. \"The president lied to the American people.\"\n \n On Friday, Harkin told FOX News that despite the chance that some of the documents may be fake, there was other proof that Bush got special privileges to get into the Guard, didn't take his physical and didn't fulfill all his duty requirements.\n \n \"So when George Bush, in the Oval Office earlier this year, said 'I did my duty,' I'm sorry, we now know he didn't do his duty,\" Harkin said.\n \n To counter those allegations, Republican National Committee spokesman Jim XXXX released a statement calling such statements \"character assassination.\"\n \n \"The Democrat playbook is wide open,\" XXXX said. \"Faced with the reality that John Kerry's record is too far out of the American mainstream and without an agenda on which to base his campaign, extreme partisans like Tom Harkin, Al Gore and James Carville are attempting to fill the vacuum of positive policies with character assassination. Bad news for the Democrats because the American people know the difference between a legitimate policy discussion and personal attacks.\"\n \n Republican critics and various outside groups, including the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (search ), have accused Democratic presidential nominee Kerry, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, of fabricating the incidents that led to his five medals.\n \n Also Thursday, prisoners of war who endured torture, isolation and interrogation at the hands of their North Vietnamese captors raised Cain over anti-war statements Kerry made after returning from service.\n \n Some former POWs who appear in a documentary film released Thursday say Kerry's 1971 Senate testimony alleging widespread and militarily-condoned war crimes made their time in prison worse. They claim that prison guards used Kerry's testimony to demand confessions of war crimes and as justification for brutalizing them.\n \n \"The words he used were devastating, because as a war prisoner, we were being called war prisoners, he was giving them at home what we were being tortured to say,\" said former POW Jim Warner.\n \n Experts Question Bush Docs\n \n CBS has defended the authenticity of the Guard memos, which were supposedly produced by Lt. Col. Jerry Killian.\n \n But one of Killian's fellow officers, an independent document examiner and Killian's own son doubted the veracity of the memos.\n \n Gary Killian, who served in the Guard with his father and retired as a captain in 1991, said he doubted his father would have written an unsigned memo which said there was pressure to \"sugar coat\" Bush's performance review.\n \n \"It just wouldn't happen,\" he said. \"No officer in his right mind would write a memo like that.\"\n \n The personnel chief in Killian's unit at the time also said he believes the documents are fake.\n \n \"They looked to me like forgeries,\" said Rufus Martin. \"I don't think Killian would do that, and I knew him for 17 years.\"\n \n Killian died in 1984.\n \n In a telephone interview from her Texas home, Killian's widow, Marjorie Connell, described the records to The Washington Post as \"a farce,\" saying she was with her husband until the day he died in 1984 and that he did not \"keep files.\" She said her husband considered Bush \"an excellent pilot.\"\n \n \"I don't think there were any documents. He was not a paper person,\" she said, adding that she was \"livid\" at CBS journalists, who she said did not ask her to authenticate the records.\n \n Independent document examiner Sandra Ramsey Lines said the memos looked like they had been produced on a computer using Microsoft Word. Lines, a document expert with the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (search ), pointed to a superscript - a smaller, raised \"th\" in \"111th Fighter Interceptor Squadron\" - as evidence indicating forgery.\n \n \"I'm virtually certain these were computer-generated,\" Lines said. She produced a nearly identical document using her computer's Microsoft Word software.\n \n Barnes' Claims Questions\n \n Adding even more fuel to the military records fire were accusations by a woman claiming to be Amy Barnes, daughter of former Texas Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes (search ).\n \n The woman said Thursday that Ben Barnes had fabricated claims that he used his influence to pull strings and get Bush into the Texas Air National Guard 36 years ago.\n \n In a phone call to WBAP's Mark Davis radio show in Dallas, Texas, the so-called Amy Barnes said the former lieutenant governor was an \"opportunist\" who had lied about Bush's Guard record.\n \n \"I love my father very much, but he's doing this for purely political reasons,\" the woman said. \"He is a big Kerry fundraiser, and he is writing a book also. And [the Bush story] is what he's leading the book off with ... He denied this to me in 2000 that he did get Bush out [of Vietnam service]. Now he's saying he did.\"\n \n The alleged Amy Barnes said Ben Barnes was also trying to sell his book. The radio station confirmed that Barnes does have a daughter names Amy, but it was not confirmed that the woman on the air was in fact her.\n \n Does It Even Matter?\n \n Voters and war veterans may not be so much concerned about the particulars of Kerry's Vietnam heroism or Bush's Guard pilot logs as they would be worried about trends that could emerge, said one well-known Reagan administration official.\n \n \"They're not concerned about whether George W. Bush made every drill or not,\" Ret. Marine Col. Oliver North, host of FOX News' \"War Stories,\" told FOX News on Friday. \"I think they are going to be concerned if they find out these documents are forgeries, because it's going to be a pattern of deception that has plagued John Kerry since Vietnam.\"\n \n Harkin said it wasn't so much the devil in the details that counted, but what those details said about Bush's character and other issues.\n \n \"I think in any presidential race, character counts, and George Bush has staked a lot on his character,\" Harkin told FOX News.\n \n If it's true that Bush lied about his Guard service, Harkin said the next question would be \"'Will he mislead us also about Iraq, how we got into Iraq?' ... This counts because it's not something that happened 30 years ago. ... It's something that happened this year.\"\n \n Bush loyalists labeled the Guard-service issue as nothing more than pure desperation from the Kerry camp.\n \n \"We do know that George Bush has the respect and support of the people of America,\" Sen. George Allen, R-Va., told FOX News. \"This is desperation. It is very pitiful that they're coming up with these things ... and it shows just how pitiful the desperation is.\n \n \"The reality is, who in the future if best to lead this country? And I think you're seeing from polls the American people see greater comfort in George Bush than they do in Senator Kerry.\"\n \n The White House has argued that recent polls showing Kerry slipping slightly among America's electorate is the reason for the recent Democratic criticism over Bush's record.\n \n FOX News' Major Garrett and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
