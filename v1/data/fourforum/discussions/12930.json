   "The Obama administration worries that future vice presidents will refuse to testify for fear of being made fun of. \n \n Cheney Predacted | The Daily Show | Comedy Central\n (video at web-site...)\n \n \nWrap your head around this: The Obama administration wants to save former Vice President Dick Cheney from the likes of \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart.\n \n That was the thrust of arguments the Justice Department presented Thursday seeking to prevent the release of an interview Cheney gave in 2004 to Special Counsel Pat Fitzgerald as part of his investigation into the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson. \n \n In an afternoon U.S. District Court hearing in Washington, Judge Emmet Sullivan presided as Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Smith defended the government's refusal to release the details of the Cheney interview. David Sobel, an attorney for the group suing for the documents, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was there to argue in favor of disclosure. Here's how it went:\n \n Sullivan asked if President Barack Obama's appointees stood by the Bush administration's steadfast refusal to make the Cheney interview public, noting, \"there's a new administration.\"\n \n \"This has been vetted by the leadership offices,\" Smith said. \"This is a department position.\"\n \n \"It is disappointing that the new administration apparently is picking up where the old one left off,\" said Sobel.\n \n Smith argued that allowing Cheney's interview to become public could have a \"chilling effect\" on the willingness of future vice presidents and presidents to cooperate with law enforcement investigations.\n \n \"Says who?\" Sullivan asked.\n \n Smith said that was the conclusion of Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who was in office at the time briefs were filed in the case last year. However, the only formal statement the government presented in its papers was from Bush Justice Department official Stephen Bradbury.\n \n \"Bradbury's a political appointee. I don't know what his experience was,\" Sullivan said skeptically. \"It's just an assumption this man makes. ... He didn't talk to the vice president.\"\n \n \"What the Justice Department doesn't want is to become an information-finder for the president and vice president's political enemies,\" Smith added. \"We don't want future vice presidents to see us as the conduit to them being mocked.\"\n \n \"The government doesn't want to have what's in these documents end up on a late-night comedy show,\" Sullivan said.\n \n A key legal question in the case is whether the potential for future investigations of the White House is too speculative to permit withholding records under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n Saving Dick Cheney from 'The Daily Show'? - Josh Gerstein - POLITICO.com\n That's pretty pathetic.\n \n The Obama administration doesn't want these documents to be publicized...\n ... on a late-night comedy show?\n Freedom of the press reigns!\n As long as it's not coming from a comedic form... emoticon_xdonno\n \n I really didn't like the excuses coming out of the Bush administration (executive privilege), but this one has sunk to an all new low of stank!",

Talking about what Bush did, what Obama promised, and then what Obama is doing now (which looks like what Bush was doing...)\nI see more people catching on to this was is surprising because I assume the worst when it comes to the American public. It isn't so much the same on the face value but the same core \"beliefs\" in a way...like a disease that shows one symptom for one person and a different for another.\n \n \nI cut some of it some slack cause some of it is an attempt to deal with the recession.\nYou have to be careful of this. Remember the Bush folks where like \"cut him some slack because of 9/11 and terrorism\". That argument was convincing to some as the recession may be to you. We are already hearing about a second stimulus when the first one has showed signs of failing and not meeting the projections Obama had. Meanwhile China is recovering and while they had a stimulus package I don't believe it was paid for with debt and most importantly they are the ones that make cheap products for those with no money. \n \n \nSome other stuff is policy catching up to what a majority of the country actually wanted for the previous 8 years, as Bush and Republicans held back a variety of stuff like stem cells, ENDA, Iraq, ...\nThe stem cell and ENDA are fluff things that won't make much of a difference. Iraq, I'm not convinced this is different..rather the overall foreign policy. \n \n \nBut on some of the other stuff? (often involving funding) \n I seriously say \"slow down\".\n I think the economy needs to recover before we look at health care (for example).\nProbably environmental stuff too. From a strict financial look at global warming (which I will assume to be true for this argument) we have a \"solution\" that costs a fortune and does little if anything. Health Care is the same way. There isn't two solutions to every problem (as we tend to hear)...time for some people to think outside the box.",
