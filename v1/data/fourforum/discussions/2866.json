So to answer your question, yes they did.\n\n I see you're attempting to be pedantic. In that case, they didn't find weapons of mass destruction, but a weapon of mass destruction. That's hardly the case that they made for invasion.\n Have you ever seen Monty Pythons: The Life of Brian, when the centurions raid a house looking for zealots, and they come out and report \"We've found a spoon!\", that's the sort of joke-argument you're making here.\n \nWho decides if a war is legal/illegal and justified/unjustified? You sure as hell don't.\n\n No, I don't. To turn the question around, \"Do you?\" Does the USA? No! The UN does. The UN didn't approve the war, therefore it's illegal. \n \nIt's a matter of opinion. Some think it is justified, some think it isn't.\n\n The second sentence is an empty truism. The first, well that depends what you're referring to. Are you saying it's a matter of opinion who decides what's a legal war, or a matter of opinion that the war was illegal?\n \nSome think it's legal, some think it's illegal. And what do you consider arbitrary killing of Iraqis?\n\n Again, a truism. I think arbitrary in that the US forces often shot at anything that moves. I've seen footage taken from one of your helly-copters (pun) on a documentary where they blew away a couple of men walking along at night. They weren't carrying weapons.\n \"On 31 March US soldiers opened fire on an unidentified vehicle as it approached a US checkpoint near al-Najaf. Ten of the 15 passengers, including five children, were killed. \n On 1 April at least 33 civilians, including many children, were reportedly killed and around 300 injured in US attacks allegedly involving cluster bombs on the town of al-Hilla, southeast of Baghdad.\"\n http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/irq-summary-eng\n \n We don't just go out and kill every Iraqi we see.\n\n You often do. During the war there were dozens of missions that the RAAF* flew when directed by American commanders, that the RAAF pilots didn't carry out because they saw the targets weren't of 'military value', and they exercised good conscience not to attack. However, the US commanders would often then send in US forces to destroy the targets anyway.\n One incident is detailed at\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200303/s814594.htm\n \"In a remarkable account of how our airmen applied Australian rules of engagement, an RAAF pilot has told The Sun-Herald each of the 14 RAAF Hornet pilots aborted three to four bombing runs because intelligence given at pre-flight briefings did not concur with what they found at the target.\"\n ...\n \"But it appears there were fundamental differences between the US dominated headquarters and Australian pilots over what constituted a valid military target.\"\n One British RAF pilot exploded a missile his plane had already launched after he looked at the target through binoculars and saw it was a workman's hut in a quarry. Intelligence had told them it was a tank.\"\n ...\n \"On April 6, a US bomber attacked a US-Kurdish convoy killing 18 Kurdish fighters.\"\n http://thebleedingheart.blogspot.com/2004_03_16_thebleedingheart_archive.html\n \nMost of their deaths occur by the hands of terrorists, who blow up police stations, cars, buses, and themselves, and then hide out like a bunch of wussies in a mosque.\n\n Yes, after the war, the terrorists have killed more people.\n \nThat's what causes the chaos. And arbitrary arrests? We captured 1200 yesterday who were fighting with al-Sadr in Najaaf. Is that arbitrary?\n\n Again I've seen stuff of men detained for no reason. Look at the men who were abused by US forces in prison. Most of them, after the scandal blew up were allowed home. There were hundreds US forces had arrested who, as it turns out had no connexion with terrorists.\n You've seen these stories...\n Monday :: May 03, 2004\n 7 More GI's Reprimanded for Abuse of Iraqi Prisoners \n Seven more 7 G.I.'s have been sanctioned for abusing Iraqi prisoners at Al Ghraib prison raising the total number of penalized soldiers to 13.

The UN didn't approve the war, therefore it's illegal.\n\n \n \n \n Since when does the UN tell us what to do and what not to do?

Amnesty.org is going to jump on anything they see. You may have seen these 2 instances, but it generally doesn't happen. Tell me the most recent time when we just shot at some Iraqis on purpose? Atrocities are bound to happen in a war like we're in now. It is inevitable. The same thing happened with John Kerry shooting a fleeing Vietcong in the back, burning villages, killing livestock, raping women, etc.\n \n \n \nYou often do.

We apparently didn't order that. So talk that over with whoever runs Australia. This forum is about GWB, not some Aussie. Why did you add in there your own little comment \"However, the US commanders would often then send in US forces to destroy the targets anyway.\"? Your opinion shows me nothing.\n \n \n \n \n\"But it appears there were fundamental differences between the US dominated headquarters and Australian pilots over what constituted a valid military target.\"\n One British RAF pilot exploded a missile his plane had already launched after he looked at the target through binoculars and saw it was a workman's hut in a quarry.

   "Whether the UN approves of it or not is irrelevant.\n\n Not if you want to deal with things 'legal' in an international sense.\n \nAnyway, some of the nations part of the United Nations are terrorist sympathizers and terrorists/reps of terrorist nations in the first place.\n\n This is true, but I'd see no reason why we should expel the USA for doing that.\n \nThe UN is made up of liberal wimps who think all of our problems can be solved by a bunch of little \"let's make peace\" and \"peaceful\" compromises and discussions.\n\n Yes, there are many people that don't want wars. Pity the USA has the war-making machine as such a large industry.\n \nThat's only going to be possible in very rare occasions (particularly when dealing with terrorists who act cowardly by hiding their identity). In the case of terrorists, they don't care about any peace deals; they just want to continue on with their jihad **** against America because they [the terrorists] think America started a holy war (primarily meaning Christians vs. Muslims) with them.\n\n I am no fan of Islam. I am of Christianity, and Christ was a messenger of peace\n \n Peace comes from war. Peace does not come from cowarding (sic?) behind the UN.\n\n George Orwell would be proud of the War is Peace lessons you've learned. :)\n \nIf you want a strong nation of the United States, vote for George Bush. If you want the US to become a nation that doesn't act upon open threats by terrorists, vote for John Kerry.\n\n I can't vote in US elections.

Kerry got three pieces of shrapnel in his body after launching a grenade at a rock near the river -- there were no enemies in sight. After earning three purple hearts, a Vietnam soldier could leave the Vietnam War (explains why John Kerry served for four months).\n\n You've posted tonnes of evidence to support your case.

   "Before I respond, I got the impression that you're not from the US. Where are you from?\n\n I'm from the 51st state, Australia :)\n \nNo, I don't. To turn the question around, \"Do you?\" Does the USA? No! The UN does. The UN didn't approve the war, therefore it's illegal.\n\n \nSince when does the UN tell us what to do and what not to do?\n\n Since the member nations all joined agreeing to adhere to certain principles and rules. No one forced the US to join, in fact you're one of the main reasons the UN exists, with helping set it up, and you pay for (or are supposed to) a fair portion of the UN budget. But, like a bully, when the rules of the game suddenly aren't in your favour, you threaten to beat up the little kids on the block\n \n It is fairly obvious that they might not be all they're cracked up to be (oil for food scandal). That's probably why they didn't approve of it, because if we invaded, no more cheap oil for them.\n\n Are you saying that the UN was after cheap oil?\n \nThe second sentence is an empty truism. The first, well that depends what you're referring to. Are you saying it's a matter of opinion who decides what's a legal war, or a matter of opinion that the war was illegal? \n\n \nWas it illegal for us to take out Hitler? That's about the exact same thing as we did to Saddam.\n\n Firstly, 'you' (and by this I mean the USA) didn't 'take out Hitler'. You contributed a large amount, more so than my own small country. Your effort was almost as great as the Soviet Union, and China.\n But well, irony! The nations that were united against Hitler were called \"The United Nations\"; all these powers were the first members of the UN.\n Further, where your analogy falls apart; Germany declared war on the USA, so the USA has a right to defend itself. I don't believe that Iraq declared war on the USA.\n So that's only a few points where the analogy fails.\n \nAgain, a truism. I think arbitrary in that the US forces often shot at anything that moves. I've seen footage taken from one of your helly-copters (pun) on a documentary where they blew away a couple of men walking along at night. They weren't carrying weapons.\n \"On 31 March US soldiers opened fire on an unidentified vehicle as it approached a US checkpoint near al-Najaf. Ten of the 15 passengers, including five children, were killed. \n On 1 April at least 33 civilians, including many children, were reportedly killed and around 300 injured in US attacks allegedly involving cluster bombs on the town of al-Hilla, southeast of Baghdad.\"\n http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/irq-summary-eng \n \n\n \n You have 2 random cases.\n\n There are more cases. I wasn't sure how many you'd want.\n \n Amnesty.org is going to jump on anything they see.\n\n Yes, it's shameful that they speak up against abuses where ever they happen. Good point.\n \n You may have seen these 2 instances, but it generally doesn't happen. Tell me the most recent time when we just shot at some Iraqis on purpose?\n\n I don't think this is the question you want to be asking... or I'd introduce ANY time you've fired at them, even in self-defence. You need to stay focused if you're going to argue.\n \nAtrocities are bound to happen in a war like we're in now. It is inevitable.\n\n That's like saying \"Murders are bound to happen any where, let's get rid of the laws then and not seek to punish the criminals\"\n \nThe same thing happened with John Kerry shooting a fleeing Vietcong in the back, burning villages, killing livestock, raping women, etc.\n\n Again, I'm totally convinced by the tonnes of evidence you present on your anti-Kerry rant.\n \n You often do. During the war there were dozens of missions that the RAAF* flew when directed by American commanders, that the RAAF pilots didn't carry out because they saw the targets weren't of 'military value', and they exercised good conscience not to attack. However, the US commanders would often then send in US forces to destroy the targets anyway.\n One incident is detailed at\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200303/s814594.htm\n \"In a remarkable account of how our airmen applied Australian rules of engagement, an RAAF pilot has told The Sun-Herald each of the 14 RAAF Hornet pilots aborted three to four bombing runs because intelligence given at pre-flight briefings did not concur with what they found at the target.\" \n\n \n That's from Australia. We apparently didn't order that. So talk that over with whoever runs Australia. This forum is about GWB, not some Aussie.\n\n You're kidding? Why is the fact an Australian source talks about the war is irrelevant?\n Let's run through this s-l-o-w-l-y\n Australia is (unfortunately) one of your allies in the illegal war on Iraq. During the war, the US was in over-all command.\n The US command ordered RAAF pilots to attack 'military' targets.\n On actually flying at the targets, the RAAF pilots, in their professional opinion judged the targets weren't military ones. Similarly, other allies; Britain have cases the same. The US seems to want to shoot everything.\n \nWhy did you add in there your own little comment \"However, the US commanders would often then send in US forces to destroy the targets anyway.\"? Your opinion shows me nothing.\n\n Well, even though the Australians and Brits exercised good conscience, the US command would still order these non-military targets to be attacked.\n \n \"But it appears there were fundamental differences between the US dominated headquarters and Australian pilots over what constituted a valid military target.\"\n One British RAF pilot exploded a missile his plane had already launched after he looked at the target through binoculars and saw it was a workman's hut in a quarry. Intelligence had told them it was a tank.\"\n ...\n \"On April 6, a US bomber attacked a US-Kurdish convoy killing 18 Kurdish fighters.\"\n http://thebleedingheart.blogspot.co...rt_archive.html \n \n\n \nBlogspot? Come on, why don't you just quote Michael Moore.\n\n It's a standard attempt to debunk an argument, that you're engaged in. Rather than deal with the facts you deal with the source. Simply put it confirms the type of stories found at other sites, such as the ABC above. Even when I post from a well-respected source such as Amnesty you go 'oh, that's the sort of thing amnesty would say' \n \nYes people were abused in prison, much like US captives often get abused. British troops abused Iraqis as well. Do you criticize Tony Blair for that? Bush did not force these troops to torture or abuse the prisoners. So why are you bringing this up? It has no relevancy to the argument that Bush is nuts.\n\n Aren't 'we' supposed to be better than 'them'? A relativist argument doesn't cut the mustard (I hope that expression's not just in Australia :) )",

They call it paranoid schizophrenia.\"\n http://www.uakron.edu/worldciv/pascher/salvador.html\n \n That's just the tip of the ice-berg.\n http://www2.truman.edu/~marc/resources/interventions.html shows the amount of times you've attacked fellow American nations; toppling the democratically elected government of Chile in the 1970s is just your better know atrocity - then you propped up that hideous fascist regime.\n \n This is why I neither support Islam; nor US imperialism. Christianity is not about going around killing people who disagree with you*\n \n The US is an imperialst nation... although this is 'history' it goes to show that you've been doing this for some time.\n Post #32\n U.S. Imperialism thread, under the subject \"Government\"\n You annexed the sovereign state of Texas (albeit with the agreement of a large number of Texans).\n \n Then you took lands of Mexico, by force, though you did give them some money.\n \n You took land of the Spanish (Puerto Rico is still US territory! So too, I believe, is Guam.\n \n \"Between the Civil War and 1900, the U.S. began its apprenticeship as an imperial power. As early as the 1850's, the U.S. was sending troops to Argentina, Nicaragua, Japan, Uruguay and China, as well as eyeing sugar rich Cuba for annexation purposes.The latter half of the Nineteenth Century was spent in industrialization and the instalment and maintenance of a social order that would prove beneficial to capitalist expansion and progress. \"\n http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/9852/usimp.htm\n \n You still have American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands\n \n Hawaii too was a state that had a monarchy; the first reigning monarch of any nation to visit the USA in fact! US citizens orchestrated a coup there, then applied for admission to the US.\n \n \"Between the end of the Spanish-American War and the dawn of the Great Depression, the United States sent troops to Latin American countries thirty-two times. \"\n http://www.smplanet.com/imperialism/teddy.html\n \n You took over the Philippines and they were so happy that they launched a guerrilla war for years to get rid of you.\n \n \" The US displayed increased aggressiveness when a boundary dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela flared up again, after gold was discovered in the disputed area\" (emphasis my own)\n http://www.history.sfasu.edu/history/134-Unit5D.html\n \n \n \n A SAMPLE OF U.S. INTERVENTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, \n SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE CARIBBEAN\n 1850-56: U.S. soldiers defend American-built transisthmian railroad in Panama\n 1852-53: U.S. Marines land in Argentina to protect American interests during a revolution\n 1855: U.S. forces sent to Uruguay to protect American lives and property\n 1856: William Walker, with a mercenary army, conquers Nicaragua.\n 1857: Cornelius Vanderbilt funds the war against Walker, and hires American mercenary Sylvanus M.
