   "Dear Readers\n Iran has received documents and drawings on the black market that serve no other purpose than to make atomic weapons. Tehran, Iran has warned of an end to diplomacy if referred to the U.N. security council. If you want my opinion, dimplomacy is not working right now. The Iranians are being to stuborn and arrogant with this program.\n Most likely referral to the security council will be made, and if necessary, sanctions will be imposed on them economically and politically. Moscow and Beijing, previous opponents of the referral of Iran, have come to terms, and are now all for the referral. Of course, Moscow is doing all it can to prevent such a referral by trying to help the Iranians.\n Inspections of Iran start Saturday. Iran still denies the nuclear bomb ambitions. The U.N. stated that they have not one shred of evidence that Iran is making bombs at the Bushehr plant, nor do they have one shred of evidence that they are not making bombs.\n More on this as I get some.\n -John Milosevic",
