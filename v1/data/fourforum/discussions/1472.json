   "I am glad we decide to make countries friends and enemies (NOT). We backed Saddam and other evil dictators. Now Pakistan looks like our enemy. Do you think our government should collectively determine who our friends and enemies are?\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/22/international/asia/22STAN.html\n Inquiry Suggests Pakistanis Sold Nuclear Secrets\n By THE NEW YORK TIMES\n \n Published: December 22, 2003 \n \n WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - A lengthy investigation of the father of Pakistan's atomic bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan, by American and European intelligence agencies and international nuclear inspectors has forced Pakistani officials to question his aides and openly confront evidence that the country was the source of crucial technology to enrich uranium for Iran, North Korea and other nations.",

   "Pakistan is actually being a little too nice to us for their own good. The Pakistan government is under heavy criticism by their people for the support they are giving us even though they are not really giving us a whole lot of support. There is almost no question that Osama is in Pakistan and that if Pakistan really wanted to do so they could find him. However that would create a lot of problems for the Pakistan government because it would be very unpopular amungst the people there. If Pakistan was ever to fall to rebellion, as is possible, guess who would be in control of the nukes there. An anti-American rebellion would not be in our best interests. So I thank Pakistan for the help they are currently giving us in fighting terrorism even if they could be doing more but just are not.\n \n As for whether our government should decide who our allies are, I am fine with them doing this. It is a very simplistic system as I'm sure you are aware since only a few people are speaking on behalf of millions of people but that is how government works. A much more complicated system would involve each person speaking on their own behalf on all accounts but that would be chaos although it is a very libritarian idea.\n \n North Korea is our enemy, Iran is our enemy, France is our enemy, Cuba is our enemy, all of which are enemies of ours on a different level. Pakistan is our ally but only on a lower level. If push came to shove we would only help Pakistan to ensure that the government in place there doesn't lose control of their nuclear weapons to anti-Western rebels. Pakistan wouldn't come to our aid either. I don't think either government has really signed an alliance.",

That was a pretty scary and tumultuous time, and it seemed to place a big threat on the world.\n I guess you could say they've been openly cooperative with us the past few decades so that's why there's little, or no, animosity between us.",

Of course we were their allies, but we did more for them at the time, they did not contribute much to us, though they did fight and kill Iranians for us. It wasn't as mutual, directly, as some alliances are, though I'm sure we received a great surplus of oil out of it.\n The same thing goes for the Taliban and Noreaga. We funded and supported them both in earlier years, and then we decimated their powers.\n \n Also, there is still a hefty amount of skepticism circulating through the Halabja matter. Many researchers postulate it was in fact the Iranians who did the gassing and there was a nice article on it. Let's see if I can't find the link.",
