It also spends vast amounts on treating chronic conditions for which it is simply impossible to get insurance cover, like the treatment my father needs for (if memory serves) multi-focal motor neuropathy, a very expensive blood derivative. In any case, it is not the government, in the sense of legislators, who make these decisions. Decisions on whether and how to treat are made by individuals in consultation with their doctor.

   "\"If somebody is dying and has little chance of survival, chances are under universal healthcare they will not be treated and thus left to die.\"\n \n Your claim that some patient groups would be allowed to die as a consequence of the introduction of Universal Healthcare is untrue, and attacking UH through this untrue assertion is classic use of strawman tactics.\n\n A straw man argument is a fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position, not based on inaccuracies of an argument. Even if my argument were false, that would not make it a strawman argument. Here is an example of an actual strawman argument:\n \nBill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets: \n Jill: \"We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy.\" \n Bill: \"Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?\" \n Jill: \"I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want too keep all your junk forever, which is just ridiculous.\"\n\n That is the strawman argument. Jill never said that they should clean the closet everyday. Here is a site explaining the fallacy of a straw man.\n Fallacy: Straw Man",

When somebody proposes something, are you not supposed to state a possible negative outcome? I never said you supported people dying because they don't have as much of a chance. You truly do not understand the nature of the straw man fallacy if you believe that by stating an argument against universal healthcare it becomes a strawman.\n \n Ironically, that post right there is a strawman. You distorted my argument and attacked that distortion. I never said people in support of universal healthcare supported the negative outcomes of it...",
