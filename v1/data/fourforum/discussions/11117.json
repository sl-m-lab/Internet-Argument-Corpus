By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point: hypocrisy on the part of skeptics.\n \n \n\n Much like whether it was Julius Caesar who crossed the Rubicon, or a decoy of his.\n\n More proof to prove my point, thanks!\n \n \n\n Now, if we found an account from Roman times of how Julius Caesar split the waters of the Rubicon by urinating in it so his troops could pass...Occam's Razor would not point towards accepting it as true.\n \n\n \n It does not matter what the document contains! The same procedure should be done for every document. What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity! You wrongly use Occam's Razor as well. If the document is well preserved, has many copies, has copies relatively close to the original, etc, then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source. Then and only then, should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened. We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one. Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar's expeditions, but yet again, we accept them as fact in our history books.\n \n But, it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river. While he didn't do that, he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later. Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment. Should we discount this too because it 'doesn't seem practical' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it?\n \n But here you are admitting that you set different standards 'depending on what the writing claims'.

   "The books of the NT (GOSPELS) were agreed on due to their content being inspired by God. Anything \"rejected\" did not contain that inspiration.\n\n Poppycock. How the hell could these people have been able to tell the difference? Answer: they couldn't (not that there was a difference, because each one was man-made with no divine help). Instead, they chose the four that painted their Savior in the best light.\n \n \nHow can the Bible be used as a source while you deny the truth of its claims?\n\n Because you don't deny the truth of its claims. If you present the Bible as a credible source, then I can use it to eviscerate your position. Suppose I tell a multi-part story where King ABC is said to never lie, yet in one part, King ABC lies his little crown off. Either King ABC lied in that story and therefore doesn't never lie, or King ABC really doesn't ever lie and in fact didn't lie in that part. You can't have it both ways, but the Bible tries to have it multiple ways all the time. Even if you and I both think that the King ABC story is fiction, we can recognize this inconsistency and have absolutely no reason to believe that the story is nonfiction.\n Later you accuse me of having double standards. This is ripe considering the above.\n \n \nWhat parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?\n\n This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.\n \n \nI wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event?\n\n A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony. These five hundred people remain unnamed and carry on with their lives as if it never happened. How would a modern court view the hearsay of 500 witnesses and no resultant effect of the allegation?\n \n \nWhy then is this not taught in history classes? Why are we taught AS FACT that Homer wrote them?\n\n We aren't. Not even in literature classes are we taught this.\n \n \nGive a link to your objection and I'll take a look and get to responding when I have more time.\n\n I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.\n If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit.\n \n \nTo expound on my last post:\n And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books. Funny how easy this book gets a pass.\n\n Funny how you haven't had a literature or history class recently. Would you like me to contact the several history and literature/English teachers in my school and ask them if they credit Homer as the actual author of those epics?\n \n \nIf we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.\n\n It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled \"holy writings\" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves.\n \n \nIn regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.\n\n Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.Independently of the question of single authorship, there is near-universal agreement, after the work of Milman Parry that the Homeric poems are dependent on an oral tradition, a generations-old technique that was the collective inheritance of many singer-poets (aoidoi). [bold added for emphasis]\n\n \nHowever, in regards to the Bible, skeptics overturn the use of Occam's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible's claims.\n\n Look, bub, if you're trying to paint nonbelievers and unfair because we accept Homer as the author of epics while rejecting Moses as the author of the Pentateuch or Matthew as the author of the book of Matthew, then you're lying: we put equal scrutiny into these questions, and -- as you can see, despite your claims to the contrary -- we don't swallow the claim that Homer wrote these epics the way we know people write books and poems today.\n More importantly, there aren't (as far as I know) absurdities that make it obvious that Homer didn't write the Iliad or The Odyssey. This isn't true of the Bible: How could Moses have written that no man as humble as Moses came before or after Moses? (And wouldn't that be pretty damn un-humble for the humblest man ever to say?)\n \n \nEven though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day, still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true.\n\n And we're back to internal contradiction coupled with anonymous authorship. Do you consider The Odyssey a representation of truth? I sure as hell don't, but that's because I hold the Bible and these stories to an equal standard, and none pass. You apparently have no problem with nonsense and absurdities in the Bible, but you have no problem believing in Scylla and Charybdis and the Sirens and Circe turning men into pigs?\n \n \nDouble standard much?\n\n It's one thing for the pot to call the kettle black, but here the cast iron cauldron is calling the porcelain basin black.",

In my opinion (as someone who has read a lot of the early church writings) it is clear from writings of very early people like Clement, Ignatius, Justn Martyr, etc that what we consider orthodoxy was indeed orthodoxy from the get-go, and so it is only fair that they had some sense of wanting to keep out writings that they didn't consider accurate or genuine. People sometimes bring this us as if it indicates something bad about Christianity or early Christianity, but why should they have allowed writings into the canon that they considered spurious? (Now whether the canonical writings we have are spurious too is another debate--the bottom line is that THEY--the early Christians--didn't feel at the time that the NT books in our canon were spurious for the most part.) \n \n Now one of the things people will sometimes say is \"well, THOSE Christians won the day, and the Gnostics/Arians didn't, so there may have been gnostic or Arian writers that got suppressed so we don't really know.\" Well, you could ALWAYS make that argument about ANYTHING. We don't come to hard conclusions based on material for which we have no idea was there--a speculative basis--we come to hard conclusions based on what IS there.
