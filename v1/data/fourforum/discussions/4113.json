   "I fail to see ANY logic at all in the Bush plan. His Social Security logic seems to fall in line with his WMD logic. Here's why. He's turning what may be a future problem in to a present day emergency. I say MAY be a future problem because all projections, by default, must be based on nothing more than a statistical guess regarding population growth. That first guess is the basis for a second guess. What will the life expectancy be 20 or 30 or 50 years from now. Then the third guess. What will the income level of that fictitious population be? A guess on top of a guess on top of a guess doesn't constitute an emergency in my book. Example: when Social Security began, they didn't project today's baby boomers. Why would the next guess be any more accurate? I predict a population decline. Or... I predict that the bird flu will wipe out massive numbers of aged. There. Problem solved.\n \n Of course, it's not that simple, but my point is that financial predictions, that far in advance, just are not reliable from either point of view.\n \n Now, let's take GWB's assumptions as fact. IF, IF, IF the guesses are at least close to correct, his plan is still a terrible way to deal with the problem. Here we sit with a huge and growing deficit. Why would we shift future debt to the present. He's promising to not cut benefits to those who are currently retired or nearing retirement. In other words, the government will continue to pay out the same amount of money for the next 25 or more years. He's not avoiding paying the baby boomers. He's promising to pay them - every last one of them - full benefits. Yet, at the same time he would like to reduce the amount of money coming in to that account immediately - making the dreaded baby boom years as financially painful as possible. Would we voluntarily take a pay cut on the day we send our children off to college? Of course not. We'd all say we'd prefer the pay cut AFTER they graduate. That is - IF there has to be a pay cut at all. Why would we bear the full burden of the baby boomer's benefits earlier than necessary - and increase that burden by paying it early - along with the resulting interest from having borrowed it. Do we borrow the money to pay our kids college tuition when they're in Kindergarten? That's what he's suggesting.\n \n Today is the day to stop looking into the future. The future is here. The baby boomers have already arrived. It's too late. Continuting to pay them while cutting the income to pay them with seems like the silliest thing I've ever heard.\n \n According to a Nightline I watched last week: If Social Security remains as it is now, it will take until 2016 for the SSA to be paying out more than it takes in. It will take until 2048 to use up the reserves that are there. So much for the advertisement about 16 to 1 workers. 16 was obviously way too many. There's enough reserves to last through 2048. AND THAT'S AFTER they raided the fund.\n \n Finally, George's big lie. From Factcheck.org (or Factcheck.COM as Dick Cheney likes to reference it). Face it, George is just trying to sell the demise of Social Security. Social Security simply doesn't fit his vision for an ownership society. So, he's twisting the \"facts\" to suit himself. And he's running a blitz of an ad campaign. He's done it before.\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/article302m.html\n \n And Georged, your question is good. But I have another one. If a worker puts say 2% in his private account, does the employER have to match it as he currently does with Social Security. Or is this really a plan to reduce employer costs.",

Perhaps that God has yet to whisper all the details in his ear. Any reduction of tax revenue, be it a 2% employee and/or 2% employer contribution, will affect current/future SS payments and general revenue, where congress has been using it for years to avoid raising taxes to ensure reelection into the finest retirement program in existence. \n \n I can't see employers getting much of a break other than reductions already in play. Our median income at lower and middle worker class levels is going down, which reduces that revenue stream with a corresponding reduction in employer tax costs. Planned relaxation of immigration laws will drop those costs even farther. We're becoming a service transaction oriented economy, with larger payrolls exiting the US in the form of relocated production and outsourced jobs servicing US requirements, so most employers won't be that concerned with their 2%.

If not, will additional public debt be required to supplement that loss of cash flow?\n\n \n Probably not. Debt has not proven to be something the American public holds the government accountable for, and why should they, most americans have loads of unecessary debt and would love to not pay it back.\n \n The Bush white house has a win-win situation. His base has always wanted SS reform (all entitlements), since they were created...actually, not reform, removal of them. That's why labeling it a crisis is a joke, they have ALWAYS wanted to remove entitlements. This wins him favor with his base. Second, it wins him favor with the big financial firms that will benefit greatly from privatization of vast quantities of money. They will support him, and his cause.\n \n The only negative is more debt, and the American people are OK with it, it's not a liability. So Bush's political balance sheet looks like:\n \n - Win since supported by his base\n - Win since supported by more of his base...big business (might even get kick backs, who knows)\n \n - Cons - more public debt, but proven that Americans don't vote with regards to debt either way\n - Cons - SS is not to help the investment savvy, it's to help the bottom rung of our society. Privatizing it will put their security in their own hands, which leaves them prey to the sophisticated financial companies, resulting in no safety net. Who cares about the bottom rung, and since when have they won an election for Bush? Even churches will make more. MOre elderly, too unsophisticated to save their money, will likely donate more to churches...they cannot lose.\n \n So, he has two clear wins, and the cons have no political importance.\n \n \n2. Given the dismal state of our equity markets, who will be responsible for those investments? \n \n The individual, which is why no SS is a problem in the first place. In many cases, this actually means the financial giants however, so it's tricky. They are quite psychologically adept at squeezing money out of people without any guarantee. Who better to squeeze from than the investment-ignorant who now have significant sums of money to throw into investments? So, some less fortunate people will be in control of their prosperity at retirement age, when they can no longer work. But in many cases the financial institutions will literally be \"in control\" of those investments. Psychological control can be just as effective as physical control.\n \n \n3. How will the US economy cope with the additional public debt, now conservatively estimated at $2-trillion, required just to initially enact such a scheme?\n\n That sort of question is not relevant to Bush's white house. It's about the party, not the reality of potential future crisis with regards to the economy, of which SS is NOT contributor to such a crisis, even though they pitch it as such.\n \n ==============================\n Republican view of entitlement (generalized labeling!)\n ==============================\n Any good republican knows that in America, you make money by swindling the poor and ignorant, legally. The more poor and ignorant you have, the better able you are to achieve these goals. Education? Good republicans want SKILLED laborers, not intelligent free/critical thinkers...for just that reason. It meets both their goals, good productivity, too ignorant to know the difference.\n \n So, an entitlement is simply this:\n Money that wise, responsible people have forced to be set aside from all individuals, so that when they are older and can no longer work, they will have something to fall back on, given that without this, we know many people do indeed go straight into poverty and have a very low quality of life without SS...in many cases, a much shorter life span as well.\n \n As a result, this money is \"out of reach\" of the good republicans, who want access to all public money through swindiling (i.e. marketing/sales)...ESPECIALLY those who were too short sighted in the first place, to save money for retirement on their own!\n \n I use swindle broadly, because I do believe in a capitalistic society. But we all know capitalism involves negotation, and when we know one side is adept, and one ignorant, swindling results naturally.\n \n That's my take on it, and I am not beyond swaying to other ways of looking at the issue.\n \n -Mach",

   "Just watched a news bit showing GWB with his first day on the road , trying to sell his SS reform. It troubles me deeply that , for the first time in 35 years of watching presidents come and go, I feel so uneasy about our president's leadership skills. I know this uneasy feeling stems from seeing 911 take our sense of horror, then patriotism, to where our country is today in Iraq. So, I wont belay that one. Now, with me being a Baby Boomer, I watched this man do his spill about SS reform and why we \"Amuricins\" just HAVE to have it, I just get itchy all over...\n \n The SS system was put in place before I was born, as a back up system for those that did not, or would not , or could not , provide a means for their own living finances in their last years . Now we are looking at trusting people to provide their own means, via privatization of their own retirement funds. Somehow this looks good on the colorful TV screen, but in real life it doesnt compute. To me, the people that REALLY need SS funds when retiring, are the same ones that did not have the skills to provide for their own retirement to begin with. So with W's new plan, we are now going to trust people like me, that are young today, to provide their own RF's , people that cant be trusted to provide their own retirement funds to begin with, hmmm...\n \n \n Back when I was growing up in the 50's - 60's, people would go to their one job, stay there for 30-40 years and retire from it with a company pension along with SS funds. These same people would help get their own children jobs at their employers company just as they were retiring. Well, we all know that peice of Americana is gone forever....\n \n So , I wonder, in todays \" global economy\" and the way that people have \"transient\" careers , with a LONG career with a employer being maybe 5 -8 years, how is this new SS reform going to assure people's retirement funds , as people cash them out everytime they change jobs ? Yes, I know the current 401 k's carry great penalties when cashed out , just to retard tapping them whenever people leave a company but . ...\n \n I also know that people are supposed to look in to Roth ira's etc, between jobs to park their 401k in while job hunting. But I have seen MANY . many, people cash out their 401's , just to carry them over while looking for another job, to survive between job searches. Then needless to say, when they find a new job, they start with a zero dollar 401 k. Then after five, eight years maybe, they get a new job, a new 401 k cycle starts again. So where would the solidity of the privatization of ones personal funds be ? Am I totally whacked out and just being an Alarmist, or is there a trace of truth to my ramblings ? :)",

   "Pure and simple, proposed SS reform is intended to drive equity markets, increase public debt by yet uncalculated trillions to replace the lost 4% of withholding taxes and eventually revert to SS if and when the volunteer ever applies for future SS benefits. \n \n The entire purpose of this exercise is to use a combination of volunteer retirement funds with public debt replacing lost SS withholding for GDP polishing. Public debt will replace the lost withholding portion and the volunteer contributions will show as increased GDP transactions, false GDP growth displayed as personal savings. \n \n Your concern of people being unable to furnish their own retirement with a 4% contribution locked into equity markets is valid. Even disregarding the volatility of equity markets, a calculation of their lifetime earnings, 4% of that compounded by a reasonable return factor isn't going to cut it. They'll still require government assistance, which will revert their 4% back into government coffers, assuming a miracle has transpired with no market shrinkage or crash and the 4% is there. Net result? more public debt from the changeover and they're on the dole at retirement. This is a scam of monumental proportions, but Bush would be long gone when the public goes in the barrel. All he wants is GDP growth during his second term for history books. \n \n The good news is that there's reportedly not enough congressional support to make it fly this year, so maybe public debt (deficit) won't take another big hit and the dollar will retain a little air. While Bush is on his last term, many members of congress are hoping for life after Bush. \n \n Anyone not comfortable with this latest scheme needs to email elected representatives and state their concerns. A simple 'no way' will do it. SS is a very emotional public issue and those reps will be paying very close attention to public (their voters) sentiment. This one is so big it can't be manipulated behind closed doors in the usual deal fashion.",

The govt took SS out of my net pay check of 52 bucks that week, and has been doing so to this day. That portion of SS is mine, I want to live long enough as a retiree, to see some of my major SS money invested, be spent by ME. I am 52 now, and really starting to feel the effects of a degenerating body and a \"not as sharp of mind \" as I had just 5 years ago. When I get 65, I can guarantee anyone that wants to know, my body/mind will not be in any BETTER shape at 65 , than it is today. .. \n\n \n I'm in roughly the same boat as you - I'm 50 and starting to feel the effects. Though I've had a lot of jobs, I've paid SS in every one of them. (never any gaps, no enemployment) I probably have far less saved than you, and would be hurt far more than you if the retirement age was raised. \n \n Keep in mind that the SS you have invested is different than any kind of private retirement you have in one big way, it isn't really yours like an investment is. Congress can decide it's not yours for any reason it sees fit. A 1950's case \"Fleming vs. Nestor\" makes that clear. Ephram Nestor came to the U.S. from Bulgaria - paid SS from 1937 to 1956, in 1956 he was deported when the government found out he was a member of the communist party from 1933 - 1939. He sued to get his SS, and lost. Congress can alter SS however it pleases, in individual and overall cases. They know that much of a change in an overall case is going to get a large group of people shootin mad however. (The main reason Democrats want our guns)\n \n \n I wish those that advocate that one works FIFTY or more years as a mandatory requirement, could be put in a time capsule and would get to see what their body/mind will be like at 70 years of age. Not all 70 year olds will end up with a fit body and mind, as others may be blessed with. Not all 70 year olds will have cushy desk jobs, because they may work in a manual labor type industry , so they will be working at such a reduced rate of productivity, they would not even be an asset to the company they work for anymore. After a male reaches 65, they really are not sure how many more years they have to live, and working until 70 , sure cuts the odds of getting to have just ten years of rest , a diminished possibilty...\n\n \n Nobody knows how many more years they have left - about a dozen people from my high school class are already gone.\n \n Almost no one from the 1930's got 10 years of rest. Why do we deserve it today, if the government can't afford to foot the bill? We only deserve it it we provide for it ourselves, individually.\n \n \n Not only for the sake of the previous statements but also, let us seniors get the hell out of the way, and provide room for the young people that are just starting out in life. Let them have a opportunity to take my vacancy in the employment field and start their young life . I think I have fully earned my time to sit in my recliner on my sun porch, or on lake shore peacefully watching the sun rise, knowing full well I will not have to set the alarm that night , for work the next morning. all jmo\n\n \n Propping up our feet and asking young people to pay our bills isn't getting out of the way. Young people should have different (better) ways to start out than simply filling an older persons previous position. I'd guess there are many non strenuous jobs that suit older people better than someone younger and often less patient.",

   "Yes I agree, we need SS reform now ( actually a longer time ago) , but I have not seen any great plans by W yet. I got one !! How about if our govt implements spending cuts that amount to stopping 88 BILLION dollars a pop, invested in another country's government reform , and take care of our own problems here first ? ? That to me , would be rational, do we think ? I am not going to be hanging on for SS funding, I have my owns means of support. I just want BACK, \"SOME \" of what the feds have taken from me for 34 years , supposedly that was taken to be set aside for me and my so called \"golden\" years :(\n\n \n The problem is, the grand wizard of SS, FDR, and 40 years of a Democrat controlled congress didn't come up with any great plans either. Our legal system, environmentalism, and a small handfull of other of our \"own problems\" would quickly dwarf 88 billion dollars in terms of total waste. \n \n Not raising the retirement age simply increases, percent by percent, the amount of time we allow government to support us. Redistibution of wealth - taking from younger Americans and giving to older Americans. More and more government - more and more socialism - and, as a result, more and more uncertainity. And of course, more and more crys to abandon FIRST what we should abandon LAST.",

   "That's only partly true IMO. Life expectancy has gone from, what, 62 in 1935, to 77 in 2005 (15 years). While I wouldn't expect today's 80 year old to keep up with 1935's 65 year old, I'd bet today's 69 or 70 year old could do what that 1935 65 year old could. That's a 3 to 1 ratio. I wonder if the medical profession has come up with a ratio for it. It would be useful to know.\n\n \n As it was explained to me, the problem lies in the fact that your quality of life in your twilight years is directly related to your health in your pre-twilight years. Obesity is through the roof in the US (up 4000% from just 25 years ago), and the MAJORITY of our population is overweight. We eat ****. Everything in American cuisine is over processed and loaded with preservatives, sugar, and fat. 35 years ago, the vast majority of our population worked in jobs where there was a significant amount of physical activity. Today, that is less than 30%. Everybody today owns a car, and the VAST majority spend more time watching TV than they do engaging in any type of physical activity. \n \n \n \n \nThose two steps would require a WHOLE LOT of money. Where do you propose to get it? More tax? or more debt?\n\n \n Keep in mind that I am a traditional conservative, which by todays standards makes me a hyper liberal. I propose that we cut taxes, eliminate debt, and then CUT SPENDING to allow us to make up the shortfalls. \n \n Cut social programs to the bone. While I certainly do not think that welfare recipients should starve to death, I also don't think they should be able to afford new entertainment systems. giver them enoguh to live in a dump and eat bad food. this iwll encourage them to get out and work\n \n Cut college entitlement programs. Make people who want to go to college work for it. This is how we did it for years and it worked better than todays system.\n \n These two steps would give us back a pool of people willing to do production jobs, and willing to do them at a reasonable cost, which would go a long ways to making American manufacturing competitive ont he world market.\n \n Cut the number of federal and state enforcement personall in HALF. May sound drastic, but is not so bad when you consider the nexpt part of the proposal, which is to cut the numebr of laws and regulations in the US in HALF. We have over 300,000,000 of them, if you can't get by on 150,000,000 you are screwqed anyway. There is no nation in the world besides the US that has over 150,000,000 laws and regulations, and they seem to get by fine witht he lower numbers. There is no reason we cannot.\n \n Cut government funded research to the bone. Corporate interests will pick up the tab since theya re the ones that ultimatly benifit. People are going to disagree with me on this, but they are WRONG. The Us government is the onlu government in the world that feels compelled to foot the bill to the tune of hundreds of billions per year to advance scientific research. Even so, the Japanese out spend us, and their government contributes NOTHING to scientific research.\n \n Cut the EPA to the bone. Leave them enough to go after large scale polluters that actually make a difference, but there is no need to be harassing smalll businesses about whether or no the wall paint in their waiting room has 12% VOC or 14%\n \n Cut the military down to a defensive level. This will be fine since my next proposal is to stop blowing hundreds of billions per year on spreading democracy or using our military as a tool for trade negotiation. Sine the Us is pretty well protected due to the fact that we have a major ocean between us and all potential agressors, the realistic size needed for a defensive force is pretty small. figure maybe 25% of current expenditures.\n \n Cut OSHA down to their accident investigation units. \n \n Cut NASA to the bone then encourage corporate particiapation in the space programs. Currently, corporations are essentially prohibited form operating space programs on their own. From a practical standpoint, corporate interest in such things FAR outstrips the interest of the US governemnt. If you could get through the government red tape, a business devoted to launching sattelites could be lucrative in the US. The chinese have been turning a profit in sattelite launching for years, so much so that during the Clinton administration we banned US companies from allowing the chinese to launch their sattelites. Even the russian space program turns a profit.\n \n Cut road construction. Live with a few more potholes. It won't kill you.\n \n Cut USFWS funding. The easiest way to do this (believe it or not) would be to disallow offroad vehicular traffic in all national parks, public recreation areas, and BLM land wihtout lease. The vast majority of poaching that is done anymore is done from 4 wheelers. Eliminate the 4 wheelers, and you can cut down on your hunting enforcement guys (since wihtout a 4 wheeler, it becomes much more difficulat, nad since you can hear one from miles away, it si pretty easy to find folks operating them illegally). In addition, nearly half of the USFWS annual maintenance budget is spent repairing damage done by off road vehicles on public land.",

Companies in my area have been giving early retirement pensions and cash payouts, just to get rid of the high benefit drawing senior employees for years now. Then they outsource those seniors jobs or go to private contractors to fill their positions...\n\n \n I don't think ALL companies want ALL elder workers to go. Those who do get rid of them that way and outsource their jobs do so for economic reasons concerning today's laws and regulations and legal threats.\n \n \nThe employee based companies have medical insurance coverage for their employees most of the time. The company gets its insurance coverage rates based on the amount of employee insurance health claims , payed out annually by the insuring company. Not meaning to overly generalize here, but as a rule senior workers have a higher medical insurance claims payout, than the younger workers, which brings me to a even more critical point...\n \n As most seniors that are gainfully employed at 65, CAN and MAY keep working on a part time basis , if not for their existing company, they may continue to work as a freelancer , say as a carrrier or car wash manager. I am more worried about continuing health insurance coverage , than I am about a puny SS payment to me. ... \n\n \n Many can't and may not keep working after 65, even if they want to, without taking a hit on SS or other retirement benefits that they've EARNED. \n \n \n After I retire from my company , the employer provided health insurance that I only pay 30% of the premium for now, will be terminated. With my small retirement fund I will be able to live on with the basic essentials O.K, because I will have no outstanding debt. I will also possibly keep working as a part timer in one of the freelancer jobs of my choice. But , as we all know, regardless of the home equity one has, securities, cash or whatever, it can ALL be wiped out in a 6 month illness, whenever one has to pay cash for their health care treatments or their spouses. Making a living after 65 is a piece of cake compared to horrors of hospital bill collectors, jmo\n\n \n I agree, but medical insurance is another forum.",

   "Cut the number of federal and state enforcement personall in HALF. May sound drastic, but is not so bad when you consider the nexpt part of the proposal, which is to cut the numebr of laws and regulations in the US in HALF.

There is no nation in the world besides the US that has over 150,000,000 laws and regulations, and they seem to get by fine witht he lower numbers. There is no reason we cannot.\n \n Cut the military down to a defensive level. This will be fine since my next proposal is to stop blowing hundreds of billions per year on spreading democracy or using our military as a tool for trade negotiation. Sine the Us is pretty well protected due to the fact that we have a major ocean between us and all potential agressors, the realistic size needed for a defensive force is pretty small. figure maybe 25% of current expenditures.\n \n\n \n Those two items are 75% of the federal budget, 50% of that being military. Even 50% of that money would quickly be a big fix for SS.\n \n Most nations, including Russia, have cut their military expenditures back to \n pure defense levels, something our desperate bravado encouraged by special interests feeding gold to politicians refuses to admit. We're still attempting colonization, something England gave up in the last century as being financially unfeasible even if one was looting the natural resources.

   "I honestly agree with all that, but I can't help but wonder how in the world our life expectancy has increased, in spite of all that. Has new medical technology done it? I guess it's possible that it has. We can't afford it, but it's going to take an economic disaster to change it. \n\n \n Life expactancy has increased because of our ability to prolong life, even if we do not manage to fix the problem. At one time, you had a heart attack, you pretty much just died. Now, we can help people ho have had heart attacks, and if they were not int too bad of shape when they started, they can go on to live a fairly normal life. If they WERE in bad shape, we can still keep them alive, but with a buttload of restrictions.\n \n What causes real breakdown in aging is overall neuromuscular breakdown. This is why as you get older it gets harder to keep in good shape. Your bodies tissues simply start to deteriorate. We have no idea what causes it, though some interesting ideas have been advanced, and certainly have no idea how to treat it. YES, people live longer since we can fix most of the major organs. You cannot stop the gradual overall decay, though.\n \n \nI agree with all that, but IMO the laws and regulations are the result of a legal system that's grown too complex. Other countries may have fewer laws and regulations, but it doesn't mean they're more free, or a model for us to follow. It only takes one simple regulation to take away a lot of freedom. \n \n \n i agree with you to a point, but at the same time, I have done a LOT of world traveling, and the US is without a doubt one of the most repressive countries I have ever been in. \n \n \nAgreed - more domestic spending. But we could cut road construction regulations, save a lot of money, and still fix the potholes.\n \n We need to sell a lot of this public land, to private interests, and let THEM decide if they want to allow 4 wheelers or not. Maybe someone can enlighten me, but I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that part of the constitution that encourages the federal government to own so many thousands of square miles of land.\n\n \n I can't lay my finger on the part of the constitution that allowed them to sell it in the first place. When the US was young, there was plenty of land for everybody, more or less free for the taking. You filed your land calim and built your house. times have changed. We hold onto some public land as recreational areas, etc... so your average American who wishes to be able to spend some time out of doors without being shot as a trespasser is able to. \n \n If it makes you feel any better, the parks service turns a profit, and the federal government is not sitting on any real prime land from a commercial or agricultural standpoint.\n \n \nThe government hasn't done enough to drastically anger a large enough group yet. If the economy crashes, and 75 million people suddenly open their mailboxes and find no SS check, some cahones may appear.\n\n \n Yes, I cna see it now.

   "an interesting fact about the Social Security plan done by Bush...A similiar plan is done in Chile and has really helped their economy...this doesn't mean it will do good here but something to think about. (it is also done in the government already but im sure you heard about that)\n\n \n There is a HUGE difference between the situation in the US and that of Chile. Chile suffered (and still does) from a lack of expansion capitol. There is a big difference between an economy that is essentially just entering their industrial prime (chile) and an economy that is falling flat on its industrial butt (the US). The program in Chile added expansion capitol to the economy which businesses used to grow. Int he US, the demand for expansion capitol is FLAT. The demand is simply not there. Businesses are sitting on fairly large cash reserves (and shipping them out of the country to protect them) but the US market is largely seen as saturated, in which case there is really no point to expansion.\n \n This is mostly why we are seeing so many large scale acquisitions lately. It is the nature of corporate enterprises to grow. If they cannot grow through competitive sales, they will grow by acquiring other companies, thus increasing their market share. A lot of folks out there are claiming that this is a sign of a healthy economy. you will find, though, that historically speaking, a large increase in corporate acquisitions and mergers during a period of relatively stagnant growth, or even negative growth, is DEFINATLY not a sign of a health economy, and raising interest rates depsite flat demand for expansion capitol is definatly a sign fo a faltering or even dead economy. \n \n Besides the obvious negative effect that thes mergers have on your economy as a whole (they stifle competition), the social effects are historically pretty bad as well, since the mamoth corporate entities that emerge weild a huge amount of political power. Think Japan post WWII (even today japan really only has 6 corporations, everything else is a wholly owned subsidery of or a divions of or whatever of one of these 6 corporations). Think Fascist italy, where in the years leading up to the seizure of power by Mussolini the corporate structure in italy changed essentially from a healthy, competitive environment to one where every CEO in the nation could fit in a single gymnasium.\n \n \n \n \nAlso, many democrats say private accounts is like putting your money into Vegas...this is crazy....in Vegas the house always wins...there is no house in the stock market. You investment in ownership of companies or you can lend money (Bonds). Bonds are the less risky of the two but they yeild a lower rate of return...smaller firms have higher return than large firms. To make it simple, higher risk = higher return. if you have a portfolio of 15 stocks though you pretty much reduce your risk to low amount and you would have a high rate of return. Social Security now yields returns from government bonds which are risk free. They yield a next to nothing return. All of this to say private accounts aint that risky like they some say.\n\n \n Yes and no. To say that investing your money is no better than a gamble is definatly false, but to immediatly assume that by diversifying in todays market you remove all risk is equally false. The stock market ahs effectively been trading in a narrow band for a long time now. That generally means that what you are seeing is mostly institutional trading....big brokerage houses churning comissions for managing portfolios. We have lost over 80% of foreign investors in our stock market, which is a bad sign. It indicates that the rest of the world is seeing something that we are not (or seeing something that we are, we are just not acting on it). Barring a catastrophic event, diversification is a good strategy for protecting your assets. The problem is that there are a few catastrophic events looming on the horizon. First, there is the bursting of the housing bubble. There no longer seems to be any debate about whether we are in a housing bubble or not. The debate seems to be centered around whether it is a 2 or a 3 trillion dollar bubble. Regardless, we can not really afford to take either hits. A 2 or 3 trillion dollar correciton to the housing market will have disasterous results for the stock market. In addition, the failing of the dollar as a currency is bound to adversely effect the stock market. The dollar is dropping like a rock, and there is really no end in sight for it. Currenlty it is being bouyed by the yuan to some extent, but there is talk of re-pegging the yuan, probably to a non dollar oriented basket of currencies, which will cause further devaluation of the dollar. \n \n When you are talkign about a plan to replace or supplement social security, you MUST think long term, and frankly we are not very good at long term planning in the US. We hear people say things like \"a devaluation of the dollar is good for the economy becuase it makes our exports more competitive\". In the short term, 1 to 2 years, while you are selling off surplus stocks, this is true. Past that point, when you are faced with having to produce your product using a lower valued dollar, you have no choice but to raise prices, and you end up right back where you started, only now you have an inflationary problem. Currently importers have largely covered the drop int he dollar out of their profit margins. This is ending. Several foreign firms, including toyota, honda, and china as a whole, have announced that they have no choice but to raise prices for products headed for the US market because fo the decreased dollar.\n \n In addition (back to catastrophic events looming on the horizon), we have an almost certain switch from the petro dollar to the petro euro looming on the horizon. If that transition is made quickly, we can expect to see the value of the dollar halve overnight, since a large part of the desirability of the dollar is the fact that other nations need it to buy oil. Already Russia, Syria, Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Keny are accpeting partial payment for oil in Euros. It is only large scale producers lika cnada, Saudi Arabia and Venesuala holding out that keep the petro dollar on top (that and the fact that we showed in Iraq that we are more than willing to invade your country, kill your children, and toss your president in jail if you switch to a petro euro).",

   "First off...who said we had to buy in US markets?

Why is this? Well probably because we are \"richer\" then most other countries...if the Euro goes up then companies will move outta Europe too because it will probably get too expensive there. Fact is we aren't going to stop this unless everyone is willing to take less money and live worse off in the US.\n \n So how does the effect Social Security and private stocks. Well, I don't see how it does. There happens to always be someone that will take your money. So investing some money is not going to be hard. Also, you can invest in foreign markets...I probably wouldn't invest in Europe though :). The fact is, Social security does have a problem...so have accounts to invest is not going to cause some massive downfall. It is not all that risky either. Over the life of the stock market the average return is pretty high (somewhere in the 16% range maybe?). Also corporate Bonds are less risky less return. Another good idea. One way or another you have to either fix Social Security or end it. If you end it you will probably see an increase in securities because some people will end up putting their money into it anyway. If you raise taxes you not only **** everyone off but just end up hurting the poor. Raising taxes also would not help the economy other than take money out of it. So the way I see it, we can raise taxes or invest the money. In the end, the ecomony and everything else proves to be impossible to predict :)",

   " Social Security now yields returns from government bonds which are risk free. They yield a next to nothing return. All of this to say private accounts aint that risky like they some say.\n\n \n I suggest you take a closer look at SS funding. Current benefits are paid from current collections with any overage in payments declared 'surplus' and used for current general expenses. The 'surplus' is traded for treasury issues, which means the taxpayer has to redeem them to get paid. Either of us would go to jail for that practice, commonly known as a Ponzi Scheme; paying investors from current income. \n \n Private accounts would revert to the government if any federal social service claim is made by the account holder. Study the history of our equity markets over the past 40 years. Pay particular attention to Black Thursday and the dot.com bubble burst before making a blanket statement on the safety of equity investments and potential growth. A private account can't jump out when a market shows signs of 'adjusting'. \n \n As Daewoo stated, there is zero demand for US expansion capital. A steady 4% of all wages influx into equity markets will be carefully and easily traded out in profits like milking a big, dumb cash cow. \n \n The next time you think your government is looking out for you, consider the amount of annual debt they're putting on your back to marginally improve the lifestyle of an average Iraqi and support Israel.

   "First off...who said we had to buy in US markets? Stocks and Bonds can be purchased anywhere.\n\n \n Currently, retirement and pension funds prohibit the purhcase of foreign stocks and or bonds. In order to keep their federal bailout option open, they have to restrict purchases to US equity markets. I seriously doubt that there is going to be any change in this in a government mandated program.\n \n \n \nNaturally some of the money that was put into Chile stocks helped out however not as much as many would think. A company only gets money from stock when first released and after it is traded it is just done among others. Not only this, but the stock market has never been a (good) indicator of how the economy is doing.\n\n \n While a company only makes money through initial issue, pumping your equity markets is a good way of increasing availabilty of expansion capitol because it gets your money circulating. Sitting in a SS trust fund, that money is unavailable. Pushing your equity markets, it is available, since very little actual \"money\" is involved in equity purchases.\n \n In chile, what really helped from an expansionary viewpoint was the fact that a large number of their corporations were holding large reserves of their own stock. Also, after several stock splits, most companies green lighted new stock issues, \n \n \nAs for the corporation thing...sure we are moving into a time where we don't really have many factories and stuff produced in the US. Why is this? Well probably because we are \"richer\" then most other countries...if the Euro goes up then companies will move outta Europe too because it will probably get too expensive there. Fact is we aren't going to stop this unless everyone is willing to take less money and live worse off in the US.\n\n \n We really don't have a choice. We are going to end up taking less money and living worse off. The EU has cut its deals with eastern European and middle eastern countries for a supply of cheap labor and environmental regulation free production facilities. \n \n \nSo how does the effect Social Security and private stocks.

I suppose that some may consider that high. Personally, I gave up ont he US markets several years ago. I invest mostly in European markets now, and in euros, and generally make 7% on the exchange rate. While the EU certainly has its critics, they are long term planners, and in the end are one of the lead horses in this race.\n \n Personally, I say we pull the plug on current social security for anybody under 70, and then tell the baby boomers to get stuffed. They alreadys spent their money. If not for the fact that the SS trust fund has been continually raided over the years, there would really be no problem. So, we tell them \"sorry, no social security for you\", then take 25% of theri 401 K and IRA accounts to make up the shortfalls in the SS trust fund,and we are back on target for the next generation.\n \n Sure, this may seem a little cold hearted, but why should the younger generation care? Obviosly the last couple of generations were not thinking about OUR best interests when they turned America from the biggest creditor nation tot he biggest debtor nation on the planet. They just said \"we will pass it on to our kids\", and they were fine with that. Let them starve to death in the street.

I recently was driving past the country home of a prominent politician and noted some interesting new landscaping going in. Namely, a series of berms. Now, I was not born yesterday, and I have seen enough military fortification plans to know firing positions when I see them, regardless of how many pretty flowers you plant on them. \n \n They were putting in a good configuration. Clear field of fire from all positions, U shaped berms to provide maximum protection for your rifleman, and a series of wedge shaped \"planting beds\" in front which will slow vehicular traffic while still providing no cover for advancing forces. They were even diverting a stream to surround the entire house (and you thought moats were out of style).\n \n When nutjobs with wild beards who are constantly babbling about the biblical implications of segregation build fortified compounds, it is easy to ignore. I have a little mroe trouble ignoring it when a guy who was once considered front runner for the position of president is doing the same. \n \n Regardless of the system we adopt, the current system of social entitlements in this country WILL come to an end. There is no choice. We are running out of money and cannot afford to pay for them, and the rest of the world is no longer willing to pick up the tab (check the results of the last few treasury offerings if you doubt this....we have not moved a complete treasury issue for several years).\n \n We COULD do some long term planning to lessen the blow, but that is not thew American way. We will instead continue to plan in 6 month cycles.",

If you take a look at most of the Bush administrations comments on the subject, you may note that they plan to borrow a couple trillion dollars to solve the solvency issue in the short term.

It looked serious. We're back to the same circumstances that constitute a major portion of our problems, irresponsible government spending. While our trade imbalance alone would allow a cushioned decline of national wealth, slowly reducing the standard of living, SS withholding \n 'surplus' is a major revenue stream being diverted to service national debt while equally irresponsible foreign policy consumes a declining tax base with rapidly expanding military and war expenditures resulting in deficits that accelerate the demise of the USD. We're in a lose/lose situation.\n \n In a declining economy with no potential recovery factors, individual retirement contribution to drive equity markets tied to an economic decline is not a solution. Young people will be ******* their money down a rat hole to drive GNP on a temporary, politically motivated basis and still end up without a viable retirement program.\n \n An easy solution is to modify the existing program with realistic actuary tables, extend the working age, chop the COLAs to where it again becomes self-supporting and increase withholding taxes on the worker side. But for that to work, withholding would have to be isolated and a third party like the Swiss gnomes responsible for it. US politicians are well proven to be far too corrupt to provide responsible management of public funds.\n \n Every nation depends on its youth for the future. In our case, the current generation is dealing our youth a hand with no possible chance of winning. Yet our youth remains apathetic, seemingly content with our vast political corruption, making no effort to influence anything but consumer markets.
