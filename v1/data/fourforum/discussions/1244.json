   "While reading through the U.S. Imperialism thread again I began to realize how many people actually think the US is imperialistic. Even I think that the US is imperialistic in how they attempt to gain influence through economics and politics. However the US government we out of it's way to declare that the invasions in Afghanistan an Iraq would be to collapse the government there and reinstate a new government for the people. That was hardly imperialistic of the US as most old empires would have kept their new conquests for themselves instead of spending money to rebuild them and set them free again. The US has even made a point of not making enough money off of these countries to pay off their own expenses due to the wars which isn't imperialistic. Still most of the world views these two wars, especially the Iraqi one, as being done to benefit the US and their imperialistic ways. So in my view the US is being imperialistic while trying to cover it up while the rest of the world sees right through them anyways. My conclusion would be that the US should stop this act of trying to avoid appearing imperialistic and simply embrace it if they truly want to. Nothing will really change after this since everyone already knows the US's intention to gain more power and control in the world. All that will change is that the US will have the ability to take countries for themselves, make money off them if they wish, and control the resources of the countries in the future.\n \n Logically I can't understand why the US tries to cover their imperialistic tendancies up to the point that they are avoiding making money back for their conquests when the opportunity to do so is there for the taking. Everyone already knows that the US is going to profit off the Iraqi oil in order to pay off some of it's own war debts but it is going to do it behind the scene so as to appear honest. This tactic doesn't fool anyone so if the US was just to come out and say that they were going to sell Iraqi oil to pay off the war debts it would come as a surprise to no one. So does it make any sense to cover up this activity to the world when everyone already knows it is going on? Only if the US wants to try and avoid appearing imperialistic while the rest of the world knows they are.\n \n I'm not saying that the US should go off and begin conquering the world. What I am saying is that if they spend money in Iraq to win a war then we should be able to openly use their resources to pay off our war debts instead of doing it behind the scenes. If the Iraqis begin to get too out of hand and some 'activists' get caught then we should be able to try and convict individuals of that nation for their crimes against us as the US's does control Iraq at this time anyways. The US should be able to hold Iraq as our own for as long as we wish and not have to deal with the UN trying to dictate what we do with Iraq or tell us when they should leave Iraq. The US should officially be able to tell the world that they have taken Iraq and from this day forward it is up to us what happens to them. Not the UN, not the Iraqi activists, not Osama. It is our decision to make. This is not to say that our decision would be to take complete control of this oil filled desert but if they wish to it we should have that choice especially since it really should not surprise everyone that they are being imperialistic for doing such.",

You seem to have missed that too. The USA tends to control foreign affairs through economics and the use of local bully-boys. Whereas the Brits would actually have British army units all over the world in each of their colonies, the USA has rationalised this, and allowed their puppets to have their own armies.
