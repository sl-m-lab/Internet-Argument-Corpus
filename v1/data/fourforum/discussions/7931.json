I doubt it, since those are lost all the time and not all of them grow into a baby. But since I believe (From a Christian perspective) that life begins at conceptions, I believe the soul is there from that moment on. \n \n I also still believe that a body has to be completely dead to have the soul leave. I've heard of a man who was in a coma for 28 years (supposed to be brain dead by this period by many opinions) and woke up later. His soul didn't leave the body and then come back just because his body was dormant. It just wasn't dead, so the soul did not leave.",

   "I was under the impression that conception and fertilisation are the same thing, or at least that conception was a slightly vaguer term that avoided getting into biological unpleasantness (like quickening etc) that had just been more widely accepted to mean fertilisation/implantation. Correct me if I'm wrong though.\n \n For these sort of things, I would certainly be tempted to trust science over religious traditions - as we see by genesis vs evolution and the big bang, when it comes to making physical claims about the world and the processes in it, most holy books are still firmly grounded in a bronze age of how the world works regardless of how enlightened and well thought aspects of philosophy may be.\n \n As for the coma example, I'd really have to have a look at the case in question to really form an opinion - I can think of a variety of potential issues (like the man being declared brain dead when put on life support, I don't know how the technology for detecting brain activity has changed over the past 30 or so years). But anyway, souls are pretty complicated anyway and something that seem to have been more or less avoided when it comes to the details of quite how they work, for example if a soul is really a spiritual representation of your mind in another holy/mental/empyrean realm then perhaps you can have souls entering/leaving or at least appearing and disappearing as people enter comas or are developing in the womb.
