   "But you did include evolution in your definition of evolism. You said, \"man evolved from \"lesser\" primates, which evolved from prehistoric mammals over millions of years.\" That's evolution, isn't it?\n \n But there are three (at least) different meanings for the word \"evolution\" as used by evolutionary scientists. Creationists have a different meaning or meanings.\n \n First, there is the definition of evolution. That is what you gave. It is not a statement of theory or an explanation of observations. It is a statement of what observable events are to be considered evolutionary. The definition you got from T.O. is good. Here's what I learned it was many years ago. Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time. What I said and what T.O. said are the same - we just used different words.\n \n Since we are into defining things I'll define my terms too. I won't presume how much knowlege of biology anyone has although I presume that Mr. Jack is well informed and you seem to have done some reading at T.O. But there might be others.\n \n an allele is one of two or more alternate forms of a gene. Eye color is an example of alleles. Blood types is another. There are between 30 to 40 thousand genes in the human genome. This was a great surprise to geneticists. They had estimated many more. There are an average of 14 alleles for every gene - some good, some bad, and some don't matter much.\n \n By frequency I mean relative proportion. It can be stated as a percentage of the population that has that allele. Everyone has two alleles for any given gene - they may be the same or they may be different.\n \n Notice that it is a population that evolves, not individuals. A population is a group of interbreeding organisms.\n \n And finally, the time I speak of involves reproduction. As I said, individuals don't evolve. There must be reproduction and the genes must be passed on the the next generation.\n \n Second, when events that fit the above definition are observed, we say that we have observed evolution. The change in color from light to dark and back again of the peppered moth observed in England over the last 150 years is evolution. Notice that there is no goal, no sense of progress, no getting better and better.\n \n Finally, there are the explanations for why evolution happens - the theories and hypotheses. There are lots of theories and hypotheses of evolution. The major theories have been around for so long and have been to thoroughly tested that they aren't questioned any more.\n \n And I don't believe any of it.",

Those who see science as an attack on their religion must see the weakness of their own dogma. \n I don't understand the question.\n\n \n \n \n That's the thing; it is not the fact man is special. It is part of literalism. Pastor Russell (the \"founder\") was a person that wandered in and out of various religions even unnamed \"oriental\" ones. He detested the churches illogical dogmas (like a loving good God making a hell) and liked science. This inertia has always remained. So if JWs are stuck with siding with the church or science and the bible is remotely vague; which happens more then you would think. You know which one we'll pick.\n \n \n Creator chap. 6 pp. 98-99 An Ancient Creation Record-Can You Trust It?\n \n What a climax it was when God assembled some of the elements of the earth to form his first human son, whom he named Adam! (Luke 3:38) The historical account tells us that the Creator of the globe and life on it put the man he had made in a gardenlike area \"to cultivate it and to take care of it.\" (Genesis 2:15) At that time the Creator may still have been producing new animal kinds. The Bible says: \"God was forming from the ground every wild beast of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call it, each living soul, that was its name.\" (Genesis 2:19)\n \n Note it says, \"climax... Adam\" then says \"still have been producing new animal kinds\". Obviously must have been a brief climax. Since we don't comment on what we think God actually did, put billions of years before Adam, and then open the other end for more animals after him. This actually fits the fossil record, and what ever else. No scientist can argue other wise. We barely define a \"kind\", those could be allele in a population (in 15 years the next Creator book replacement will probably go down those lines while still denouncing evolution). JW's are a population it evolves too. As older members that write the watchtower leave due to old age or death newer ones (still old people) take their place and it gets even farther from Russelism/christiandom. Unique teachings are forgoten like 47000 years of creation a or apologetic ones like the cross/crown, and are replaced by generalism and more science.\n \n The only thing remotely mystical is forming man out of dust since we believe in materialization (Gods mystical version of the replicator on star trek) then that makes sense too. Since we don't believe in a \"soul\" then there is nothing else important in the genesis account of creation in the JW faith. Since we belief God created the Angels (those other elohim) long before the earth I can't see why it still hangs on to all those \"mankind is special\" disclaimers, but I assume it is to avoid backlash.\n \n As for Adam and Eve she is obviously Adam's female clone. Made from 2 cells of his cells \"the extra X chromosome\" came from one of the donor cells and the Y was removed. If this did not happen the story makes no sense, for no other animal female was made from a tissue sample. I got this idea from some cloning page that said cloning would allow homosexual men to have male or female children.\n \n My question if you break it down. Take the all of species there ever was. Now spread them out chronologically/geographically in a way remotely resembling the fossil record. Then repeat the magic words \"and God created each according to its kind\". How in heck can I tell if that's evolution or not? What are the differences if God hand painted the dots on the first ladybug vs. some random beetle egg gets hit with a free radical and the coloration gene breaks down? \n \n Also when God \"created\" these animals do YEC think they all fell out of the sky at once? What did they eat with out an ecosystem to fuel reproduction of the next generation?",

   "I know it may sound odd but what is the fate of evolution/creation debates in the future. Like all science once things leave the theoretical and become a technology people begin to treat them as mundane happenstance. I notice the watchtower for one just criticizes bad science (rightly so) while steadily being more non-specific and often ceases to comment. Pastor Russell was most famous for his photodrama of creation showing history, science, and the bible all agree. \n \n The thing is I don't see why God needs to use any magic to do anything he is God. There is no reason for him to have to blue print anything. The only thing different from evolution is God has a specific purpose an objective.\n \n Also note most gods in nature worship control the actual environment. The God of the Old Testament made claim that he could control the environment too. Some never account for the fact that God did claim to control the formation of the earth. So how could you tell if God used the planet to shape the creatures?\n \n Long ago Darwin's book origin of the species caused conflict. Some idiot felt genesis actually explained creation. When genesis actually told you what people already knew things where created (or that things existed). I can't find any explanation for anything in Genesis. Unless I am mistaken it is just a few pages of God saying create things, and then them existing. How did anyone actually put this into the realm of science explaining anything?",

Since it is a singularity you can't scientifically analyzed or explain it with current theories. Now what can you argue about? The only thing left is change. If the universe was created 6k years ago there is no time for change on a cosmic scale all that hydrogen can't burn into heavier elements. So the big bang can't happen. I know the universe is much older so it does not conflict with anything.\n \n Primeval pool an unknown liquid that can cause chemicals to congeal to living things. It is unknown. That does not conflict with anything. Genesis 1:20 \"Let the water teem with living creatures...\"\n \n 'ape--<man' evolution this does not conflict with Genesis. In science Adam and Eve do not exist as real people. In Genesis man is produced from elements in the ground just like an automobile. The evolution of apes to man is not addressed. I can say Adam did not evolve since he had no biological parents. The homonids are not related to him by heredity (the actual DNA is a different matter). Was there homo sapiens before Adam? I have no idea. Having a soul means nothing to me so it is not like they would be \"lower\" if they existed.\n \n The debate left is did modern day humans descend from Adam or a prehistoric homo- sapien population? No idea but that would solve the fundy problem of where Cain got his wife from (j/k). The bible talks of sons of God mixing with Adams offspring making hybrids. I have not comment on what that also cloud mean, but a homo-sapien Neanderthal little girl has been found, but it is debated. Neanderthal are also stronger than humansif they are the actual nephlim is unknown. Considering many \"smart\" homonids went extinct Adams offspring could have caused this for there were supposed to live around the same time. The Genesis gives no comment unless you decide to put words in God's mouth.",
