   "By Heather Ratcliffe\n ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH\n 11/01/2008\n \n A woman who was raped in her Cape Girardeau, Mo., home last weekend shot and fatally wounded the attacker when he broke in again early Friday morning, officials said.\n \n Prosecuting Attorney H. Morley Swingle said no charges would be filed against the woman, 57, who shot (1.) Ronnie W. Preyer, 47, a registered sex offender, in the chest with a shotgun.\n \n Officials said she did not know him.\n \n (2.) At about midnight Oct. 25, she heard glass break in her basement and was grabbed by a man as she tried to flee out the front door. He punched her in the face, forced her into a bedroom and raped her, Swingle said. \n \n She reported the crime to police, and her landlord repaired the window.\n \n On Friday, she was home alone, watching TV about 2:15 a.m. when (3.) a man broke the same basement window and switched off the electricity to the house, Swingle said.\n \n (4.) She tried to call 911 but couldn't with the power off. So she got a shotgun and waited as the man began banging on a door from the basement. She fired when he came crashing through the door.\n \n After she fled to a neighbor's home to call police, officers found Preyer, badly wounded, stumbling away. He died at St. Francis Medical Center several hours later. \n \n (5.) Swingle said the victim identified Preyer from photos as her previous attacker. When he was shot, Preyer, of Jackson, Mo., had wet caulking on his clothing from the recently repaired basement window.\n \n (6.) Preyer had been convicted in New Madrid, Mo., in 1989 of rape and robbery and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was convicted in 2006 of failing to register as a sex offender, and earlier this year of misdemeanor assault.\n \n Said Swingle, \"(7.) I will not be filing any sort of charge against this ... woman, who was clearly justified under the law in shooting this intruder in her home.\"\n STLtoday - Cape woman shoots man who raped her\n \n\n \n 1. Apparently he was a registered sex offender. \n \n 2. See what can happen when you try to run? She didn't get grabbed, punched, forced to the bathroom, and raped the second time. So being that she tried both ways, which worked better? \n \n 3. Broke the same window, and shut off the electricity. First off, breaking the window and climbing in is good enough for me, but killing the power? Why would someone cut the power? Perhaps he intended serious harm to someone? Like rape, or murder? \n \n 4. No power = no phone. So she couldn't call for help. Let's see, can't call for help, trying to run last time got you raped...what would you do? \n \n 5. Identified him as her previous attacker. Her previous rape was reported to the police, but apparently they had not caught him yet, hence why he was still out on the street free to victimize people. \n \n 6. Previously convicted of rape, robbery, failure to register, and assault. Obviously someone with a habit of victimizing people. She may have saved others from being raped or killed by shooting him.\n \n 7. No charges, because she was \"clearly justified under the law\". And that comes from a Prosecuting Attorney, who clearly knows the law better than Penfold and Brady. \n \n This is a clear cut case of why one should have the absolute right to defend themselves in their homes against inturders that they feel pose a threat. Penfold and Brady can scoff all they want, but reasonable people realize that this was completely justified. She acted within her rights, she acted within the law, and this repeat offender will never rape anyone again. Kudos to this woman, and shame on the XXXXXX that would condemn what she did.",

   "Where am I defending him? I state a fact. He is ALLEGED to have done these things, It has not been proven. Fact. He will never have his day in court. Fact.\n\n \n Fact. You don't ever read anything present in the argument. Fact. All of the evidence pointing to him actually doing what he was accused of. He had wet calking on his shirt from crawling in through the new, broken window. And I'm willing to bet that his fingerprints are all over the basement, and his shoe print is on the basement door that he kicked down.\n \n What's it going to take for you to believe that this man was as guilty as sin? A handwritten, signed and notarized confession of how he raped a 57 year old woman and then went back five days later to do it again?\n \n \nThe alleged attacker's label was attached in 1989, when he commenced serving ten years for his crime. He doesn't exactly make a habit of it, does he? Whatever happened to paying one's debt to society?\n\n \n Fact. Once you become a sex offender you remain a sex offender for life, no exceptions. That's a title that will follow you to your grave.\n \n Or maybe you don't like that, maybe you believe that once somebody does their sentence, or only serves months on the year, that they should no longer be considered felons? Are you in favor of people having their firearms returned after doing ten years in a federal prison for mass murder?\n \n \nThe alleged victim's claims have not and never will be proven true or otherwise, so they remain allegations. The fact that she extrajudicially took the life of another is not denied but applauded!\n\n \n So even the word of a prosecuting attorney isn't good enough for you? What exactly is good enough for you? Would the Pope saying that she did no wrong convince you that she's the innocent party? Or maybe you're one of these \"Damn all the evidence to the contrary, what I say is right and you're retarded to question me\" people?\n \n \nWas she attacked? Did she murder him and concoct this tale to get away with it? Who knows? Not me or you. All we have is her story, and a body.\n\n \n And a mountain of evidence against him. She identified him as her attacker, there was his DNA evidence on record and on her from the first time he attacked her, calking on his shirt, and likely his prints all over the basement. What more do you need? The people who investigate these incidents decided that she was in the right, why isn't that good enough for you?

I just spent a few minutes looking, and the numbers or defensive gun uses ranged anywhere from 80k - 2.5 million every year. I would not wager a guess which was correct, probably somewhere in between. And define \"innocent victim\". You mean like the victim of a criminal with a gun, or a victim of accidental shooting. There is a big difference, and it means a lot when compiling statistics. A gangbanger killed in a shootout with another gangbanger can be called an \"innocent victim\", it just depends on who is compiling the stats. \n \n I work in a very violent urban area. I see gun crime all the time. The majority of the shootings and gun related deaths I see are drug related shootings and turf wars between violent gangs. I have probably been to about 40 shootings in the last 4 years while I was working, and I can only recall 3 cases where the victims were innocent people minding their own business. Probably close to 20 involved gang members shooting other gang members, and the rest were drug related.

   "I finally broke down and watched the TV coverage video.\n \n I don't know what the punishment is in Missouri for the crimes mentioned in the video. In Virginia home invasion burglary carries a possible 20 year maximum sentence. If the burglar is armed with any deadly weapon (knife, crowbar, gun, etc) then the sentence range is not less than 20 years up to life imprisonment. Rape is punished by not less than 5 years up to life imprisonment. None of this permits the state to seek capital punishment for the man's crimes unless a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing occurs during or just after the rape or attempted rape. Additionally, SCOTUS has decreed capital punishment cannot be sought by any state absent a murder. \n \n But the law of self-defense does not limit the use of deadly force in self-defense to situations in which the state could seek the death penalty for the aggressor. The use of deadly force requires that the person using deadly force reasonably fear that they are being threatened with death or great bodily harm. In Virginia rape is considered a \"serious bodily injury\"-the threat of which justifies the use of deadly force to prevent it. In addition, the woman could reasonably have feared that the attacker might kill her this time. In Virginia the Castle Doctrine would also justify the use of deadly force to prevent a burglary of your home. Nothing requires the homeowner to first ask the burglar what his intention is before responding to the threat.\n \n The fact that she first armed herself before the second burglary, and that she took the shotgun with her to confront the break-in would be irrelevant in Virginia, given the following jury instruction:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY that when a person reasonably apprehends that another intends to attack him for the purpose of doing him serious bodily harm, then such person has the right to arm himself for his own necessary self defense and if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an attack will be made upon him then no inference of malice can be drawn from the fact of such preparation.\n \n I don't know what the law of self-defense is where the crime happened, but I would have made the same decline to prosecute the woman decision if it happened in my jurisdiction. In Virginia her actions would have been justified legally, and in my personal opinion morally.\n \n As an aside, though, I would not have revealed the alleged rapists NCIC record. That was the document the prosecutor was highlighting, quoting from, and allowing to be filmed. NCIC records are very confidential restricted access documents. If I wanted to reveal what the man's prior convictions were, then I could do so but only after I had sent off for copies of the actual conviction/sentencing court records. Those I could reveal because they are public records. In Virginia, it would be a crime for me to reveal the restricted NCIC record history sheets to the media as was done in the video. Apparently it is not a problem in Missouri.... \n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)",

That's why she won't be arrested for it....and there are at least two reasons I am happy for his death. He'll never do it again and there won't be a sleazy lawyer filing suit against the lady for wounding the sleazy rapist. This is the type of case that all you ACLU-supporting fanatics shine a bad light on. The man's rights were not violated. He was simply killed in the act of attempting to violate the lady's rights. Too frickin' bad! That's a bit of bad luck for him and a bit of good luck for her....and the good life goes on. It reminds of the time two robbers held up a Mom and Pop store and both of them were shot to death...right there. Mom and Pop are fine...still minding their little corner grocery store. Three cheers for perp death.\n \n \nNo answer, no suprise. While I'm not as familiar with Penfold, I have found that it is nearly impossible to get Brady to answer a direct question. In Brady's case its fear, unsure about Penfold.\nThose that jump to the defense of criminals that are killed by their intended victims generally have no answer for questions such as yours.

   "Oh, no - like I said, I'm not particularly concerned with the circumstances surrounding Ethmi's claim. I was just objecting to the line \"She is right until proven wrong.

Anecdotal evidence on it's own does not stand up in a court of law - all that you've provided so far is evidence that a she reported that he'd raped her - not evidence that the rape actually occurred.\n \n Disclaimer: In all possibility she was raped, I haven't looked into the story - I'm just being pernickety, partly because Ryuuichi's post was all too agressive for it's own good and partly because I'm like that anyway. Feel free to ignore it :p.\n \n EDIT: Ethmi posted while I was a-typing. This post pretty much covers my response to him already, I just thought I'd reiterate for his sake. \n \n I don't sympathise with the attacker and I don't have a particular case against the woman's actions, simply because I don't know enough about the circumstances.

The way it works in this country is innocent until proven guilty. He was not convicted in a court of law for these alleged crimes, so technically in a legal sense he is innocent of them.

   "I'm going to get back into this discussion....\n \n If the man had been indicted and forced to go to trial for the alleged prior rape, then he would have had every right to be presumed innocent; to have a trial by jury if desired; to have jurors hear his case who have not been biased by comments made to the press (similar to those comments made by reckless politicians like Nifong in the Duke rape case, or, more recently, by Mayor Bloomberg about Plaxico Burress); to be represented by competent legal counsel; to review the state's evidence, including forensic testing, if any, for exculpatory information; to be present at the trial and confront and cross-examine the victim and other witnesses against him; and to the requirement that he must be found not guilty of rape unless and until the judge or jury concludes at the end of the trial the state had proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Every person, no matter how guilty they truly are, is entitled to these rights in my country. \n \n But these rights can be forfeited by your own actions, and he was not killed because of a prior rape. \n \n Even if we assume he had raped her previously and she was certain of this, then the victim would have had no right to shoot him because of the prior rape. If, for example, the victim chased him down in a parking lot and shot him for what had happened to her previously, then this would not be legitimate self-defense. This would be \"summary justice.\" It would be an act of revenge-taking the law into her own hands-and thereby denying the person the rights outlined above. It would, in short, be murder-imposed by a vigilante for a crime that if convicted of the jury could not have recommend death as a possible punishment.\n \n But he was not killed because of a prior rape. \n \n Based upon the information we have she claimed she shot him because he was breaking through her door with the evident intent to kill her or cause her great bodily harm. \n \n She could be lying about how it happened-it would not be the first time someone killed a person and then fraudulently claimed the right of self-defense. For example, how many of you have heard someone suggest this or something similar: \"If you shoot the burglar outside while running off with your TV then drag him inside or drag him and drape him coming in through the window.\" Don't ever follow this advice. It's murder to begin with-for you have no right to kill just to recover property. And when the medical examiner reports finding tiny post-mortem scratches on his face and dirt up his nose then we will know you shot him outside and dragged him face down through the flower bed back into the house. And if you claim he came at me with a knife, and we discover the knife found lying at his feet matches the knives in your kitchen drawer, and when tested we find only your prints on the knife, then we know you planted the knife and are lying about it. This is what law enforcement does at violent crime scenes. If you ever kill someone and claim self-defense then they will take your story and compare it to all the evidence they see and collect to determine if the evidence backs up what you say. In my experience this happens at every violent crime scene, because when LE reviews the case with the prosecutor he/she will ask things like: Do the photographs of the scene showing damage to the door, how the body was found, etc, corroborate what she says-Does the medical examiner's report of the trajectory of the pellets as they traveled through the body corroborate what she says-Has the lab tested the gun to see if her claim of distance from the man when she shot is corroborated, etc. \n \n We only know what has been released to the public. But from this we have nothing to suggest that any piece of evidence recovered by the police casts doubt on the victim's version of events. \n \n All we know is this: The victim claims she was in her own home; that she was alone; that she suffered a sudden and violent home invasion and reasonably believed the intruder intended to attack her; that based upon how it happened she had a reasonable belief that the attacker intended to kill her or cause her great bodily harm; and that nothing has come to light which would cast doubt on this version of events. Based upon this alone she had the right to use deadly force against him whether or not a prior rape had actually occurred. The added factor of a claimed prior rape is immaterial to whether she had a right to defend herself. It only comes into consideration because we always view self-defense from the standpoint of the person claiming to have exercised the right. In that context the prior rape event acts to further bolster her belief that she was about to suffer another violent attack.\n \n Based upon what we know, this man was not killed because he is a \"criminal\" with a lengthy record. There is no evidence to suggest it was a revenge killing because of the prior rape. This is not a murder. It is a justifiable homicide. This man was killed because he chose to act on that day in a manner that authorized her to take his life. He was killed because he violently invaded a woman's home in a manner that caused her to shoot out of fear for her own life. \n \n Her actions do not amount to \"summary justice.\" There is no anger, hatred, or revenge motive at work here. She acted out of a good faith belief that shooting was necessary to protect her life.\n \n All the rights I outlined earlier work to protect this man from the government. He voluntarily forfeited the protection of those rights by his actions. He could not, for example, shout in between kicks at the door \"The law says I'm presumed innocent of any crime I am committing against you and I can't be punished until a jury finds me guilty\" and expect this to shield him from a shotgun blast. The victim is not required to here this, put the gun down, and answer \"Then I will not defend myself, and if you rape me and kill me then I hope they catch you, find you guilty, and punish you after my funeral.\"\n \n In my opinion her actions are justified both legally and morally. \n \n I have dealt with how this man forfeited his right to have the presumption of innocence trump her right of self-defense. Now let me ask this question of those who still believe he had a claim to a presumption of innocence and who also suggest her shooting him was an act of \"summary justice\":\n \n How do you square not extending the same presumption of innocence to her actions?",

Morley Swingle said no charges would be filed against the woman, 57, who shot Ronnie W. Preyer, 47, a registered sex offender, in the chest with a shotgun.\n \n Officials said she did not know him.\n \n At about midnight Oct. 25, she heard glass break in her basement and was grabbed by a man as she tried to flee out the front door. He punched her in the face, forced her into a bedroom and raped her, Swingle said.\n \n She reported the crime to police, and her landlord repaired the window.\n \n On Friday, she was home alone, watching TV about 2:15 a.m. when a man broke the same basement window and switched off the electricity to the house, Swingle said.\n \n She tried to call 911 but couldn't with the power off. So she got a shotgun and waited as the man began banging on a door from the basement. She fired when he came crashing through the door.\n \n After she fled to a neighbor's home to call police, officers found Preyer, badly wounded, stumbling away. He died at St. Francis Medical Center several hours later.\n \n Swingle said the victim identified Preyer from photos as her previous attacker. When he was shot, Preyer, of Jackson, Mo., had wet caulking on his clothing from the recently repaired basement window.\n \n Preyer had been convicted in New Madrid, Mo., in 1989 of rape and robbery and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was convicted in 2006 of failing to register as a sex offender, and earlier this year of misdemeanor assault.\n \n Said Swingle, \"I will not be filing any sort of charge against this ... woman, who was clearly justified under the law in shooting this intruder in her home.\"\n",

   "Your thoughtful response is plausible, but depends itself on several presumptions.\n \n The absence of evidence that she is lying (in circumstances which in your experience lying is not unheard of) is not proof that she is telling the truth, let alone the whole truth.\n \n All we have is a dead man and the killer's version of the events leading up to his death. A killer who claimed to previously have been raped by the dead man. If the his killer believed this to be so, how do you then conclude with certainty that he could not have been killed in anger, hatred or revenge?\n \n I will admit that my reaction to the gleeful onesided \"score one for the good guys\" attitude in the early posts may have coloured my attitude to her entitlement to her presumption of innocence, but in my defence I would say that only one person died in all of this, and there are a myriad of unanswered questions surrounding that death, which some here are all too willing to give a free pass to the witness/perpetrator..\n\n \n My presumptions are that I do not presume to second guess the investigation of this event. But I do not suggest the case is closed. I offered my opinions based upon the facts as we know them. I have never been involved in a case in which the press was given access to all the facts, the photographs, the witness statements, the lab testing results, the autopsy reports, etc. And nether is this case one of them. We do not know what else is out there to corroborate what the victim says. All we know is that the prosecutor has reviewed the evidence he had and concluded that her version is truthful and un-contradicted by other known facts. Several years ago I was involved in a case in which a deceased woman was found in her home surrounded by empty pill bottles. The initial on scene officer thought it must be a suicide. That all changed when the medical examiner reported she died of manual strangulation, that he observed visible signs of blunt force trauma to her vaginal vault, and that her rapist had also broken her hyoid bone while strangling her. Initial opinions can change when new facts arise which force them to, but until any are announced in this case I see no reason to second guess the facts as we know them, or the judgment of law enforcement officials who possess far more facts than we do. \n \n Likewise, based upon what we know there is no proof that she acted with malice-that she acted out of anger, hatred, or revenge. To quote the relevant portions of the Virginia jury instruction: \n \n Malice is that state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason. Malice may result from any unlawful or unjustifiable motive including anger, hatred or revenge....\n \n But the instruction also goes on to read, in relevant part:\n \n Heat of passion excludes malice when that heat of passion arises from provocation that reasonably produces an emotional state of mind such as...terror or fear....\n \n Based upon what we know, his actions reasonably would have created a state of mind causing the woman to act out of terror or fear. That is a classic case of heat of passion. \n \n Legitimate self defense is considered a \"legal excuse or justification,\" and as long as her actions were within the range of permitted self defense then we have a justifiable, non-criminal homicide. \n \n But let's speculate for a moment and conclude that we could prove-beyond a reasonable doubt-that she could not have reasonably feared suffering death or great bodily injury. Her heat of passion claim would remain, but her self defense claim would fail for using excessive force. In that circumstance her actions would become voluntary manslaughter, where the necessary element of murder-malice-is still excluded because his actions provoked both her fear and response. But as I said earlier I believe she acted within the bounds of legitimate self-defense, and I offer this speculative manslaughter scenario only as an illustration of how the element of malice and its component motives like anger are considered. \n \n In my opinion, based upon what we know, his actions provoked reasonable fear in her to legally exclude the element of malice, and his actions also gave her a reasonable belief that he was threatening her with death or great bodily harm which justified her act of shooting him.",

   "The latest on the case.\n \n seMissourian.com: Story: Cape woman shoots, kills rapist in her home\n \n \nBefore shooting and killing her rapist early Friday morning, a Cape Girardeau woman had never fired a shotgun in her life.\n \n Though the woman, whose name has been withheld, lived alone, she'd always felt safe in her neighborhood, where she'd lived for the past four years.\n \n When Ronnie W. Preyer, a registered sex offender who was about to be charged with assaulting her a week earlier, broke into her home shortly after 2 a.m. Friday, she said a calm settled over her as she shot him in the chest before running to a neighbor's to get help.\n \n Preyer, 47, of Cape Girardeau was pronounced dead a few hours later at Saint Francis Medical Center.\n \n A dark bruise still marring the side of her face, the rape victim described the previous assault. She had been watching TV around midnight Oct. 25 when she heard a crash. She knew her basement door, leading up to her kitchen, was unlocked, and the noise had come from the basement.\n \n Realizing an intruder had broken into the house, she made a beeline for the back door, but Preyer was waiting for her.\n \n \"You fight, you try to think of all the things you can do, but it's happening so fast,\" she said.\n \n Though she did put up a fight, Preyer punched her - twice, she thinks. At first, she couldn't believe it was really happening and feared someone was playing a horrible joke.\n \n He told her \"Don't tell anybody. I know where you live,\" she said.\n \n The woman sat quietly for several hours before deciding she needed to notify the police.\n \n \"I wasn't going to tell, but the more I thought about it, the worse I felt,\" she said.\n \n Landlord bought gun\n \n She told her daughter and her landlord what happened, and her landlord repaired the window, added security devices to all the doors and, in a gesture that may have saved her life, purchased a shotgun for her.\n \n \"I've never shot a shotgun before,\" she said.\n \n Her landlord instructed her on how to load the firearm, and she kept it near her for a week.\n \n Meanwhile, Cape Girardeau police began investigating the rape and made frequent rounds past her residence to check on things.\n \n On Friday morning, about two hours after an officer had checked on her, she was still awake.\n \n \"You can't sleep. You can't do anything. You're just listening,\" she said.\n \n When the lights went out, her first thought was that she remembered having paid her electric bill.\n \n \"I knew something wasn't right,\" she said.\n \n She got her gun.\n \n Growing nervous, she opened the blinds, sat down in a chair and waited.\n \n She's sure she must have prayed.\n \n When she heard a pop from behind the basement door, she knew.\n \n Standing several feet away in the tiny kitchen, she held up the gun as Preyer crashed through the door into the room. She fired. Though people warned her the firearm would kick quite a bit the first few times she fired it, she said she didn't feel a thing.\n \n \"I just saw some sparks come out of the gun,\" she said.\n \n Preyer fell, and she fled to a neighbor's, using the door farthest away from him to make her escape. She screamed for help, her neighbor took the gun from her and they called the police, she said.\n \n \"That was my moment of hysteria,\" she said.\n \n Police arrived in less than a minute, for which she was grateful.\n \n They told her she'd done the right thing, that they believed he may have intended to kill her, she said. \"It makes you feel sick almost, to think someone would want to kill you,\" she said.\n \n The woman went to the police station and identified Preyer, who had been transported to the hospital, as the man who raped her Oct. 25 and the man who broke into her home Friday.\n \n About to be charged\n \n Cape Girardeau County Prosecuting Attorney Morley Swingle was in the process of charging Preyer with attempted rape, rape, burglary and attempted burglary when he learned Preyer died at the hospital, around 9:30 a.m.\n \n \"It is clear that under Missouri's self-defense law the woman was justified in using deadly force upon the intruder in her home because he was in the process of burglarizing her home when she shot him,\" Swingle wrote in a letter to police chief Carl Kinnison.\n \n The woman said she keeps seeing the image of Preyer crashing through her basement door.\n \n \"I'm glad I had something to protect me. When your life is in danger, you just do what you have to, you don't think,\" she said. \"It's you or them.\"\n \n Preyer's criminal history is speckled with home invasions and assaults, and he was convicted of failing to inform the county of his change of address in compliance with registered sex offender laws.\n \n Preyer was convicted in 1989 of raping and robbing a woman in New Madrid County. He served 15 years in prison on both charges.\n \n December case\n \n He was also arrested last December and charged with attempted rape and second-degree felony assault. Swingle said his office dismissed the rape charge because he did not think he could get a conviction. Preyer was convicted on the assault charge and served 128 days in jail.\n \n The victim in that case, a woman in her early 30s who knew of his sex offender status, allegedly went for a drive with Preyer. He attacked her while in the car. She fought back, and he began punching her in the head and face, she told Jackson police.\n \n After talking with the victim in that case, Swingle decided to dismiss the charges because the woman did not use a nearby phone to call for help and because she went with Preyer \"for something to do,\" even though he was a sex offender, he said.\n \n She also admitted to drinking a 12-pack of Budweiser prior to the assault, Swingle said.\n \n \"We know in at least one case, he did a good job of picking his victim. This time, he didn't do such a good job,\" Swingle said.\n",
