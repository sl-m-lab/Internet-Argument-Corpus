   "What a rambling collection of unmitigated lies and distortions of historical reality. You prove that you either have no first hand understanding of the realities in Israel or you just don't care about them and are more interested in promoting palestinian propaganda. You say this about Palestinian children:\n If you were to ask a Palestinian child \"What is a Caterpillar tractor used for?\" many of the Palestinian children that live in Palestine would tell you \" Caterpillar tractors are used by the Israelis to destroy our homes, farms, and villages to build a wall around us or roads for Jewish people only that divide our land or to create green space in the name of Israeli security.

With the exception of a very few Palestinian people if they are able to leave the Palestine Territory they will not know if they will be able to return to their home until they do because it is totally up to the Israelis to decide and the condition on the ground change like the wind. \n But how do you explain the generational hatred for all jews which is taught to the children on morning TV? Shows made to look like \"Sesame Street\" that promote suicide bombs, abject hatred and Jihad... \n \n YouTube - Muslim Palestinians teach children to hate in cartoons 2\n \n YouTube - Muslim Palestinians teach children to hate in cartoons 1\n \n YouTube - Kids shown video of their mother's suicide bombing death on Hamas TV\n \n YouTube - Hamas children show teaches: Jews are murderers\n \n Also, in order to show that this culture of poverty and hatred for Israel has been created by the Palestinian Authority and has been multi generational, let's look at some reality going to to Yassir Arafat who led the PLO for 35+ years. He looted the Palestinian bank to the tune of an estimated 5 billion dollars. Money which could have been spent to raise the Palestinian people out of poverty, build a social and economic infrastructure and allow them to be good peace loving, happy and productive neighbors of Israel for decades now. But the PLO preferred to run the common palestinian into poverty and lie to them about it being Israel's fault when all of the money given them year after year by many governments, not just the USA was hidden from the people it was intended to aid. Here, from the Middle East Quarterly: \n Arafat's Swiss Bank Account :: Middle East Quarterly\n \n Here's how another arab, Al-Masri put it:\n The money Arafat spent to buy the loyalty of his court, al-Masri gently suggests, could easily have paid for a functioning Palestinian state instead. \n \n \"With three hundred, four hundred million dollars we could have built Palestine in ten years. Waste, waste, waste. I flew over the West Bank in a helicopter with Arafat at the beginning of Oslo, and I told him how easy we could make five, six, seven towns here; we could absorb a lot of people here; and have the right of return for the refugees. If you have good intentions and you say you want to reach a solution, we could do it. I said, if you have money and water, it could be comparable to Israel, this piece of land.\"... \n \n In a largely traditional society Arafat stood out because he was self-made, the symbolic incarnation of a people that owed its continued existence to him. Decades before he began to show his age in public, his lips trembling, his hands shaking, his belly distended-even then he was known as the Old Man. His speeches were laundry lists of slogans and exhortatory phrases such as \"Ya jabal ma yahzak reeh\" (\"O mountain, the wind cannot shake you!\") and \"Li-l-Quds rayyihin, shuhada bi-l-malayyin\" (\"To Jerusalem we march, martyrs by the millions\") interspersed with Koranic verses. The symbolic leader of the Palestinian nation spoke with a pronounced Egyptian accent. His lips flapped when he spoke. To some, the combination was irredeemably comic. He distinguished himself within the Palestinian national movement by his boundless energy for the cause, alqadhiya, which might also be translated as \"the case,\" a term appropriate to a proceeding in a courtroom. One of the peculiarities of the nation that Arafat created was that it was founded on a festering grievance rather than any positive imagination of the future; the worse things were in the present, the stronger the Palestinian case became. http://seekerblog.com/archives/20050818/in-a-ruined-country-how-yasir-arafat-destroyed-palestine/\n \n And here's another expos'e: Daimnation!: The thief of Palestine\n \n So tell me; an american born arab of islamic descent why it is Israel's fault when the Palestinian Declaration of Independence simultaneously promises to seek peaceful coexistence as it repeatedly calls for the expulsion of Israel? Palestinian Declaration of Independence - 1988 Can you explain or justify that reality of what they represent as opposed to what they say?",

And are you denying that the PLA has refused every attempt at peace by Israel with violence? Here's the history of the thanks King Hussein of Jordan received when he took in Arafat's Palestinian mob.\n September 1970 is known as the Black September (Arabic: &#1571;&#1610;&#1604;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1608;&#1583;&#8206;) in Arab history and sometimes is referred to as the \"era of regrettable events.\" It was a month when Hashemite King Hussein of Jordan moved to quash the militancy of Palestinian organizations and restore his monarchy's rule over the country.[3] The violence resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, the vast majority Palestinian.[2] Armed conflict lasted until July 1971 with the expulsion of the PLO and thousands of Palestinian fighters to Lebanon.Black September in Jordan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The history reflected upon here is typical of every country that ever tried to help this rabid band of outlaws called the Palestinian people. In every case they have responded to kindness with evil and attempts to hijack the countries which invited them in. Just as they have done with Israel as they responded to every attempt at peace with violence.\n \n Here's more about arab countries which wont even allow Palestinians passage through their countries unescorted without proper return documentation for Israel. And remember, those palestinians are being expelled from arab countries. emoticon_xgood\n Arab Countries Reluctant to Receive Expelled Palestinians\n \n By David Lamb\n Los Angeles Times\n BEIRUT, Lebanon\n Col. Moammar Gadhafi's decision to expel 30,000 Palestinians from Libya has been greeted with dismay in the Middle East, where Arab countries have no intention of opening their doors to the would-be settlers.\n \n Lebanon already has denied entry to several thousand Palestinians who arrived on two ships from Cyprus and Greece without Lebanese travel documents, and Friday it banned maritime transport from Libya in hopes of cutting off the flow of deportees. About 350 Palestinian from Libya with proper documents were allowed to enter.\n \n Other Palestinians remained stranded at sea or at the Al-Saloum checkpoint on the Libyan-Egyptian border. Egypt has allowed Palestinians with Israeli permits for entry to Gaza or the West Bank to cross Egypt, under escort, to the Palestinian-ruled areas. Those without permits would be turned back by Israel, Egyptian officials said.Arab Countries Reluctant to Receive Expelled Palestinians - The Tech",

Israel was a terrorist state at its foundation and its actions since have done nothing to dispel that image. I only hope that when the Palestinians win their independence they can do a better job of it.\n\n \n Really? How do you call them terrorists when on November 29, 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Resolution as its first official act requiring the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The General Assembly called upon the inhabitants of the country to take all the necessary steps on their part to put the plan into effect. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their independent State is unassailable.\n \n It is the natural right of the Jewish people to lead, as do all other nations, an independent existence in its sovereign State.\n \n And like all racist anti-Semites, you continue to propagate lies and misinformation regarding the founding of Israel. Also in usual form you post no historical evidence to support your claims. Here's the myth and the truth: Myths & Facts - The War of 1948\n \n As for this Stern Gang, here's the lowdown on them: Stern Gang (Zionist extremist organization) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\n \n And here is an excerpt of the May- 48 Proclamation of 'Israel's Independence\n WE HEREBY PROCLAIM the establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine to be called 'Medinal Israel' (The State of Israel). WE HEREBY DECLARE that, as from the termination of the British Mandate at midnight, the 14th-15th May, 1948, and pending the setting up of the duly elected bodies of the State in accordance with a Constitution, to be drawn up by the Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October, 1948, the National Council shall act as the Provisional State Council, and that the National Administration shall constitute the Provisional Government of the Jewish State, which shall be known as Israel.\n \n THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for immigration of Jews from all countries of their dispersion; will promote the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; will be based on the principles of liberty, justice and peace as conceived by the Prophets of Israel, will uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race or sex will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, education and culture; will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and will loyally uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n \n THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be ready to cooperate with the organs and representatives of the United Nations in the implementation of the Resolution of the Assembly of November 29, 1947, and will take steps to bring about Economic Union over the whole of Palestine. We appeal to the United Nations to assist the Jewish people in the building of its State and to admit Israel into the family of Nations. In the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace and play their part in the development of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions - provisional and permanent.\n \n We extend our hand in peace and neighborliness to all the neighboring states and their peoples, and invite them to co-operate with the independent Jewish nation for the common good of all. The State of Israel is prepared to make its contribution to the progress of the Middle East as a whole.\n 14-May- 48 : The Proclamation of 'Israel's Independence'\n \n Now compare this proclamation by Israel with the attack by her arab neighbors which occurred the very next day after instituting it, and the following Palestinian constitution which vows to KILL or DRIVE every Jew into the Sea. Then you tell me which side has a history of attempting to coexist in peace and which side has refused peace at any cost.",

It is in any case a racist document, defining the state by ethnicity and limiting immigration on that basis. If a state declared itself to be \"the Aryan state\", we would rightly be appalled. \n \n Do you deny that the bombing of the King David Hotel was a terrorist act?  \n\n \n Here is what I think of the bombing at the King David Hotel.\n The Bombing of the King David Hotel\n \n The King David Hotel was the site of the British military command and the British Criminal Investigation Division. The Irgun chose it as a target after British troops invaded the Jewish Agency June 29, 1946, and confiscated large quantities of documents. At about the same time, more than 2,500 Jews from all over Palestine were placed under arrest. The information about Jewish Agency operations, including intelligence activities in Arab countries, was taken to the King David Hotel.\n \n A week later, news of a massacre of 40 Jews in a pogrom in Poland reminded the Jews of Palestine how Britain's restrictive immigration policy had condemned thousands to death.\n \n Irgun leader Menachem Begin stressed his desire to avoid civilian casualties and said three telephone calls were placed, one to the hotel, another to the French Consulate, and a third to the Palestine Post, warning that explosives in the King David Hotel would soon be detonated.\n \n On July 22, 1946, the calls were made. The call into the hotel was apparently received and ignored. Begin quotes one British official who supposedly refused to evacuate the building, saying: \"We don't take orders from the Jews.\"1 As a result, when the bombs exploded, the casualty toll was high: a total of 91 killed and 45 injured. Among the casualties were 15 Jews. Few people in the hotel proper were injured by the blast.2\n \n http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/jeru/kingdavbomb.jpg\n \n In contrast to Arab attacks against Jews, which were widely hailed as heroic actions, the Jewish National Council denounced the bombing of the King David.3\n \n For decades the British denied they had been warned. In 1979, however, a member of the British Parliament introduced evidence that the Irgun had indeed issued the warning. He offered the testimony of a British officer who heard other officers in the King David Hotel bar joking about a Zionist threat to the headquarters. The officer who overheard the conversation immediately left the hotel and survived.4The Bombing of the King David Hotel\n \n \n Do you deny that the Deir Yassin massacre took place? Lets fast forward, to the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, where later Prime Minister Ariel Sharon allowed the murder of 2000 Palestinians. Arafat and the Hamas leadership were/are just as bad (in intent though not in execution, not having the backing of the US military establishment), but to pretend Israel is a lone respector of human rights in a region of savages is both absurd and untrue.\n\n \n And here is the rest of the story regarding the Dier Yassin.\n Counting the Dead\n \n Surprisingly, after the \"massacre,\" the Irgun escorted a representative of the Red Cross through the town and held a press conference. The New York Times' subsequent description of the battle was essentially the same as Begin's. The Times said more than 200 Arabs were killed, 40 captured and 70 women and children were released. No hint of a massacre appeared in the report. \"Paradoxically, the Jews say about 250 out of 400 village inhabitants [were killed], while Arab survivors say only 110 of 1,000.\"7 A study by Bir Zeit University, based on discussions with each family from the village, arrived at a figure of 107 Arab civilians dead and 12 wounded, in addition to 13 \"fighters,\" evidence that the number of dead was smaller than claimed and that the village did have troops based there.8 Other Arab sources have subsequently suggested the number may have been even lower.9\n \n In fact, the attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed. For example, at 9:30 A.M., about five hours after the fighting started, the Lehi evacuated 40 old men, women and children on trucks and took them to a base in Sheikh Bader. Later, the Arabs were taken to East Jerusalem. Starting at 2:00 P.M., residents were taken out of the village. The trucks passed through the Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim after the Sabbath had begun, so the neighborhood people cursed and spit at them, not because they were Arabs, but because the vehicles were desecrating the Sabbath. Seeing the Arabs in the hands of Jews also helped raise the morale of the people of Jerusalem who were despondent from the setbacks in the fighting to that point.10 Another source says 70 women and children were taken away and turned over to the British.11 If the intent was to massacre the inhabitants, no one would have been evacuated.Deir Yassin\n \n Just the fact that you refer to these events as massacre's shows your subjective bent to demonize Israel at every turn. I believe by simply showing the other side of the story I have refuted your prejudicial perspective. But if need be, I can post evidence that in every case Israel was acting in her own best interest based on the reality which existed at the time. Not that I believe she is without any sin in all cases. I understand that the jews are human and flawed just as we all are. But you desire to condemn her at every turn is just as revealing about your anti-semitism. And as for proving that? I refer to all of your posts on the subject of Israel's right to exist. You condemn her at every turn.",

That 107 people were killed, and that women, children and seniors were escorted to safety. Show me any examples of palestinians showing equal mercy, compassion and concern for Israeli civilians in similar circumstances. The fact is that you can't, not one instance when Arabs have ever shown any compassion for jews. They attack with terror and suicide bombs and raise their children to be willing to die for allah rather than ever attempt to make peace with a jew.\n \n How can you blame Israel when arabs are born and raised from birth to hate and be devoted to murder and suicide in the name of a nationalistic devotion which is void of any love or concern for their fellow human beings? And remember that just one day after declaring themselves an autonomous nation, they were invaded en masse by all of their arab neighbors. I make no excuses for any wrong committed by Israel, but neither do I judge them harshly when I don't fully understand all of the intricacies and ins and outs regarding the enemy they faced when I do understand how devious and diabolical this enemy is, not to mention its combined commitment to utterly and completely destroying the Jewish people and expelling them from their God given land.\n \n I have produced evidence throughout this thread which clarifies that this people has been an enemy even to every arab nation which has attempted to take them in, and have ended up expelling them with violent military force. I have posted videos of modern palestinian children's TV which documents that glorifies terrorism and suicide bombing innocent civilians in the name of allah and the state of Palestine. Do you consider that the actions of a righteous and responsible nation state Jo? Is that your idea of a good neighbor who is deserving of world wide support? How can you in good conscience support a country which spits on international laws and well established rules of engagement? \n \n So, there in lies the rub Jo, as you stand against the people through whom salvation came into the world in favor of this terroristic and barbarian people, you automatically place yourself on the side of Gods enemies because nobody will ever expel or destroy this people whom God made an everlasting covenant with. If you were a true believer in Christ, you would understand that truth and not be condemning Israel or opposing them in deference to the Palestinians who have urinated on any and every attempt at peace that Israel has offered them over 6 decades. emoticon_xdonno Jo Bennett, Pathetic is thy cause!",

   "If you were to compare the Palestinian Slowocaust to the Jewish Holocaust there are great differences as well as similarities. In the Holocaust there was much more of a focus on the quickest and most efficient way of killing great numbers of people that were labeled as undesirables by the Nazis. Mainly Jewish people, gypsies and homosexuals were killed with very little damage done to property. In contrast in the Palestinian Slowocaust there is mush less killing and much more property damage and confiscation of land. A very well organized and financed operation by the Israelis to gain control of the land, with the Jewish National Fund being one of the main early cornerstones of this operation. \n \n The Germany Nazis were and the Israelis are very focus on developing the most sophisticated military arms. Both nations being leaders in the arms race of their time. With the Nazis using no restraint of the use their modern weapons of the time to kill. The Israelis have for the most part used great restraint with their weapons of death in their quest to control the land. The German Nazis did not have to confiscate a great amount of land from the Jewish people of Europe because for the most part at the time Jewish people rich or poor could not own land. Where in the Palestinian Slowocaust it is over the control of land that is historically known as the Holy Land with Jerusalem being the crown jewel. \n \n The founding fathers of Israel wanted total control of all of the Holy Land in what was Palestine without killing all of the indigenous non Jewish people. With a lot of money and world wide connections the Jewish Israelis started on a quest for total control of the land in Palestine. They were going to gain control of the Palestine by hook or crook. Denial has been and is today one of the cornerstone used in the creation of the modern State of Israel. Denial that there are Palestinian people, or a land ever named Palestine. Refer to Rand Mcnally World Atlas Premier Edition of 1927. \n \n For the first and only time in history an international body (United Nations) passed UN Resolution 181. Taking the land of one nation of people and dividing it into two. This part has been done a number of times. But what has never been done is dividing a nation into two creating a new nation for people from all over the world of one religion to come too.",

I don't say that individual jews within the IDF don't over react to situations and do bad things in the course of operations there. I'm not here to be an apologist for Israel either.

After all, destroying all of them would be easy if that was the actual goal. \n \n They have offered every imaginable kind of treaty which has been rejected by your leaders and responded to with violence. That is what your credo says. That you will never make peace with Israel, that you will destroy the Jews. So how is it Israel's fault when they dare to defend against your attacks on their civilian population? Man up and stop crying about getting hit back when it is always you throwing the first punch in the fight. That's why as an arab, I don't feel sorry for them. They deserve everything they get if they insist on being the propagator of the violence. :xbanghead",

The US currently gives Israel $3 billion in military aid every year, and until recently gave them $1.2 billion in economic aid. The only country to get more in recent years has been Iraq.\n\n \n The money loaned to, and given to Israel in foreign aid has been well spent since they have used it wisely to build up an economic infrastructure and for self defense against enemies who surround her and have vowed to destroy her. What you fail to mention is the Aid which Palestine receives and has received for decades, none of which was wisely invested to improve the lives of the palestinian people, but has been spent to overtly and offensively attack Israel. Why is it that you are so willfully ignorant of that reality Jo?\n On December 17, 2007, eighty-seven countries and international organizations met in Paris and pledged to provide $7.4 billion over three years to the Palestinian Authority[1] (PA), an amount far in excess of any previous level of U.S. or European aid to the Palestinians. The conference participants justified the aid as a means of providing \"immediate support to the entire Palestinian population,\"[2] and as a reward intended to strengthen those Palestinians who favor peaceful coexistence with Israel.[3]\n \n In the midst of the effort in Paris to bestow unprecedented sums of foreign aid on the Palestinians, there was little discussion of the unintended consequences - often deadly ones - of previous aid regimens. The recent history of foreign assistance shows a distinct correlation between aid and violence. Perhaps aid itself does not cause violence, but there is strong evidence that it contributes to a culture of corruption, government malfeasance, and terrorism that has had lethal consequences for both Israelis and Palestinians over the past decade.\n \n The Paris conference aid package continues fifteen years of international funding that has established the Palestinians as one of the world's leading per capita recipients of foreign support (see Table 1). Figures published by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development for 2005 show that Palestinians received $304 per person in foreign aid,[4] second only to the war-torn Republic of Congo among entities with populations larger than one million. Unlike the Congo, though, the Palestinians have received such subsidies for decades.\n \n Amidst the internal turmoil of 2006 and 2007, aid to the Palestinians increased by more than 50 percent,[5] and in July 2007 the Israeli government handed over $300-400 million in import taxes it had collected on behalf of the PA.[6] This revenue windfall came despite the 2005 warning by George Abed, head of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, that \"if you poured in a lot of financing at this time, it would not have a big impact. It would not be very effective ... It would be wasted.\"[7] International organizations and diplomats acknowledge Palestinian misuse and diversion of aid money,[8] but they remain reluctant to study the deeper implications of how such aid affects Palestinian political culture.\n \n An examination of key measures of violence reveals a troublesome correlation between the number of homicides committed by Palestinians and the level of funding provided to the Palestinian Authority. As aid to the Palestinian government increased, there was a corresponding increase in the number of people, both Israeli and Palestinian, killed by Palestinians. The correlation between aid and homicide statistics does not mean that foreign aid causes violence, but it does raise a question about whether the flow of aid to the Palestinian government has helped fuel Palestinian violence and hindered efforts to restore calm.

Over the next 2 decades that got their a$$es handed to them on a number of occasions. In fact, the Arabs put up such a weak showing in the Six Day War that the US had to step in to prevent Israel from entering Cairo. In retrospect, it was the best thing that we could have done because Israel had overrun its supply line and would have been hurting real soon, anyway.\n The Arabs in the ME used Palestine in multiple attempts to drive the Jews out of the ME and it blew up in their faces.

   "\n The Indian Reservations are an appalling example of an oppressor trying to legitimise their oppression. The US government broke treaty after treaty with the Native Americans and the reservations were what the Indians were left with after the oppressors had taken everything they wanted. Not a bad comparison with Palestine actually, another suitable comparison, and really where the Israeli government wants to go, is the South African Bantustan system.\n\n \n The difference is Indians don't blow themselves up in public, and if they did, people would view them as criminals rather than freedom fighters.",

   "In 1947 it was called Palestine, and had been for some time. It had also been the homeland of the Palestinians for some time. The fact that there was a previous occupation does not undermine its existence. Does the fact that the territory was under Roman occupation mean that Israel didn't exist in 33AD?\n\n \n Actually it was a wasteland that the arabs thought little about until they saw that the Jews were constructively developing the land, then they determined to run the weak and defenseless Jews off of it. Britain made some serious errors also which promoted dissension which persists to this day.\n \n When Britain was entrusted with a mandate to create nations out of the territories in the Middle East, the arabs, in general, were not so much against the creation of a Jewish State in Israel. Most of the arabs were more interested in creating their own states in the surrounding region, and they held back from causing too many problems since this would have been a risk to their own interests. At the time Britain was willing to carry out the order of its mandate and help the Jews build the State of Israel, because it wasn't faced with much opposition. Furthermore, Israel was still a largely underdeveloped wasteland, and the arabs considered it to be only a backwater province of syria. Not only was Jewish settlement tolerated, it was encouraged by the arabs, who saw the Jews as the \"redeemers of the Land,\" since the desert blossomed wherever the Jews would settle. The arabs thought they were smart, giving the Jews Israel while they took the \"good land.\" But once they saw that Israel was fertile and that it could support many people, the arabs were not disheartened, since they thought they would take Israel as well. And they moved there in great numbers, as jobs and opportunities were made available to them.\n \n But the British were foolish because they made empty promises, saying and doing whatever was important to them and then changing their policies to suit their best interests. The British could have insisted that the arabs not settle in Israel (since they were already being given their own lands) and then they could easily have kept their promises. But there were arabs in Israel, and the arab population grew rapidly, and so Britain had to choose its policy. And britain chose to favor the arab majority. Perhaps britain thought the Jews would be easier to handle, and britain could throw around the Jews and treat them like puppets, as the Jews have always been weak and helpless people. But history has proven otherwise, because the Jews of Israel have shown themselves to be more powerful than all the arab countries combined. And it is not numbers that matter. Israel cannot be harmed as long as it is filled with the Spirit of G-d.Amichai Project for Israel - White Papers\n \n \n@Archangel: so, what you're article says is that the Palestinians get less than the Israelis in the 3 years from December 2007 (7.4 billion vs 9 billion) and even that is more than they've ever had before. Also, complaining about the Palestinians spending the money of weapons is a little absurd when the Israeli aid is spent on F16s, armoured bulldozers, missiles and tanks.\n\n \n That isn't what it says at all unless one is illiterate and incapable of comprehending plain english. It says that the states which came together to raise 7.4 billion dollars in Aid for the Palestinians, raised it for this reason! (From the link in my post above; I repeat for your edification)\n The conference participants justified the aid as a means of providing \"immediate support to the entire Palestinian population,\"[2] and as a reward intended to strengthen those Palestinians who favor peaceful coexistence with Israel.[3]\n \n But like past efforts, this too failed to bring about a culture of peace in Palestine or an agenda to build a national economic infrastructure for the people. So once again Jo, your apologetic interpretation of my prior link is bogus and nothing more than an attempt to make excuses for a terroristic people who have vowed not to rest until they destroy Israel. The TERMS Peace and Coexistence do NOT exist in their vocabulary, yet you defend them when we all know that Israel builds weapons for defensive purposes rather than to destroy the palestinian people. Because we all also know that if that was Israel's agenda, the Palestinian authority would no longer exist. \n \n In the midst of the effort in Paris to bestow unprecedented sums of foreign aid on the Palestinians, there was little discussion of the unintended consequences - often deadly ones - of previous aid regimens. The recent history of foreign assistance shows a distinct correlation between aid and violence. Perhaps aid itself does not cause violence, but there is strong evidence that it contributes to a culture of corruption, government malfeasance, and terrorism that has had lethal consequences for both Israelis and Palestinians over the past decade.",

Do you see anywhere in those chapters where God says to split it up and give it to the Palestinians?\n \n If I were Israel I'd tell the world the land is theirs, based on Ezekiel 38-39 and if the Palestinians try to cause trouble they're going to be toast.\n \n Do you ever go by God's Word, or is this another one of your politically correct squirrel trails?",

I certainly can't see the Israelis managing to use Katyusha rockets for fuel for 7 years.\n \n In any case, who said splitting the land up was a good idea? I would favour a single state where Israelis and Palestinians can live together and co-operate to build a safe and secure country. Separation tends to lead to hostility, as events on the Indian subcontinent have shown.\n \n Part of Christ's message was that ethnicity was no longer important.

Have you forgotten in your naivete, their vow to destroy Israel and drive every Jew into the Sea? For 60 years now they have urinated on every single treaty the Jews have agreed to in good faith. Just admit it Jo, you are an apologist for terrorists and you attempt to justify your blind animosity toward Israel with the bible as your tool. But no corruption or perversion of Gods word that you attempt will successfully aid you in justifying your attacks on Israel as the aggressor when it is the Palestinians/Arabs who have determined to destroy Israel and never make peace with her.",
