   "While the compulsory nature of same-sex kissing is a peculiarity of Christian writings, the practice is not entirely absent from Hebrew Scripture either. Throughout several centuries of burning bushes, wars of conquest and temple building, many of Hebrew Scripture's grimmest patriarchs and military commanders spent a small part of each day making kissy-face with each other.\n And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. (Exod. 4:27)\n \n And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. (2Sam. 19:39)\n These are but two of many examples. In fact, if we were to use the Bible as our only source for the history of osculation, we might be tempted to deduce that same-sex kissing had always been the norm and that no actual man had kissed an actual woman since Jacob kissed Rachel at Gen. 29:11 late in the third millennium BCE.\n \n Is a pattern beginning to emerge? \n \n Let's look at the numbers.\n \n Of the forty-six kisses registered in the Holy Writ, only six are between men and women in a non-family setting (Gen. 29:11; Prov. 7:13; Song 1:2; Song 8:1; Luke 7:38; Luke 7:45) and only two of those are demonstrably sexual (Gen. 29:11; Prov. 7:13). Of the remaining number, two are acts of worship to graven images (1Kgs. 19:18 & Hosea 13:2), one is between allegorical constructs of Righteousness and Peace (Ps. 85:10), one is a slightly puzzling act of self- osculation in the book of Job (31:27), and two occur between women (Ruth 1:14 & 19). Were left with twenty-nine kisses (including those in which Judas betrays Jesus) that involve men nuzzling up to express affection or respect, either partially or exclusively between themselves. The combined total of same-sex kisses is thirty-one, which renders a 67.39% ratio in favor of the practice including the seven (15.21%) that require it as a sign of membership in a Christian community.\n \n The Bible is quite specific about the way to salvation: believe in the Lord (Jn. 3:16), don't eat weasels (Lev. 11:29), and give each other a kiss from time to time.\n\n \nIf we allow for a generous interpretation of condemnation, a mere twenty-eight verses in the Bible specifically condemn the city of Sodom or the sexual practices conventionally associated with it, even though only one verse alludes to what those acts might be (Lev. 20:13). This is a close contest when compared to the thirty-one verses encouraging (or at least not discouraging) same-sex kisses and the seven that specifically command salutatory smooching. Simple numerical superiority would seem to place compulsory kissing on the conservative agenda for national moral reform if only to maintain the ideological symmetry in which its advocates claim to participate. Whatever the Biblical case, fear, not caritas, seems to be determining conservative priorities in this instance.\n http://www.sexuality.org/l/religion/xkiss.html",
