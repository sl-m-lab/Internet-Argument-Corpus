   "is it a double standard to be intolerant and judgemental towards the beliefs of a homophobe?\n\n \n Not exactly. The gay rights movement isn't about people tolerating gays. It is about treating gays equally under the law. We fully support their rights to believe differently than us, to believe that we are immoral, and to judge us. We think that they are wrong, but we support their freedom to do that. In the same sense, it is not a double-standard to be judgemental of their beliefs.\n \n And in truth, only one of us can be correct. If I say that we should judge or be intolerant of someone because that person's beliefs are wrong, then I am not applying a double-standard by saying that we shouldn't be intolerant of someone whose beliefs are correct. For example, if I were to say that we should judge racists negatively, it would not be a double-standard for me to say that racists should not judge non-racists negatively, for I believe that non-racists are correct.\n \n Anyhow, what would be a double standard is if we advocated taking away the rights of gay rights opponents to believe and act as they choose, when those beliefs and acts harm no one. The gay rights movement is about equal legal rights; we suggest that everyone should have them. Because of this, the double-standard could only involve supporting equal rights for ourselves but denying them for our opponents.\n \n A double-standard is not a reason to avoid the word homophobe. But there are reasons. First, it has no real meaning. There's no clear line between being a homophobe and not being one, and calling someone a homophobe doesn't show that person is wrong in any fashion. It does, however, serve to insult and discredit that person without appropiate justification. In my opinion, it's only purpose is to insult.\n \n Now keep in mind, I do find it understandable to insult people in frustration, and I understand how frustrating it can be when people call you a sinner and when the majority is denying you rights that you feel are very important, rights that make you less than them. I do not hold it against people when they insult out of frustration or desire to express their emotions, only when they insult out of an enjoyment at offending someone else. But as for myself, I will avoid using insults as best I can.",

All these things have occured, while same-sex marriage was not legal, and different-sex marriage was legal. I guess divorce must be your idea of a wonderful thing, if you support different-sex marriage. After all, using your logic different-sex marriage is just as likely, if not more likely, to have led us there, as same-sex marriage.

I might as well say you are inconsistent.
