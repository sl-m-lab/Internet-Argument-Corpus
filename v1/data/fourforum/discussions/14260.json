   "IMO, the thing to look for is the reader that supports the most formats and really think about what features you need. Personally when I sat down and thought about it I realized that I have pretty much zero desire to connect my book to the internet. I can check my email on my phone if I really want to. IF I want to check the news, I sit down at a computer and go to google news. \n \n I ended up buying an Astak 6\" EZ reader from newegg. It supports pretty much every kind of ebook you are likely to run into. I like it.",

They are a LOT different. First, there is a HUGE difference in battery life. Who wants their book to run out of juice??? I used a Q-1 UMPC as an ebook reader for a while but even with the (expensive) extended battery, I was always having to recharge the thing. The cool thing about e-ink is that it does not use any energy AT ALL to display the text on the screen...it only uses power to turn the page. I read a LOT and have never had a problem with battery life. I charge it whenever I think of it and am not using it (actually I reached over and plugged it in when I read the OP). \n \n I understand what you are saying about hauling a bunch of techno junk. Right now in my truck there are 2 laptops, a tablet PC, an air card, a smart phone, and a digital camera. IF you have to do without something, and you are an avid reader, do NOT make it the ebook reader with e-ink. Trust me on this.",

You might look at downloading some software called Calibre. It is an Ebook organizer type program but its real strength is that it solved the format problem I posted about so many months ago. Calibre will convert between pretty much any Ebook formats. \n \n One thing I like about the kindle is the multi platform support. I have the kindle app on my android phone and can pretty much pop it open and have access to any of the ebooks I have bought through amazon.

A book is something you typically stare at for hours. Staring at an LCD that close to your face for hours WILL damage your eyes. That is why every single Ebook reader to hit the market failed miserably until E-ink showed up on the scene. The difference is incredible. The difference in battery life is also incredible. If you are using your Ipad for reading, you will need to charge it every day or two. A kindle you have to charge about once a month or so, and it charges in under 20 minutes. \n \n The Ipad is a cool device and I like mine, but an Ebook reader it is not.",

That is what my phone is for...and it also has skype. Do you not have a cell phone?\n \n Cost is not the issue, functionality is. The Ipad just does not bring much to the table when it comes to functionality. The on screen keyboard is good as far as on screen keyboards go, but does not even come close to the speed and functionality of a hardware keyboard. So, yea, you can answer Emails on it, if you either REALLY enjoy typing slowly or only send very short Emails. You can also tap an Email out in morse code, but why subject yourself to that?\n \n I have no desire to show slide shows on my tablet at family events. In fact, I have no desire to EVER show slide shows on my tablet. Being able to start a movie and hand it off to the kids is kind of handy.\n \n You are getting a little too defensive here. I am not calling the thing junk. I even said I like mine. I just dont find it all that useful. It does a whole bunch of stuff, but none of it very well, and most of it I have no desire whatsoever to do. \n \n The Ipad is a multifunction device that will also read Ebooks. The Kindle is a Ebook reader. If what you want to know is which is the better Ebook reader, the kindle wins hands down, no question. As an Ebook reader, it is superior to my Ipad in every single way. Yea...the Ipad does a bunch of other stuff, but none that has anything AT ALL to do with reading ebooks. \n \n What you are arguing here is akin to arguing that I should get rid of my HDTV because the sync system in my truck can play movies, and the truck ALSO drives, has a radio, and has climate controlled seats, therefore it is OBVIOUSLY superior to an HDTV. \n \n The shortfalls of the Ipad when it comes to functionality have been a problem with tablets for a long time. Like I said earlier, I am a gadget guy. I like gadgets and whether it makes sense or not, I just have to have the new, neat electronic gizmo. My first Tablet was a Dauphin DTR-1. It had a 486 processor, ran windows 3.1, and cost a little over $3000 with spare batteries, case, etc.... I have had Q1's, viewsonic tablets, grid tablets, \"convertible\" laptops (where the screens can pivot 180 degrees to use as a tablet) and they all (with the exception of the convertible laptop) have had the same problem which is data input is difficult/slow with them. On screen keyboards (and the Q1 had a better on screen keyboard than the Ipad does) do not cut it. Some of the full tablet PC implementations like the Q1 and the viewsonic tables were a little better because of the reasonably good voice recognition software available, but they still had a LONG ways to go. They were good for viewing engineering drawings. The ipad cant even do that. \n \n I have had my Ipad for quite a while and have yet to identify anything that it will do that my phone will not. There are a LOT of things that my laptop will do that the Ipad wont. I just dont see it as that useful a device. Maybe they will add functions later that will make it more useful, but for now it is pretty much just a bigger screen for angry birds.",
