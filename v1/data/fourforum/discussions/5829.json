   "The Rational Mind and a Meaningful Life\n By \n Christopher A. Redding\n \n \n For\n Mercer University\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There is no meaning to life outside of the rational mind, because the rational mind provides meaning regardless of the situation. There are prerequisites to finding personal meaning meaningful and those are an embrace of rationalism, courage and honesty. In ones struggle to find a meaningful life it is the authors opinion (which is meaningful) to avoid fallacies that deter ones goals, such as, irrationalism, hedonism and altruism. In the end when all things are considered the rational mind will find life, self-interest and a renewed attitude. \n Prerequisites\n Rationalism is a virtue and is important to meaningfulness because it explains things in a sane manner. It is the means by which individuals can exercise free thought outside of the area of dogma such as blind faith. Blind faith is the exercise of explaining existence without reason, of explaining things through an authoritative power and it is usually motivated by fear or an irresponsibleness of a thinker to use their own mind or to be courageous in doubt. \n Rationalism is necessary for wisdom. Wisdom is the ability to look down the road of life and to observe the choices one should make to avoid the un-necessary and harmful decisions one can make. Benjamin Franklin once said,\" Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom.\" (Isaccson, p.32). It is necessary to have free thought to gain wisdom. \n Rationalism is a virtue as Ayn Rand describes it,\" It means a commitment to the principle that all one's convictions, values, goals, desires and actions must be based on, derived from, chosen and validated by a process of thought- as precise and scrupulous a process of thought, directed by as ruthlessly strict an application of logic, as one's fullest capacity permits.\" (Rand, p. 28). Traditions and dogma have no place in rationalism. It takes the rational mind to find meaning in any situation. The rational mind is able to ascend any given condition. \n Courage is the willingness to face opposition regardless of ones misgivings. Courage is required if one is to seriously pursue a meaningful life because one will be confronted with doubt, authority figures, fear, and coercion. Courage is needful because it guarantees everything else,\" Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others.\" (Winston Churchill). \n It is the failure of many to consider that humanity must have a life of no tension. Tension in life is necessary to create growth. Frankl states that everyone needs mental tension,\" I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium ...a tensionless state.\" (Frankl p.110). It takes courage to face one's troubles and find a means of dealing with them. Some will lack the courage and turn to a state of conformism and do what others want him or her to do in an effort to find meaning. Conformism is the way of a coward because one gives up the struggle for meaning by losing themselves in fulfilling another's desires, and in addition it is irrational to assume that one can make another happy. Happiness comes and goes along the path of life; happiness is linked with sadness because you cannot experience the one without the other. You cannot know happiness without a contrast. Happiness is a glass of joy that one drinks to the bitter dregs. To fulfill the meaningfulness of another is an impossible task and only leads to self-destruction.\n Honesty is a key to rationalism. Honesty is the virtue one must have to pursue a meaningful life. When professor Morrie Schwartz was confronted with his approaching death he said,\" To know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That's better. That way you can actually be more involved in your life while you're living.\" (Albom, p. 81). People are not being honest with themselves when they fill their lives with objects and think to themselves that merely purchasing items will make my life meaningful. People are not being honest with themselves when they hold onto traditions and refuse to examine them because they fear that they are being misled. \n One must be honest with themselves, because it is destructive to delude yourself. It is destructive to live a lie about yourself and to actively conform to a norm based on irrational traditions and dogma. Religion has played a great role in putting humanity into a conformed state and denying an active role in examining traditions and dogma, \"I am appalled by the psychological damage caused by religious teachings- damage that often takes years to counteract.\" (Smith, p.10). \n Fallacies to Avoid\n Irrationalism is a fallacy that must be avoided. In searching for meaning if one forgoes rational thought or thinking one is giving up to obliviousness. To exist but not live, \"...in abandoning the will to think one abandons the will to live.\" (Rand, p. 143). In addition to live irrationally is to live in the face of contradictions to life and the mind must live in a state of mysticism. It is like the red face man who shouts to the top of his lunges unfounded subjective thoughts and when asked why (to justify his reasoning) he only answers, \"because.\" To live irrationally is to live with impossibilities and to deny reality, \"The irrational is the impossible; it is that which contradicts the facts of reality; facts cannot be altered by a wish, but they can destroy the wisher.\" (Rand, p. 31).\n Hedonism must be avoided because in effect it only buries the rational mind in pleasure and thus avoids meaningfulness. Hedonism is an effort to fill life full of pleasurable moments in time, but one must realize that pleasures end at one point and people are face to face with pain. Hedonism is like a drunk who wishes to alter his reality because he feels overwhelmed. He finds pleasure in his drunken state, but discovers in the morning that he is in pain because of a hangover and he repeats the cycle over again to avoid reality. There is nothing wrong with pleasure as long as it does not cause harm; in the case of the drunk he is harming himself with his abuse of liquor. People should enjoy their lives and the pleasures they find. Sex should be enjoyed and explored, be a child and play. Use your body and mind in delightful sport, regardless of what the irrational speakers bellow. \n Altruism in the sense of the modern meaning is a principle of action that is unselfish such as the notion of self-sacrifice. The notion of giving one's self over for the sake of another is irrational. For example if one had a neighbor who is ill and penniless it should be understood that illness and poverty are part of the normal risks of existence; but one may bring him aid if one is able. An act of good will is not an act of duty (altruism) and this does not mean that one must support such people continuously (Rand, p.55). Help that is given is an exception, \"...not a rule, an act of generosity, not of moral duty....\" (Rand, p.56). Avoid altruism because one will not find meaningfulness in self-sacrifice, but only a wasted life for the unwillingness of others. \n Rational Mind\n Life is the chief value. Value is what one holds dear and life is that value. Any discussion about the meaningfulness of life is meaningless without valuing life its self. In valuing life one gives themselves the opportunity to seek their meaning. Life being the chief values allows everyone to be rational, to act courageous and to be honest with themselves. Only a living entity can have goals and can desire meaning. \n Self-interest is of interest to preserve life, which is the chief value. You must be interested in yourself. You must find the things that matter to you and that challenge you to the process of growing into more of the individual you are becoming. To seek your self-interest is to preserve not only your life but also your integrity and not sale your soul for nothing which in the end makes you more of a fool then an earnest freethinker. \n An attitude towards free will is necessary for a meaningful life. Regardless of the situation you may find yourself in; an attitude that you have the ability to rationally over come those conditions will carry you into a meaningful existence. Frankl had lived through the holocaust and concluded that,\" Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them.\" (Frankl, p. 133). \n You may have noticed that I simply did not tell you what the meaning of life is that is because the individual must to that. I could simply state what the meaning of life for me is, but what does that mean to you? I have given you the tools that I have discovered over the course of my life that will aid you to find your meaning, but heed this warning; you may find that the meaning to your existence changes from situation to situation. As for me the meaning of life is found within living it, to be free, to be rational, to be honest and to discovery. The rational mind provides meaning regardless of the situation. \n \n \n Reference:\n Albom, Mitch \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" Doubleday publishing 1997.\n Frankl, Viktor E. \"Man's search for Meaning\" Beacon Press 1992.\n Isaacson, Walter, \"Benjamin Franklin An American Life\" Simon & Schuster 2003.\n Oxford American Dictionary, Oxford University Press 2002.\n Rand, Ayn \"The Virtue of Selfishness\" Published by Signet 1964.\n Smith, George H. \"Atheism The Case Against God\" Prometheus Books 1989. \n http://www.heartquotes.net/Courage.html",
