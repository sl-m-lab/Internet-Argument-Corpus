   "POST ONE\n \n Catholics believe Faith is man's response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man\n a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. \n \n \n Catholics believe the desire for God is written in the human heart, because\n man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe the dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. \n \n \n \n Catholics believe man exists because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that In many ways, throughout history down to the present\n day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behavior: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a religious being\n \n \n \n Catholics Believe that from one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the\n whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him - though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For \"in him we live and move and have our being.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe this \"intimate and vital bond of man to God\" \n can be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man.\n \n Catholics Believe such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinfulman which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n \n \"Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.\"\n \n \n Catholics Believe although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, \"an upright heart,\" as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God.\n \n \n \"You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power and your wisdom is without measure. And man, so small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small part of your creation, wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight in your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe Man is created in God's image and called to know and love him,\n therefore the person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him. These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of \"converging and convincing arguments,\" which allow us to attain certainty about the truth.\n \n Catholics believe these \"ways\" of approaching God from creation have a\n twofold point of departure: the physical world and the human person.\n \n The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency,and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.\n \n \n As St. Paul says of the Gentiles:\n \n For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made.\n \n And St. Augustine issues this challenge: \n \n Question the beauty of the earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the\n beauty of the air distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of the sky . . . question all these realities. All respond:\n \n \"See, we are beautiful.\" Their beauty is a profession \n These beauties are subject to change. Who made them if\n not the Beautiful One who is not subject to change?\n \n \n Catholics believe The human person, with his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, the \"seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material,\" can have its origin only in God.\n \n \n Catholics Believe the world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality which is the first cause and final end of all things, a reality \"that everyone calls 'God.'\"\n \n \n Catholics believe man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed\n to reason.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason. Without this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God's revelation. Man has this capacity because he is created \n \n \"in the image of God.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone\n \n \n Catholics believe though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and negation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the\n attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe this is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God's revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding, but also \"about those religious and moral truths which of themselves are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present condition of the human race, they can be known by all men with ease, with firm certainty and with no\n admixture of error.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that In defending the ability of human reason to know God, Christianity is expressing confidence in the possibility of speaking about him to all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue with other religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with unbelievers and atheists.\n \n \n Catholics believe since mans knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of knowing and thinking.\n \n \n Catholics believe all creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most\n especially man, created in the image and likeness of God. The manifold perfections of creatures - their truth, their goodness, their beauty - all reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we can name God by taking his creatures' perfections as our starting\n point, \"for from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continually purify our language of everything in it that is limited, image-bound or imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God the inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable - with our human representations. Our human words always fall short of the mystery of God.\n \n Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does attain to God himself, though unable to express him in his infinite simplicity. Likewise, we must recall that between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude and that concerning God, we cannot\n grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him.\n \n TO RECAP - \n \n Man is by nature and vocation a religious being.\n Coming from God, going toward God, man lives a fully\n human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God.\n \n Man is made to live in communion with God in whom\n he finds happiness: \"When I am completely united to you,\n there will be no more sorrow or trials; entirely full\n of you, my life will be complete\" \n \n When he listens to the message of creation and to\n the voice of conscience, man can arrive at certainty about\n the existence of God, the cause and the end of everything.\n \n The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator\n and Lord, can be known with certainty from his works,\n by the natural light of human reason \n \n We really can name God, starting from the manifold\n perfections of his creatures, which are likenesses of the infinitely\n perfect God, even if our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery.\n \n \"Without the Creator, the creature vanishes\" \n This is the reason why believers know that the love of\n Christ urges them to bring the light of the living God\n to those who do not know him or who reject him.\n \n \n Catholics believe although by natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of his works. there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation. Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and\n the Holy Spirit.\n \n \n Catholics believe It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal\n himself and to make known the mystery of his will. His will was....that men should have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature.\n \n \n Catholics believe God, who \"dwells in unapproachable light,\" wants to\n communicate his own divine life to the men he freely created, in order to adopt them as his sons in his only-begotten Son. By revealing himself. God wishes to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him, and of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity.\n \n \n Catholics Believe the divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously\n \"by Gods deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other\" and shed light on each other. It involves a specific divine pedagogy: God communicates himself to man gradually. He prepares him to welcome by stages the supernatural Revelation that \n is to culminate in the person and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ.\n \n St. Irenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine pedagogy using the image of God and man becoming accustomed to one another: \n \n The Word of God dwelt in man and became the Son of man in order to accustom man to perceive God and to accustom God to dwell in man, according to the Father's pleasure.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word,\n provides men with constant evidence of himself in created realities. \n And furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation, he manifested himself to our first parents from the very beginning.\" He invited them to intimate communion with himself and clothed them with resplendent grace and justice. \n \n This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin. After the fall, [God] buoyed them up with the hope of salvation, by promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his solicitude for the human race. For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who seek salvation by patience in well-doing.\n \n Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship\n you did not abandon him to the power of death. . . .\n Again and again you offered a covenant to man.\n \n \n Catholics believe after the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once sought to save humanity part by part. The covenant with Noah after the flood gives expression to the principle of the divine economy toward the \"nations,\" in other words, toward men grouped \"in their lands, each with [its] own language, by their families, in their nations.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe this state of division into many nations is at once cosmic,\n social, and religious. It is intended to limit the pride of fallen humanity, united only in its perverse ambition to forge its own unity as at Babel. But, because of sin, both polytheism and the idolatry of the nation and of its rulers constantly threaten this provisional economy with the perversion of paganism.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe the covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel. The Bible venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel the just, the king-priest Melchizedek - a figure of Christ - and the upright \"Noah, Daniel, and Job.\" Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity that can be reached by those who live according to the covenant of Noah, waiting for Christ to \"gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe In order to gather together scattered humanity God calls\n Abram from his country, his kindred, and his father's house, and makes him Abraham, that is, \"the father of a multitude of nations.\"\n \n \"In you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.\"\n \n The people descended from Abraham would be the trustees of the promise made to the patriarchs, the chosen people, called to prepare for that day when God would gather all his children into the unity of Christs Church. They would be the root onto which the Gentiles would be grafted, once they came to believe.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe after the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by\n freeing them from slavery in Egypt. He established with them the Covenant of Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law so that they would recognize him and serve him as the one living and true God, the provident Father and just judge, and so that they would look for the promised Savior.\n \n \n Catholics believe Israel is the priestly people of God, \"called by the name of the LORD,\" and \"the first to hear the word of God.\n people of \"elder brethren\" in the faith of Abraham.\n \n \n Catholics believe through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope\n of salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant intended for all, to be written on their hearts. The prophets proclaim a radical redemption of the People of God, purification from all their infidelities, a salvation which will include all the nations. Above all, the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this hope. Such holy women as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah,\n Hannah, Judith, and Esther kept alive the hope of Israel's salvation. The purest figure among them is Mary.\n \n \n Catholics believe God has said everything in his Word\n \n In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son. Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father's one, perfect, and unsurpassable Word. In him he has said everything; there will be no other word than this one.\n \n St. John of the Cross, among others, commented strikingly on Hebrews 1:1-2:\n \n \"In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other),he spoke everything to us at once in this sole Word and he has no more to say . . . because what he spoke before to the prophets in parts, he has now spoken all at once by giving us the All Who is His Son. Any person questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not only of foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not fixing his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some other novelty.\n \n \n Catholics believe there will be no further Revelation. the Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been made completely explicit; it remains for Christian\n faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course of the centuries.\n \n \n Catholics believe that even thought throughout the ages, there have been so-called \"private\" revelations, some of which have been recognized by the Catholic Church. They do not belong to the deposit of faith. It is not an individuals role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but to live and help others live more fully by it. \n \n \n Catholics believe that the Christian faith cannot accept \"revelations\" that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfillment, as is the case in certain non-Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which base\n themselves on such \"revelations.\"\n \n \n \n In Breif, \n \n Catholics believe that by love, God has revealed himself and given himself\n to man. He has thus provided the definitive, superabundant answer to the questions that man asks himself about the meaning and purpose of his life.\n \n God has revealed himself to man by gradually communicating his own mystery in deeds and in words. Beyond the witness to himself that God gives in created things, he manifested himself to our first parents,\n spoke to them and, after the fall, promised them salvation and offered them his covenant.\n \n God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and\n with all living beings It will remain in force as long as the world lasts.\n \n God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him\n and his descendants. By the covenant God formed his\n people and revealed his law to them through Moses.\n \n Through the prophets, he prepared them to accept the salvation destined for all humanity.\n \n God has revealed himself fully by sending his own\n Son, in whom he has established his covenant for ever.\n he Son is his Father's definitive Word; so there will\n be no further Revelation after him until his return.",

   "POST TWO\n \n Catholics believe that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the\n knowledge of the truth that is, of Christ. Jesus Christ must be\n proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this revelation\n may reach to the ends of the earth\n \n \n Catholics believe God graciously arranged that the things he had once\n revealed for the salvation of all peoples should remain in\n their entirety, throughout the ages, and be transmitted to all\n generations.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that Christ the Lord, in whom the entire Revelation of the\n most high God is summed up, commanded the apostles to preach\n the Gospel, which had been promised beforehand by the prophets,\n and which he fulfilled in his own person and promulgated with his\n own lips. In preaching the Gospel, they were to communicate the\n gifts of God to all men. This Gospel was to be the source of all\n saving truth and moral discipline.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that In keeping with the Lord's command, the Gospel was\n handed on in two ways:\n \n - orally by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of\n their preaching, by the example they gave, by the institutions they\n established, what they themselves had received - whether from the\n lips of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they\n had learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit\"\n \n \n - in writing \"by those apostles and other men associated with the\n apostles who, under the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit,\n committed the message of salvation to writing.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe that In order that the full and living Gospel might always be\n preserved the apostles left bishops as their successors.\n They gave them their own position of teaching authority.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special\n way in the inspired books, was also to be preserved in a continuous line\n of succession until the end of time\n \n \n \n Catholics believe this living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit,\n is called Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though\n closely connected to it. Through Tradition, \"the Church, in her doctrine, life, and worship perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that \n she herself is, all that she believes.\" \"The sayings of the holy Fathers are \n a witness to the life-giving presence of this Tradition, showing how its riches \n are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her belief and her prayer.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe the Father's self-communication made through his Word\n in the Holy Spirit, remains present and active in the Church: \n \n \n Catholics believe that God, who spoke in the past, continues to converse with the Spouse of his beloved Son. And the Holy Spirit, through whom the living voice of the Gospel rings out in the Church - and through her in\n the world leading believers to the full truth, and makes the Word\n of Christ dwell in them in all its richness.\n \n \n Catholics believe \"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound\n closely together and communicate one with the other. For both of\n them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together\n in some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same\n goal. Each of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the\n mystery of Christ, who promised to remain with his own \"always,\n to the close of the age.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe \"Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in\n writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit.\"\n \n \"And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of\n God which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord\n and the Holy Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the apostles\n so that, enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully\n preserve, expound, and spread it abroad by their preaching.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe that as a result the Church, to whom the transmission and\n interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her\n certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone.\n Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with\n equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.\n \n \n Catholics believe that the Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what\n they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did\n not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself\n demonstrates the process of living Tradition.\n \n \n Catholics believe Tradition is to be distinguished from the various theological,\n disciplinary, liturgical, or devotional traditions, born in the local churches over time. \n \n These are the particular forms, adapted to different places and\n times, in which the great Tradition is expressed. In the light of Tradition,\n these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the\n guidance of the Church's magisterium.\n \n \n Catholics believe the apostles entrusted the \"Sacred deposit\" of the faith\n as contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, to the whole of the Church. \"By adhering to [this heritage] the entire holy people, united to its pastors, remains always faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. \n \n So, in maintaining, practicing, and professing\n the faith that has been handed on, there should be a remarkable\n harmony between the bishops and the faithful.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word\n of God, whether in its written form or in the form of Tradition, has\n been entrusted to the living, teaching office of the Church alone.\n \n Its authority in this matter is exercised in the name of Jesus\n Christ. This means that the task of interpretation has been\n entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter,\n the Bishop of Rome. But is its servant. It teaches only what has been \n handed on to it. At the divine command and with the help of the Holy Spirit,\n it listens to this devotedly, guards it with dedication, and expounds it\n faithfully. All that it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed\n is drawn from this single deposit of faith.\n \n Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: \"He who hears\n you, hears me,\" the faithful receive with docility the teachings\n and directives that their pastors give them in different forms.\n \n \n Catholics believe the Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds\n from Christ to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is, when it proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an irrevocable adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revelation or also when it proposes, in a definitive way, truths having a necessary connection with these.\n \n \n Catholics believe there is an organic connection between our spiritual life\n and the dogmas. Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they\n illuminate it and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright,\n our intellect and heart will be open to welcome the light shed by\n the dogmas of faith.\n \n \n Catholics Believe the mutual connections between dogmas, and their coherence, can be found in the whole of the Revelation of the mystery of Christ. In Catholic doctrine there exists an order or hierarchy of truths, since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe all the faithful share in understanding and handing on\n revealed truth. They have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit,\n who instructs them and guides them into all truth.\n \n Catholics Believe The whole body of the faithful . . . cannot err in matters\n of belief. This characteristic is shown in the supernatural appreciation\n of faith on the part of the whole people, when, from the bishops to the last of the faithful they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith and morals.\n \n Catholics believe by this appreciation of the faith, aroused and sustained\n by the Spirit of truth, the People of God, guided by the sacred\n teaching authority (Magisterium), . . . receives . . . the faith, once for\n all delivered to the saints. . . . The People unfailingly adheres to this\n faith, penetrates it more deeply with right judgment, and applies\n it more fully in daily life.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe with thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith\n is able to grow in the life of the Church through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts it is in particular theological research [which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which [believers] experience,\"the sacred Scriptures \"grow with the one who reads them.\n \n Catholics also believe that understanding comes from the preaching of those who have received, along with their\n right of succession in the episcopate, the sure charism of truth.\n \n Catholics believe It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrangement\n of God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture, and the Magisterium\n of the Church are so connected and associated that one of\n them cannot stand without the others. Working together, each in\n its own way, under the action of the one Holy Spirit, they all\n contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.\"\n \n \n IN SHORT\n \n \n What Christ entrusted to the apostles, they in turn\n handed on by their preaching and writing, under the\n inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to all generations, until\n Christ returns in glory.\n \n Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a\n single sacred deposit of the Word of God\", in\n which, as in a mirror, the pilgrim Church contemplates\n God, the source of all her riches.\n \n The Church, in her doctrine, life, and worship, perpetuates\n and transmits to every generation all that she\n herself is, all that she believes\n \n Thanks to its supernatural sense of faith, the People of\n God as a whole never ceases to welcome, to penetrate\n more deeply, and to live more fully from the gift of\n divine Revelation.\n \n The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically\n has been entrusted solely to the Magisterium of the\n Church, that is, to the Pope and to the bishops in\n communion with him.",

   "[SIZE=&quot;5&quot;]Post Three[SIZE]\n \n Catholics believe that In order to reveal himself to men, in the condesension of his goodness God speaks to them in human words. Indeed the\n words of God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like\n human language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he\n took on himself the flesh of human weakness, became like men.\n \n \n Catholics believe through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks\n only one single Word, his one Utterance in whom he expresses\n himself completely\n \n \n Catholics believe that one and the same Word of God extends\n throughout Scripture, that it is one and the same Utterance\n that resonds in the mouths of all the sacred writers, since\n he who was in the beginning God with God has no need of\n separate sylibles; for he is not subject to time.\n \n For this reason, the Church has always venrated the\n Scriptures as she venerates the Lord's Body. She never ceases to\n present to the faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of \n God's Word and Christ's Body. \n \n In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her \n nourishment and her strength, for she welcomes it not as a human word,\n but as what it really is, \"the word of God.\"\n \n In the sacred books, the Father who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children, and talks with them.\"\n \n Catholics believe God is the author of Sacred Scripture. The divinly revealed\n realities, which are contained and presented in the text of Sacred Scripture,\n have been written down under the insperation of the Holy Spirit.\n For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the\n apostolic age, accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old\n and the New Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on\n the grounds that, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,\n they have God as their author and have been handed on as such to\n the Church herself.\n \n Catholics believe God inspired the human authors of the sacred books.\n To compose the sacred books, God chose certain men who, all the\n while he employed them in this task, made full use of their own\n facilties and powers so that, though he acted in them and by them,\n it was as true authors that they consigned to writing whatever he\n wanted written, and no more.\n \n Catholics believe the inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that\n the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded\n as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the\n books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that\n truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.\n \n Catholics believe the Christian faith is not a religion of the book.\n Christianity is the religion of the \"Word\" of God, a word which is\n not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and\n living. If the Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ,\n the eternal Word of the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit,\n open [our] minds to understand the Scriptures.\n \n \n Catholics believe that In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way.To interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to\n what the human authors truly wanted to afirm and to what God\n wanted to reveal to us by their words.\n \n Catholics believe that In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the reader must take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the\n literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling,\n speaking, and narrating then current. For the fact is that truth is\n differently presented and expressed in the various types of historical\n writing, in prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of\n literary expression.\n \n But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and\n no less important principle of correct interpretation, with out which\n Scripture would remain a dead letter. Sacred Scripture must be\n read and interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was\n written. The Church offeres three criteria for\n interpreting Scripture in accordance with the Spirit who inspired it.\n \n 1. Be especially attentive to the content and unity of the whole\n Scripture. Different as the books which comprise it may be, Scripture\n is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus\n is the center and heart, open since his Passover. \n \n The phrase \"heart of Christ\" can refer to Sacred Scripture,\n which makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as\n the Scripture was obscure. But the Scripture has been opened\n since the Passion; since those who from then on have understood it,\n consider and discern in what way the prophecies must be interpreted.\n \n 2. Read the Scripture within the living Tradition of the whole\n Church. According to a saying of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is\n written principally in the Church's heart rather than in documents\n and records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living\n memorial of God's Word, and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her\n the spiritual interpretation of the Scripture (according to the\n spiritual meaning which the Spirit grants to the Church).\n \n 3. Be attentive to the anlogy of faith. By \"analogy of faith\" \n we mean the coherence of the truths of faith among themselves and\n within the whole plan of Revelation.\n \n \n Catholics believe according to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between two senses of Scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being subdivided into the allegorical, moral, and anagogical senses. The profound concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to the living reading of Scripture in the Church.\n \n The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture\n and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation\n All other senses of Sacred Scripture are based on the literal. \n Thanks to the unity of God's plan, not only the\n text of Scripture but also the realities and events about which it speaks can be signs.\n \n \n Catholics believe we can acquire a more profound understanding of events by recognizing their signficance in Christ; thus the\n crossing of the Red Sea is a sign or type of Christ's victory and also of Christian Baptism.\n \n Catholics believe the events reported in Scripture ought to lead us to act justly. As St. Paul says, they were written \"for our instruction.\"\n \n Catholics believe we can view realities and events in terms of their eternal significance, leading us toward\n our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is a sign of the heavenly Jerusalem.\n \n \n Catholics believe It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules,\n toward a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of\n Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church \n to form a firmer judgment. For, of course, all that has been said\n about the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to\n the judgment of the Church which exercises the divinely confered\n commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the\n Word of God.\n \n \"I would not believe in the Gospel, had not the authority\n of the Catholic Church already moved me.\"\n \n \n \n Catholics believe It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned\n which writings are to be included in the list of the sacred books\n This complete list is called the canon of Scripture. It includes 46\n books for the Old Testament (45 if we count Jeremiah and Lamentations\n as one) and 27 for the New.\n \n \n The Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,\n Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings,\n 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther,\n 1 and 2 Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs,\n the Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah,\n Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,\n Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.\n \n \n The New Testament: the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark,\n Luke and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the Letters of St. Paul to the Romans,\n 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,\n 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, the Letter to the Hebrews,\n the Letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude, and Revelation (the Apocalypse).\n \n Catholics believe the Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacerd\n Scripture. Its books are divinely inspired and retain a permanent\n value, for the Old Covenant has never been revoked.\n \n Indeed, \"the economy of the Old Testament was deliberately\n so oriented that it should prepare for and declaire in prophecy\n the coming of Christ, redeemer of all men.Even though they\n contain matters imperfect and provisional, the books of the Old\n Testament bear witness to the whole divine pedagogy of God's\n saving love: these writings are a storehouse of sublime teaching\n on God and of sound wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful\n treasury of prayers in them, too, the mystery of our salvation is\n present in a hidden way.\n \n \n Catholic Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of\n God. The Church has always vigorously opposed the idea of\n rejecting the Old Testament under the pretext that the New has\n rendered it void (Marconism).\n \n \n Catholics believe the Word of God, which is the power of God for salvation\n to everyone who has faith, is set forth and displays its power in a\n most wonderful way in the writings of the New Testament\n which hand on the ultimate truth of God's Revelation. Their central\n object is Jesus Christ, God's incarnate Son: his acts, teachings,\n Passion and glorification, and his Church's beginnings under the\n Spirit's guidance.\n \n Catholics believe the Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures because they\n are our principal source for the life and teaching of the Incarnate\n Word, our Savior.\n \n \n Catholics believe we can distingush three stages in the formation of the Gospels:\n \n 1. The life and teaching of Jesus. The Church holds firmly that the\n four Gospels, whose historicity she unhesitatingly affirms, faithfully\n hand on what Jesus, the Son of God, while he lived among men, really did\n and taught for their eternal salvation, until the day when he was taken\n up.\n \n 2. The oral tradition. \"For, after the ascension of the Lord, the \n apostles handed on to their hearers what he had said and done, but with\n that fuller understanding which they, instructed by the glorious events of\n Christ and enlightened by the Spirit of truth, now enjoyed.\n \n 3. The written Gospels. \"The sacred authors, in writing the four\n Gospels, selected certain of the many elements which had been handed on,\n either orally or already in written form, others they synthesized or explained\n with an eye to the situation of the churches, while sustaining the form of preaching, but always in such a fashion that they have told us the\n honest truth about Jesus.\n \n Catholics believe the fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as\n is evident both in the veneration which the liturgy accords it and in\n the surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all times\n \n \n Catholics believe there is no doctrine which could be better, more precious\n and more splendid than the text of the Gospel.\n \n \"Behold and retain what our Lord and Master, Christ, has taught by his\n words and accomplished by his deeds.\"\n \n \"above all it's the Gospels that occupy my mind when I'm\n at prayer; my poor soul has so many needs, and yet this is\n the one thing needful. I'm always finding fresh lights there,\n hidden and enthralling meanings\"\n \n The Church, as early as apostolic times, and then constanly\n in her Tradition, has illuminated the unity of the divine plan\n in the two Testaments through typology, which discerns in God's\n works of the Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished\n in the fullness of time in the person of his incarnate Son. \n \n \n Christians therefore read the Old Testament in the light of\n Christ crucified and risen. Such typological reading discloses the\n inexhaustible content of the Old Testament but it must not make\n us forget that the Old Testament retains its own intrinsic value as\n Revelation reaffirmed by our Lord himself. Besides, the New\n Testament has to be read in the light of the Old. Early Christian\n catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament. As an old\n saying put it, the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the\n Old Testament is unveiled in the New.\n \n Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the\n fulfillment of the divine plan when \"God [will] be everything to\n everyone.\"Nor do the calling of the patriarcs and the exodus\n from Egypt, for example, lose their own value in God's plan, from\n the mere fact that they were intermediate stages.\n \n And such is the force and power of the Word of God that\n it can serve the Church as her support and vigor and the children\n of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a\n pure and lasting font of spiritual life. Hence access to Sacred\n Scripture ought to be open wide to the Christian faithful.\n \n \n Therefore, the 'study of the sacred page' should be the\n very soul of sacred theology. The ministry of the Word, too \n pastoral preaching, catechetics, and all forms of Christian instruction, \n among which the liturgical homily should hold pride of place \n is healthily nourished and thrives in holiness through the Word\n of Scripture.\n \n The Church forcefully and specifically exhorts all the\n Christian faithful . . . to learn the surpassing knowledge of Jesus \n Christ by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures. Ignorance of\n the Scriptures is ignorance of Christ.\n \n \n To Recap\n \n \n All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and this one\n book is Christ, \"because all divine Scripture speaks of\n Christ, and all divine Scripture is fulfilled in Christ\"\n \n The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and,\n because they are inspired they are truly the Word of\n God\" \n \n God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he\n inspired its human authors; he acts in them and by\n means of them. He thus gives assurance that their\n writings teach without error his saving truth \n \n Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be attentive\n above all to what God wants to reveal through the\n sacred authors for our salvation. What comes from the\n Spirit is not fully \"understood except by the Spirit's\n action\"\n \n \n The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the 46\n books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the New.\n \n The four Gospels occupy a central place because\n Christ Jesus is their center.\n \n The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the\n unity of God's plan and his Revelation. The Old\n Testament prepares for the New and the New\n Testament fulfills the Old; the two shed light on each other;\n both are true Word of God.\n \n The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures\n as she venerated the Body of the Lord\"\n both nourish and govern the whole Christian life.\n \"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path\"",

   "POST FOUR\n \n \n Catholics believe by his Revelation, the invisble God, from the fullness of\n his love, addresses men as his friends, and moves among them, in\n order to invite and receive them into his own company. The\n adequate response to this invitation is faith.\n \n By faith, man completely submits his intellect and his will\n to God. With his whole being man gives his assent to God the\n revealer. Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the\n author of revelation, \"the obedience of faith.\" \n \n To obey (from the Latin ob-audire, to \"hear or listen to\") in\n faith is to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because\n its truth is guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself. Abraham is the\n model of such obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture. The Virgin\n Mary is its most perfect embodment.\n \n Abraham - \"father of all who believe\"\n \n The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of\n Israel's ancestors, lays special emphasis on Abraham's faith: By\n faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place \n which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not\n knowing where he was to go. By faith, he lived as a stranger and\n pilgrim in the promised land. By faith, Sarah was given to conceive\n the son of the promise. And by faith Abraham offered his only\n son in sacrifice.\n \n Catholics then believe that Abraham fulfills the definition of faith in Hebrews \n 11:1: \"Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of\n things not seen\":Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to\n him as righteousness.\" Because he was \"strong in his faith,\"\n Abraham became the \"father of all who believe.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe the Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith. The\n Letter to the Hebrews proclaims its eulogy of the examplary faith of\n the ancestors who \"received divine approval.\" Yet \"God had\n foreseen something better for us\": the grace of believing in his Son\n Jesus, \"the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe the Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience\n of faith. By faith Mary welcomes the tidings and promise brought \n by the angel Gabriel, believing that \"with God nothing will be\n impossible\" and so giving her assent: \"Behold I am the handmaid\n of the Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word.\"\n Elizabeth greeted her: \"Blessed is she who believed that there\n would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n It is for this faith that all generations have called Mary blessed\n \n Throughout her life and until her last ordeal when Jesus\n her son died on the cross, Mary's faith never wavered. She never\n ceased to believe in the fulfillment of God's word. And so the\n Church venerates in Mary the purest realisation of faith.\n \n Catholics believe Faith is first of all a personal adhernce of man to God. At\n the same time, and inseaprably, it is a free assent to the whole truth\n that God has revealed. As personal adherence to God and assent to\n his truth, Christian faith differs from our faith in any human person. \n It is right and just to entrust oneself wholly to God and to\n believe absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place\n such faith in a creature.\n \n \n \n Catholics believe that for a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his \"beloved Son,\" in whom the Father\n is \"well pleased\"; God tells us to listen to him. The Lord himself\n said to his disciples: \"Believe in God, believe also in me.\" We can\n believe in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made\n flesh: \"No one has ever seen God the only Son, who is in the bosom\n of the Father, he has made him known.\" Because only he \"has seen the\n Father,\" Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him.\n \n \n Catholics believe One cannot believe in Jesus Christ without sharing in his\n Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who reveals to men who Jesus is. For no one can say Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit, who searches everything, even the depths of God. \n \n No one comprehends the thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God.\n Only God knows God completely: we believe in the Holy Spirit because he is God.\n \n The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in the one and only God:\n Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n \n Catholics believe when St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son\n of the living God, Jesus declared to him that this revelation did not \n come \"from flesh and blood,\" but from \"my Father who is in\n heaven.\" Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him.\n Before this faith can be exercised, man must have the grace of God\n to move and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the HolySpirit, who moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the \n eyes of the mind and makes it easy for all to accept and believe the\n truth.\n \n Although Catholics believe that Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps of the Holy Spirit It is no less true that believing is an authentically human act. \n \n Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has revealed are contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason. Even in human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other persons tell us about themselves and their intentions or to trust their promises (for example, when a man and a woman marry) to share a communion of life with one another. \n If this is so, still less is it contrary to our dignity to yield by faith the\n full submission of . . . intellect and will to God who reveals, and\n to share in an interior communion with him.\n \n Catholics believe that In faith, the human intellect and will cooperate with divine grace: Believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the divine truth by command of the will moved by God through grace.\n \n Thus what moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed\n truths appear as true and intelligible in the light of our natural\n reason: we believe because of the authority of God himself who reveals them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. So that\n the submission of our faith might nevertheless be in accordance\n with reason, God willed that external proofs of his Revelation\n should be joined to the internal helps of the Holy Spirit. Thus\n the miracles of Christ and the saints, prophecies, the Church's\n growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability are the\n most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence\n of all they are motives of credibility, which show that the assent of faith is \n by no means a blind impulse of the mind.\n \n Catholics believe that Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowledge because it is founded on the very word of God who cannot lie. \n To be sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason\n and experience, but the certainty that the divine light gives is\n greater than that which the light of natural reason gives.Ten\n thousand difficulties do not make one doubt. \n \n Catholics believe Faith seeks understanding it is intrinsic to faith that a\n believer desires to know better the One in whom he has put his\n faith and to understand better what He has revealed; a more \n pentrating knowledge will in turn call forth a greeter faith,\n increasingly set afire by love. The grace of faith opens the eyes of \n our hearts to a lively understanding of the contents of Revelation:\n that is, of the totality of God's plan and the mysteries of faith\n of their connection with each other and with Christ, the center of \n the revealed mystery. The same Holy Spirit constantly perfects\n faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may be more and more profoundly\n understood. \n \n In the words of St. Augustine, \"I believe,in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe.\"\n \n \n Catholics believe although faith is above reason, there can\n never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the\n same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed\n the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself,\n nor can truth ever contradict truth.Consequently, methodical\n research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in\n a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can\n never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and \n the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and\n persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it\n were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the\n conserver of all things, who made them what they are.\n \n Catholics believe to be human, man's response to God by faith must be\n free, and . . . therefore nobody is to be forced to embrace the faith\n against his will. The act of faith is of its very nature a free act. \n \n Catholics believe God calls men to serve him in spirit and in truth. Consequently they are bound to him in conscience, but not coerced. . . . This fact received its fullest manifestation in Christ Jesus. Indeed, Christ\n invited people to faith and conversion, but never coerced them.\n For he bore witness to the truth but refused to use force to impose\n it on those who spoke against it. His kingdom . . . grows by the love\n with which Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws men to himself.\n \n Catholics believe that Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation. Since\n without faith it is impossible to please [God] and to attain to the \n fellowship of his son, therefore without faith no one has ever\n attained justification, nor will anyone obtain eternal life but he\n who endures to the end. \n \n Cathlics believe Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can\n lose this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated to St. Timothy: \"Wage\n the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience.\" By rejecting \n conscience, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith.\n To live, grow, and persevre in the faith until the end we must\n nourish it with the word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase\n our faith; it must be \"working through charity,\" abounding in \n hope, and rooted in the faith of the Church. \n \n Catholics believe Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific\n vision, the goal of our journey here below. Then we shall see God \n \"face to face,\" as he is. So faith is already the beginning of\n eternal life:\n \n \n When we contemplate the blessings of faith even now, as if\n gazing at a reflection in a mirror, it is as if we already\n possessed the wonderful things which our faith assures us\n we shall one day enjoy.\n \n \n Now, however, \"we walk by faith, not by sight\"; we\n perceive God as \"in a mirror, dimly\" and only \"in part.\" Even\n though enlightened by him in whom it believes, faith is often lived\n in darkness and can be put to the test. The world we live in often\n seems very far from the one promised us by faith. Our experiences\n of evil and suffering, injustice, and death, seem to contradict the\n Good News; they can shake our faith and become a temptation\n against it.\n \n It is then we must turn to the witnesses of faith: to Abraham,\n who \"in hope . . . believed against hope\" to the Virgin Mary, who,\n in her pilgrimage of faith, walked into the night of faith in\n sharing the darkness of her son's suffering and death; and to so\n many others: Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a\n cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which\n clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is\n set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.\n \n Catholics believe Faith is a personal act - the free response of the human\n person to the initiative of God who reveals himself. But faith is not\n an isolated act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live\n alone. You have not given yourself faith as you have not given\n yourself life. The believer has received faith from others and should\n hand it on to others. Our love for Jesus and for our neighbour impels\n us to speak to others about our faith. Each believer is thus a link in\n the great chain of believers. I cannot believe without being carried\n by the faith of others, and by my faith I help support others in the faith.\n \n \"I believe\" (Apostles' Creed) is the faith of the Church\n professed personally by each believer, principally during Baptism.\n \"We believe\" (Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) is the faith of the\n Church confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more\n generally by the liturgical assembly of believers. \"I believe\" is also\n the Church, our mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches\n us to say both \"I believe\" and \"We believe.\"\n \n \n It is the Church that believes first, and so bears, nourishes,\n and sustains my faith. Everywhere, it is the Church that first\n confesses the Lord: Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims\n Christ as we sing in the hymn \"Te Deum\"; with her and in\n her, we are won over and brought to confess: \"I believe,\" - \"We\n believe.\" It is through the Church that we receive faith and new life\n in Christ by Baptism. In the Rituale Romanum, the minister of\n Baptism asks the catechumen: \"What do you ask of God's\n Church?\" And the answer is: \"Faith.\" \"What does faith offer you?\"\n \"Eternal life.\"\n \n Catholics believe Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive\n the life of faith through the Church, she is our mother: We believe\n the Church as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church\n as if she were the author of our salvation. Because she is our\n mother, she is also our teacher in the faith.\n \n \n Catholics do not believe in formulas, but in those realities they\n express, which faith allows us to touch. The believer's act [of faith]\n does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which\n they express].All the same, we do approach these realties with\n the help of formultions of the faith which permit us to express the\n faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate\n and live on it more and more.\n \n The Church, \"the pillar and bulwark of the truth,\" faithfully guards \n the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. \n She guards the memory of Christ's words; it is she who\n from generation to generation hands on the apostles' confession of\n faith. As a mother who teaches her children to speak and so to\n understand and communicate, the Church our Mother teaches us\n the language of faith in order to introduce us to the understanding\n and the life of faith.\n \n \n Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures,\n peoples, and nations, the Church has constantly confessed this one\n faith, received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and\n grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and\n Father. St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a witness of this faith, declared:\n \n \"Indeed, the Church, though scattered throughout the whole world,\n even to the ends of the earth, having received the faith from the apostles and their disciples . . . \n guards [this preaching and faith] with care, as dwelling in but a single house, and similarly\n believes as if having but one soul and a single heart, and preaches,\n teaches, and hands on this faith with a unanimous voice, as if\n possessing only one mouth.\"\n \n For though languages differ throughout the world, the\n content of the Tradition is one and the same. The Churches established\n in Germany have no other faith or Tradition, nor do those\n of the Iberians, nor those of the Celts, nor those of the East, of Egypt,\n of Libya, nor those established at the center of the world. . . . The\n Church's message is true and solid, in which one and the same\n way of salvation appears throughout the whole world.\n \n \n Catholics guard with care the faith that we have received from\n the Church, for without ceasing, under the action of God's Spirit,\n this deposit of great price, as if in an excellent vessel, is constantly\n being renewed and causes the very vessel that contains it to be\n renewed.\n \n \n \n IN BRIEF\n \n \n Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God\n who reveals himself. It involves an assent of the\n intellect and will to the self-revelation God has made\n through his deeds and words.\n \n \"To believe\" has a twofold reference: to the person\n and to the truth: to the truth, by trust in the person\n who bears witness to it.\n \n We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son,\n and the Holy Spirit.\n \n Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to believe,\n man needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Believing is a human act, conscious and free,\n corresponding to the dignity of the human person.\n \n Believing is an ecclesial act. The Church's faith\n precedes, engenders, supports, and nourishes our faith.\n The Church is the mother of all believers. No one can\n have God as Father who does not have the Church as\n Mother\n \n We believe all that which is contained in the word of God,\n written or handed down, and which the Church\n proposes for belief as divinely revealed\n \n Faith is necessary for salvation. The Lord himself affirms:\n \"He who believes and is baptized will be saved;\n but he who does not believe will be condemned\" (Mk 16:16).\n \n \"Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us\n blessed in the life to come\" (St. Thomas Aquinas).",

   "Truth be told Jim, just as many religious officials of other Christian sects engage in sex abuse as Catholics do. Still no excuse.\n Agreed. I suspect the problem is to be found within all large groups, especially those where the 'leaders' opine that they are more godly than the average listener.\n \n \nBut you hardly hear the cases where a Pentecostal or Protestant is banging minor followers and telling them 'Touch not Mine anointed and do my prophets no harm' to get them to shut up. I believe there was a case in TX. where such a case happened. Poor girl had 'demons of lesbianism' in her that had to be exercised...\nCorrect. Few of them get caught while yeilding to their natural drives to have orgasms. Jimmy Swaggart comes to mind...but he was chasing whores, not alterboys. The Right Reverend Jesse Jackson strayed a bit from his preachings...but he was excercising his right to have a mistress, not molesting young boys. I'm not doubting that you can come up with a list of Protestant child molesters. As a matter of fact, I'd bet that the percentage of Protestant child molesters within the whole group of child molesters differs little from the percentage of Protestants in the world's population. What is perculiar to the RCC in this regard is its willingness to enable perverted priests by merely shipping them to another congregation when they should be defrocked and shipped to the courts.\n \n \n\n The only group that can outdo religious officials in sex abuse of children...is school teachers.\n...and they usually lose their credentials when caught.\n \n \n\n There are specific reasons why Catholics (in America) are focused on.\n The cover up was cowardly and those involved should have been publically defrocked, excommunicated and tossed to what ever judicial system that applied.\nWhat makes you think the church hierachy has changed their MO? I'm betting the cover-up continues as we speak.\n \n \n\n The one issue you didn't mention that should apply is Catholics apparent willingness to offer forgiveness at the drop of a hat (especially when it isn't even asked for). An exagerated practice of that 'forgiving your brother 7 times 77 thing...'\nEnlighten me...I thought Catholics had to ask for forgiveness by going to confession and telling the priest of their sins whereupon the priest gives them absolution after they recite 'Hail Mary' repeatedly.\n \n \nthere is no excuse and no justification for any of the acts perpetraited by those involved in this scandle but the words of Christ, as he takes the hand of St Mary Magdelain ring out in the church. \"your sins and I know they are many are forgiven you - Go and sin no more\"\nThere is also no excuse and no justification for the RCC to allow the perps to remain in contact with children. Actually, there's no excuse or justification for the RCC not to join the affected families in seeking prosecution and appropriate punishment of the perps.\n \n \n\n The Holy Spirit reminds me by the actions of the Church what Christ said to her who had commited a sin in a society who deemed it \"unforgivable\" and demanded \"death\" - \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\"\nActually, Christ said that to the crowd holding the stones.\n \n By which actions of the church? \n \n \n \n\n I myself have been in the position where I was the one who's sins demanded death(hell) and Christ said to me \"your sins and I know they are many are forgiven you - Go and sin no more\" and now with those caught up in these sins I find that Christ says the same to them as he did/does to me and at the same time reminds me (a would be stone caster) of my failures \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\"\nHave you sinned no more since then?\n \n I believe that child molesters tend to be repeat offenders. Surely, the church knows that saying 'go and sin no more' is NOT a guarantee that the sinner will cease molesting children. Surely, the church knows that if the molester is again placed in charge of children...anywhere, he will again succumb to the temptations of the flesh...in that he (the priest) is nothing more than a fleshed out skeleton, trained in the ways of the church and given the power to control malleable minds.\n \n \n \n\n The Acts of these human individuals are so monstrous so vile they truely convey they weakness of fallen human nature and the extent of the depravity that is evil's temptation yet the actions of the divine church are so loving, so forgiving so incomprehensible to the finite mind they truly reflect the Unlimited Goodness and Inexahustable Mercy of God.\n...proving the adage that love is blind. The church is blind to the concept of ridding one's organization (hierarchy) of known, perverted individuals. If we all adopted the over-forgiving stance of the RCC, we'd release our convicted child molesters and tell them not to do it anymore.",

Amen \n .\n \n \n \n The Nicene Creed\n \n We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty\n maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen. \n We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christthe only Son of God, \n \n eternally begotten of the Father, \n God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, \n begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. \n Through him all things were made. \n For us men and for our salvation\n he came down from heaven\n \n By the power of the holy spirit \n he was born of the Virgin Mary, \n and became man. \n \n \n For our sake he was crucified \n under Pontius Pilate; \n he suffered death and was buried. \n \n On the third day he rose again \n in fulfillment of the Scriptures; \n he ascended into heaven \n and is seated at the right \n hand of the Father. \n He will come again in glory \n to judge the living and the dead\n and his kingdom will have no end.\n \n We believe in the Holy Spirit, \n the Lord, the giver of life, \n who proceeds from the \n Father and the Son. \n With the Father and the Son he is \n worshipped and glorified. \n He has spoken through the Prophets. \n \n We believe in one holy \n catholic and apostolic Church. \n We acknowledge one \n baptism for the forgiveness of sins. \n We look for the resurrection \n of the dead, \n and the life of the world to come.\n Amen.\n \n \n \n THE CREEDS\n \n \n Catholics believe whoever says \"I believe\" says \"I pledge myself to what we\n believe.\" Communion in faith needs a common language of faith,\n normative for all and uniting all in the same confession of faith.\n \n From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and\n handed on her faith in brief formulae for all. But already early on,\n the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of its faith\n into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for\n candidates for Baptism: \n \n \n This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human\n opinions, but rather what was of the greatest importance was\n gathered from all the Scriptures, to present the one teaching\n of the faith in its entirety. And just as the mustard seed\n contains a great number of branches in a tiny grain, so too\n this summary of faith encompassed in a few words the whole\n knowledge of the true religion contained in the Old and\n New Testaments.\n \n \n Such syntheses are called \"professions of faith\" since they\n summarize the faith that Christians profess. They are called\n \"creeds\" on account of what is usually their first word in Latin:\n credo (\"I believe\"). They are also called \"symbols of faith.\" \n \n The Greek word symbolon meant half of a broken object, for\n example, a seal presented as a token of recognition. The broken parts were\n placed together to verify the bearer's identity. The symbol of faith, then, is\n \n a sign of recognition and communion between believers. Symbolon also\n means a gathering, collection, or summary. A symbol of faith is a summary\n of the principal truths of the faith and therefore serves as the first and\n fundamental point of reference for catechesis.\n \n The first \"profession of faith\" is made during Baptism. The\n symbol of faith is first and foremost the baptismal creed. Since\n \n Baptism is given \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of\n the Holy Spirit,\" the truths of faith professed during Baptism are\n articulated in terms of their reference to the three persons of the\n Holy Trinity. \n \n And so the Creed is divided into three parts: the first part\n speaks of the first divine Person and the wonderful work of creation;\n the next speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery\n of his redemption of men; the final part speaks of the third divine\n Person, the origin and source of our sanctification. These are\n the three chapters of our [baptismal] seal.\n \n These three parts are distinct although connected with\n one another. According to a comparison often used by the Fathers,\n we call them articles. Indeed, just as in our bodily members there\n are certain articulations which distinguish and separate them, so\n \n too in this profession of faith, the name articles has justly and rightly\n been given to the truths we must believe particularly and distinctly.\n In accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested\n to by St. Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the\n Creed as twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith\n by the number of the apostles.7\n \n \n Through the centuries many professions or symbols of\n faith have been articulated in response to the needs of the different\n eras: the creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches,\n e.g., the Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed; the professions\n of faith of certain Councils, such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons,\n Trent; or the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi or\n the Credo of the People of God of Paul VI\n \n None of the creeds from the different stages in the\n Church's life can be considered superseded or irrelevant. They help\n us today to attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the\n different summaries made of it.\n \n Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church's life:\n \n The Apostles' Creed is so called because it is rightly considered\n to be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith. It is the ancient\n baptismal symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises\n from this fact: it is the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter\n the first of the apostles, to which he brought the common faith.\n \n The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its\n great authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecumenical\n Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the great \n Churches of both East and West to this day.\n \n \n As on the day of our Baptism, when our whole life was\n entrusted to the \"standard of teaching,\" Catholics embrace the\n Creed of our life-giving faith. To say the Credo with faith is to enter into\n communion with God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and also with\n the whole Church which transmits the faith to us and in whose\n midst we believe: \n \n \n This Creed is the spiritual seal, our heart's meditation and \n an ever-present guardian; it is, unquestionably, the treasure \n of our soul.\n \n \n \n A Catholics profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First\n and the Last, the beginning and the end of everything. The Credo\n begins with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine person\n of the Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of\n heaven and earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation\n of all God's works.\n \n \n \"I believe in God\": this first affirmation of the Apostles'\n Creed is also the most fundamental. The whole Creed speaks of\n God, and when it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in\n relation to God. The other articles of the Creed all depend on the\n first, just as the remaining Commandments make the first explicit.\n The other articles help us to know God better as he revealed himself\n progressively to men. \"The faithful first profess their belief in God.\"\n \n \n These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan\n Creed begins. The confession of God's oneness, which has its roots\n in the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the \n profession of God's existence and is equally fundamental. God is unique;\n there is only one God: The Christian faith confesses that God is one\n in nature, substance and essence.\n \n \n To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One:\n \"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love\n the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and\n with all your might. Through the prophets, God calls Israel and\n all nations to turn to him, the one and only God: \"Turn to me and\n be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no\n other.... To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.\n Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and\n strength.\n \n Jesus himself affirms that God is \"the one Lord\" whom you\n must love \"with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all\n your mind, and with all your strength\". At the same time Jesus\n gives us to understand that he himself is the Lord. To confess\n that Jesus is Lord is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not\n contrary to belief in the One God. Nor does believing in the Holy\n Spirit as \"Lord and giver of life\" introduce any division into the One God:\n \n Catholics firmly believe and confess without reservation that there \n is only one true God, eternal, infinite (immensus) and\n unchangeable, incomprehensible, almighty, and ineffable, the\n Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed,\n but one essence, substance or nature entirely simple.\n \n Catholics believe God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his\n name known to them. A name expresses a person's essence and\n identity and the meaning of this person's life. God has a name; he\n is not an anonymous force. To disclose one's name is to make\n oneself known to others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by\n becoming accessible, capable of being known more intimately and\n addressed personally.\n \n Catholics believe God revealed himself progressively and under different\n names to his people, but the revelation that proved to be the\n fundamental one for both the Old and the New Covenants was the\n revelation of the divine name to Moses in the theophany of the\n burning bush, on the threshold of the exodus and of the covenant\n on Sinai.\n \n \n God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that burns\n without being consumed: \"I am the God of your father, the God\n of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is the\n God of the fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs\n in their wanderings. He is the faithful and compassionate God who\n remembers them and his promises; he comes to free their descendants\n from slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time,\n can do this and wills to do it, the God who will put his almighty\n power to work for this plan. \n \n \n Moses said to God, If I come to the people of Israel and say\n to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and they\n ask me, What is his name? what shall I say to them? God said\n to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM.\" And he said, Say this to the\n people of Israel, I AM has sent me to you. . . this is my name\n for ever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all\n generations\n \n \n Catholics believe that In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH (\"I AM HE WHO\n IS, \" \"I AM WHO AM\" or \"I AM WHO I AM\"), God says who he is and\n by what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious\n just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something\n like the refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what\n he is - infinitely above everything that we can understand or say:\n he is the \"hidden God, \" his name is ineffable, and he is the God\n who makes himself close to men.\n \n By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his\n faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the\n past (\"I am the God of your fathers\"), as for the future (\"I will be\n with you\"). God, who reveals his name as \"I AM,\" reveals himself\n as the God who is always there, present to his people in order to\n save them. \n \n Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence,\n man discovers his own insignificance. Before the burning bush,\n Moses takes off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of\n God's holiness. Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah\n cries out: \"Woe is me! I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips.\"\n Before the divine signs wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: \"Depart\n from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.\" But because God is holy,\n he can forgive the man who realizes that he is a sinner before him:\n \"I will not execute my fierce anger . . . for I am God and not man,\n the Holy One in your midst.\" The apostle John says likewise: \"We\n shall . . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts\n condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows\n everything.\"\n \n Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not\n pronounce his name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed name\n (YHWH) is replaced by the divine title \"LORD\" (in Hebrew Adonai, in Greek\n Kyrios). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus will be acclaimed:\n \"Jesus is LORD.\"\n \n After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from\n God to worship the golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of\n intercession and agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, \n thus demonstrating his love. When Moses asks to see his glory,\n God responds \"I will make all my goodness pass before you, and\n will proclaim before you my name 'the LORD' [YHWH].\" Then the\n LORD passes before Moses and proclaims, \"YHWH, YHWH, a God\n merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast\n love and faithfulness\"; Moses then confesses that the LORD is a\n forgiving God.\n \n The divine name, \"I Am\" or \"He Is,\" expresses God's\n faithfulness: despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punishment\n it deserves, he keeps \"steadfast love for thousands.\" By\n going so far as to give up his own Son for us, God reveals that he\n is \"rich in mercy. By giving his life to free us from sin, Jesus\n reveals that he himself bears the divine name: \"When you have\n lifted up the Son of man, then you will realize that \"I AM\"\n \n \n Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and\n deepen realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the\n divine name. God is unique; there are no other gods besides him.\n He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth:\n \n \"They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a\n garment . . . but you are the same, and your years have no end.\"\n In God \"there is no variation or shadow due to change.\" God is\n \"HE WHO IS,\" from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains\n ever faithful to himself and to his promises.\n \n Catholics believe the revelation of the ineffable name \"I Am who Am\"\n contains then the truth that God alone IS. The Greek Septuagint\n translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church's\n Tradition, understood the divine name in this sense: God is the\n fullness of Being and of every perfection, without origin and\n without end. All creatures receive all that they are and have from\n him; but he alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything\n that he is.\n \n God, \"He Who Is,\" revealed himself to Israel as the one\n \"abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\" These two terms\n express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works\n God displays, not only his kindness, goodness, grace and steadfast \n love, but also his trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness, and\n truth. \"I give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your\n faithfulness.\" He is the Truth, for \"God is light and in him there\n is no darkness\"; \"God is love,\" as the apostle John teaches....\n \n \n \"The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your\n righteous ordinances endures forever.\" \"And now, O LORD God,\n you are God, and your words are true;\" this is why God's \n promises always come true. God is Truth itself, whose words \n cannot deceive. This is why one can abandon oneself in full trust\n to the truth and faithfulness of his word in all things. The beginning\n of sin and of man's fall was due to a lie of the tempter who induced\n doubt of God's word, kindness and faithfulness. \n \n God's truth is his Wisdom, which commands the whole\n created order and governs the world. God, who alone made\n heaven and earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created\n thing in relation to himself.\n \n God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching\n that comes from God is \"true instruction.\" When he sends his Son\n into the world it will be \"to bear witness to the truth\": \"We know\n that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to\n know him who is true.\" \n \n \n In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that\n God had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive\n for choosing them from among all peoples as his special possession:\n his sheer gratuitous love. And thanks to the prophets Israel\n understood that it was again out of love that God never stopped\n saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.\n \n God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his\n son. His love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her\n children. God loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved;\n his love will be victorious over even the worst infidelities\n and will extend to his most precious gift: \"God so loved the world\n that he gave his only Son.\"\n \n God's love is \"everlasting\": \"For the mountains may\n depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not\n depart from you.\" Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people,\n \"I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued\n my faithfulness to you.\"\n \n But St. John goes even further when he affirms that \"God\n is love\": God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and \n the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his \n innermost secret: God himself is an eternal exchange of love, \n Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that\n exchange. \n \n \n For Catholics Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all\n our being has enormous consequences for our whole life.\n \n It means coming to know God's greatness and majesty: \n \"Behold, God is great, and we know him not.\" Therefore, we must \"serve\n God first.\"\n \n \n It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One,\n everything we are and have comes from him: \"What have you that\n you did not receive?\" \"What shall I render to the LORD for all his\n bounty to me?\"\n \n It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: \n Everyone is made in the image and likeness of God.\n \n \n It means making good use of created things: faith in God,\n the only One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar \n as it brings us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar\n as it turns us away from him:\n \n My Lord and my God, take from me everything that\n distances me from you. \n My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me\n closer to you \n \n My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all\n to you.\n \n It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in \n adversity. A prayer of St. Teresa of Jesus wonderfully expresses this trust: \n \n Let nothing trouble you / Let nothing frighten you \n Everything passes / God never changes \n Patience / Obtains all \n Whoever has God / Wants for nothing \n God alone is enough.\n \n IN SHORT\n \n \n \"Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD . . .\"\n (Dt 6:4; Mk 12:29). \"The supreme being must be\n unique, without equal. . . . If God is not one, he is not\n God\" \n \n Faith in God leads us to turn to him alone as our first\n origin and our ultimate goal, and neither to prefer\n anything to him nor to substitute anything for him.\n \n Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery\n beyond words: \"If you understood him, he would not\n be God\" \n \n The God of our faith has revealed himself as He who is;\n and he has made himself known as \"abounding in\n steadfast love and faithfulness\" (Ex 34:6). God's very\n being is Truth and Love.",

   "POST SIX\n \n Catholic Christians are baptized \"in the name of the Father and of\n the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\" Before receiving the sacrament,\n they respond to a three-part question when asked to confess the\n Father, the Son and the Spirit: \"I do.\" Catholics believe the faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity.\n \n Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the\n Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names, for there is only one\n God, the almighty Father, his only Son, and the Holy Spirit: the\n Most Holy Trinity.\n \n The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery\n of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is\n therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that\n enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching\n in the \"hierarchy of the truths of faith.\" The whole history of\n salvation is identical with the history of the way and the means by \n which the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, reveals\n himself to men and reconciles and unites with himself those who\n turn away from sin.\n \n \n The Fathers of the Catholic Church distinguish between theology (theologia)\n and economy (oikonomia). \"Theology\" refers to the mystery of God's\n inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and \"economy\" to all the works by\n which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the oikonomia\n the theologia is revealed to us; but conversely, the theologia illuminates \n the whole oikonomia. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the\n mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works.\n So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself\n in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand\n his actions.\n \n The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of\n the mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known\n unless they are revealed by God. To be sure, God has left traces\n of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation\n throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy\n Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to\n Israel's faith before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending\n of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Many religions invoke God as \"Father. \" The deity is often\n considered the \"father of gods and of men.\" In Israel, God is called\n \"Father\" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world. Even more, God\n is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel,\n \"his first-born son.\" God is also called the Father of the king of\n Israel. Most especially he is the Father of the poor, of the\n orphaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection.\n \n By calling God \"Father,\" the language of faith indicates two main\n things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent authority;\n and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for all his\n children. God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the image of\n motherhood, which emphasizes God's immanence, the intimacy\n between Creator and creature. \n \n The language of faith thus draws on the human experience of parents, \n who are in a way the first representatives of God for man. \n But this experience also tells us that human parents are\n fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and motherhood. (Here is a interesting one for you simone) We\n ought therefore to recall that God transcends the human distinction\n between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God. He also\n transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, although he is their origin\n and standard: no one is father as God is Father.\n \n Catholics believe Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense:\n he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father in\n relation to his only Son, who is eternally Son only in\n relation to his Father: No one knows the Son except the Father,\n and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom\n the Son chooses to reveal him.\n \n For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word:\n \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\n the Word was God\"; as \"the image of the invisible God\"; as the\n \"radiance of the glory of God and the very stamp of his nature.\"\n \n Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed\n at the first ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is \n \"consubstantial\" with the Father, that is, one only God with him. The\n second ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this\n expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed\n \"the only- begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father,\n light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made,\n consubstantial with the Father.\"\n \n \n Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of\n \"another Paraclete\" (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since\n creation, having previously \"spoken through the prophets\", the Spirit\n will now be with and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them\n \"into all the truth.\"68 The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another\n \n divine person with Jesus and the Father.\n The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his\n mission in time. The Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church\n both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person,\n once he had returned to the Father. The sending of the person of\n the Spirit after Jesus' glorification reveals in its fullness the\n mystery of the Holy Trinity.\n \n The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by\n the second ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): \"We believe\n in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from\n the Father.\" By this confession, the Church recognizes the\n Father as \"the source and origin of the whole divinity.\" But the\n eternal origin of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin:\n \"The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and\n equal with the Father and the Son, of the same substance and also\n of the same nature. . . Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father\n alone, . . . but the Spirit of both the Father and the Son.\" The Creed\n of the Church from the Council of Constantinople confesses: \"With\n the Father and the Son, he is worshipped and glorified.\"\n \n The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit\n \"proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque).\" The Council of\n Florence in 1438 explains: \"The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father\n and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the\n Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one\n principle and through one spiration . . . . And, since the Father has\n through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that\n belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally\n from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit\n proceeds from the Son.\"\n \n The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed\n confessed in 381 at Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient\n Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it dogmatically in\n 447, even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon, came to\n Recognize and receive the Symbol of 381. The use of this formula in the\n Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin liturgy (between the eighth\n and eleventh centuries). The introduction of the filioque into the\n Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy constitutes moreover,\n even today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox Churches.\n \n At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character\n as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he \"who proceeds\n from the Father,\" it affirms that he comes from the Father through the Son.\n The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion\n between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father\n and the Son (filioque). It says this, \"legitimately and with good reason,\"\n for the eternal order of the divine persons in their consubstantial communion\n implies that the Father, as \"the principle without principle,\" is the\n first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with\n the Son, the single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.\n This legitimate complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not\n affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.\n \n \n \n From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity\n has been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally\n by means of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal\n faith, formulated in the preaching, catechesis, and prayer of the\n Church. Such formulations are already found in the apostolic\n writings, such as this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy:\n \"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the\n fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\"\n \n During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify its\n Trinitarian faith, both to deepen its own understanding of the faith\n and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This\n clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the\n theological work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the\n Christian people's sense of the faith.\n \n In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to\n develop her own terminology with the help of certain notions of philosophical\n origin: \"substance,\" \"person\" or \"hypostasis,\" \"relation,\" and so on. In\n doing this, she did not submit the faith to human wisdom, but gave a new\n and unprecedented meaning to these terms, which from then on would be\n used to signify an ineffable mystery, \"infinitely beyond all that we can\n humanly understand.\"\n \n The Church uses (I) the term \"substance\" (rendered also\n at times by \"essence\" or \"nature\") to designate the divine being in\n its unity, (II) the term \"person\" or \"hypostasis\" to designate\n the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them,\n and (III) the term \"relation\" to designate the fact that their\n distinction lies in the relationship of each to the others.\n \n The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one\n God in three persons, the \"consubstantial Trinity.\" The divine\n persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each\n of them is God whole and entire: \"The Father is that which the Son\n is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that\n which the Holy Spirit is, i.e., by nature one God. In the words\n of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), \"Each of the persons is that\n supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature.\"\n \n The divine persons are really distinct from one another. \"God is\n one but not solitary.\" \"Father,\" \"Son,\" \"Holy Spirit\" are not\n simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they\n are really distinct from one another: \"He is not the Father who is\n the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit\n he who is the Father or the Son.\" They are distinct from one\n another in their relations of origin: \"It is the Father who generates,\n the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.\" The\n divine Unity is Triune. \n \n The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does\n not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from\n one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to\n one another: \"In the relational names of the persons the Father is\n related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both.\n While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we\n believe in one nature or substance. Indeed \"everything (in them)\n is one where there is no opposition of relationship.\" \"Because of\n that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy\n Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit;\n the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son.\n \n St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called \"the Theologian,\"\n entrusts this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of\n Constantinople: \n \n \n \"Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which\n I live and fight, which I want to take with me as a companion,\n and which makes me bear all evils and despise all pleasures:\n I mean the profession of faith in the Father and the Son and\n the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you today. By it I am soon going\n to plunge you into water and raise you up from it. I give it\n to you as the companion and patron of your whole life. I give\n you but one divinity and power, existing one in three, and\n containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without\n disparity of substance or nature, without superior degree\n that raises up or inferior degree that casts down . . . the\n infinite co-naturality of three infinites. Each person\n considered in himself is entirely God . . . the three considered\n together. . . . I have not even begun to think of unity when\n the Trinity bathes me in its splendor. I have not even begun\n to think of the Trinity when unity grasps me. \"\n \n \n \"O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!\" God is\n eternal blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love:\n Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the \n glory of his blessed life. Such is the \"plan of his loving kindness,\"\n \n conceived by the Father before the foundation of the world, in his\n beloved Son: \"He destined us in love to be his sons\" and \"to be\n conformed to the image of his Son,\" through \"the spirit of sonship.\"\n This plan is a \"grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus\n before the ages began,\" stemming immediately from Trinitarian\n love. It unfolds in the work of creation, the whole history of\n salvation after the fall, and the missions of the Son and the Spirit, \n which are continued in the mission of the Church.\n \n The whole divine economy is the common work of the\n three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same\n nature, so too does it have only one and the same operation: \"The\n Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of\n creation but one principle.\" However, each divine person\n performs the common work according to his unique personal\n property. Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament,\n \"one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus\n Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom\n all things are.\" It is above all the divine missions of the Son's\n Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that show forth the\n properties of the divine persons.\n \n Being a work at once common and personal, the whole\n divine economy makes known both what is proper to the divine\n persons and their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life\n is a communion with each of the divine persons, without in any\n way separating them. Everyone who glorifies the Father does so\n through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ\n does so because the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him.\n \n The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry\n of God's creatures into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.\n But even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy\n Trinity: \"If a man loves me,\" says the Lord, \"he will keep my word, \n and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make\n our home with him\":\n \n \n \"O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself\n entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful\n as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be\n able to trouble my peace or make me leave you, O my\n unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more\n deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your\n heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest.\n May I never abandon you there, but may I be there, whole\n and entire, completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring,\n and wholly given over to your creative action.\"\n \n \n \n \n TO RECAP\n \n \n The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central\n mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian life.\n God alone can make it known to us by revealing\n himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n \n The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the\n eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial with\n the Father, which means that, in the Father and with\n the Father, the Son is one and the same God.\n \n The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in\n he name of the Son (Jn 14:26) and by the Son \"from\n the Father\" (Jn 15:26), reveals that, with them, the\n Spirit is one and the same God. \"With the Father and\n the Son he is worshipped and glorified\" (Nicene Creed).\n \n \"The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first\n principle and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from\n the communion of both the Father and the Son\"\n (St. Augustine, De Trin. 15, 26, 47: PL 42, 1095). \n \n \n By the grace of Baptism \"in the name of the Father and\n of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\" we are called to\n share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in\n the obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light\n \n \n \"Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God\n in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either\n confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for\n the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the\n Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father,\n Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their\n majesty coeternal.\n \n Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are\n also inseparable in what they do. But within the single\n divine operation each shows forth what is proper to\n him in the Trinity, especially in the divine missions of\n the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.",

   "I have been curious for the few months regarding the actions of early and present day Christians, but the RCC seems to be at the forefront and you seem to be the man in the know about everything Catholic right now. \n \n I preface the questions with I am really just interested in an answer and not trying to prove a point.\n \n A large number of the documents that are the basis for or contribute to the validity of much of the wealth and authority that the RCC make claim to, have been proven to be forged or altered. A few of the more well known are Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, The Donation of Constantine and Liber Pontificalis. \n \n Do Catholics know or care about the results gained by the early church thru deception and not tradition or God? The significance being that the Popes are responsible for what is and is not acceptable for all Catholics (all Christians if they had thier way). If so why is it acceptable and if not, why and if addressed how?\n \n In todays LA Times the pope is quoted as saying indigenous people welcomed the purifying teachings of european priests. I am sure some welcomed the teachings, but we know that most did not. It seems the common practice is to spin the actions of the church into something that is favorable and just not address reality or do so as quitly as possible. Why is the Church so unyielding on matters where it has made a mistake. People jump all over them because they won't admit it. It happens enough where it must be considered policy as opposed to the poor choices of a few. One word as an example Galileo. Child molesters come from all walks of life it just happens to be the catholics turn in the spotlight right now. Had they been open about this or even serious about dealing with it they would be in a very different position right now. It's like Clinton and Starr. Starr knew what Clinton did, but Clinton kept denying it and made Starr prove it. Starr said ok you got it, boom 1 impeached president. Had he just come out said sorry I did a bad thing. People thought he was great he would have gotten detention after school and nobody would remember it. \n \n The Arch Dioces in San Diego just got busted because they got caught hiding assets from the bankruptcy court that they were in because they at the 11th hour saw it as the only way to get the victims of the munerous lawsuits for child molestation to settle for less money. We arn't talking a few hunfdred thousand or a couple of million, we're talking around 100 - 150 million that they put into bank accounts that they had no intention of disclosing to the court. I know people do this and worse all the time, but the RCC sets for itself a standard that is higher, one that is supposed to lead by example. It is easy to say don't judge the whole based on a few, but their are more than a few and more than a few times. How do catholics reconcile the unspoken but often practiced policies that seem to contradict the teachings of Jesus and the Bible? \n \n Do they not know? Do they not care? Is it not real for them? Which is more powerful faith or fact? Based on results I think I have the answer, but wanted another opinion.",

Just as God intended it to be.\n \n ...Such is the Mystery of Faith. emoticon_xangel\nYou may like to think that way (that all Christians are members of one big church). I have faith in the Lord, not in any church.\n \n What you do with the above post is lump all Christians together and call them \"the Church\", with no differentiation between Catholics, Protestants (Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Mormons, Lutherans, Christain Scientists, blah, blah, blah!) It's quite easy to expect molesters to be a percentage of that crowd.\n \n We should confine this discussion to the Roman Catholic Church...the topic of the thread...what Catholics believe!\n \n Apparently, at least as stated by the prolific author (or C&P artist) of this thread, Catholics believe in the Word of God (as in the bible as written and handed down verbally through the ages) AND whatever the hierarchy of their sect (the Pope and his boys) pass down as new and improved rules. This is similar to but more easily amended than Joseph Smith's addition to what was not to be added to. \n \n \"The Church\", in their case certainly consists of parishioners and the ruling few, but I doubt any rules are up for debate amongst those who have not been crowned and dressed in 'Holy' robes. It's the ruling few that determine what 'the Church' should believe and practice...not the parishioners. The parishioners are the sheep...their local \"Father\" is their shepherd and commander in things religious. The \"Father\" answers to his own Bishop who answers to his own Cardinal who answers to the Pope. (There may be some other steps in there...I never got really deep into studying it.)\n \n The Catholic Church believes what the Catholic rulers within the hierarchy of their well organized religious army tell them to believe.\n \n Removal of perverted priests and others from the ranks of their army would be tantamount to admitting that they have a problem...so they merely move his sorry XXX to another parish and tell him to be a good boy from now on, throw some money at his victims in exchange for future silence and the problem is gone. This is religious forgiveness for a civil crime....despicable action on the part of The Catholic Church.\n \n It's expected of the Catholic Church to forgive all sins by all people...it is not expected of any church (or any other group) to maintain a pervert's access to children. Just as a rose is a rose is a rose, a sexual predator is a sexual predator is a sexual predator. There's no other way to describe them. There's no changing them without a lobotomy or castration. They cannot be left to their own guidance, especially within an organization that instills fear of their retribution in the minds of truly God fearing followers.\n \n If the Church detects a child molester, they should forgive him...then kick his XXX out of any position of power within the church...with no further compensation for his 'services'.",

   "I know nothing about them, the only real thing that gives the catholic magestirum any authority is found in historical succesion back to Saint Peter \"the rock\" upon whom Christ \"built\" his \"church\"\n \n That answers my question in part. There is much more that gives the Catholic Church it's authority than succession. The elevation of the Bishop of Rome to Pope having authority in all matters of faith was a process that took a few hundred years. During that process documents were produced that were used to either establish, support and/or confirm precedent or existing law defining the scope of the Roman Bishop and later Pope of what was Christianity that was to become Catholicism. Many of these documents have since been found to be forged or altered. This would call into question the validity of the Pope's authority in all matters of faith or how much in what areas. \n \n \n Deception, what deception?\n \n When facts or fabricated or altered so as to benefit the bearer of those facts, as explained above, regardless of the reasons, that would be considered deceptive. The fact that you are unaware, as I beleive many are, leads to the question does it matter? As well as is it worthwhile to have an understanding of the history, unbiased or at least look at opposing views with an open mind, of an organization that has such a significant role in your life and who has made choices for you that will determine many of the decesions you make everyday?\n \n how do you know most did not, what is your source and how reliable is it. Actually in the midst of massive persecution I am convinced that vast numbers would have seen the social benefits of Catholicism.\n \n Let's see their land was taken from them, they were made slaves, their lives uprooted and even today remain one of the least educated and poorest ethnic classes. I would say that experiment didn't work out to well. White man needed more space, religion was instrumental in establishing a white presence throughout the world. Just think if there had been no monks or missionaries.\n \n \n I am not so sure that it is you know its just very slow moving when you have all eternity you can pay attention to detail. I think the Church is very forth coming when they make a mistake - Pope JPII appologised for the way the church had treated Jews durring the 2nd world war even though he knew fine well that the accusations against the church were false, historic documents since realsed by the vatican under pope B16 has shown that thes accusations were unfonded infact the opposite was true and that by all accounts the accusations were leveled at the church by the communist state in order to try and undermine the Churches credibility..these documents have been atested to by historians.

I brought it up since it was already in the thread and the events are still unfolding. The point I wanted to make was not Catholics are into kiddie porn, but how they as an organization have handled it. The fact that a number of priests had their actions discovered a number of times and then covered up repeatedly with no serious actions taken is a problem. To refuse to hand over non-confession related employment/disciplinary documents to law enforcement who have established a valid reason to request such information is a problem. The larger problem is that seems to be the policy with many issues that would be an embarrasement or conflict with church doctrine. My example was Galileo. I beleive the church could earn the respect of many people if it would simply say sorry we did the best we could with what we knew at the time\n \n I dont think the church did anything wrong, I dont think the Church should be held accountable for the mistakes of a few... its not fair that a church and its assests that parishoners have bought and paid for out of their own money should have to be sold off in order to pay for the mistakes of a few men....its scandelous in itself.\n \n Of course the church did something wrong:xbanghead They covered it up and aby not taking the appropriate steps subject numerous children to molestation. When tobacco got killed in the courts the big money wasn't for growing tobacco and making cigarrettes. It was for making it addictive and then hiding the facts that then subjected millions of people to unnecessary health risks. Mistakes of a few men, what bubble do you live in? We are talking about hundreds of kids and only God knows how many there are who don't come forward or the statute of limitations has made prosecution impossible. This is not a \"few men\" this is not a couple of kids, but even if it was you have any idea how many of these kids grow up disfunctional? Who exactly should be financially responsible for the care or treatment? Why should my taxes be used to fund the clean up of an organization that has hundreds of millions of dollars, acts irresponsibly and don't forget at least in the US niether the church nor priest pays taxes. \n \n (its CC not RCC btw)\n \n There is the truth of the matter, that is why it is so scandelous, why it does so much damage to the reputation of the church. One has to seperate the faith and the magestirum from the body of believers, you must know and understand that the church is a hospital with both doctors and patients, I understand that the priests should be the doctors and not the ill patients...but even doctors get ill.\n \n You condone their actions don't you? Every statement has been sympethetic to the one who commits the crime and the one who covers it up while trivializing approaching contempt for the victim. \n \n So by all means continue with your Jesus teached typing course, but do your self and the rest of us a favor and take the time to read what you type and then a few more minutes to try and understand it.\n \n 1st off we understand that priests are people too and like the rest of us we are sinners, we are a ship of scoundrels, muderers, theives, homosexuals, adulterers, rapists, priests and bishops no exception but we all share one thing in common, we recognise our sinfulness and are trying to live according to the catholic faith... a faith that we all love and hold dear a faith that does not condone our sins but condemns them.\n \n You have yet to condem one sin, you have condemed only the victims of the sins of others while condoning the sins of the sinner. \n \n Yes we know, yes we care, yes it is real for us but humanity is made up of weak and sinful human beings. I have commited fornication, even adultery....did I know it was opposed to Christ and his teachings... yes.....did I care... yes of course I did.... was it real.... it most certainly was.\n \n Wake up, if you knew it was wrong and you did it anyway YOU DID NOT CARE! Nobody is perfect, we all make mistakes, some more than others some bigger than others. That doesn't mean say 10 hail mary's and go do it again. It doesn't mean lie about it ask your co-conspirator to forgive you and go do it again and it doesn't mean screw the victim of your actions because that would make life a little more difficult for you. Own up to it, fix it as best you can and if you care you don't do it again and if you can't stop you don't put yourself or put someone who can't stop in a position to do it again. That is caring!\n \n I am in no possiton to cast any stones at anyone.\n \n Oh I see we just let em do whatever they want and God will do his job in the end. Go study what that means you are way off base.\n \n But can you see what you are doing.\n \n You are not bothered about condeming the failure of the man but instead you condemn the high standards he has failed at acheieving.\n\n \n No I am condeming the organization refuses to adhere to the most basic of it's own standards. That subjects itself, it's followers and in some cases innocent bystanders to needless hurt. \n \n Don't you see your attitude is what keeps the Catholic faith from achieving those lofty standards that were created, not by me, but by Catholics.

   "Hi Inri, I've avoided this thread because I like you and agree with much of what you say. But I read this thread for the first time today and see that you are very well versed in Catholicism so it only seems right to ask you about some of the major doctrines the church practices that go totally against what the bible says. Obviously these come in no particular order but here goes. Answer any or as many as you can.\n \n 1] The bible say's call no man Father, lest he be your earthly father. Yet the RCC has all of its members refer to Priests as Father. Why ? Why would they include in their tradition, a tradition that goes directly against what the bible says to do ?\n \n 2] The Church does teach the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary in spite of the fact that she and Joseph had children together after Jesus. They also elevate her above other women in that she is considered Mary, mother of God. It is taught that people can pray to her. That she can bestow blessings on people. But the bible says that Jesus and only Jesus is the mediator between God and Man.\n \n 3] Confessing to Priests. Again, the bible teaches us that their is only one mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, yet here is the RCC making it mandatory for its members to confess their sins to priests who are sinners just like we are. And priests forgive sins but have no real power to.\n \n 4] The Infallibility of the Pope. The Pope is a man from the seed of Adam, thus he is a sinner just like me. He is not infallible as only God is infallible. The inference that he is is blasphemy to God and it's a heretical doctrine.\n \n 5] The Doctrine of Limbo. Is mentioned nowhere in the bible at all and appears to be totally man made doctrine.\n \n 6] The elevation of men to Saints by the Church. This Doctrine is a corruption of the fact that according to the bible, every single believer in Christ who possesses His Holy Spirit is seen by God as a Saint. Yet the RCC holds sainthood up as some special status that only the church can give. This too is heresy and in no way scriptural. And the RCC has known of the verses and passages in the bible where these truths are self evident for 2 thousand years now yet they have perpetuated these lies and built church doctrine upon those lies. I ask why ?\n \n 7] Praying to saints. This is a blasphemous practice that borders on Idolatry that is so against what God stands for and teaches its pathetic. Yet the RCC has promoted it and built the practice into their liturgy since the liturgy has existed.\n \n 8] The placement of statues of Mary, Saints and even Jesus in their Cathedrals that people pray to and before goes directly against Gods commandment to have no graven images before Him. The Church has built a tradition on placing the image of sinful humans and Angels who were made to serve humans and God in the front of Sanctuaries all over the World so when ever faithful catholics were in prayer and worship of God, they would inadvertently be praying before these false idols. WHY is my question ? Why would the RCC do this when they know the passages that go against these practices ?\n \n This is enough for now. But doesn't it bother you that such cut and dry doctrines have been distorted and corrupted by your belief system ? It sure bothers me as one of those flea bitten protestants. emoticon_xangel",

   "\"So in your mind who is to held accountable?\"\n \n The bishops and priests who acted in these ways, it certainly wasnt the Catholic Authority, it Certainly wasnt the people in the pews, why should they be made to suffer for the crimes of others?\n \n I have heard of Church buildings and property having to be sold off in order to pay for the court settlements, like in my Village, many of the Churches and properties around the world have been bought and built by the parishoners....do you think it is right that these people have to have their Church that they built and payed for sold off in order to pay compensation for the crimes of a priest maybe a priest from an entirely different parish...how is that punishing the offender, its punishing the innocent.... If anyone should be punished it is those who have commited the crimes, How is little 80 year old mrs miggins going to get to church on sunday morning now that her parish has been sold off, who is going to visit mr wright who is dying of cancer now there is no parish in his area...why do these people have to be punished for the crimes of a priest...let the priest suffer, sue him, cut his manhood off or whatever...but the church is innocent! \n \n Well obviously \"D\"\n \n Accept responsibility for thier actions, work with both priests and victims to get treatment and develop safegaurds to prevent further occurances.\n \n However families wanted to go to court, wanted large payouts, they wanted the church to suffer even though the church was innocent, fine if they sued the bishop and the priest, but the disocese dosnt belong to them it belongs to the faithful catholics who have built that diosese up, who have payed for the up keep.... I fully agree with the church leaders who moved money out, said they were bankrupt ect..in a snese they were right they dont have any money, that belongs to the Church not them....infact from now on all monies should be sent to the vatican to distribute fairly and eavenly among the worlds diosese, then no judge or civil authority can demand anything!",

I find it interesting that you didn't even copy and paste them to explain, or justify their roots from the scriptures which is the only unrefutable evidence any believer can accept. If the truth is on your side then that should be easy to do.\n \n \ndid you know that the doctrine of the holy trinity is a Catholic doctrine that was kept by most protestants and it can not be found explicitly in scripture...some protestants had dropped the doctrine of the trinity and with it many of them as a result the divine nature of Christ.\n\n \n This is just not true because we get our doctrine of the Trinity directly from Jesus who said:\n \n \nMat 28:19 Go *therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n\n \n \nfrom evidence of past \"conversations\" regarding many of these doctrines you have concerns with I am not so sure my \"explinations\" would change your opinion on them or on the conspiracy that the Church has distorted the and corrupted the bible, if you look into things in that frame of mind then any explination I give can be ignored and consider your ignorance justified by simply say well the catholic explination I give distorts and corrupts the bible\n\n \n I never implied that the RCC actually corrupted the bible because they didn't change it to fit with their misinterpretations of it. What they corrupted is the interpretations which they have totally distorted for reasons that escape me. But distortions they are unless you can produce scripture passages that justify them.\n \n \nReally your post like so many I have encountered in the past asks the Catholic faith to defend itself by explaining the doctrines in holds inlight of scripture that they have corrupted and distorted...there really is no point in addressing your concerns because they are not so much concerns as judgements on your part.\n\n \n They are blatant distortions of the truth Imri,I have no personal vendetta against the RCC but these contradictions are blindingly obvious even to laymen. It doesn't take a theology degree to see it, just a basic knowledge of Scripture.\n \n \ni could say the church teaches that we should not take the passage of Call no man father as litteral and that jesus was talkig figuritively, and show scripture that supports Catholics approach. such as....

As are all of your other examples which implied respect for elders or statesmen in the faith. But the one passage you left out was this one: I put it in red because its Jesus speaking. And note the bolded as it's the main verse that speaks to the subject being discussed. But I had to post the whole passage because Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and Scribes and condemning them as hypocrites who lay heavy burdens on the people while appearing righteous but resembling more a brood of vipors.\n \n Mat 23:1 \n THEN Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples\n Mat 23:2 \n saying: \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.\n Mat 23:3 \n \"Therefore whatever they tell you to observe,[fn1] that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.\n Mat 23:4 \n \"For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.\n Mat 23:5 \n \"But all their works they do to be seen by men.

For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies[fn3] the gold?\n \n \nyou really need to ask yourself some questions first do you want to point fingers, make accusations, pass judgment, if so you dont need to mask it under the guise of trying to seem interested in any answers we might give. Or do you want to find out what catholics believe....Your mind set is not open to the possiblity that we could be innocent of corruption and distorttion of scripture and so there is no point in going any further with it.\n\n \n If you can defend your position scripturally then I am willing to be shown the truth. I suspect though that you know you can't justify the RCCs positions scripturally so your taking this position that I have made up my mind in order to deflect your inability to support your contentions in defense of the indefensible.\n \n The rest is to follow:",

You will also find that the dark ages aligned perfectly with the span of time when the Catholic Church decreed it illegal to the sentence of death for a layman to possess or read a bible. It was ordered that only a Priest designated by the Pope could accurately interpret the Word of God. Laymen were too ignorant to comprehend the depth of Gods Word according to the Vatican. \n \n As a Priest of Rome, Martin Luther read the bible and saw all the references that called for the Spirit to speak directly with each person through Gods Word, which placed him in direct opposition with the Vatican and the Pope. This is the very reason that the Protestant Reformation took place at all. Because one lowly Priest believed that in order for the faith to flourish in the hearts of men, the bible had to be available to all people who hungered for it. That it specifically not be controlled and interpreted by a single brain at the vatican and that one man not control what the unwashed masses believed but that the Holy Spirit be breathed back into the hearts and souls of men once again as God originally intended. This spiritual revolution marked the reintroduction of God back into the lives of humanity and ended the brutal time in History referred to as the Dark Ages.\n \n [QUOTE]also if you look into it you will find that the rise of athiesm in western chrisendom can be specifically traced back the protestant reformation...,.\"many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, \"[QUOTE]\n \n This is a true passage from the bible, but your interpretation is balderdash if you're trying to apply it to Protestantism. \n \n \n\"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.

Here they are again for your perusal.\n \n \n1] The bible say's call no man Father, lest he be your earthly father. Yet the RCC has all of its members refer to Priests as Father. Why ? Why would they include in their tradition, a tradition that goes directly against what the bible says to do ?\n \n 2] The Church does teach the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary in spite of the fact that she and Joseph had children together after Jesus. They also elevate her above other women in that she is considered Mary, mother of God. It is taught that people can pray to her. That she can bestow blessings on people. But the bible says that Jesus and only Jesus is the mediator between God and Man.\n \n 3] Confessing to Priests. Again, the bible teaches us that their is only one mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, yet here is the RCC making it mandatory for its members to confess their sins to priests who are sinners just like we are. And priests forgive sins but have no real power to.\n \n 4] The Infallibility of the Pope. The Pope is a man from the seed of Adam, thus he is a sinner just like me. He is not infallible as only God is infallible. The inference that he is is blasphemy to God and it's a heretical doctrine.\n \n 5] The Doctrine of Limbo. Is mentioned nowhere in the bible at all and appears to be totally man made doctrine.\n \n 6] The elevation of men to Saints by the Church. This Doctrine is a corruption of the fact that according to the bible, every single believer in Christ who possesses His Holy Spirit is seen by God as a Saint. Yet the RCC holds sainthood up as some special status that only the church can give. This too is heresy and in no way scriptural. And the RCC has known of the verses and passages in the bible where these truths are self evident for 2 thousand years now yet they have perpetuated these lies and built church doctrine upon those lies.

   "Arcangel.....Lets see you show me how this passage relates to the immaculate Conception\n \n have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them. 9 Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you. \n \"Have them make a chest of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. 11 Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.\n\n \n The Arc of the Covenant was Gods dwelling place with the people of Israel. He didn't dwell within it but above it, between the wings of the Cherubim who's wings stretch forth creating a type of seat above which His Glory resided. The Arc is a \"type\" representing Gods redemption and atonement of humanity. \n \n Goats were of particular importance on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the time when the children of Israel came together to be reconciled to God (Leviticus chapter 16). Two goats were selected by lottery, one for sacrifice and the other to be sent out into the wilderness. The blood of the sacrificed goat would be taken into the Holy of Holies by the High Priest, as required by God to forgive the sins of the children of Israel, for \"without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\" (Hebrews 9:22). Then the High Priest would lay his hands on the head of the other goat and confess all the sins of the children of Israel before it was sent out into the wilderness, signifying that God would forget all the sins thus confessed. Here is the origin of the 'scapegoat'.\n \n The twofold significance of the goats is therefore that God wants to forgive and to forget. He desires to remove from His people not only the guilt of sin, but also His memory of that sin, so that we may be reconciled to Him.\n \n For God's righteousness to be satisfied, though, one goat without blemish must die and the other goat without blemish must have the sins of Israel laid upon it and be removed outside the camp. All this speaks forward to the crucifixion of Jesus: \"He who knew no sin was made sin for us\" (II Corinthians 5:21), \"He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin\" (I John 3:5). Since Jesus is the reality of the two goats for our atonement and reconciliation to God, \"we implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\" (II Corinthians 5:20).\n \n The goats signify that the Sinless One has been made sin for us so that God can legally forgive us and no longer remember our sins, as it says in the New Covenant: \"I will be forgiving of their unrighteousness and their sins I will remember no longer\" (Hebrews 8:12).\n \n The covering of Woven Goat's Hair signifies that, if we have entered into the Tabernacle, we are clothed with Christ as our righteousness: \"God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us so that we in Him might become the righteousness of God\" (II Corinthians 5:21).\n To 'redeem' literally means to 'buy back'. 'Redemption' is the act of 'buying back'. \n \n The property you are 'redeeming' once belonged to you. It was in your possession, and then someone took it, either legally (by right) or by force. You are not happy about this and you wish that it still belonged to you. The only way is for you to buy it back, 'redeem' it. The act of 'buying back' is called 'redemption'.\n \n 'Redemption' can also work this way: you own nothing. Because you are so poor, you accumulate debts. The only way out of the debts is to sell yourself as a slave to pay off the debts. The only way out of this slavery is if someone pays the full cost of your debts and releases you.\n \n God created us, we belong to Him. He made mankind for Himself. But we have been kidnapped by God's powerful enemy, Satan, and tricked into all kinds of wrongdoing, sin. As a result, we have become enslaved to doing wrong. Our debt is mounting all the time and it seems we have no way out. Then God sends along the ransom price, His Son Jesus. Jesus is debt-free. He did not sin at all (I Peter 2:22). Rather, He loved God with all His heart, mind, soul and strength, and He loved the people round Him. Jesus pays for our debts by dying on the cross. By believing in what God has done in Jesus Christ, we can be freed from our debts, released from slavery, and come back to God as our Father.\n \n Jesus said \"My blood is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins\" (Matthew 26:28). The debt we each owe to God, because of our sins and offenses against Him and against one another, is colossal. Jesus paid with His blood the price our sins exacted in God's eyes, so He could purchase us back to God (redeem us). Peter writes: \"know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like gold and silver, from your aimless conduct, but you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (Messiah), the blood of a lamb without blemish and without spot\" (I Peter 1:18-19).\n \n In the Bible, Silver is used to symbolise 'redemption', the ransom price God placed on each of the children of Israel (Exodus 30:11-16). God desires to redeem people, not to condemn them, but to satisfy His righteousness a price must be paid. When Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the price paid was thirty pieces of Silver (prophesied in Zechariah 11:12-13 and fulfilled in Matthew 26:15; 27:3).\n \n Exodus 12:1 to 13:16 shows the other side of redemption: the way to redeem the life of the first-born son was by the sacrifice of a lamb at Passover. God sacrificed His only Son, Jesus the Lamb of God (John 1:29) at Calvary, as the final Passover Lamb (I Corinthians 5:7) during the Feast of Passover in 33 AD, in order to redeem mankind, that is to buy us back from sin and all its effects (Romans 5:6,18).",

The blood of the sacrificed goat would be taken into the Holy of Holies by the High Priest, as required by God to forgive the sins of the children of Israel, for \"without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\" (Hebrews 9:22). Then the High Priest would lay his hands on the head of the other goat and confess all the sins of the children of Israel before it was sent out into the wilderness, signifying that God would forget all the sins thus confessed. Here is the origin of the 'scapegoat'.\n \n The twofold significance of the goats is therefore that God wants to forgive and to forget. He desires to remove from His people not only the guilt of sin, but also His memory of that sin, so that we may be reconciled to Him.\n \n For God's righteousness to be satisfied, though, one goat without blemish must die and the other goat without blemish must have the sins of Israel laid upon it and be removed outside the camp. All this speaks forward to the crucifixion of Jesus: \"He who knew no sin was made sin for us\" (II Corinthians 5:21), \"He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin\" (I John 3:5). Since Jesus is the reality of the two goats for our atonement and reconciliation to God, \"we implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\" (II Corinthians 5:20).\n \n The goats signify that the Sinless One has been made sin for us so that God can legally forgive us and no longer remember our sins, as it says in the New Covenant: \"I will be forgiving of their unrighteousness and their sins I will remember no longer\" (Hebrews 8:12).\n \n The covering of Woven Goat's Hair signifies that, if we have entered into the Tabernacle, we are clothed with Christ as our righteousness: \"God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us so that we in Him might become the righteousness of God\" (II Corinthians 5:21).\n To 'redeem' literally means to 'buy back'. 'Redemption' is the act of 'buying back'. \n \n The property you are 'redeeming' once belonged to you. It was in your possession, and then someone took it, either legally (by right) or by force. You are not happy about this and you wish that it still belonged to you. The only way is for you to buy it back, 'redeem' it. The act of 'buying back' is called 'redemption'.\n \n 'Redemption' can also work this way: you own nothing. Because you are so poor, you accumulate debts. The only way out of the debts is to sell yourself as a slave to pay off the debts. The only way out of this slavery is if someone pays the full cost of your debts and releases you.\n \n God created us, we belong to Him. He made mankind for Himself. But we have been kidnapped by God's powerful enemy, Satan, and tricked into all kinds of wrongdoing, sin. As a result, we have become enslaved to doing wrong. Our debt is mounting all the time and it seems we have no way out. Then God sends along the ransom price, His Son Jesus. Jesus is debt-free. He did not sin at all (I Peter 2:22). Rather, He loved God with all His heart, mind, soul and strength, and He loved the people round Him. Jesus pays for our debts by dying on the cross. By believing in what God has done in Jesus Christ, we can be freed from our debts, released from slavery, and come back to God as our Father.\n \n Jesus said \"My blood is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins\" (Matthew 26:28). The debt we each owe to God, because of our sins and offenses against Him and against one another, is colossal. Jesus paid with His blood the price our sins exacted in God's eyes, so He could purchase us back to God (redeem us). Peter writes: \"know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like gold and silver, from your aimless conduct, but you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (Messiah), the blood of a lamb without blemish and without spot\" (I Peter 1:18-19).\n \n In the Bible, Silver is used to symbolise 'redemption', the ransom price God placed on each of the children of Israel (Exodus 30:11-16). God desires to redeem people, not to condemn them, but to satisfy His righteousness a price must be paid. When Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the price paid was thirty pieces of Silver (prophesied in Zechariah 11:12-13 and fulfilled in Matthew 26:15; 27:3).\n \n Exodus 12:1 to 13:16 shows the other side of redemption: the way to redeem the life of the first-born son was by the sacrifice of a lamb at Passover. God sacrificed His only Son, Jesus the Lamb of God (John 1:29) at Calvary, as the final Passover Lamb (I Corinthians 5:7) during the Feast of Passover in 33 AD, in order to redeem mankind, that is to buy us back from sin and all its effects (Romans 5:6,18).\"\n\n \n What has that got to do with the Immaculate conception.",

   "I am not sure you know what the Immaculate Conception is!\n \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm\n\n \n You're absolutely right, I had no idea of the catholic concept of the immaculate conception. They have even corrupted that into a blasphemous doctrine. None of what that link implies is correct spiritually at all and elevates Mary to having been born without a sinful nature as all other descendants of Adam were. Let me fill you in on something, the only thing that qualified Mary to bear the Savior besides a willing and righteous heart of course, was her lineage that came directly from the line of king David which fulfilled the prophecy that Messiah would come from David. \n \n By immaculate conception, I thought you were referring to mary's conception of Jesus as being miraculous and from the Holy Spirit. But I never understood that the RCC believed that Mary was of a supernatural construct in order to have carried Jesus. The catholic deceptions go deeper than I ever understood.\n \n \nwhats the point?\n You have already made it very clear that whatever I say is a result of a corrupt and distorted teaching anyway....THERE IS NO POINT !\n\n \n Not at all. I have said that the RCC has created religious traditions that corrupt what the bible actually says. You responded by saying you can prove I'm wrong using the bible as your source. I said i wait with baited breath for this scriptural evidence to correct me and now, once again you insist that I'll reject any evidence you produce from the actual bible. And that just isn't true. \n \n Even your link above about the immaculate conception admits that the catholic belief can't be supported with scriptures but is founded in religious traditions created by men and not God. It is therefor blasphemous and of no more value than believing in the easter bunny.\n \n \nNo direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture.\n\n \n \nWhat has that got to do with the Immaculate conception.\n\n \n Nothing really. You posted a passage about the Ark of the covenant and I posted my study of the value and type that the Ark represents for the New Testament Age of Grace. How it applies to mans redemption and all that. Now that I know of your interpretation of the immaculate conception, I believe you liken the ark to Mary who was the vessel that would hold the spirit of God, ie the Savior Jesus Christ. \n \n Tell me this though, how do you deal with the fact that the presence of God didn't dwell within the Arc of the Covenant but above it ? Where as Jesus came from within the womb of mary, the vessel through which He was born ? How do you overcome this obvious contradiction ?\n \n And also Imri, according to your take on the immaculate conception Jesus would have no human nature at all and therefor wouldn't have really suffered the temptations of Man in His Earthly life which according to the Gospel is what qualified him to die for our sins once and for all time as the perfect Lamb of God. So you see Imri, every time the RCC added their own touch of tradition and human insight into the Gospel they have corrupted it and lessened the power it has to meet all of mans needs as Gods tool for eternal redemption and forgiveness of sins once and for all time. \n \n You are being deceived my friend and must stop being lazy and trusting men to tell you what you must believe and go directly to the Throne of Grace and seek the Lords face personally. For only He can teach you as I posted above. See...\n \n Mat 23:8 \n \"But you, do not be called 'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, the Christ,[fn2] and you are all brethren.\n Mat 23:9 \n \"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.\n Mat 23:10 \n \"And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.\n \n Notice that within the span of 3 verses he repeats that He, the Christ is your teacher twice. If you'll trust Him and not a Church to teach you doctrine, you'll be sure not to be deceived by Man. Seleh...",

   "thanks jo.\n \n you say that there is a point for me to use scripture to defend catholic dogma, yet in the same post you say.....\" The catholic deceptions go deeper than I ever understood.\"\n\n \n So what INRI ? Is your position so weak you can't take any disagreement ? Then you're at the wrong forum because all I get around here is rejection from these humanists. If you can support the RCCs Doctrinal practices with the bible, you have a true believer here who will never reject that evidence so bring it on and I'll believe it as long as you're not pulling verses out of context and trying to make them say what the bible doesn't mean.\n \n \n \nIf I tell you this will you try to show me how the passage relates to the Immaculate Conception.....its quite simple really when you THINK about it.......What was kept in the Arc of the covenant???\n \n The word of God!!!!\n In the begining was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us!\n \n\n \n You mean the Ten Commandments. OK, but the actual Spirit of God dwelt above it. Does that do anything to your analogy ? To me it does. But it isn't a salvation issue so I can accept your interpretation because it does no harm to the overall Gospel. Unlike these other doctrinal issues we disagree on and which you seem afraid to correct with the bible, because you know that scripturally you can't support these doctrines.\n \n \nNo it says \"No direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\"\n \n If you scroll down you will find the texts that support it.\n\n \n Text ? What text. The text written by some Priest, Munk or Bishop between 400 AD and 1600 AD or when ever they created this doctrine ? How can you respect that as authoritative ? It means nothing to me.\n \n \ncatholics believe that every human being is of supernatural construct, indeed all human beings are created by God in his image and likeness.\n\n \n Don't twist what I mean INRI. You know exactly the context in which I'm speaking. For Mary to have been born without a sinful nature as all other men possess, as your article says, she would have been created with a unique and different nature than the rest of us. So please dont be disingenuous with me. Because another word for disingenuous is dishonest.\n \n \nare you implying that somehow the preservation of Mary from the stain of original sin somehow made her less human..... on the contary it made her more human in that our human nature is made in the image and likeness of God, are you saying that God who as the bible tells us is without sin somehow has sin?\n \n \n Regarding Mary in the bolded, the answer is yes. She would be less human if born without a sinful nature. If true, that would have given Jesus the combined natures of both his parents which would have both been sinless, which totally defeats the purpose of Him taking on the flesh of Man, living a perfect life while suffering all of our temptations as an example for us that it can be done. Then in that perfect state, He was an acceptable sacrifice for our sins to die once, and for all time for the sins of humanity. Your doctrine completely defeats the purpose of his mission.\n \n And one more thing. What affect would that have had on the other children she went on to have with Joseph who then would have had her sinless nature within them ? Isn't it strange that these extra special human children who were actually raised in the same home as jesus growing up didn't accept his Messiah-ship until He raised from the dead Himself. You'd think with a sinless nature they inherited from their mom would have given them some insight into jesus true nature. But Mary didn't have a sinless nature for that very reason.\n \n Now regarding your statement about God in the bolded. How could you get that I'm suggesting God has sin by saying that making mary without a sinful nature defeats the purpose of Messiahs/Jesus mission ? \n \n \nthat is just it, I trust him more than you do, because I listen to the Church.\n\n \n You are free to put your faith in the church my friend. I choose to place my faith in God Himself and His Holy Word.\n \n Now if you'll notice, you have done a fine job in deflecting all focus from our original subject. And that is the false doctrines of the RCC. You keep insisting they can be supported with scripture but you know they can't. So just admit it and I'll stop pushing for the evidence you said you can produce.\n \n 1] The bible say's call no man Father, lest he be your earthly father. Yet the RCC has all of its members refer to Priests as Father. Why ? Why would they include in their tradition, a tradition that goes directly against what the bible says to do ?\n \n 2] The Church does teach the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary in spite of the fact that she and Joseph had children together after Jesus. They also elevate her above other women in that she is considered Mary, mother of God. It is taught that people can pray to her. That she can bestow blessings on people. But the bible says that Jesus and only Jesus is the mediator between God and Man.\n \n 3] Confessing to Priests. Again, the bible teaches us that their is only one mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, yet here is the RCC making it mandatory for its members to confess their sins to priests who are sinners just like we are. And priests forgive sins but have no real power to.\n \n 4] The Infallibility of the Pope. The Pope is a man from the seed of Adam, thus he is a sinner just like me. He is not infallible as only God is infallible. The inference that he is is blasphemy to God and it's a heretical doctrine.\n \n 5] The Doctrine of Limbo. Is mentioned nowhere in the bible at all and appears to be totally man made doctrine.\n \n 6] The elevation of men to Saints by the Church. This Doctrine is a corruption of the fact that according to the bible, every single believer in Christ who possesses His Holy Spirit is seen by God as a Saint. Yet the RCC holds sainthood up as some special status that only the church can give. This too is heresy and in no way scriptural. And the RCC has known of the verses and passages in the bible where these truths are self evident for 2 thousand years now yet they have perpetuated these lies and built church doctrine upon those lies. I ask why ?\n \n 7] Praying to saints. This is a blasphemous practice that borders on Idolatry that is so against what God stands for and teaches its pathetic. Yet the RCC has promoted it and built the practice into their liturgy since the liturgy has existed.\n \n 8] The placement of statues of Mary, Saints and even Jesus in their Cathedrals that people pray to and before goes directly against Gods commandment to have no graven images before Him. The Church has built a tradition on placing the image of sinful humans and Angels who were made to serve humans and God in the front of Sanctuaries all over the World so when ever faithful catholics were in prayer and worship of God, they would inadvertently be praying before these false idols. WHY is my question ? Why would the RCC do this when they know the passages that go against these practices ?",

   "\"So in your mind who is to held accountable?\"\n \n The bishops and priests who acted in these ways, it certainly wasnt the Catholic Authority, it Certainly wasnt the people in the pews, why should they be made to suffer for the crimes of others?\n \n I have heard of Church buildings and property having to be sold off in order to pay for the court settlements, like in my Village, many of the Churches and properties around the world have been bought and built by the parishoners....do you think it is right that these people have to have their Church that they built and payed for sold off in order to pay compensation for the crimes of a priest maybe a priest from an entirely different parish...how is that punishing the offender, its punishing the innocent.... If anyone should be punished it is those who have commited the crimes, How is little 80 year old mrs miggins going to get to church on sunday morning now that her parish has been sold off, who is going to visit mr wright who is dying of cancer now there is no parish in his area...why do these people have to be punished for the crimes of a priest...let the priest suffer, sue him, cut his manhood off or whatever...but the church is innocent! \n \n Well obviously \"D\"\n \n Accept responsibility for thier actions, work with both priests and victims to get treatment and develop safegaurds to prevent further occurances.\n \n However families wanted to go to court, wanted large payouts, they wanted the church to suffer even though the church was innocent, fine if they sued the bishop and the priest, but the disocese dosnt belong to them it belongs to the faithful catholics who have built that diosese up, who have payed for the up keep.... I fully agree with the church leaders who moved money out, said they were bankrupt ect..in a snese they were right they dont have any money, that belongs to the Church not them....infact from now on all monies should be sent to the vatican to distribute fairly and eavenly among the worlds diosese, then no judge or civil authority can demand anything!\n\n \n The church is liable because it's \"upper management\" Bishops and the next in line Pope had knowledge that this type of behavior was happening and did nothing to stop it. \n \n Last question and then can we please go to what I was really asking about before this banter about the churches responsibility?\n \n How much is the innocence of a child worth? Based on your statements you know how much is to much, so what is a fair price for a man of God to have his way with a little kid?\n \n By the way a great many religious folks think molestation is a major cause of homosexuality, which according to many religious folks is a sin that will deny you heaven.

Mt3:9 where Jesus calls Abraham \"father\", Acts 7:2 where stephen calls he jewish leaders \"fathers\" Acts 21:40 -22:1 St Paul Calls Jeruselem Jews \"fathers\" where St Paul in Romans 4:16-17 calls Abraham \"father of us all\" or perhaps even more where St Paul himself declares himself a father in 1 cor 4:14-15 where he sates \"i became your father thru the gospel\" I could show you passages of scripture where Jesus is talking using hyperbole when he tells us to pluck out our eyes and cut off our hands, I could give you good theological explinations and scripture for all of your concerns but it wont come to any good if your aksing questions in the mind set that we are already guilty, that we have distoreted scripture ect.\n \n \n you really need to ask yourself some questions first do you want to point fingers, make accusations, pass judgment, if so you dont need to mask it under the guise of trying to seem interested in any answers we might give. Or do you want to find out what catholics believe....Your mind set is not open to the possiblity that we could be innocent of corruption and distorttion of scripture and so there is no point in going any further with it.\n \n However I will give you something to ponder in your heart.\n \n Jesus left his church on earth after he left this earthly plain a church that he said he would protect and guide a church he gave full authority, the catholic church is the only church on this planet that can trace its succesion back to the cheif apostle peter, the person on whom Christ said we would build his Church, There is other churches who also have apostolic succesion, the orthodox churches, they themselves attest to the primacy of the bishop of rome. The final thing Is that which I would like you to ponder..... Is it possible that it isnt the Catholic faith that has distorted and corrupted scripture but a Christian movment started solely to \"protest\" against the Catholic faith a movment started 1500 years after Christ left his church on earth, a Christian movment that has taught you to distrust catholicism, has taught you to believe the catholic church has distorted and corrupted the \"true\" doctrines of Christianity....is protestantism the one true faith given to the world by jesus christ 2000 years ago...yet is only 500 years old and has no apostolic succesion.....\n \n also if you look into it you will find that the rise of athiesm in western chrisendom can be specifically traced back the protestant reformation...,.\"many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, \"\n \n \"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. \"\n \n Check this out!\n http://www.mwt.net/~lnpalm/breathin.htm\n\n \n This is what my original question dealt with which you have ignored. Above you site where doctrine is based on scripture and tradition, what I wanted to know was are Catholics aware of the forged and/or altered documents that are the basis for some of those traditions and authority excersised by the Pope in determining what Catholics will beleive and how they will act. \n \n If so does it matter and if not why not or do they not care or they believe it doesn't effect the end result",

   "Archangel, if you believe that Mary would be less human if she were without sin, does it then follow that you consider Jesus to be not fully human? Christian belief has always been that Jesus was wholly human and wholly God, are you disputing that?\n\n \n Hi Jo, Of course not. I'm defending that premise. It's IMRI's doctrine that is disputing it. If Mary had a sinless nature, she would have been on par with Adam and Eve before they sinned, combine that with God who surely doesn't have a sin nature and Jesus is no longer half man/half God. He is now the result of 2 parents with no sinful nature which means he is no longer an acceptible sacrifice for the propitiation of mans sins.\n \n Besides, absolutely none of this doctrine is supported anywhere in the Word of God. It's complete fiction made up by the RCC. And if IMRI insists that it's true then he must admit that it's complete speculation on the Churches part. Because if man say's something that the bible doesn't say, because we believe the bible to be GODS Word, then to apply alleged truths that aren't written in the bible is to completely speculate on what God believes or has done.",

Really IMRI, Is Our God a God of confusion ? \n \n No, I haven't insisted that Jesus was born with the stain, the spot, the blemish of sin upon Him, those are your words and your catholic terminology. I am saying that Jesus inherited the adamic nature from Mary and the nature of the Holy Spirit from God His Father who supernaturally caused His conception within Mary to take place. The fact is that because He never sinned, He never acted upon the Adamic Nature that made Him susceptible to the same temptations as us. He was never without the presence of the Holy Spirit in that God was always in Him.\n \n The evidence of this is when He was on the Cross and just before He was to die as the sins of humanity were coming into Him. For the first time in His life God couldn't dwell with Him because He was SIN. What did He say IMRI ? He said Father, Father, why have you forsaken me. For the first time in His life He was alone.\n \n Also, I am a believer who is born again. The evidence of that is that I too possess the Holy Spirit of God which indwells me. Are you saying I too have a sinless nature ? God forbid such blasphemy should be spoken because as sinners go, I am the greatest among you. And yet His spirit surely dwells within me. \n \n I'm sorry IMRI but you, through Catholicism have a warped view of mans relationship with God, the sinful nature, Mary's true nature and the relationship of the Holy Spirit with Man. Note the bolded below as it tells the story of Mary and Gabriel as she is informed of her pregnancy. Notice how shocked she is to have been chosen. If she had a sinless nature, wouldn't the Holy Spirit have been in her at least as strongly as He was in Jesus during His ministry and prepared her in advance for such a blessing ?\n \n Luk 1:1\n IN AS MUCH as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled [fn1] among us,\n Luk 1:2 \n just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,\n Luk 1:3 \n it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,\n Luk 1:4 \n that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.\n Luk 1:5 \n There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.\n Luk 1:6 \n And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\n Luk 1:7 \n But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.\n Luk 1:8 \n So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,\n Luk 1:9 \n according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.\n Luk 1:10 \n And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.\n Luk 1:11 \n Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\n Luk 1:12 \n And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.\n Luk 1:13 \n But the angel said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.\n Luk 1:14 \n \"And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.\n Luk 1:15 \n \"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.

The virgin's name was Mary.\n Luk 1:28 \n And having come in, the angel said to her, \"Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!\"\n Luk 1:29 \n But when she saw him,[fn3] she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was.\n Luk 1:30 \n Then the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.\n Luk 1:31 \n \"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS.\n Luk 1:32 \n \"He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.\n Luk 1:33 \n \"And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Luk 1:34 \n Then Mary said to the angel, \"How can this be, since I do not know a man?\"\n Luk 1:35 \n And the angel answered and said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.\n Luk 1:36 \n \"Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.\n Luk 1:37 \n \"For with God nothing will be impossible.\"\n Luk 1:38 \n Then Mary said, \"Behold the maidservant of the Lord!

John the Baptist was also born without sin (although not concieved without sin) Jesus and of course Adam and eve, I am sure there is another one, I think its elijha but i am not sure.\n \n you believe sin is an integral part of the human nature, it is not.... it is a fault, a blemish.... sinfulness seperates us from god, we were created to love and serve God.\n \n \nNow post verses or passages that speak to HER sinless nature as she is the one you're claiming had one.\n\n \n I have already posted them\n \n \n REVELATION\n God's sanctuary in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His sanctuary. There were lightnings, rumblings, thunders, an earthquake, and severe hail. A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of 12 stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in labor and agony to give birth.\n \n The Ark of the Old Covenant carried Gods God, The Manna and the Rod of Aron until the aloted time when God would let them enter the promised land\n \n Jesus is the word of God, He is the Manna come down from heaven and he is the Authority and power of God (rod of aron) and came forth from a pregnant woman at the aloted time God would let us enter the promised kingdom of heaven.\n \n Mary is the Ark of the New Covenant.\n \n Exodus:\n Have them make a chest of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. 11 Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out\n \n First of all you will notice the Ark is made first of all with acacia wood, normal wood, just as mary is concieved with an ordinary human nature, then by the command of God, the Ark is overlayed (protected) with PURE GOLD, just as the human nature of mary is overlayed with grace and protected from the stain of orignial sin.\n \n just as at the moment of its inception the ark was to be made with both wood and preserved with pure Gold, so too the new ark was to be made of human nature and preserved with Grace from the moment of her conception.\n \n \"hail mary, full of Grace\" - Arcangel Gabrial to our lady at the annuciation.\n \n \"Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!\"\n \n \"you have found favor with God\"\n \n \"My soul magnifies the Lord\"\n \n \"He who is mighty has done great things for me\"\n \n \n \n \nNo, I haven't insisted that Jesus was born with the stain, the spot, the blemish of sin upon Him\n\n \n now your just blatantly being obtuse and damn well infuriating!\n \n you quoted me as saying....\"Your assumption that Christ had the stain of original sin is erronious! \" - which I did, in reply you said and I quote direct from your post \"It isn't an assumption, it's a statement of fact.\"\n \n And unless you start behaving in a way more respectable way towards someone who is bringing you the truth of our lord Jesus Christ, I who speak to you with all the authority of the most high Jesus Christ, through the apostles, then I shall have no recourse but to dust my feet off and have nothing to do with you, for you have done nothing but instigate argument...",

   "If you're frustrated, imagine how I feel with you cutting and pasting my posts and questions down to less than complete thoughts ? Like this for example... I posted this complete thought. \n \n \nAlso, I am a believer who is born again. The evidence of that is that I too possess the Holy Spirit of God which indwells me. Are you saying I too have a sinless nature ?\n\n \n And you quoted this.\n \n \nAre you saying I too have a sinless nature ?\n\n \n Has someone sent you a memo saying you should cut the meat out of every opposing statement to save space or something ?\n \n Then I wrote this complete thought.\n \n \nI'm sorry IMRI but you, through Catholicism have a warped view of mans relationship with God, the sinful nature, Mary's true nature and the relationship of the Holy Spirit with Man. Note the bolded below as it tells the story of Mary and Gabriel as she is informed of her pregnancy. Notice how shocked she is to have been chosen. If she had a sinless nature, wouldn't the Holy Spirit have been in her at least as strongly as He was in Jesus during His ministry and prepared her in advance for such a blessing ?\n\n \n And you responded with this cut and paste nonsensical statement by itself which means absolutely nothing alone.\n \n \n\"the sinful nature, Mary's true nature and the relationship of the Holy Spirit with Man\"\n\n \n Is this what you consider to be honest debating style ? Did you even attempt to answer these questions ?\n \n \nWhere does the bible show that God intervened into the womb of Mary's mother to change the nature of Mary before she was born, when the bible never even mentions Mary's parents in any way that I recall. Would not mary's mother also be blessed among women to have been touched in such a way by God ?\n \n And having been born with a sinless nature as the RCC claims, wouldn't Mary herself have been qualified to have died for the sins of humanity ?\n\n \n Or these ?\n \n \n1] The bible say's call no man Father, lest he be your earthly father. Yet the RCC has all of its members refer to Priests as Father. Why ? Why would they include in their tradition, a tradition that goes directly against what the bible says to do ?\n \n 2] The Church does teach the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary in spite of the fact that she and Joseph had children together after Jesus. They also elevate her above other women in that she is considered Mary, mother of God. It is taught that people can pray to her. That she can bestow blessings on people. But the bible says that Jesus and only Jesus is the mediator between God and Man.\n \n 3] Confessing to Priests. Again, the bible teaches us that their is only one mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, yet here is the RCC making it mandatory for its members to confess their sins to priests who are sinners just like we are. And priests forgive sins but have no real power to.\n \n 4] The Infallibility of the Pope. The Pope is a man from the seed of Adam, thus he is a sinner just like me. He is not infallible as only God is infallible. The inference that he is is blasphemy to God and it's a heretical doctrine.\n \n 5] The Doctrine of Limbo. Is mentioned nowhere in the bible at all and appears to be totally man made doctrine.\n \n 6] The elevation of men to Saints by the Church. This Doctrine is a corruption of the fact that according to the bible, every single believer in Christ who possesses His Holy Spirit is seen by God as a Saint. Yet the RCC holds sainthood up as some special status that only the church can give. This too is heresy and in no way scriptural. And the RCC has known of the verses and passages in the bible where these truths are self evident for 2 thousand years now yet they have perpetuated these lies and built church doctrine upon those lies. I ask why ?\n \n 7] Praying to saints. This is a blasphemous practice that borders on Idolatry that is so against what God stands for and teaches its pathetic. Yet the RCC has promoted it and built the practice into their liturgy since the liturgy has existed.\n \n 8] The placement of statues of Mary, Saints and even Jesus in their Cathedrals that people pray to and before goes directly against Gods commandment to have no graven images before Him. The Church has built a tradition on placing the image of sinful humans and Angels who were made to serve humans and God in the front of Sanctuaries all over the World so when ever faithful catholics were in prayer and worship of God, they would inadvertently be praying before these false idols. WHY is my question ? Why would the RCC do this when they know the passages that go against these practices ?\n\n \n You haven't actually answered any question but simply tried to twist what I have said, cut the meat out of it and respond with questions when it's you making the claims that need to be defended. From the post below, how do you explain Mary rejoicing in God her savior after Gabriel told her of her pregnancy ? Why does someone without a sin nature need a savior EMRI ? Of course I don't expect an answer but just so you have something to think about as you worship before a statue of Mary.\n \n \n Luk 1:46 \n And Mary said:\n \n \"My soul magnifies the Lord,\n Luk 1:47 \n And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.\n Luk 1:48 \n For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;\n For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.\n \n Does Mary considering herself as blessed tell you she is without sin ?\n \n And does this sound like a woman who had any inkling that she was blessed by God, not to mention a sinless nature ? Does he say anywhere that it's due to her sinless nature that Mary has been chosen or doesn't he mention specifically that the child will come from the lineage of King David. Think about it EMRI, I'm not your enemy here. But you and the Doctrines you put your faith in are man made and wrong. They just don't hold up to scriptural scrutiny.\n \n Luk 1:28 \n And having come in, the angel said to her, \"Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!\"\n Luk 1:29 \n But when she saw him,[fn3] she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was.\n Luk 1:30 \n Then the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.\n Luk 1:31 \n \"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS.\n Luk 1:32 \n \"He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.\n Luk 1:33 \n \"And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Luk 1:34 \n Then Mary said to the angel, \"How can this be, since I do not know a man?\"\n Luk 1:35 \n And the angel answered and said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.\n \n And by the way, these are from the passage in my previous post.",

   "but what about revelation and exdous?\n \n \nhow do you explain Mary rejoicing in God her savior after Gabriel told her of her pregnancy ? Why does someone without a sin nature need a savior EMRI ?\n\n \n first of all there is no such thing as a sinful nature, just a human nature with the stain of original sin\n \n Also Mary did need a saviour, her IC was through the merits of her Son Jesus Christ, she still needed a saviour. Imagine if you will, a man walking along and he falls in a pit and another man comes along and reaches down and picks him out of the pit, he is covered in mud, such is the normal way of salvation..... now also there is a woman who is walking along and about to fall down the pit too however the man puts his hand out and catches her just as she is about to tumble, preventing her from going into the pit and being covered in mud. Mary still needed a savior.\n \n \nDoes Mary considering herself as blessed tell you she is without sin ?\n\n \n if you read those passages you find the presence of the holy spirit is the root of the converstaion, not pride. You will find elizabeth is effected by the Spirit and Our lady \"overshadowed by the spirit\" - BTW the arcahic meanining of Overshawdow means to shelter or protect.\n \n however she is not considering herself blessed, but motivated by the spirit, indeed we know that she is blessed by the greating of both elizabeth and the Arcangel gabriel.\n \n \nBut you and the Doctrines you put your faith in are man made and wrong. They just don't hold up to scriptural scrutiny\n\n \n Man made, wrong, unscriptual....This from a man who believes Christ was born with the stain of original sin and has yet failed to provide one supporting let alone proving scripture passage. Ever heard the saying people in glass houses shouldnt throw bricks? I dont give this discussion much hope at all when you cant even accept that you maybe wrong concerning the the state of christs human nature a belief not only expounded by Catholics, orthodox but also the vast vast majority of protestants.\n \n however this scriptual scrutiny you are using is comming from your interpretation of scripture where is your authority to interperate scripture coming from, lets compair who has the most authority to interperate scripture and although you still havent provided proof for your \"fact\" or defence that your yourself are guilty of doctrine and beiefs that are not scriptual, let us compair who has the most Authority to interpeate scripture, then if we can agree on that simple issue, I promise to move on and answer your questions.",

While your church may very well be the oldest organized religious sect on earth, it is far from being the only source of the Spirit of God. Quite contrarily, I recognize it as the best source of False Prophets that I have encountered in my lifetime. It has also been (and may likely continue to be this day) the most influential impediment to the progress of civilization and scientific study that has ever existed. It is unspeakable the damage done during the suppression of Galeleo's work, the burning of 'heretical' books, the formation of Jewish ghettos and the wholesale murder of thousands of 'heretics' during the Inquistion.\n \n After 600 YEARS this pompous church has finally opened the Archives of the Inquisition (which has been conveniently renamed to some benign moniker) and the current Pope has apologized to the world for all the damage and suffering caused by the actions of former Popes and Cardinals who carried out the organized torture and murder of those who disagreed with the divine authority of the Pope. I think the Pope is admitting that Popes are not infallible. As he should...because they AIN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM ME AND YOU...they just wear what they consider to be holy robes and think they're hot :xcensored Spirits of God.\n \n Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. \n \n Slightly reworded, the operative words are: \"We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us.\" Thus sayeth the Pope and his cronies.\n \n ...and you...bein' a card-carryin' Catholic, lap up everything they say.\n \n How silly can you get?",

   "I would say one should only listen to a human voice IF it would assist him in times of confussion on for some help in understanding. If that voice contradicts any correct doctrine or scripture, you should not heed any of it for fear of being led astray in subtle or great increments\n \n No man is an intermediary between you and God.\n That middle-man nonsense was done away with.\n The only covering is Christ and Scripture and the Spirit should go hand in hand to a common goal at ALL times. Tradition and dogma is window dressing that should help to enhance you path and not detract from it.\n \n \n Orthodox Christianity and some others have what is called 'Spiritual Fathers'. I initially found about this by a WofFer who basically plagerized the concept then bastardized it to set himself up further as a cult leader, replacing the Christ and natural fathers with himself as a covering. Even going so far as to state Honor thy Father refered to himself (Pater meaning spiritual father too).\n \n From what I gathered, true spiritual fathers would be a sort of 'living saint' a person who is on the path that the Christ out lines and a person who could give guidance and mentor the babes in Christ as a matured Christian.\n There are some references to this style IIRC in the bible, like Paul to Peter or others. \n Some sects believe this position/behavior is for the Priests or Pastors but it would appear more personal than that from my mere readings. So I wouldn't know if that is true. \n But, it would be more akin to rearing a (new Christian) child in the way they should go so that they might mature in Christ and not be led astray by anything else.\n \n Should one simply say 'I believe' and then wait to hear/ feel the movement of a spirit, hoping it's the right one?\n Should emotionalism be confused for the Spirit?\n How about manipulations of cunning wolves in the pulpit (regardless of sect) be mistake for a spirital event.\n \n As for seminary or formal education...\n That is merely to ensure you are in orthodoxy with your beliefs and teachings. Like the bible calls Christians to police each other, the Bareans testing Pauls teachings for example or Paul correcting Peter, this is to weed out error that could (and often does) slip in. \n Once again, you should also test that too in accordance to scripture and the Spirt rather than blindly accept it.\n \n You can adhear to it, leave it, by pass it. But if you bypass it, you run the risk of not getting any checks and balances to what you make later believe.\n \n I've known one infamous local WofFer who disregarded all of his seminary training for a Hooked on Heresy version from Rhema and bodly stated that one morning, Jesus personally told him that He would strike down anyone who stood against him. \n That certainly didn't sound like anything I can think of the biblical Christ would say.",

Now it turns out the orders for this cover up were written in Rome at the highest levels of the Vatican. \n \n CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales has uncovered a church document kept secret for 40 years. \n \n The confidential Vatican document, obtained by CBS News, lays out a church policy that calls for absolute secrecy when it comes to sexual abuse by priests - anyone who speaks out could be thrown out of the church. \n \n The policy was written in 1962 by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani. \n \n The document, once \"stored in the secret archives\" of the Vatican, focuses on crimes initiated as part of the confessional relationship and what it calls the \"worst crime\": sexual assault committed by a priest\" or \"attempted by him with youths of either sex or with brute animals.\" \n \n Bishops are instructed to pursue these cases \"in the most secretive way...restrained by a perpetual silence...and everyone {including the alleged victim) ...is to observe the strictest secret, which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy Office...under the penalty of excommunication.\" \n \n Larry Drivon, a lawyer who represents alleged victims, said, \"This document is significant because it's a blueprint for deception.\" \n \n Drivon said this proves what he has alleged on behalf of victims in priest-abuse lawsuits: that the church engaged in a crime - racketeering. \n \n \"It's an instruction manual on how to deceive and how to protect pedophiles,\" Drivon said. \"And exactly how to avoid the truth coming out.\" \n \n The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the document is being taken out of context, that it's a church law that deals only with religious crimes and sins. And that the secrecy is meant to protect the faithful from scandal. \n \n \"The idea that this is some sort of blueprint to keep this secret is simply wrong,\" said Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the Conference. \n \n \"This is a system of law which is complete in itself and is not telling the bishops in any way about how to handle these crimes when they are considered as civil crimes,\" Maniscalco said. \n \n But Richard Sipe, a former priest who has written about sex abuse and secrecy in the church, said the document sends a chilling message. \n \n \"This is the code for how you must deal with sex by priests. You keep it secret at all costs,\" Sipe said. \"And that's what's happened. It's happened in every diocese in this country.\" \n \n According to church records, the document was a bedrock of Catholic sex abuse policy until America's bishops met last summer and drafted new policies to address the crisis in the church. \n \n And more quotes from CBS\n \n \n(CBS) For decades, priests in this country abused children in parish after parish while their superiors covered it all up.

   "Not so superior and sanctimonious anymore huh INRI. You see, when you place all of your faith in a church built by men, then you rise and fall with it. That is why my personal denomination, or church of choice is totally irrelevant to my personal doctrinal beliefs. Nor do i rest in the church in general as a guide for what I believe. Let me give you an example. I love a pastor/teacher of the Gospel named Chuck Smith. Google Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa and click on it. Then choose Series 2000 on the bottom and he has the whole bible there chapter by chapter that you can listen to.\n \n I tell you this for 2 reasons only. 1) so you can hear a bible teacher actually teach by the power of the Holy Spirit of God. Just pick any chapter of any book and give it a listen. #2) to tell you that Pastor Chuck teaches on and believes in the Pre Tribulation Rapture of the Church. Now I love him, his mind, and his wisdom, but I still don't accept or believe the Rapture will occur until the very end of the Tribulation period, and I mean possibly right before the Lords return. \n \n Believe me when i say I hope I'm wrong and Pastor Chuck is right, but I still hold to my beliefs according to the light I have received and I'm not sinning or revolting against any church or calling Chuck or God a liar by not accepting what this man whom I greatly respect say's about the pre-trib rapture. I am free in Christ to seek Gods truth and I'm beholding to no man or church. \n \n You don't have that freedom with the RCC. If you deny church teachings or doctrines as to how you must think and believe you become a heretic just as Martin Luther was seen as a Heretic when he realized by the power of the Holy Spirit that in order for Gods spiritual light to once again shine on Earth, and for the Holy Spirit of God to once again dwell within the hearts of men, then the bible, Gods Word must be freely accessible to all men and not just Priests who taught according to what the Pope determined men should believe.\n \n The only reason the RCC changed their policy of laymen owning bibles was because so many people acquired them anyway due to the Protestant Reformation so Rome begrudgingly dropped the policy. But their man made doctrines were already established traditions so they couldn't change them and remain credible. This is the true history of the RCC. I am constantly attacked in debates about the evils committed by Christianity through out the Centuries. And 95% of these atrocities were caused by the RCC on orders given by the Pope of the day. The rest were caused by National leaders who committed atrocities in Gods name. And then there were those Puritans. :)\n \n Here is more on the doctrinal contradictions I raised earlier but with scriptural evidence that what I'm saying is not my opinion but is supported by the Word of God itself. So stop with your sanctimonious religious speak and deal with some facts like a child of God who desires the truth over just empty platitudes and century old lies of a long dead church.\n \n I'll list the catholic tradition first and then what the Bible hss to say about the matter.\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Call priests father, e.g., Father McKinley.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS -\n \n Matthew 23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Forbidding the priesthood to marry.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS -\n \n 1) It is devilish to forbid God's people to marry when He has given marriage to be received with thanksgiving.\n 1 Timothy\n 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;\n 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;\n 4:3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.\n \n 2) Peter was married (remember the pope is supposedly continuing the apostolic line through Peter).\n \n Matthew\n 8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.\n \n Mark\n 1:30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.\n \n Luke\n 4:38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.\n \n 3) Paul, a great apostle, remained single; however he made it very clear that he could marry if he wanted to.\n \n 1 Corinthians\n 9:5 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Mary never had other children after the Lord Jesus. A perpetual virgin.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Mary and Joseph indeed had children. They were the Lord's half brothers and sisters for their father was Joseph and mother was Mary.\n \n Matthew\n 13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?\n 13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?\n Mark\n 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Mary is the queen of heaven.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Worshipping the queen of heaven (which is not the Mary of the Bible) is worshipping another god and it provokes the Lord to anger.\n \n Jeremiah\n 7:17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?\n 7:18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.\n 7:19 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?\n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Mary is the mother of God.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Mary is the mother of the earthly Jesus, not God. Jesus pre- existed from everlasting as God (see John 1:1). When He came to redeem mankind, He laid aside His glory and was made like unto sinful man so that He could take our punishment (Hebrew 2:9). God has no mother. He has lived from everlasting which means He had no beginning.\n \n Isaiah\n 43:10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. [If Mary gave birth to God, she'd be God.]\n Psalm\n 93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.\n \n Micah \n 5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler [Jesus] in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\n \n Philippians\n 2:6 Who [Jesus], being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\n 2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Pope called Holy Father.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - The term Holy Father is only found one time in the entire Bible. It was when Jesus prayed before He and His disciples went to the garden of Gethsemane. He referred to God the Father as Holy Father. It is blasphemy to call a man by God's name\n \n John\n 17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Purgatory, nuns, popes.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - None of these is mentioned in the Bible. It is a sin to add to the Bible.\n \n Proverbs\n 30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.\n The pope is a man who takes upon himself honor which belongs to no human being. Even the very name by which he allows himself to be called (Holy Father) is highly presumptuous and blasphemous (see above).\n \n One does not need the pope to determine what God's will is. The Bible says that God has given the Holy Ghost to each believer and that He (the Holy Ghost) guides and leads us into all truth. All a believer needs is the Bible and the Holy Ghost to know the will of the Lord. Popery has been treacherous, but worse, each pope has been the blind leading the blind. Jesus said that both will fall into the ditch. Catholics, come out of this system that cannot save and know Jesus for youself, intimate and up-close.\n \n NOTE: Purgatory is supposedly a place where a person is purified of sins--even popes supposedly go there. The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the one that purifies us of our sins. Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.... When a person dies their eternal home is sealed--heaven or hell--no in between. Hebrews 9:27 ...it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Venerating/worshipping images. Pope bows to statues of Mary, people worship the eucharist and have statues/candles in their homes and churches.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - It is idolatry to venerate images. We are not even supposed to make them.\n \n Exodus\n 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\n 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God...\n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - The mass. Through transubstantiation, the wafer/host and the wine supposedly become the actual blood and body of Jesus Christ when the priest prays over them.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Jesus died once for sins, never to be repeated. He sits on the right hand of God and does not reappear in the mass as a mass of blood and flesh.\n \n Hebrews\n 10:12 But this man [Jesus], after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;\n 10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.\n 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\n 10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,\n 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;\n 10:17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\n 10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.\n John\n 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\n \n 1 Corinthians\n 11:24 And when he [Jesus] had given thanks, he brake it [bread], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.\n 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.\n 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come (not for the forgiveness of sins or to receive Jesus).\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Saved, in part, by good works.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Good works are the fruits that grow out of being saved. They do not make you saved. An apple does not make its tree an apple tree, it was already an apple tree before any apples appeared. When you see the apples; however, you know what kind of tree it is. If a person is saved, he will shew forth good works because he has the spirit of Christ in him. The good works don't make him saved only the blood of Jesus can do that.\n \n I John\n 1:7b ...the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\n Acts 16:31b\n ...believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.\n \n Romans\n 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:\n 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;\n 3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\n 3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.\n 3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.\n \n What about James 2:20 \"faith without works is dead\"?\n \n The kind of faith that saves is a faith that shows forth the works of God. Even devils believe in Jesus and tremble (James 2:19). Many people believe in Jesus but they won't follow Him. They have a faith, but not the kind that saves. If a person has true faith in Jesus, the Holy Ghost dwells in him and will cause good works will show forth in his life. The good works confirm the faith by which the person was saved. James 2:21-23 uses Abraham as an example. Abraham believed God so when God asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac, Abraham, out of his faith in God, offered up Isaac.\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - The church is founded on Peter.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - Jesus Christ is the foundation of the church. Peter was a man like you and me. Jesus called Peter Satan in Matthew 16:23 when Peter rebuked Jesus dying. When Cornelius tried to worship Peter, Peter responded, \"Stand up; I myself also am a man.\" (Acts 10:26). The pope needs to remember Acts 10:26 when he has men bowing to him and kissing his hand like he is worthy of worship.\n \n 1 Corinthians\n 3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\n Matthew\n 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected [Jesus], the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\n \n * * * *\n CATHOLIC TRADITION - Confessing sins to a priest. Petitioning saints and Mary.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS - We are to confess our sins and needs to God alone.\n \n I John\n 1:9 If we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n Matthew\n 6:9, 12 After this manner...pray ye: Our Father... forgive us....\n \n 1 Timothy\n 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus [not Mary, not saints, not priests, not the pope];\n \n I John 2:1, ...And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\n \n * * * *\n There are many other scriptures that could have been used here to testify against the doctrines of the catholic religion. There are also many other doctrines of the catholic religion which could have been refuted (e.g. the sacraments, receiving the Holy Ghost, salvation through the catholic religion, penance, rosary, etc.).\n \n * * * *\n The Catholic religion has a history of taking the money of poor widows in order to say masses for the dead (which do no good) and collecting the material possessions of nuns. In Italy, the heart of Roman Catholicism, there is an often used saying that goes, \"Without money, they don't sing the mass.\" That is really pitiful on several fronts--1) mass is blasphemous and people who trust in it are hell-bound 2) there's no such thing as purgatory and 3) the gift of God is without price.\n \n Roman Catholicism today is probably the wealthiest government in the world. It owns a good share of America's hospitals and has healthy real estate interests. The bottom line is, if you want to get right with God, you have to go through His Son, Jesus Christ, not some religious organization. \n ",

   "The Divine Rebuke of Corrupt Religious Authority\n Two streams of Christianity have been operating side-by-side for 2000 years. One is the body of Christ, the apostolic church which includes all who have been born again with the Spirit of God. This true church holds to the faith of the apostles and submits to the authority of Scripture. The other stream is apostate Christianity; those who profess Christ but hold to a different gospel and therefore have never experienced the second birth( 1 John 2:19-20).\n \n Since apostasy also occurred in Judaism, there is a critical question to consider. Was the action that caused the Jews to depart from the only religion God ordained, the same action that caused apostates to depart from the only Church Christ established? Yes! The fatal error common to both occurred when religious leaders replaced God's authority with an authority of their own. The Pharisees used the Chair of Moses to distort God's word with their own traditions and the Roman Catholic Church has used the Chair of Peter to do the same. It is indeed astonishing to see how the Catholic clergy resembles the Pharisees of first century Judaism. Both became corrupt when they rejected the absolute supreme authority of Scripture. While we know how Jesus condemned the hypocritical Pharisees for their character and conduct, we can only wonder if the same rebukes would apply to the Catholic clergy today. The Pharisee's stubborn refusal to submit to God's authority ultimately led them to reject Jesus as the Messiah, while the same stubborn refusal has led the Catholic clergy to reject Him as their all-sufficient Savior.\n \n In Matthew 23 Jesus gives His last public sermon and it is filled with sharp rebukes against the corrupt religious leadership of the Pharisees. The sermon is also a warning for those who follow false shepherds instead of the True Shepherd. It is therefore my prayer that Catholics will take an objective look at their religious leaders. Have they become just as corrupt as the shepherds of God's chosen people? Let us look at the similarities between the Pharisees and the Roman Catholic clergy.\n \n They Oppose Divine Authority\n In Matthew 23:2, Jesus says: \"The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses,\" the position of authority. Notice that they seated themselves, God did not put them there. In doing so, they opposed divine authority by establishing their own. This is analogous to Catholic priests. They stubbornly continue a sacrificial priesthood which was divinely terminated 2000 years ago. When Jesus, the High Priest offered Himself once, as a sacrifice for sin, for all time, there was no longer a need for priestly sacrifices. Our merciful God made this clear when He tore open the veil that once prevented access into His presence by anyone other than sanctified priests (Mark 15:38). We now \"have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh, and since we have a great Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith' (Heb. 10:19-22).\n \n Catholic priests are not called by God, nor are they in the will of God. Their bogus offerings can never take away sin nor can they do what Jesus has already done: \"by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified\" (Heb. 10:11).\n \n They Prevent Entrance into Heaven \n In Matthew 23:13, Jesus condemns the Pharisees for doing the same thing Catholic priests are doing. Jesus declares: \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.\" Both the Pharisees and Catholic clergy have kept people out of the Kingdom with their legalistic teachings that nullify God's sovereign grace. They bar the gates of heaven with a works-righteousness system that leaves their followers hopelessly guilty and without assurance or peace. Many Catholics, who are zealous for God, are working to establish their own righteousness because they have been taught a perversion of the Gospel. Their priests \"malign the way of truth\" and point them to the wide road that leads to destruction (Mat. 7:13: 2 Pet. 2:1-2).\n \n Their Converts Become Sons of Hell\n In verse 15, Jesus again curses the Pharisees. \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte [convert]; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.\" The Catholic clergy also makes their converts \"sons of hell.\" Their ministry is not one of conversion but of perversion. Instead of proclaiming the good news of Christ's finished work of redemption, they pervert the message with continuous offerings for sin that keep converts in ritualistic bondage (Catechism [CCC], 1367). Priests deny the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice by insisting Catholics must make their own satisfaction for sins (CCC, 1459). After doing their penance, Catholics are given the false hope by priests that their sins have been forgiven.\n \n Catholics are instructed that Jesus merely opened the gates of heaven with His death and resurrection. Since He only made salvation possible, a perversion of the true gospel is necessary to instruct Catholics what they must do to enter the gates of heaven (CCC, 2027). Converts to this damning gospel of works and sacraments remain under God's wrath. Their destiny remains unchanged - a Christ-less eternity of torment.\n \n They Are Self Indulgent and Robbers\n In verse 25, Jesus cursed the Jewish leaders for their external piety which hid their internal corruption. \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.\" The Catholic clergy is also guilty of robbery and self-indulgence. Although their subjects view them as trustworthy with a supernatural touch of holiness, they have a long history of sexual immorality that includes raping and robbing children of their innocence. Some of the pedophile priests have been caught and exposed, but their bishops relocated them to other parishes where they continued indulging in sexual perversions. Rather than being godly shepherds who protect their flock, they are wicked wolves who destroy the flock.\n \n There is no gentle way to expose the Catholic clergy who rob and extort millions of dollars each year from their congregations with the ungodly practice of indulgences. Priests perpetuate the fraudulent scam of indulgences and purgatory in order to collect stipends from grieving individuals who want to reduce the time of suffering for their loved ones. This may be the cruelest hoax of all time. It is a deceptive practice that holds people in bondage to their church not only in this life but even after death.\n \n They Are Hypocrites\n In verse 27, Jesus curses them for their hypocrisy. \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.\" This hypocrisy is also common among the Catholic clergy. They appear pious in their liturgical robes, but underneath the vestments are spiritually dead men. Their unregenerate hearts cause others to fall into hypocrisy. Since they do not have hearts controlled by the Spirit they must hide their wicked hearts with outward pomp. They say they represent Jesus Christ but, by means of hypocrisy, they follow doctrines of demons (I Tim. 4:1-3). Since they reject \"doctrines conforming to godliness,\" their lives are marked by sin instead of godliness ( I Tim. 6:3; Jude 4, 8-16).\n \n They Are Boastful and Proud\n In verse 29, Jesus condemns the religious leaders for boasting that they were better than their forefathers. \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say, 'If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\"' Recently we have heard apologies from the Vatican for the persecution of Jews and Christians throughout history. The Catholic clergy of today is saying, we are not like our forefathers, we no longer kill the servants of God; you can trust us. We would agree they are better today than in the past, but that is nothing to boast about. History reveals that previous popes were guilty of committing nearly every sin and crime possible, including assassinations, murder, rape, adultery, fornication, incest, robbery, conspiracy, bribery, fraud and perjury. The corruption of 29 popes as so contemptible that the Vatican has listed them as \"anti-popes.\" However, its attempt at revising history cannot erase the ungodly scandals and crimes of the papacy.\n \n Jesus accentuates his rebukes with a sobering question. \"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell?\" May we all learn from biblical history and urgently and forcefully warn our loved ones, who are following false shepherds, to turn to the only True Shepherd!\n \n This page URL:\n http://www.pro-gospel.org/01/ea-029.php",

   "CRIMES OF THE POPES\n WE now give a rapid summary of the crimes and vices with which many of the popes disgraced the chair of St. Peter; and before we conclude, the reader will see that every villainy the imagination can conceive has been practised by the vicegerents of God. Peculation, theft, cruelty, murder, fornication, adultery, and incest, not to mention still darker crimes, have all been notoriously committed by the supreme rulers of Christendom, who sat in the seat of infallibility, and claimed universal jurisdiction over the thoughts and consciences of mankind. \n \n ST. DAMASUS (366-84). He was the first to assume the title of Pontiff. His election was opposed by Ursicinus, whose partisans accused Damasus of adultery. [122:1] Riddle says: \n \n \"After some deadly conflicts between the followers of the two rivals, Ursicinus was banished from the city; and a similar sentence was about to be carried into effect against seven presbyters of his party, when the people interfered, and lodged them for safety in one of the churches. But even here they found no shelter from the fury of their opponents. Armed with fire and sword, Damasus, with some of his adherents, both of the clergy and of the laity, proceeded to the place of refuge, and left no less than a hundred and sixty of their adversaries dead within the sacred precincts.\" [122:2] \n That this was a massacre and not a faction fight is shown by the fact that on the side of Damasus not a single person was killed. [123:3] Ammianus Marcellinus, the contemporary historian of the event, says of the contention between Damasus and Ursicinus: \n \n \"I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that reigns at Rome, that those who desire such rank and power may be justified in laboring with all possible exertions and vehemence to obtain their wishes; since after they have succeeded, they will be secure for the future, being enriched by offerings from matrons, riding in carriages, dressing splendidly, and feasting luxuriously, so that their entertainment surpassed even royal banquets. [123:4] \n Damasus gained the title of Auriscalpius Matronarum, ladies' ear-scratcher. [123:5] He died of fever, and the Romish Church still invokes the aid of this saintly vicar of God in fever cases. [123:6] \n \n SIXTUS III (432-40). This pope, according to both Baronius and Platina, was accused of debauching a virgin, but was acquitted by a Council under the Emperor Valentina, who is said to have referred the pronouncing of the sentence to the Pope himself, \"because the judge of all ought to be judged by none.\" It was without doubt to establish this maxim that the \"acts\" of the Council were forged. [123:7] \n \n ST. LEO THE GREAT (440-61). Jortin calls him \"the insolent and persecuting Pope Leo, who applauded the massacre of the Priscillianists, and grossly misrepresented them.\" [123:8] \n \n SYMMACHUS (498-514). His election was violently opposed by the antipope Laurentius, and three Councils were held to decide the schism. Accusations of the most heinous crimes were laid against Symmachus. Bower says: \n \n \"This gave occasion to the rekindling of the war between the two parties in Rome; and several priests, many clerks, and a great number of citizens, fell daily in the battles that were fought in the different parts of the city. No regard was shown by either party to rank or dignity; and not even the sacred virgins were spared by the enraged multitude in their fury.\" [123:9] \n Eunodius declared that the Pope was \"judge in the place of the most high, pure from all sin, and exempt from all punishment. All who fell fighting in his cause he declared enrolled on the register of heaven.\" [124:1] \n \n ST. HORMISDAS (514-23). He was a married man, and had a son, who was raised to the popedom. He was full of ambition, and insolent in his demands to the emperor, whom he exhorted to the persecution of heretics. \n \n BONIFACE II (530-32). His election was disputed by the antipope Dioscorus. Each accused the other of simony, but Dioscorus opportunely died. Boniface \"began his pontificate with wreaking his vengeance on the memory of his deceased competitor, whom he solemnly excommunicated, as guilty of simony, when he could not clear himself from the charge, nor retort it on him, as perhaps he otherwise might.\" [124:2] This sentence was removed by Pope Agapetus. \n \n SILVERIUS (536-38). He was accused of betraying the city of Rome to the Goths, and was in consequence expelled from his see. \n \n VIGILUS (537-55). He was a deacon elected by bribery. He engaged himself to obey the Empress Theodora, who gave him money to gain the suffrages of the clergy. Anastasius tells us that he killed his own secretary in a transport of passion, and caused his own sister's son to be whipped to death. He is considered to have been accessory to the banishment and death of Silverius. When banished himself by the emperor, he speedily repented, in order to save his seat. \n \n PELAGIUS (555-60). He was accused of poisoning his predecessor. This is uncertain; but it is certain that, like most of his predecessors and successors, he incited the civil powers to the persecution of heretics. \n \n ST. GREGORY THE GREAT (590-604). According to Gibbon, this pontiff was \"a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense and superstition.\" [124:3] Jortin's picture is still less flattering: \n \n \"Pope Gregory the Great was remarkable for many things -- for exalting his own authority; for running down human learning [125:4] and polite literature; for burning classic authors; for patronising ignorance and stupidity; for persecuting heretics; for flattering the most execrable princes; and for relating a multitude of absurd, monstrous and ridiculous lies, called miracles. He was an ambitious, insolent prelate, under the mask of humility.\" [125:5] \n Draper says that Gregory not only forbade the study of the classics, mutilated statues, and destroyed temples but also \"burned the Palatine library, founded by Augustus Caesar.\" Gibbon, however, throws doubt on this destruction, while admitting that it was generally believed. [125:6] \n \n Gregory does not appear to have been fond of women and wine, like so many other popes; but he possessed the darker vices of bigotry and ambition. His congratulations on the usurpation of the cruel, drunken and lascivious Phocas, after a wholesale massacre of the emperor's family, simply because the successful villain favored the pretensions of Rome (p. 109), are a sufficient proof that Gregory would scruple at nothing to advance the glory of his see. \n \n SABINIAN (604-6). Bower says he rendered himself so odious to the Roman people by his avarice and cruelty to the poor, that they could not forbear abusing him whenever he appeared. In a dreadful famine he raised the price of corn to exorbitant rates. He accused St. Gregory of simony; but according to Baronius, that departed saint having vainly reproved him in three different apparitions for his covetousness, gave him in a fourth apparition so dreadful a blow on the head, that he died soon after. [125:7] \n \n BONIFACE III (607). By flattering Phocas as Gregory had done, he induced him to take the title of universal bishop from the bishop of Constantinople, and confer it upon himself and his successors. \n \n THEODORUS (642-49). He commenced the custom of dipping his pen in consecrated wine when signing the condemnation of heretics, [126:8] thus sanctifying murder with the blood of Christ. Of Adeodatus, Donus I, Agatho, and Leo II, we only know that they carried on fierce contests with the archbishop of Ravenna for refusing to acknowledge their supremacy. Leo II anathematised his predecessor, Pope Honorius, for heresy. [126:9] Neither Benedict II, John V, nor Conon, lived a whole year after assuming the tiara. \n \n ST. SERGIUS I (687-701). He had to purchase his seat from the exarch of Ravenna by pawning the ornaments of the tomb of St. Peter. He was accused of adultery, but his innocence was strikingly proved; for, upon the child of whose parentage he was accused being baptised when but eight days old, he cried out, \"The pontiff Sergius is not my father.\" Bruys, the French historian of the Papacy, says, \"What I find most marvellous in this story is, not that so young a child should speak, but that it should affirm with so much confidence that the pope was not its father.\" [126:1] \n \n CONSTANTINE (708-15). He is said to have excommunicated the Emperor, Philip Bardanes, for being of the same heresy as Pope Honorius. To oblige Constantine, Justinian II cut out the tongue and blinded the eyes of the Archbishop of Ravenna, who refused to pay the obedience due to the apostolic see. [126:2] \n \n ST. GREGORY II (715-31). He was chiefly noted for his endowing monasteries with the goods of the poor, and for his opposition to the Emperor Leo's edict against image worship. [126:3] Rather than obey the edict, he raised civil war both in Italy and elsewhere. He prayed that Christ might set the Devil on the emperor, and approved the barbarous murder of the imperial officer. [126:4] Yet the priests place in the list of saints a pontiff who, to establish the Christian idolatry of image worship, filled Italy with carnage. \n \n STEPHEN III (768-72). When elected he found on the pontifical throne a lay pope, one Constantine, who, after a violent struggle, was dislodged and punished with the loss of his eyes, [127:5] many of his friends sharing the same fate. [127:6] \n \n ADRIAN I (772-95). He made a league with Irene, the murderess of her son, to restore image worship, and presented to Charlemagne the pretended donation of Constantine. [127:7] Avarice was the vice of this able pontiff. He left large sums to his successors. \n \n ST. PASCAL I (817-24). At the Diet of Compeigne this pope was charged with being accessory to the mutilation and murder of two Roman priests. The Pope denied the charge, but refused to deliver up the perpetrators of the crimes, alleging that they belonged \"to the family of St. Peter.\" [127:8] \n \n EUGENIUS II (824-27). He had the honor of inventing the barbarous practice of ordeal by cold water. \n \n NICHOLAS (858-67). He excommunicated Photius, the Greek patriarch, and the emperor Michael as his abettor, and threatened King Lothaire with the ecclesiastical sword if he suffered any bishop to be chosen without his consent. [127:9] \n \n ADRIAN II (867-72). He was a married priest. He congratulated Bazilius, the murderer of the emperor Michael, and entered into alliance with him. [127:1] \n \n JOHN VIII (872-82). The meek and holy nature of this worthy successor of St. Peter may be judged by his ordering the Bishop of Naples to bring him the chief men among the Saracens in that city, and cutting their throats in the presence of his legate. [127:2] A letter of John is extant, in which he justifies Athanasius, Bishop of Naples, for having plucked out the eyes of Sergius, Duke of Naples, who favored the Saracens in despite of the papal anathemas. He even cites the Gospel text as to plucking out offending eyes. Cardinal Baronius declares that this pontiff perjured himself, and that he rather deserved the name of a woman than that of a man. [128:3] The annals of the Abbey of Fulda relate that John VIII was poisoned by the relations of a lady whom he had seduced from her husband. [128:4] \n \n FORMOSUS (891-96). He had been repeatedly excommunicated by John VIII. He invited Arnulf, the German emperor, to invade Italy, which he did, committing great atrocities. Formosus, however, had a great character for piety. He is said to have been well versed in scripture, and to have died a virgin in his eightieth year. \n \n BONIFACE VI (896). Even according to Baronius, he was a man of most infamous character. He had been deposed for his scandalous life, first from the rank of sub-deacon, and afterward from the priesthood. [128:5] \n \n STEPHEN VI. (896-7). He intruded into the see in the room of the intruder Boniface. Being of the opposite faction to Pope Formosus, he caused the body of that pontiff to be taken out of the tomb and to be placed, in the episcopal robes, on the pontifical chair. Stephen then addressed the dead body thus: \"Why didst thou, being Bishop of Porto, prompted by thy ambition, usurp the universal see of Rome?\" After this mock trial Stephen, with the approbation and consent of a Council of bishops, ordered the body to be stripped, three of the fingers (those used in blessing) to be cut off, and the remains to be cast into the Tiber. At the same Council all the ordinations of Formosus were declared invalid. [128:6] \n \n Then followed what Riddle calls \"a rapid succession of infamous popes,\" of whom we may mention that Leo V (903) was deposed and cast into prison by his chaplain, Christopher, who was in turn ejected and imprisoned by Sergius III (904-11). This pontiff also had been excommunicated by John VIII. He was, says Baronius, \"the slave of every vice and the most wicked of men.\" [128:7] Riddle says: \n \n \"This Sergius III was a monster of profligacy, cruelty and vice in their most shameless and disgusting forms. But it was this very character which made him useful to his party, the duration of whose influence at Rome, could be insured only by a preponderance of physical power, and this again only by violence which should disdain all restraints of morality and religion. Sergius was the man for this purpose, who, while he lived in concubinage with Marozia, did not hesitate to yield all the treasures of the Roman Church as plunder to his party.\" [129:8] To him succeeded other paramours of Marozia and of her mother the prostitute Theodora. John X, for instance (914-28), received his chair because he was the lover of Theodora, while Leo VI and Stephen VIII (929-31) were creatures of Marozia. Adultery and assassination form the staple of the annals of their pontificates. \n \n JOHN XI (931-36). He was the son of Pope Sergius III. by Marozia, and if possible he surpassed his parents in crime. Elected pope at the age of eighteen, Alberic, his half brother, expelled him from Rome and imprisoned their mother Marozia. Stephen VIII (939-942) made himself so obnoxious to the Romans that they mutilated him. [129:9] \n \n JOHN XII (956-64), the son of Alberic, was the first to change his name, which was originally Octavian. He nominated himself pope at the age of seventeen. Wilks says: \"His profaneness and debaucheries exceeded all bounds. He was publicly accused of concubinage, incest, and simony.\" This pope was so notorious for his licentiousness that female pilgrims dared not present themselves in Rome. [129:1] Bower says that he had changed the Lateran Palace, once the abode of saints, into a brothel, and there cohabited with his father's concubine; that women were afraid to come from other countries to visit the tombs of the apostles at Rome; that he spared none, and had within a few days forced married women, widows, and virgins to comply with his impure desires. He was at length deposed by Otho, at the solicitation of a council of bishops and laymen, on charges of sacrilege, simony, blasphemy, and cruel mutilation. He had deprived one deacon of his right hand and made him a eunuch. He put out the eyes of Benedict, his ghostly father, cut off the nose of the keeper of the archives, and scourged the Bishop of Spires. [130:2] On the deposition of John, Leo VII was put in his place. John fulminated anathemas against his opponents, and soon after died, from a blow on the head while in bed with a married woman. [130:3] Jortin remarks that \"Baronius says, from Luitprandus, that it was the Devil who gave John that blow; but it seems not probable that Satan would have used his good friend in such a manner. It is more likely that it might be the husband of the adulteress.\" [130:4] \n \n Mosheim says \"that the history of the Roman pontiffs of this century [the tenth] is a history of monsters, a history of the most atrocious villainies and crimes, is acknowledged by all writers of distinction, and even by the advocates of popery.\" [130:5] \n \n BONIFACE VII (974). The old authors in derision call him Maliface. Having had his predecessor Benedict murdered, he plundered the Basilica and escaped with his spoils to Constantinople, whence he afterwards returned and murdered John XIV (984), then on the papal throne. \n \n GREGORY V (996-99). He was turned out of his see by Crescentius, who elected the antipope John. Upon Gregory's restoration he had this unfortunate creature deprived of sight, cut off his nose, and tore out his tongue. He then ordered him to be led through the streets in a tattered sacerdotal suit, and mounted upon an XXX with his face to the tail, which he held in his hand. [130:6] \n \n SERGIUS IV (1009-12). This pope was called Os Porci, or Swine's Mouth. Of his doings little is known, but he is asserted to have gravely declared \"that the pope could not be damned, but that, do what he would, he must be saved.\" [130:7] \n \n BENEDICT VIII (1012-24). He saved the city of Rome from a great storm, which it seems was caused by some Jews. The Jews being immediately executed the storm ceased. [131:8] \n \n JOHN XIX (1024-33). He was a layman, brother of Benedict, yet he was raised to the see. Wilks says: \n \n \"It was by gold, and not by imperial power, that the Romans consented to this uncanonical election. The rapacity of this pope was so great that he offered to sell the title of 'Universal Bishop' to the see of Constantinople for a sum of money!\" [131:9] \n By his exactions, debauchery and tyranny, he became so odious to the Romans that he had to flee for his life. \n \n BENEDICT IX (1033-46). A nephew of the last two pontiffs. Some say he was raised to the papacy at the age of twelve -- others, at eighteen. He \"stained the sacred office with murder, adultery, and every other heinous crime.\" [131:1] Desiderius, afterwards pope under the name of Victor III, styles Benedict the successor of Simon the sorcerer, and not of Simon the apostle, and paints him as one abandoned to all manner of vice. [131:2] Being eager to possess the person and property of a female cousin, he sold the papacy to John Gratianus, \"the most religious man of his time,\" for a sum of money, and consecrated him as Gregory VI. Benedict afterwards poisoned Pope Damasus II. The Romans, weary of his crimes, expelled him from the city, but he was reinstated by Conrad. \"But,\" says Jortin, \"as he continued his scandalous course of life, and found himself despised and detested both by clergy and laity, he agreed to retire, and to abandon himself more freely to his pleasures.\" Stipulating therefore to receive a sum of money, he resigned his place to Gratianus, called Gregory VI, and went to live in his own territories. [131:3] \n \n Mosheim calls Benedict IX \"a most flagitious man and capable of every crime.\" [131:4] \n \n We have already seen how Benedict, Sylvester, and Gregory, were alike declared unworthy of the pontificate, and Clement placed in the see, and by what means Hildebrand contrived to extend the papal power. This great pontiff, Gregory VII (1073-85), has been accused of poisoning his predecessors in order to obtain the popedom, and also of committing adultery with Matilda, Countess of Tuscany, who bestowed all her possessions on the pope. But these accusations probably arose from the spite of the many enemies aroused by Hildebrand's high-handed measures. \n \n PASCAL II (1099-1118). He was a disciple of Hildebrand, and inherited his ambition without his talents. He compelled Henry IV to abdicate, but on his son Henry V marching against him, after a sanguinary struggle, he gave up to the emperor the right of investiture. Afterwards he excommunicated all who should declare his own grant to be valid. [132:5] \n \n ADRIAN IV (1154-59). The only Englishman who ever became pope. He caused Arnold of Brescia to be burnt at the stake (1154) for preaching against papal corruption. The Irish should remember that it was this pope who, in virtue of the pretended Donation of Constantine, made over to Henry II of England the right to take and govern Ireland on condition of the pope receiving an annual tribute of one penny for each house. [132:6] \n \n ALEXANDER III (1159-81). The Lateran Council (1179) declared war against all heretics, and a crusade against them was sanctioned by this pontiff. [132:7] \n \n CLEMENT III (1188-1191). He published the third crusade (1189). \n \n INNOCENT III (1198-1216) also preached a crusade. He claimed for his see universal empire and established the Inquisition to support the claim. He excommunicated Philip II of France and put the whole nation under interdict. Afterwards he placed England under interdict, excommunicated John, bestowed the crown on Philip of France, and published a crusade against England. He also instituted a crusade against the Albigenses, butchering them by tens of thousands with every circumstance of atrocity. [132:8] \n \n GREGORY IX (1227-41). He formally established the Inquisition; and, to support his ambition and the unbridled luxury of his court, raised taxes in France, England and Germany, excommunicated kings, and incited nations to revolt; finally causing himself to be driven from Rome. [133:9] \n \n INNOCENT IV (1243-54). He conspired against the life of the Emperor Frederic, through the agency of the Franciscan monks. To avoid confronting his accuser, he retired to France, summoned a council at Lyons (1244), and excommunicated and deposed the emperor, whom he coolly denominated his vassal. He also excommunicated the kings of Arragon and Portugal, giving the crown of the latter to the Count of Bologna. He persecuted the Ghibellines, and pretending to have the right of disposing of the crown of the two Sicilies, offered it to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother to Henry III of England. Innocent made exorbitant claims to the bishoprics and benefices in England. [133:1] \n \n BONIFACE VIII (1294-1303). He had his predecessor, Celestine, put in prison, where he died. [133:2] He openly styled himself \"King of Kings,\" trafficked in indulgences, and declared all excluded from heaven who disputed his claim to universal dominion. He persecuted the Ghibellines, and ordered the city of Bragneste to be entirely destroyed. He was publicly accused of simony, assassination, usury, of living in concubinage with his two nieces and having children by them, and of using the money received for indulgences to pay the Saracens for invading Italy. [133:3] \n \n CLEMENT V (1305-1314). He is noted for his cruel suppression of the order of Knights Templar, so as to appropriate their property. He summoned the grand master of the Templars under false pretexts to his court, and issued a bull against the order in which he brought against it the most unfounded and absurd charges, and finally pronounced its abolition, having the Grand Master and many leading members burnt alive. [134:4] After sharing the spoils of the Templars with the king of France, Clement V fixed his court at Avignon, and gave himself publicly to the most criminal debaucheries. He preached a new crusade against the Turks and gave each new crusader the right to release four souls from purgatory. Dante places him in hell. \n \n JOHN XXII (1316-34). Like his predecessors, he persecuted and burnt heretics. He anathematised the emperor of Germany and the king of France, and preached a new crusade. Money was raised in abundance by the sale of indulgences, and was misappropriated by the pope. He left enormous treasures. Villani, whose brother was one of the papal commission, states that this successor of the fisherman amassed altogether twenty-five million florins. [134:5] Gieseler says: \"He arbitrarily disposed of the Benefices of all countries, chiefly in favor of his own nephews, and the members of his curia.\" [134:6] \n \n URBAN VI (1378-89). In his time occurred what is known as \"the great Western schism,\" which lasted from 1378 till the Council of Constance (1414). There were during that time two popes, one residing at Rome and the other at Avignon. But which of the popes was the true one and which the antipope has not yet been decided. Urban VI was a ferocious despot. He ordered six cardinals, whom he suspected of opposing him, to be brutally tortured. [134:7] Nor was his competitor, Clement VII, behind him in violence and crime. For fifty years they and their successors excited bloody wars and excommunicated one another. The schism, which cost thousands of lives, was ended by the deposition of John XXIII (1415), who was found guilty of murder and incest. He was accused before the Council of having seduced two hundred nuns. Theodoric de Niem informs us that he kept two hundred mistresses in Bologna, and he is described by his own secretary as a monster of avarice, ambition, lewdness and cruelty. [135:8] The same author says that an act of accusation, prepared against him, presented a complete catalogue of every mortal crime. \n \n MARTIN V (1417-31). His crimes were not of a kind to be censured by a Council of bishops. He had John Huss and Jerome of Prague burnt alive, and to put down their heresies excited civil war in Bohemia. He wrote to the Duke of Lithuania: \"Be assured thou sinnest mortally in keeping faith with heretics.\" \n \n EUGENIUS IV (1431-47). His first act was to put to torture the treasurer of his predecessor, Martin V. He seized that pontiff's treasures and sent to the scaffold two hundred Roman citizens, friends of the late pope. [135:9] The Council of Basle was called and deposed the pope, setting up an antipope, Felix V. Civil war and much cruelty of course followed. \n \n PAUL II (1464-71). He broke all the engagements he had made to the conclave prior to his election. He persecuted with the greatest cruelty and perfidy the Count of Anguillara. He strove to kindle a general war throughout Italy, and excommunicated the king of Bohemia for protecting the Hussites against his persecutions. He also persecuted the Fratricelli. \"His love of money,\" says Symonds, \"was such that, when bishoprics fell vacant, he often refused to fill them up, drawing their revenues for his own use, and draining Christendom as a Verres or a Memmius sucked a Roman province dry. His court was luxurious, and in private he was addicted to all the sensual lusts.\" [135:1] The same writer says that \"He seized the chief members of the Roman Academy, imprisoned them, put them to the torture, and killed some of them upon the rack.\" [135:2] He died suddenly, leaving behind him an immense treasure in money and jewels, amassed by his avarice and extortion. [135:3] \n \n SIXTUS IV (1471-84). He strove to excel his predecessors in crime. According to Symonds, \"He began his career with a lie; for though he succeeded, to that demon of avarice, Paul, who had spent his time in amassing money which he did not use, he declared that he had only found five thousand florins in the papal treasury.\" The historian continues: \n \n \"This assertion was proved false by the prodigality with which he lavished wealth immediately upon his nephews. It is difficult even to hint at the horrible suspicions which were cast upon the birth of two of the Pope's nephews and upon the nature of his weakness for them: yet the private life of Sixtus rendered the most monstrous stories plausible, while his public treatment of these men recalled to mind the partiality of Nero for Doryphorus ... The Holy Father himself was wont to say, A Pope needs only pen and ink to get what sum he wants.' ... Fictitious dearths were created; the value of wheat was raised to famine prices; good grain was sold out of the kingdom, and bad imported in exchange; while Sixtus forced his subjects to purchase from his stores, and made a profit by the hunger and disease of his emaciated provinces.\" [136:4] \n Ranke declares: \n \n \"He was restrained by no scruple from rendering his spiritual power subservient to his worldly views, or from debasing it by a mixture with those temporary intrigues in which his ambition had involved him. The Medici being peculiarly in his way, he took part in the Florentine troubles; and, as is notorious, brought upon himself the suspicion of being privy to the conspiracy of the Pazzi, and to the assassination which they perpetrated on the steps of the altar of the cathedral: the suspicion that he, the father of the faithful, was an accomplice of such acts! When the Venetians ceased to favor the scheme of his nephew, as they had done for a considerable time, the pope was not satisfied with deserting them in a war into which he himself had driven them; he went so far as to excommunicate them for persisting in it. He acted with no less violence in Rome: he persecuted the Colonnas with great ferocity: he seized Marino from them; he caused the prothonotary Colonna to be attacked, arrested and executed in his own house. The mother of Colonna came to San Celso in Branchi, where the body lay -- she lifted the severed head by the hair, and cried 'Behold the head of my son! Such is the faith of the pope. He promised that if we would give up Marino to him he would set my son at liberty; he has Marino: and my son is in our hands -- but dead! Behold thus does the pope keep his word.'\" [136:5] \n Jortin says that \"Sixtus IV erected a famous bawdy-house at Rome, and the Roman prostitutes paid his holiness a weekly tax, which amounted sometimes to twenty thousand ducats a year.\" [137:6] \n \n INNOCENT VIII (1484-92). Schlegel, in his notes to Mosheim, says he \"lived so shamefully before he mounted the Roman throne, that he had sixteen illegitimate children to make provision for. Yet on the papal throne he played the zealot against the Germans, whom he accused of magic, and also against the Hussites, whom he well-nigh exterminated.\" [137:7] Wilks says: \"He obtained the votes of the cardinals by bribery, and violated all his promises.\" [137:8] The practice of selling offices prevailed under him as well as under his predecessors. \"In corruption,\" says Symonds, \" he advanced a step even beyond Sixtus, by establishing a bank at Rome for the sale of pardons. Each sin had its price, which might be paid at the convenience of the criminal: one hundred and fifty ducats of the tax were poured into the Papal coffers; the surplus fell to Franceschetto, the Pope's son.\" [137:9] The Vice-Chancellor of this rapacious pontiff, on being asked why indulgences were permitted for the worst scandals, made answer that \"God wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should pay and live.\" It must be added that \"the traffic which Innocent and Franceschetto carried on in theft and murder filled the Campagna with brigands and assassins.\" [137:1] The Pope's vices cost him so much that he even pledged the papal tiara as a security for money. \n \n ALEXANDER VI (1492-1503). Roderic Borgia was one of the most depraved wretches that ever lived. His passions were so unbridled that, having conceived a liking for a widow and two daughters, he made them all subservient to his brutality. Wilks calls him \"a man of most abandoned morals, deep duplicity, and unscrupulous ambition. Like his predecessors, he had but one object at heart, the temporal and hereditary aggrandisement of his family.\" [138:2] Mosheim says: \"So many and so great villainies, crimes and enormities are recorded of him, that it must be certain he was destitute not only of all religion, but also of decency and shame.\" [138:3] This pope, at a certain feast, had fifty courtesans dancing, who, at a given signal, threw off every vestige of clothing and -- we draw a veil over the scene! \"To describe him,\" says Symonds, \"as the Genius of Evil, whose sensualities, as unrestrained as Nero's, were relieved against the background of flame and smoke which Christianity had raised for fleshly sins, is justifiable.\" [138:4] His besetting vice was sensuality; in oriental fashion he maintained a harem in the Vatican. He invited the Sultan Bajazet to enter Europe and relieve him of the princes who opposed his intrigues in favor of his children. \n \n In regard to his death we follow Ranke: \n \n \"It was but too certain that he once meditated taking off one of the richest of the cardinals by poison. His intended victim, however, contrived, by means of presents, promises and prayers, to gain over his head cook, and the dish which had been prepared for the cardinal was placed before the pope. He died of the poison he had destined for another.\" [138:5] \n JULIUS II (1503-13). He obtained the pontificate by fraud and bribery, [138:6] and boldly took the sword to extend his dominion. [138:7] Mosheim says: \n \n \"That this Julius II possessed, besides other vices, very great ferocity, arrogance, vanity, and a mad passion for war, is proved by abundant testimony. In the first place, he formed an alliance with the Emperor and the King of France, and made war upon the Venetians. He next laid siege to Ferrara. And at last, drawing the Venetians, the Swiss and the Spaniards, to engage in the war with him, he made an attack on Lewis XII, the king of France. Nor, so long as he lived, did he cease from embroiling all Europe.\" [138:8] \n PAUL III (1531-49). He was as much a man of the world as any of his predecessors. He acknowledged an illegitimate son and daughter. [138:9] The emperor once remonstrated with him on having promoted two of his grandsons to the cardinalate at too early an age. He replied that he would do as his predecessors had done -- that there were examples of infants in the cradle being made cardinals. [139:1]\n \n \n We now close this horrid list of criminals. Since the Reformation the popes have been obliged to live more decently, or at least to conceal their vices instead of flaunting them before the world. Should the Protestants object that they are in no way responsible for the crimes of the Papacy, we shall cheerfully concede the plea; but at the same time we beg to remind them that Catholics are also Christians, and that the historian must deal with the whole system through all the centuries. Besides, as Michelet observed, Protestantism is after all only an estuary, and Catholicism the great sea.\n \n http://www.ftarchives.net/foote/crimes/c7.htm",

   "CRIMES OF THE POPES\n WE now give a rapid summary of the crimes and vices with which many of the popes disgraced the chair of St. Peter; and before we conclude, the reader will see that every villainy the imagination can conceive has been practised by the vicegerents of God.

I think you should have a look at the history of Christianity.\n\n \n That is precisely the point I was making BBS. Martin Luther himself was a catholic monk, never was he considered a protestant. The term protestant came later as an official offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church. So the statement that Catholicism became much more respectable once the protestants had left, coincidence? is ridiculous because there were no protestants in the church because protestantism didn't even exist yet. Here's a timeline for you.\n \n Timeline of the Protestant Reformation\n \n 1517 Albert of Brandenburg, archbishop of Mainz, sponsors a sale of indulgences to pay for, among other things, construction of Saint Peter's in Rome. \n \n In response, Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk, posts his 95 theses on the door of the castle chapel in Wittenburg, Germany, where Luther is a university professor. The theses invite debate over the legitimacy of the sale of indulgences. \n \n Copies of the theses spread rapidly over Europe. The papacy takes steps against Luther as a heretic. The Wittenburg faculty supports Luther. \n \n 1520 Luther publishes his three famous treatises: \"An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German National Concerning the Reform of the Christian Estate,\" \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\" and \"On the Freedom of a Christian.\" He wins powerful support. \n \n 1521 Luther is excommunicated. He refuses to recant unless proven wrong by the Bible or by \"clear reason.\" \n \n 1530 Many German princes and cities sign the Augsburg Confession as an expression of the evangelical faith. \n \n 1555 The Peace of Augsburg provides that each German prince can determine the religious affiliation of the territory he rules. The Reformation sweeps Northern and Eastern Europe. \n \n Note: United Methodism is not a direct descendant of the Protestant Reformation but -- as an offshoot of the Church of England -- is a descendant of the English Reformation (beginning 1533-34) which led to the establishment of the Church of England by Henry VIII. Henry split from Rome for a number of reasons. One contributing reason was that the pope delayed and ultimately refused to annul Henry's illegal marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the aunt of Charles the V, who was putting considerable pressure on the pope to delay the annulment. Another contributing reason was the influence of Lutheranism in influential circles of Anglican theology.\n \n Henry VIII was highly critical of Martin Luther and never adopted Protestant doctrines. However, some of his Anglican arch bishops and clergy were highly influenced by the Reformation on the continent. \n ",

It is unspeakable the damage done during the suppression of Galeleo's work, the burning of 'heretical' books, the formation of Jewish ghettos and the wholesale murder of thousands of 'heretics' during the Inquistion.\n \n After 600 YEARS this pompous church has finally opened the Archives of the Inquisition (which has been conveniently renamed to some benign moniker) and the current Pope has apologized to the world for all the damage and suffering caused by the actions of former Popes and Cardinals who carried out the organized torture and murder of those who disagreed with the divine authority of the Pope. I think the Pope is admitting that Popes are not infallible. As he should...because they AIN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM ME AND YOU...they just wear what they consider to be holy robes and think they're hot :xcensored Spirits of God.\n \n Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God......We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. \n \n Slightly reworded, the operative words are: \"We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us.\" Thus sayeth the Pope and his cronies.\n \n ...and you...bein' a card-carryin' Catholic, lap up everything they say.\n \n How silly can you get?\n\n \n Actually Christianity is not the oldest, it's not the second or the third either. \n \n INRI you still have not answered my questions about Catholic texts. \n \n Kind of a side question but since I have at least two knowledgable people posting I thought I would ask\n \n I am a little confused on Jesus died for our sins. Since we still have (for some) original sin, what did Jesus die for? If it was only to bring the sin level back to 0, wouldn't he have to keep coming back and getting killed since we will always have sin? \n \n Why does it even matter if Mary was tainted by original sin or not? The explaination given about how Mary was given a trip slip to bypass the sin stain would leave Jesus sin free even if Mary wasn't exempt. If the answer is Jesus would have been tainted in an impure womb, then why wasn't Mary tainted in her mother's impure womb?",

   "CRIMES OF THE POPES\n WE now give a rapid summary of the crimes and vices with which many of the popes disgraced the chair of St. Peter; and before we conclude, the reader will see that every villainy the imagination can conceive has been practised by the vicegerents of God. Peculation, theft, cruelty, murder, fornication, adultery, and incest, not to mention still darker crimes, have all been notoriously committed by the supreme rulers of Christendom, who sat in the seat of infallibility, and claimed universal jurisdiction over the thoughts and consciences of mankind. \n \n ST. DAMASUS (366-84). He was the first to assume the title of Pontiff. His election was opposed by Ursicinus, whose partisans accused Damasus of adultery. [122:1] Riddle says: \n \n \"After some deadly conflicts between the followers of the two rivals, Ursicinus was banished from the city; and a similar sentence was about to be carried into effect against seven presbyters of his party, when the people interfered, and lodged them for safety in one of the churches. But even here they found no shelter from the fury of their opponents. Armed with fire and sword, Damasus, with some of his adherents, both of the clergy and of the laity, proceeded to the place of refuge, and left no less than a hundred and sixty of their adversaries dead within the sacred precincts.\" [122:2] \n That this was a massacre and not a faction fight is shown by the fact that on the side of Damasus not a single person was killed. [123:3] Ammianus Marcellinus, the contemporary historian of the event, says of the contention between Damasus and Ursicinus: \n \n \"I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that reigns at Rome, that those who desire such rank and power may be justified in laboring with all possible exertions and vehemence to obtain their wishes; since after they have succeeded, they will be secure for the future, being enriched by offerings from matrons, riding in carriages, dressing splendidly, and feasting luxuriously, so that their entertainment surpassed even royal banquets. [123:4] \n Damasus gained the title of Auriscalpius Matronarum, ladies' ear-scratcher. [123:5] He died of fever, and the Romish Church still invokes the aid of this saintly vicar of God in fever cases. [123:6] \n \n SIXTUS III (432-40). This pope, according to both Baronius and Platina, was accused of debauching a virgin, but was acquitted by a Council under the Emperor Valentina, who is said to have referred the pronouncing of the sentence to the Pope himself, \"because the judge of all ought to be judged by none.\" It was without doubt to establish this maxim that the \"acts\" of the Council were forged. [123:7] \n \n ST. LEO THE GREAT (440-61). Jortin calls him \"the insolent and persecuting Pope Leo, who applauded the massacre of the Priscillianists, and grossly misrepresented them.\" [123:8] \n \n SYMMACHUS (498-514). His election was violently opposed by the antipope Laurentius, and three Councils were held to decide the schism. Accusations of the most heinous crimes were laid against Symmachus. Bower says: \n \n \"This gave occasion to the rekindling of the war between the two parties in Rome; and several priests, many clerks, and a great number of citizens, fell daily in the battles that were fought in the different parts of the city. No regard was shown by either party to rank or dignity; and not even the sacred virgins were spared by the enraged multitude in their fury.\" [123:9] \n Eunodius declared that the Pope was \"judge in the place of the most high, pure from all sin, and exempt from all punishment. All who fell fighting in his cause he declared enrolled on the register of heaven.\" [124:1] \n \n ST. HORMISDAS (514-23). He was a married man, and had a son, who was raised to the popedom. He was full of ambition, and insolent in his demands to the emperor, whom he exhorted to the persecution of heretics. \n \n BONIFACE II (530-32). His election was disputed by the antipope Dioscorus. Each accused the other of simony, but Dioscorus opportunely died. Boniface \"began his pontificate with wreaking his vengeance on the memory of his deceased competitor, whom he solemnly excommunicated, as guilty of simony, when he could not clear himself from the charge, nor retort it on him, as perhaps he otherwise might.\" [124:2] This sentence was removed by Pope Agapetus. \n \n SILVERIUS (536-38). He was accused of betraying the city of Rome to the Goths, and was in consequence expelled from his see. \n \n VIGILUS (537-55). He was a deacon elected by bribery. He engaged himself to obey the Empress Theodora, who gave him money to gain the suffrages of the clergy. Anastasius tells us that he killed his own secretary in a transport of passion, and caused his own sister's son to be whipped to death. He is considered to have been accessory to the banishment and death of Silverius. When banished himself by the emperor, he speedily repented, in order to save his seat. \n \n PELAGIUS (555-60). He was accused of poisoning his predecessor. This is uncertain; but it is certain that, like most of his predecessors and successors, he incited the civil powers to the persecution of heretics. \n \n ST. GREGORY THE GREAT (590-604). According to Gibbon, this pontiff was \"a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense and superstition.\" [124:3] Jortin's picture is still less flattering: \n \n \"Pope Gregory the Great was remarkable for many things -- for exalting his own authority; for running down human learning [125:4] and polite literature; for burning classic authors; for patronising ignorance and stupidity; for persecuting heretics; for flattering the most execrable princes; and for relating a multitude of absurd, monstrous and ridiculous lies, called miracles. He was an ambitious, insolent prelate, under the mask of humility.\" [125:5] \n Draper says that Gregory not only forbade the study of the classics, mutilated statues, and destroyed temples but also \"burned the Palatine library, founded by Augustus Caesar.\" Gibbon, however, throws doubt on this destruction, while admitting that it was generally believed. [125:6] \n \n Gregory does not appear to have been fond of women and wine, like so many other popes; but he possessed the darker vices of bigotry and ambition. His congratulations on the usurpation of the cruel, drunken and lascivious Phocas, after a wholesale massacre of the emperor's family, simply because the successful villain favored the pretensions of Rome (p. 109), are a sufficient proof that Gregory would scruple at nothing to advance the glory of his see. \n \n SABINIAN (604-6). Bower says he rendered himself so odious to the Roman people by his avarice and cruelty to the poor, that they could not forbear abusing him whenever he appeared. In a dreadful famine he raised the price of corn to exorbitant rates. He accused St. Gregory of simony; but according to Baronius, that departed saint having vainly reproved him in three different apparitions for his covetousness, gave him in a fourth apparition so dreadful a blow on the head, that he died soon after. [125:7] \n \n BONIFACE III (607). By flattering Phocas as Gregory had done, he induced him to take the title of universal bishop from the bishop of Constantinople, and confer it upon himself and his successors. \n \n THEODORUS (642-49). He commenced the custom of dipping his pen in consecrated wine when signing the condemnation of heretics, [126:8] thus sanctifying murder with the blood of Christ. Of Adeodatus, Donus I, Agatho, and Leo II, we only know that they carried on fierce contests with the archbishop of Ravenna for refusing to acknowledge their supremacy. Leo II anathematised his predecessor, Pope Honorius, for heresy. [126:9] Neither Benedict II, John V, nor Conon, lived a whole year after assuming the tiara. \n \n ST. SERGIUS I (687-701). He had to purchase his seat from the exarch of Ravenna by pawning the ornaments of the tomb of St. Peter. He was accused of adultery, but his innocence was strikingly proved; for, upon the child of whose parentage he was accused being baptised when but eight days old, he cried out, \"The pontiff Sergius is not my father.\" Bruys, the French historian of the Papacy, says, \"What I find most marvellous in this story is, not that so young a child should speak, but that it should affirm with so much confidence that the pope was not its father.\" [126:1] \n \n CONSTANTINE (708-15). He is said to have excommunicated the Emperor, Philip Bardanes, for being of the same heresy as Pope Honorius. To oblige Constantine, Justinian II cut out the tongue and blinded the eyes of the Archbishop of Ravenna, who refused to pay the obedience due to the apostolic see. [126:2] \n \n ST. GREGORY II (715-31). He was chiefly noted for his endowing monasteries with the goods of the poor, and for his opposition to the Emperor Leo's edict against image worship. [126:3] Rather than obey the edict, he raised civil war both in Italy and elsewhere. He prayed that Christ might set the Devil on the emperor, and approved the barbarous murder of the imperial officer. [126:4] Yet the priests place in the list of saints a pontiff who, to establish the Christian idolatry of image worship, filled Italy with carnage. \n \n STEPHEN III (768-72). When elected he found on the pontifical throne a lay pope, one Constantine, who, after a violent struggle, was dislodged and punished with the loss of his eyes, [127:5] many of his friends sharing the same fate. [127:6] \n \n ADRIAN I (772-95). He made a league with Irene, the murderess of her son, to restore image worship, and presented to Charlemagne the pretended donation of Constantine. [127:7] Avarice was the vice of this able pontiff. He left large sums to his successors. \n \n ST. PASCAL I (817-24). At the Diet of Compeigne this pope was charged with being accessory to the mutilation and murder of two Roman priests. The Pope denied the charge, but refused to deliver up the perpetrators of the crimes, alleging that they belonged \"to the family of St. Peter.\" [127:8] \n \n EUGENIUS II (824-27). He had the honor of inventing the barbarous practice of ordeal by cold water. \n \n NICHOLAS (858-67). He excommunicated Photius, the Greek patriarch, and the emperor Michael as his abettor, and threatened King Lothaire with the ecclesiastical sword if he suffered any bishop to be chosen without his consent. [127:9] \n \n ADRIAN II (867-72). He was a married priest. He congratulated Bazilius, the murderer of the emperor Michael, and entered into alliance with him. [127:1] \n \n JOHN VIII (872-82). The meek and holy nature of this worthy successor of St. Peter may be judged by his ordering the Bishop of Naples to bring him the chief men among the Saracens in that city, and cutting their throats in the presence of his legate. [127:2] A letter of John is extant, in which he justifies Athanasius, Bishop of Naples, for having plucked out the eyes of Sergius, Duke of Naples, who favored the Saracens in despite of the papal anathemas. He even cites the Gospel text as to plucking out offending eyes. Cardinal Baronius declares that this pontiff perjured himself, and that he rather deserved the name of a woman than that of a man. [128:3] The annals of the Abbey of Fulda relate that John VIII was poisoned by the relations of a lady whom he had seduced from her husband. [128:4] \n \n FORMOSUS (891-96). He had been repeatedly excommunicated by John VIII. He invited Arnulf, the German emperor, to invade Italy, which he did, committing great atrocities. Formosus, however, had a great character for piety. He is said to have been well versed in scripture, and to have died a virgin in his eightieth year. \n \n BONIFACE VI (896). Even according to Baronius, he was a man of most infamous character. He had been deposed for his scandalous life, first from the rank of sub-deacon, and afterward from the priesthood. [128:5] \n \n STEPHEN VI. (896-7). He intruded into the see in the room of the intruder Boniface. Being of the opposite faction to Pope Formosus, he caused the body of that pontiff to be taken out of the tomb and to be placed, in the episcopal robes, on the pontifical chair. Stephen then addressed the dead body thus: \"Why didst thou, being Bishop of Porto, prompted by thy ambition, usurp the universal see of Rome?\" After this mock trial Stephen, with the approbation and consent of a Council of bishops, ordered the body to be stripped, three of the fingers (those used in blessing) to be cut off, and the remains to be cast into the Tiber. At the same Council all the ordinations of Formosus were declared invalid. [128:6] \n \n Then followed what Riddle calls \"a rapid succession of infamous popes,\" of whom we may mention that Leo V (903) was deposed and cast into prison by his chaplain, Christopher, who was in turn ejected and imprisoned by Sergius III (904-11). This pontiff also had been excommunicated by John VIII. He was, says Baronius, \"the slave of every vice and the most wicked of men.\" [128:7] Riddle says: \n \n \"This Sergius III was a monster of profligacy, cruelty and vice in their most shameless and disgusting forms. But it was this very character which made him useful to his party, the duration of whose influence at Rome, could be insured only by a preponderance of physical power, and this again only by violence which should disdain all restraints of morality and religion. Sergius was the man for this purpose, who, while he lived in concubinage with Marozia, did not hesitate to yield all the treasures of the Roman Church as plunder to his party.\" [129:8] To him succeeded other paramours of Marozia and of her mother the prostitute Theodora. John X, for instance (914-28), received his chair because he was the lover of Theodora, while Leo VI and Stephen VIII (929-31) were creatures of Marozia. Adultery and assassination form the staple of the annals of their pontificates. \n \n JOHN XI (931-36). He was the son of Pope Sergius III. by Marozia, and if possible he surpassed his parents in crime. Elected pope at the age of eighteen, Alberic, his half brother, expelled him from Rome and imprisoned their mother Marozia. Stephen VIII (939-942) made himself so obnoxious to the Romans that they mutilated him. [129:9] \n \n JOHN XII (956-64), the son of Alberic, was the first to change his name, which was originally Octavian. He nominated himself pope at the age of seventeen. Wilks says: \"His profaneness and debaucheries exceeded all bounds. He was publicly accused of concubinage, incest, and simony.\" This pope was so notorious for his licentiousness that female pilgrims dared not present themselves in Rome. [129:1] Bower says that he had changed the Lateran Palace, once the abode of saints, into a brothel, and there cohabited with his father's concubine; that women were afraid to come from other countries to visit the tombs of the apostles at Rome; that he spared none, and had within a few days forced married women, widows, and virgins to comply with his impure desires. He was at length deposed by Otho, at the solicitation of a council of bishops and laymen, on charges of sacrilege, simony, blasphemy, and cruel mutilation. He had deprived one deacon of his right hand and made him a eunuch. He put out the eyes of Benedict, his ghostly father, cut off the nose of the keeper of the archives, and scourged the Bishop of Spires. [130:2] On the deposition of John, Leo VII was put in his place. John fulminated anathemas against his opponents, and soon after died, from a blow on the head while in bed with a married woman. [130:3] Jortin remarks that \"Baronius says, from Luitprandus, that it was the Devil who gave John that blow; but it seems not probable that Satan would have used his good friend in such a manner. It is more likely that it might be the husband of the adulteress.\" [130:4] \n \n Mosheim says \"that the history of the Roman pontiffs of this century [the tenth] is a history of monsters, a history of the most atrocious villainies and crimes, is acknowledged by all writers of distinction, and even by the advocates of popery.\" [130:5] \n \n BONIFACE VII (974). The old authors in derision call him Maliface. Having had his predecessor Benedict murdered, he plundered the Basilica and escaped with his spoils to Constantinople, whence he afterwards returned and murdered John XIV (984), then on the papal throne. \n \n GREGORY V (996-99). He was turned out of his see by Crescentius, who elected the antipope John. Upon Gregory's restoration he had this unfortunate creature deprived of sight, cut off his nose, and tore out his tongue. He then ordered him to be led through the streets in a tattered sacerdotal suit, and mounted upon an XXX with his face to the tail, which he held in his hand. [130:6] \n \n SERGIUS IV (1009-12). This pope was called Os Porci, or Swine's Mouth. Of his doings little is known, but he is asserted to have gravely declared \"that the pope could not be damned, but that, do what he would, he must be saved.\" [130:7] \n \n BENEDICT VIII (1012-24). He saved the city of Rome from a great storm, which it seems was caused by some Jews. The Jews being immediately executed the storm ceased. [131:8] \n \n JOHN XIX (1024-33). He was a layman, brother of Benedict, yet he was raised to the see. Wilks says: \n \n \"It was by gold, and not by imperial power, that the Romans consented to this uncanonical election. The rapacity of this pope was so great that he offered to sell the title of 'Universal Bishop' to the see of Constantinople for a sum of money!\" [131:9] \n By his exactions, debauchery and tyranny, he became so odious to the Romans that he had to flee for his life. \n \n BENEDICT IX (1033-46). A nephew of the last two pontiffs. Some say he was raised to the papacy at the age of twelve -- others, at eighteen. He \"stained the sacred office with murder, adultery, and every other heinous crime.\" [131:1] Desiderius, afterwards pope under the name of Victor III, styles Benedict the successor of Simon the sorcerer, and not of Simon the apostle, and paints him as one abandoned to all manner of vice. [131:2] Being eager to possess the person and property of a female cousin, he sold the papacy to John Gratianus, \"the most religious man of his time,\" for a sum of money, and consecrated him as Gregory VI. Benedict afterwards poisoned Pope Damasus II. The Romans, weary of his crimes, expelled him from the city, but he was reinstated by Conrad. \"But,\" says Jortin, \"as he continued his scandalous course of life, and found himself despised and detested both by clergy and laity, he agreed to retire, and to abandon himself more freely to his pleasures.\" Stipulating therefore to receive a sum of money, he resigned his place to Gratianus, called Gregory VI, and went to live in his own territories. [131:3] \n \n Mosheim calls Benedict IX \"a most flagitious man and capable of every crime.\" [131:4] \n \n We have already seen how Benedict, Sylvester, and Gregory, were alike declared unworthy of the pontificate, and Clement placed in the see, and by what means Hildebrand contrived to extend the papal power. This great pontiff, Gregory VII (1073-85), has been accused of poisoning his predecessors in order to obtain the popedom, and also of committing adultery with Matilda, Countess of Tuscany, who bestowed all her possessions on the pope. But these accusations probably arose from the spite of the many enemies aroused by Hildebrand's high-handed measures. \n \n PASCAL II (1099-1118). He was a disciple of Hildebrand, and inherited his ambition without his talents. He compelled Henry IV to abdicate, but on his son Henry V marching against him, after a sanguinary struggle, he gave up to the emperor the right of investiture. Afterwards he excommunicated all who should declare his own grant to be valid. [132:5] \n \n ADRIAN IV (1154-59). The only Englishman who ever became pope. He caused Arnold of Brescia to be burnt at the stake (1154) for preaching against papal corruption. The Irish should remember that it was this pope who, in virtue of the pretended Donation of Constantine, made over to Henry II of England the right to take and govern Ireland on condition of the pope receiving an annual tribute of one penny for each house. [132:6] \n \n ALEXANDER III (1159-81). The Lateran Council (1179) declared war against all heretics, and a crusade against them was sanctioned by this pontiff. [132:7] \n \n CLEMENT III (1188-1191). He published the third crusade (1189). \n \n INNOCENT III (1198-1216) also preached a crusade. He claimed for his see universal empire and established the Inquisition to support the claim. He excommunicated Philip II of France and put the whole nation under interdict. Afterwards he placed England under interdict, excommunicated John, bestowed the crown on Philip of France, and published a crusade against England. He also instituted a crusade against the Albigenses, butchering them by tens of thousands with every circumstance of atrocity. [132:8] \n \n GREGORY IX (1227-41). He formally established the Inquisition; and, to support his ambition and the unbridled luxury of his court, raised taxes in France, England and Germany, excommunicated kings, and incited nations to revolt; finally causing himself to be driven from Rome. [133:9] \n \n INNOCENT IV (1243-54). He conspired against the life of the Emperor Frederic, through the agency of the Franciscan monks. To avoid confronting his accuser, he retired to France, summoned a council at Lyons (1244), and excommunicated and deposed the emperor, whom he coolly denominated his vassal. He also excommunicated the kings of Arragon and Portugal, giving the crown of the latter to the Count of Bologna. He persecuted the Ghibellines, and pretending to have the right of disposing of the crown of the two Sicilies, offered it to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother to Henry III of England. Innocent made exorbitant claims to the bishoprics and benefices in England. [133:1] \n \n BONIFACE VIII (1294-1303). He had his predecessor, Celestine, put in prison, where he died. [133:2] He openly styled himself \"King of Kings,\" trafficked in indulgences, and declared all excluded from heaven who disputed his claim to universal dominion. He persecuted the Ghibellines, and ordered the city of Bragneste to be entirely destroyed. He was publicly accused of simony, assassination, usury, of living in concubinage with his two nieces and having children by them, and of using the money received for indulgences to pay the Saracens for invading Italy. [133:3] \n \n CLEMENT V (1305-1314). He is noted for his cruel suppression of the order of Knights Templar, so as to appropriate their property. He summoned the grand master of the Templars under false pretexts to his court, and issued a bull against the order in which he brought against it the most unfounded and absurd charges, and finally pronounced its abolition, having the Grand Master and many leading members burnt alive. [134:4] After sharing the spoils of the Templars with the king of France, Clement V fixed his court at Avignon, and gave himself publicly to the most criminal debaucheries. He preached a new crusade against the Turks and gave each new crusader the right to release four souls from purgatory. Dante places him in hell. \n \n JOHN XXII (1316-34). Like his predecessors, he persecuted and burnt heretics. He anathematised the emperor of Germany and the king of France, and preached a new crusade. Money was raised in abundance by the sale of indulgences, and was misappropriated by the pope. He left enormous treasures. Villani, whose brother was one of the papal commission, states that this successor of the fisherman amassed altogether twenty-five million florins. [134:5] Gieseler says: \"He arbitrarily disposed of the Benefices of all countries, chiefly in favor of his own nephews, and the members of his curia.\" [134:6] \n \n URBAN VI (1378-89). In his time occurred what is known as \"the great Western schism,\" which lasted from 1378 till the Council of Constance (1414). There were during that time two popes, one residing at Rome and the other at Avignon. But which of the popes was the true one and which the antipope has not yet been decided. Urban VI was a ferocious despot. He ordered six cardinals, whom he suspected of opposing him, to be brutally tortured. [134:7] Nor was his competitor, Clement VII, behind him in violence and crime. For fifty years they and their successors excited bloody wars and excommunicated one another. The schism, which cost thousands of lives, was ended by the deposition of John XXIII (1415), who was found guilty of murder and incest. He was accused before the Council of having seduced two hundred nuns. Theodoric de Niem informs us that he kept two hundred mistresses in Bologna, and he is described by his own secretary as a monster of avarice, ambition, lewdness and cruelty. [135:8] The same author says that an act of accusation, prepared against him, presented a complete catalogue of every mortal crime. \n \n MARTIN V (1417-31). His crimes were not of a kind to be censured by a Council of bishops. He had John Huss and Jerome of Prague burnt alive, and to put down their heresies excited civil war in Bohemia. He wrote to the Duke of Lithuania: \"Be assured thou sinnest mortally in keeping faith with heretics.\" \n \n EUGENIUS IV (1431-47). His first act was to put to torture the treasurer of his predecessor, Martin V. He seized that pontiff's treasures and sent to the scaffold two hundred Roman citizens, friends of the late pope. [135:9] The Council of Basle was called and deposed the pope, setting up an antipope, Felix V. Civil war and much cruelty of course followed. \n \n PAUL II (1464-71). He broke all the engagements he had made to the conclave prior to his election. He persecuted with the greatest cruelty and perfidy the Count of Anguillara. He strove to kindle a general war throughout Italy, and excommunicated the king of Bohemia for protecting the Hussites against his persecutions. He also persecuted the Fratricelli. \"His love of money,\" says Symonds, \"was such that, when bishoprics fell vacant, he often refused to fill them up, drawing their revenues for his own use, and draining Christendom as a Verres or a Memmius sucked a Roman province dry. His court was luxurious, and in private he was addicted to all the sensual lusts.\" [135:1] The same writer says that \"He seized the chief members of the Roman Academy, imprisoned them, put them to the torture, and killed some of them upon the rack.\" [135:2] He died suddenly, leaving behind him an immense treasure in money and jewels, amassed by his avarice and extortion. [135:3] \n \n SIXTUS IV (1471-84). He strove to excel his predecessors in crime. According to Symonds, \"He began his career with a lie; for though he succeeded, to that demon of avarice, Paul, who had spent his time in amassing money which he did not use, he declared that he had only found five thousand florins in the papal treasury.\" The historian continues: \n \n \"This assertion was proved false by the prodigality with which he lavished wealth immediately upon his nephews. It is difficult even to hint at the horrible suspicions which were cast upon the birth of two of the Pope's nephews and upon the nature of his weakness for them: yet the private life of Sixtus rendered the most monstrous stories plausible, while his public treatment of these men recalled to mind the partiality of Nero for Doryphorus ... The Holy Father himself was wont to say, A Pope needs only pen and ink to get what sum he wants.' ... Fictitious dearths were created; the value of wheat was raised to famine prices; good grain was sold out of the kingdom, and bad imported in exchange; while Sixtus forced his subjects to purchase from his stores, and made a profit by the hunger and disease of his emaciated provinces.\" [136:4] \n Ranke declares: \n \n \"He was restrained by no scruple from rendering his spiritual power subservient to his worldly views, or from debasing it by a mixture with those temporary intrigues in which his ambition had involved him. The Medici being peculiarly in his way, he took part in the Florentine troubles; and, as is notorious, brought upon himself the suspicion of being privy to the conspiracy of the Pazzi, and to the assassination which they perpetrated on the steps of the altar of the cathedral: the suspicion that he, the father of the faithful, was an accomplice of such acts! When the Venetians ceased to favor the scheme of his nephew, as they had done for a considerable time, the pope was not satisfied with deserting them in a war into which he himself had driven them; he went so far as to excommunicate them for persisting in it. He acted with no less violence in Rome: he persecuted the Colonnas with great ferocity: he seized Marino from them; he caused the prothonotary Colonna to be attacked, arrested and executed in his own house. The mother of Colonna came to San Celso in Branchi, where the body lay -- she lifted the severed head by the hair, and cried 'Behold the head of my son! Such is the faith of the pope. He promised that if we would give up Marino to him he would set my son at liberty; he has Marino: and my son is in our hands -- but dead! Behold thus does the pope keep his word.'\" [136:5] \n Jortin says that \"Sixtus IV erected a famous bawdy-house at Rome, and the Roman prostitutes paid his holiness a weekly tax, which amounted sometimes to twenty thousand ducats a year.\" [137:6] \n \n INNOCENT VIII (1484-92). Schlegel, in his notes to Mosheim, says he \"lived so shamefully before he mounted the Roman throne, that he had sixteen illegitimate children to make provision for. Yet on the papal throne he played the zealot against the Germans, whom he accused of magic, and also against the Hussites, whom he well-nigh exterminated.\" [137:7] Wilks says: \"He obtained the votes of the cardinals by bribery, and violated all his promises.\" [137:8] The practice of selling offices prevailed under him as well as under his predecessors. \"In corruption,\" says Symonds, \" he advanced a step even beyond Sixtus, by establishing a bank at Rome for the sale of pardons. Each sin had its price, which might be paid at the convenience of the criminal: one hundred and fifty ducats of the tax were poured into the Papal coffers; the surplus fell to Franceschetto, the Pope's son.\" [137:9] The Vice-Chancellor of this rapacious pontiff, on being asked why indulgences were permitted for the worst scandals, made answer that \"God wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should pay and live.\" It must be added that \"the traffic which Innocent and Franceschetto carried on in theft and murder filled the Campagna with brigands and assassins.\" [137:1] The Pope's vices cost him so much that he even pledged the papal tiara as a security for money. \n \n ALEXANDER VI (1492-1503). Roderic Borgia was one of the most depraved wretches that ever lived. His passions were so unbridled that, having conceived a liking for a widow and two daughters, he made them all subservient to his brutality. Wilks calls him \"a man of most abandoned morals, deep duplicity, and unscrupulous ambition. Like his predecessors, he had but one object at heart, the temporal and hereditary aggrandisement of his family.\" [138:2] Mosheim says: \"So many and so great villainies, crimes and enormities are recorded of him, that it must be certain he was destitute not only of all religion, but also of decency and shame.\" [138:3] This pope, at a certain feast, had fifty courtesans dancing, who, at a given signal, threw off every vestige of clothing and -- we draw a veil over the scene! \"To describe him,\" says Symonds, \"as the Genius of Evil, whose sensualities, as unrestrained as Nero's, were relieved against the background of flame and smoke which Christianity had raised for fleshly sins, is justifiable.\" [138:4] His besetting vice was sensuality; in oriental fashion he maintained a harem in the Vatican. He invited the Sultan Bajazet to enter Europe and relieve him of the princes who opposed his intrigues in favor of his children. \n \n In regard to his death we follow Ranke: \n \n \"It was but too certain that he once meditated taking off one of the richest of the cardinals by poison. His intended victim, however, contrived, by means of presents, promises and prayers, to gain over his head cook, and the dish which had been prepared for the cardinal was placed before the pope. He died of the poison he had destined for another.\" [138:5] \n JULIUS II (1503-13). He obtained the pontificate by fraud and bribery, [138:6] and boldly took the sword to extend his dominion. [138:7] Mosheim says: \n \n \"That this Julius II possessed, besides other vices, very great ferocity, arrogance, vanity, and a mad passion for war, is proved by abundant testimony. In the first place, he formed an alliance with the Emperor and the King of France, and made war upon the Venetians. He next laid siege to Ferrara. And at last, drawing the Venetians, the Swiss and the Spaniards, to engage in the war with him, he made an attack on Lewis XII, the king of France. Nor, so long as he lived, did he cease from embroiling all Europe.\" [138:8] \n PAUL III (1531-49). He was as much a man of the world as any of his predecessors. He acknowledged an illegitimate son and daughter. [138:9] The emperor once remonstrated with him on having promoted two of his grandsons to the cardinalate at too early an age. He replied that he would do as his predecessors had done -- that there were examples of infants in the cradle being made cardinals. [139:1]\n \n \n We now close this horrid list of criminals. Since the Reformation the popes have been obliged to live more decently, or at least to conceal their vices instead of flaunting them before the world. Should the Protestants object that they are in no way responsible for the crimes of the Papacy, we shall cheerfully concede the plea; but at the same time we beg to remind them that Catholics are also Christians, and that the historian must deal with the whole system through all the centuries. Besides, as Michelet observed, Protestantism is after all only an estuary, and Catholicism the great sea.\n \n http://www.ftarchives.net/foote/crimes/c7.htm\n\n \n \n \n I think you should have ended this with Paul's description of the kind of person was to hold office in the church and what offenses would prohibit one from becoming a bishop. So much for the unbroken line of succession.",

   "god didnt die on a cross to set our sin levels back to 0 but to pay the price of sin...for the wages of sin is death.\n \n Can I as a Catholic reccomend a protestant writer to better explain salvation.\n \n The writer of the world famous \"The Lion the witch and the wardrobe\" C.S Lewis also wrote Adult books.....no....not those type of adult books. One of his works called Mere Christianity has a wonderful chapter on salvation, I reccomend it and not only for that Chapter either.\n \n \n Excerpt from Mere Christianity...by C.S Lewis\n \n http://www.lib.ru/LEWISCL/mere_engl.txt\n \n .....We are faced, then, with a frightening alternative. This man we are\n talking about either was (and is) just what He said or else a lunatic, or\n something worse. Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic\n nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it\n may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God. God has landed\n on this enemy-occupied world in human form.\n And now, what was the purpose of it all? What did He come to do? Well,\n to teach, of course; but as soon as you look into the New Testament or any\n other Christian writing you will find they are constantly talking about\n something different-about His death and His coming to life again. It is\n obvious that Christians think the chief point of the story lies here. They\n think the main thing He came to earth to do was to suffer and be killed.\n Now before I became a Christian I was under the impression that the\n first thing Christians had to believe was one particular theory as to what\n the point of this dying was. According to that theory God wanted to punish\n men for having deserted and joined the Great Rebel, but Christ volunteered\n to be punished instead, and so God let us off. Now I admit that even this\n theory does not seem to me quite so immoral and so silly as it used to; but\n that is not the point I want to make. What I came to see later on was that\n neither this theory nor any other is Christianity. The central Christian\n belief is that Christ's death has somehow put us right with God and given us\n a fresh start Theories as to how it did this are another matter. A good many\n different theories have been held as to how it works; what all Christians\n are agreed on is that it does work. I will tell you what I think it is like.\n \n All sensible people know that if you are tired and hungry a meal will do you\n good. But the modern theory of nourishment-all about the vitamins and\n proteins-is a different thing. People ate their dinners and felt better long\n before the theory of vitamins was ever heard of: and if the theory of\n vitamins is some day abandoned they will go on eating their dinners just the\n same. Theories about Christ's death are not Christianity: they are\n explanations about how it works. Christians would not all agree as to how\n important these theories are. My own church-the Church of England-does not\n lay down any one of them as the right one. The Church of Rome goes a bit\n further. But I think they will all agree that the thing itself is infinitely\n more important than any explanations that theologians have produced. \n \n I think they would probably admit that no explanation will ever be quite adequate to\n the reality. But as I said in the preface to this book, I am only a layman,\n and at this point we are getting into deep water. I can only tell you, for\n what it is worth, how I, personally, look at the matter.\n On my view the theories are not themselves the thing you are asked to\n accept. Many of you no doubt have read Jeans or Eddington. What they do when\n they want to explain the atom, or something of that sort, is to give you a\n description out of which you can make a mental picture. But then they warn\n you that this picture is not what the scientists actually believe. What the\n scientists believe is a mathematical formula. The pictures are there only to\n help you to understand the formula. They are not really true in the way the\n formula is; they do not give you the real thing but only something more or\n less like it. \n \n They are only meant to help, and if they do not help you can\n drop them. The thing itself cannot be pictured, it can only be expressed\n mathematically. We are in the same boat here. We believe that the death of\n Christ is just that point in history at which something absolutely\n unimaginable from outside shows through into our own world. And if we cannot\n picture even the atoms of which our own world is built, of course we are not\n going to be able to picture this. Indeed, if we found that we could fully\n understand it, that very fact would show it was not what it professes to\n be-the inconceivable, the uncreated, the thing from beyond nature, striking\n down into nature like lightning. \n \n You may ask what good will it be to us if\n we do not understand it. But that is easily answered. A man can eat his\n dinner without understanding exactly how food nourishes him. A man can\n accept what Christ has done without knowing how it works: indeed, he\n certainly would not know how it works until he has accepted it.\n We are told that Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed\n out our sins, and that by dying He disabled death itself. That is the\n formula. That is Christianity. That is what has to be believed. Any theories\n we build up as to how Christ's death did all this are, in my view, quite\n secondary: mere plans or diagrams to be left alone if they do not help us,\n and, even if they do help us, not to be confused with the thing itself. All\n the same, some of these theories are worth looking at.\n \n The one most people have heard is the one I mentioned before -the one\n about our being let off because Christ had volunteered to bear a punishment\n instead of us. Now on the face of it that is a very silly theory. If God was\n prepared to let us off, why on earth did He not do so? And what possible\n point could there be in punishing an innocent person instead? None at all\n that I can see, if you are thinking of punishment in the police-court sense.\n \n On the other hand, if you think of a debt, there is plenty of point in a\n person who has some assets paying it on behalf of someone who has not. Or if\n you take \"paying the penalty,\" not in the sense of being punished, but in\n the more general sense of \"standing the racket\" or \"footing the bill,\" then,\n of course, it is a matter of common experience that, when one person has got\n himself into a hole, the trouble of getting him out usually falls on a kind\n friend. Now what was the sort of \"hole\" man had got himself into? He had\n tried to set up on his own, to behave as if he belonged to himself. \n \n In other words, fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement:\n he is a rebel who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms,\n surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising that you have been on the\n wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground\n floor-that is the only way out of a \"hole.\" This process of surrender-this\n movement full speed astern-is what Christians call repentance. Now\n repentance is no fun at all. It is something much harder than merely eating\n humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we\n have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing\n part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man\n to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only\n a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it\n and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would\n be a perfect person-and he would not need it.\n \n Remember, this repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a\n kind of death, is not something God demands of you before He will take you\n back and which He could let you off if He chose: it is simply a description\n of what going back to Him is like. If you ask God to take you back without\n it, you are really asking Him to let you go back without going back. It\n cannot hap pen. Very well, then, we must go through with it. But the same\n badness which makes us need it, makes us unable to do it. Can we do it if\n God helps us? Yes, but what do we mean when we talk of God helping us? We\n mean God putting into us a bit of Himself, so to speak. He lends us a little\n of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His\n love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child\n writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the\n letters because you are forming them. \n \n We love and reason because God loves\n and reasons and holds our hand while we do it. Now if we had not fallen,\n that would be all plain sailing. But unfortunately we now need God's help in\n order to do something which God, in His own nature, never does at all-to\n surrender, to suffer, to submit, to die. Nothing in God's nature corresponds\n to this process at all. So that the one road for which we now need God's\n leadership most of all is a road God, in His own nature, has never walked.\n God can share only what He has: this thing, in His own nature, He has not.\n But supposing God became a man-suppose our human nature which can\n suffer and die was amalgamated with God's nature in one person-then that\n person could help us. He could surrender His will, and suffer and die,\n because He was man; and He could do it perfectly because He was God. You and\n I can go through this process only if God does it in us; but God can do it\n only if He becomes man. Our attempts at this dying will succeed only if we\n men share in God's dying, just as our thinking can succeed only because it\n is a drop out of the ocean of His intelligence: but we cannot share God's\n dying unless God dies; and He cannot die except by being a man. That is the\n sense in which He pays our debt, and suffers for us what He Himself need not\n suffer at all.\n \n I have heard some people complain that if Jesus was God as well as man,\n then His sufferings and death lose all value in their eyes, \"because it must\n have been so easy for him.\" Others may (very rightly) rebuke the ingratitude\n and ungraciousness of this objection; what staggers me is the\n misunderstanding it betrays. In one sense, of course, those who make it are\n right. They have even understated their own case. The perfect submission,\n the perfect suffering, the perfect death were not only easier to Jesus\n because He was God, but were possible only because He was God. But surely\n that is a very odd reason for not accepting them? The teacher is able to\n form the letters for the child because the teacher is grown-up and knows how\n to write. That, of course, makes it easier for the teacher, and only because\n it is easier for him can he help the child. If it rejected him because \"it's\n easy for grown-ups\" and waited to learn writing from another child who could\n not write itself (and so had no \"unfair\" advantage), it would not get on\n very quickly. If I am drowning in a rapid river, a man who still has one\n foot on the bank may give me a hand which saves my life. Ought I to shout\n back (between my gasps) \"No, it's not fair! You have an advantage! You're\n keeping one foot on the bank\"? That advantage-call it \"unfair\" if you\n like-is the only reason why he can be of any use to me. \n \n To what will you\n look for help if you will not look to that which is stronger than yourself?\n Such is my own way of looking at what Christians call the Atonement.\n But remember this is only one more picture. Do not mistake it for the thing\n itself: and if it does not help you, drop it......click the link to continue the explination by reading chapter 5. The Practical Conclusion",

It must be a combination of both if you think that referring to offenses committed hundreds of years ago by an organization that has existed for almost 2000 years reflects a lack of insight. And only an ignorant and uninformed kid would hold more value to that which occurred within the span of living memory and disregard that which is only based on historical record. Gee, I gues the civil war really didn't happen since no one is alive from that alleged historical event. \n \n Only we old codgers hold on to such thinking. Damn that senility. emoticon_xgood",

   "POST SEVEN\n \n Of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is\n named in the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our\n lives. We believe that his might is universal, for God who created \n everything also rules everthing and can do everything. God's\n power is loving, for he is our Father, and mysterious, for only faith\n can discern it when it \"is made perfect in weakness.\"\n \n \n \"He does whatever he pleases\"\n \n The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal\n power of God. He is called the \"Mighty One of Jacob,\" the \"LORD\n of hosts,\" the \"strong and mighty\" one. If God is almighty \"in\n heaven and on earth,\" it is because he made them. Nothing is\n impossible with God, who disposes his works according to his\n will. He is the Lord of the universe, whose order he established\n \n and which remains wholly subject to him and at his disposal. He\n is master of history, governing hearts and events in keeping with\n his will: \"It is always in your power to show great strength, and\n who can withstand the strength of your arm?\"\n \n \n \"You are merciful to all, for you can do all things\"\n \n God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power\n shed light on one another: God reveals his fatherly omnipotence\n by the way he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he \n gives us (\"I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and\n daughters, says the Lord Almighty.\"): finally by his infinite\n mercy, for he displays his power at its height by freely forgiving sins.\n \n God's almighty power is in no way arbitrary: \n \n In God,power, essence, will, intellect, wisdom, and justice are all identical.\n Nothing therefore can be in God's power which could not be in his\n just will or his wise intellect.\n \n \n The mystery of God's apparent powerlessness\n \n Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by\n the experience of evil and suffering. God can sometimes seem to\n be absent and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysterious \n \n way God the Father has revealed his almighty power in the\n voluntary humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he \n conquered evil. Christ crucified is thus \"the power of God and the\n Wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and \n the weakness of God is stronger than men.\" It is in Christ's \n Resurrection and exaltation that the Father has shown forth \"the\n immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe.\"\n \n Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's \n almighty power. This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to \n draw to itself Christ's power. The Virgin Mary is the supreme \n model of this faith, for she believed that \"nothing will be impossible \n with God,\" and was able to magnify the Lord: \"For he who is \n mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.\"\n \n Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than\n holding it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God.\n Once our reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it \n will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that [the\n Creed] will afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be\n great and marvelous things, far above the ordinary laws of\n nature.\n \n \n \n \n \n IN BRIEF\n \n \n With Job, the just man, we confess: \"I know that you\n can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be\n thwarted\" (Job 42:2).\n \n Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often\n addresses its prayer to the \"almighty and eternal God\"\n (\"omnipotens sempiterne Deus . . .\"), believing firmly\n that \"nothing will be impossible with God\" (Gen 18:14;\n Lk 1:37; Mt 19:26). \n \n God shows forth his almighty power by converting us\n from our sins and restoring us to his friendship by\n grace. \"God, you show your almighty power above all\n in your mercy and forgiveness . . .\" (Roman Missal, 26th\n Sunday, Opening Prayer).\n \n If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how\n can we believe that the Father could create us, the Son\n redeem us and the Holy Spirit sanctify us?",
