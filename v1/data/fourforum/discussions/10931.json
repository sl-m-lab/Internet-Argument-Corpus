   "From lytes link, I found this.\n The Upper Paleolithic (or Upper Palaeolithic) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age as it is understood in Europe, Africa and Asia. Very broadly it dates to between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago, roughly coinciding with the appearance of \"high\" culture (behavioral modernity) and before the advent of agriculture. The terms \"Late Stone Age\" and \"Upper Paleolithic\" refer to the same periods. For historical reasons \"Late Stone Age\" usually refers to the period in Africa, whereas \"Upper Paleolithic\" is generally used when referring to the period in Europe. In 19th century archaeology, the Upper Paleolithic was also known as the \"Reindeer Age\".\n I understand that Theologians have come to an estimated age of Man by backtracking the Genealogies in the bible which is where the 6500 to 9000 year date for creation came from. But I personally have problems with that conclusion and question the accuracy of these manmade estimates. We know that their are gaps in the genealogical record in the bible so it's impossible in my opinion to date the time of the Creation with any absolute certainty.\n \n There is also evidence that shows Man was building sophisticated architecture at least 10,000 years ago. So that conflicts with the theological age of creation. Here's one example: \n \n http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan2.html\n \n So based on the estimated age of those Cave Paintings, and that Man may actually have been created as far back as 25,000 to 35,000 years ago, I don't have a problem with them having been painted by Early Man who was created by God but not evolved.",

Have you every heard of the Table of Nations? It is the compilation of the Genealogies from Genesis 10 that deals with Noah's sons forward.

This is what I meant when I said there were gaps in the genealogical record, and I stand by my claim unless you can show an unbroken genealogy from Adam to Noah. What you will actually find is not a complete descendancy from Adam but only through the lineage of Seth, his son which believed God and through whom Messiah would eventually come.\n \n http://www.bible-truth.org/GEN5.HTM\n \n And let me say, if this study proves nothing else to you, it should show that Creationists aren't just brain washed puppets that are spoonfed results without being able to make up our own minds based on dissecting the bible and what it claims. \n \n Here is the Table of Nations, it is pages long and the latter pages are as important as the former.\n \n http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/bb000319.htm\n \n And this link that I posted yesterday, I believe is evidence of a pre-flood civilization that had attained technological capabilities that might resemble accomplishments that only this current generation has realized once again.\n \n http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan2.html\n \n \nThere are no gaps in the Biblical geneology, it's all spelled out quite clearly.

   "Please post the verse/passage that states that age of the World and I will be very inclined to believe it. My problem with the age as I understand it is that it's based on human understanding. So show me how my lack of belief in the theological status quo is actually contradicting what the bible say's. Because honestly, I'm not aware of the bible giving your 5768 year age at all. Men? YES, the bible? NO.\n\n \n First of all, 5768 is today's year in the Jewish calendar, which measures how long it's been since the creation of man. If you interpret the bible literally, the world was created less than a week before man was. \n \n (For those of you who don't know the bible, there are two stories of creation: that of the seven days and that of Adam and Eve. There are many interpretations of what this means and which is true, but for simplicity's sake I am going with the interpretation which states that the stories are intertwined and that God created Adam on the sixth day.)",

Wouldn't you have to count the length of their lifetimes to actually determine how much time elapsed between generations? \n \n\n We're not counting time elapsed between generation, we're counting time passed between specific events. Imagine this. We know that this sequence of events happens, in this order. Event A, event B, event C, event D. Ok? The time between event A and event B is X, between B and C is Y, and between C and D is Z. Still with me? Ok, so what is the total time between A and D? X + Y + Z. Right? Ok. A is Adam is created. B is Seth is born. C is Enosh is born, etc, etc etc. X is how old Adam was when Seth was born, Y is how old Seth was when Enosh was born, etc, etc etc. The fact that Adam was supposed to live for centuries after the birth of Seth doesn't enter into the equation. Once Seth is born we're using that point to continue our count, not Adam's life.\n \n To put it another way, how long does it take you to drive home? You leave work at 5:00, and get home at 5:45. The fact that you're still alive doesn't change the fact that it only took you 45 minutes, we don't keep counting till the point where you're dead. :)\n \n One final example, with made up numbers. My grandfather is born in 1900. 35 years later he gives birth to my dad, in 1935. 30 years later my dad gives birth to me, in 1965. When I'm 20, in 1985, I have my first beer.

See? \n \n \nNow we know that their lifetimes overlapped, so this math isn't accurate.\n\n \n The point I am trying to make here is that with the life spans being as long as they were pre-flood, then everyone lived longer and it just stands to reason that more time passed than we allow for in our modern way of thinking. And I understand the 1656 year timeframe is the accepted time frame given between Adam and Noah by those who propose it. \n \n It is my belief that their is more to the timing that we are not considering. Just like I believe is the case with evolutionists making assumptions when they don't have all of the facts, I believe that unknown factors exist in the bible. So making absolutes age predictions is a losers game in my opinion. \n \n Just considering the Jewish calendar of 5768 since the Creation of the World, and I respect their timing more than anyones. so if we subtract 2008 from it, we are left with 3760 years from Creation to Jesus. Now subtract the 1656 years from Adam to Noah and we are left with 2104 between the Flood and Jesus coming.\n \n Now this may be correct, but if we just accept it as correct then we are accepting all of the variables used to come up with those numbers as absolutely correct. And I'm sorry, but I know that for example, only the genealogy of Seth, from Adam was used. What if Adam had 5 other children before the son from whom the genealogy was counted from? The point is, the bible doesn't clarify that so we must make assumptions in order to believe the numbers as given. And what if the same situation exists with every other Patriarch used to make up this genealogical time frame. You must assume that the sons referred to is always the first born so no other gaps of time exist that are unaccounted for. \n \n The only point I have tried to make is that it's what we DON'T know that will skew these estimated lengths of time and I have no reason to make such assumption. Am I saying that the status quo is absolutely wrong, and only I am right? Not at all. But I am saying that I believe that the genealogical record is not nearly complete enough for us to make such assumptions from. That is my personal belief and I know it is valid based on the record and the fact that theologians admit that the genealogical record isn't complete. So my point is, I'm not saying that I MUST be right, I'm saying that I might be right. And if that is true then those who use the available numbers to date the time period in question MIGHT be wrong. The fact is that NOBODY CAN SAY FOR SURE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT. That is why virtually no theologians state this age as a FACT, but only as a belief based on the available information.",

I think that your delusions were smashed when you consulted your pastor and found that Kronus is correct.

We have established that the time from the creation to Noah is 1656 years, and even given generous estimates to the generations from the flood on, the earth must be quite young; no more than about 10,000 years. Most creationist christians claim about 6,000 years.\n \nI just can't prove it because the bible doesn't speak to that issue at all. That is what is such a huge assumption; we just don't know the answer because the bible doesn't tell us.\nBut it does. It lists the entire genealogy from Adam to Jesus. How can that not indicate at least an approximate age for the earth? Either the Bible is literal or it is not.\n \n So, since we have established that you are not a young earth creationist, i.e., that you accept that the earth is quite old and that the Bible cannot be trusted in this matter, what kind of creationist are you? Gap creationist, day-age creationist, or progressive creationist? Of course you aren't an evolutionary creationist or a theistic evolutionist. So exactly what do you believe. Once you reject a literal reading of the Bible, we need to know exactly what you believe in order to place them in the context of arguments against science.",
