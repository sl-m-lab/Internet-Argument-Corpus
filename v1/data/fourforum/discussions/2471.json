   "Chamber of Commerce employee in Alabama says he was fired for wearing a small lapel pin depicting the Ten Commandments.\n \n Christopher Word - who attends the same church as \"Ten Commandments Judge\" Roy Moore - said his boss, Hoover, Alabama Chamber of Commerce executive Director Bill Powell, confronted him Monday after a weekly staff meeting, the Birmingham News reported. Word said he was told, \"I could either take it off or I've got to go.\"\n \n Click below for the full article:\n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38567",

The company has to agree with the termination and so forth. So to answer your question; if a company policy is violated, yes, you could get fired for breaking the rules.\n \n If the boss was offended by the pin, it's his fault, and he shouldn't be able to fire the guy. Being offended and breaking the rules are two different things. See my point?",

   "Not to turn a religious discussion into a political one,but it seems to me that the founding fathers when writing the constitution wrote what they wrote about religion in order to keep government out of religion not religion out of government. Keeping the second to some degree is necessary in theory. Keeping it completely is impossible as most of the populace of this country (US) is religious in one fashion or another and the government employs them. To limit their freedom of expression or religion is what the founding fathers were fearful of.",

It seems like it&#8217;s more of a view than a policy, really. In that case the Chamber has no leg to stand on, as I referred to in my second post.\n \n But, there seems to be something missing in the story. What rules were broken, if any? If no rules were broken, then no harm no foul.\n \n Maybe Powell is looking for a little shine-time?",

Then who is to say Atheists cannot come to work with a picture of God and a big red X over his face. The fact is that religion is a touchy issue. If it is possible for you or anyone in the work place to be offended by the atheists item then it is just as possible that someone is offended by the turban or the ten commandments pin. No one is going to get offended by the Matrix or the \"Force\". That is entertainment and is in a whole different realm than religion.",
