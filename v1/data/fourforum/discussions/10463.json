Invoking God doesn't solve the problem, because then God is uncaused, and a creator God is more difficult to explain than physics is. (Having time be circular wouldn't help either, except for science fiction writers.)\n \n I am quite grateful that Shakyamuni Buddha clearly and definitely put these questions outside the scope of religion. I wish more Christians would realize that creation has nothing to do with salvation, and let science get on with it.\n \n PS There is a mythology in which God and the Universe come into existence at the same time, and God labors under the delusion that it created the Universe. In many other mythologies, God or the Gods come into existence after the Universe.\n \n Also, in some theologies, God doesn't exist, because mere existence isn't good enough. God is sometimes said to be ineffable, which means among other things neither existing nor not existing, and so on. Ineffability is a self-contradiction, of course. Now we are in the realm of the Zen koan, where it is better not to pretend to explain, but rather to invite people to give the practice a try.\n\n \n how do you know that the so called laws existed before the big bang, were they waiting for it to happen?\n \n I have no problem with a Godless universe, however science is not doing much progress in answering questions such as has the Universe a beginning? since time did not exist before the Big Bang how can you go before that instant?\n \n \n Zen is not inviting people to try. Zen is not a game. Zen is about knowing by direct experience of reality. koans are tests to see how much progress a person has made.\n \n Buddha's teaching were about living right not about Religion in the sense of Christians and Moslems have of Religion. It was no philosophy either.",

Thus, the creationism v. evolution debate becomes an effort by creationists to discredit evolution rather than an effort to offer evidence for creationism. The reason is simple - there is no evidence that supports creationism.\n \n On the other hand, it is intentional ignorance to claim that the earth is only 6,000 years old, that there was a universal flood about 4500 years ago, or that the millions of species in the world today evolved from a few thousand species at most at rates no evolutionary biologist would even consider possible.
