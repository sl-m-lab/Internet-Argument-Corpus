   "Back in the '50s, there was a hunting camp on an island in the Mississipppi where one of the members had a barge fitted out with a set of wheel rollers like you see at an emission testing station today. These rollers were set at the same spacing as the wheels of his old jeep and each wheel drove a paddle wheel mounted on the sides of the barge. (A four wheel drive side wheeler!) It had rudder steering that understandably wasn't very effective, but each of the rear paddle wheels had in-out splined couplings and could be individually disengaged. Shifting the jeep to 2-wheel drive disengaged the front paddles and the barge could be steered well enough.\n \n Quite inventive, I'd say. He'd just drive his jeep onto the barge, tie it down and putt over to the island, drive it off and go hunting. You might think an outboard motor or two would have done better, but it was a fairly large barge and his four paddle wheels were more effective and could move the barge even faster than he wanted to go with it.\n \n It took three people to operate it properly, but he never had trouble finding helpers...'cause his jeep was one of the only ones in the club with a cab and a heater.",
