   "I will now show a trail of Christian heritage through English law leading up to the formation of the United States of America...\n \n Alfred the Great, one of the codifiers of the laws of England, swore treaties by God.\n \"With this army Alfred made a solemn treaty, to the effect that they should depart out of the kingdom, and for this they made no hesitation to give as many hostages as he named; also they swore an oath over the Christian relics, (21) which with king Alfred were next in veneration after the Deity himself, that they would depart speedily from the kingdom.\"\n http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/KingAlfred/part1.html\n \n William the Conqueror began his collection of statutes by saying \"Here is shown what William the king of the English, together With his princes, has established since the Conquest of England. \n Firstly that, above all things, he wishes one God to lie venerated throughout his whole kingdom, one faith of Christ always to be kept inviolate, peace and security to be observed between the English and the Normans\"\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/lawwill.htm\n \n Henry II who codified the common law has his constitution of Clrendon state:\n \"The declaration of the above-mentioned royal customs and dignities has beenmade by the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, and the nobler and older menof the kingdom, at Clarendon on the fourth day before the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, lord Henry being present there with the lord king hisfather. There are, indeed, many other great customs and dignities of holymother church and of the lord king and barons of the kingdom, which are notincluded in this writing, but which are to be preserved to holy church and tothe lord king and his heirs and the barons of the kingdom, and are to be kept inviolate for ever.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cclarendon.html\n \n King John's Magna Carta begins:\n \"John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects, greetings. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor of God and the advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifying of our realm, we have granted as underwritten by advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop of Dublin,\"\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/magna.htm\n \n Now it is important to understand the Magna Carta in relation to US law making\"\n \"It is impossible to understand the politics and activities of our day without an understanding of the history behind them. It is not only the right, but the responsibility, of a citizen to seek to understand one's government, one's relationship to it, and that government's relationship to the larger world. All governments, and all societies, are based on a system of laws. A constitution is a formal charter stating the laws of a nation and communicating that nation's structure, standards, and intentions, not only to its citizens, but to the larger world. The modern constitution is a device to express the foundations of the life and business of a political nation. It lends credibility to a government and defines how that government represents its people. Here is an exploration of recent documents that form our idea of what a constitution should be, and some of the constitutions that resulted.\"\n http://www.leftjustified.org/leftjust/lib/sc/ht/wtp/wtp.html\n also\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_docs/Foundation_home.html\n This site recognizes the direct influence of the Magna Carta on the formation of the United States. It also recognizes the import of the Mayflower Compact.\n \n Further, these examples up to this point quite unashamedly are Christian.\n \n Thus when the \"The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress - 1774\" states\n \"That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS:\"\n (http://www.leftjustified.org/leftjust/lib/sc/ht/wtp/1cngrss.html) they are referring to the laws established and exampled above; those that mention the Christian God.\n \n The English Bill of Rights' first statement is one concerning religio the freedom to practice a Christian faith\n \"Whereas the late King James the Second, by the assistance of divers evil counsellors, judges, and ministers employed by him, did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom.\"\n http://www.constitution.org/bor/eng_bor.htm\n \n And \"in composing the (American) declaration (of Independence), Jefferson followed the format of the English Declaration of Rights, written after the Glorious Revolution of 1689.\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_docs/Foundation_lesson_declaration.htm\n \n Which is why it begins and ends with evoking the name of God\n \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...\"\n \"And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence,...\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_docs/Declaration_Independence.html\n \n Even when Thomas Paine calls for religious tolerance, it's in a Christian context writing in \"Common Sense\" he states.\n \"As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of all government, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our christian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the same family, differing only, in what is called their Christian names.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/paine-common.html",

   "You're thinking of Ralph Nader.\n\n \n Actually within the common law world at large I'm thinking specifically of the tort of negligence which had its birth in the case Donaghue v Stevenson (1932), when Lord Aitken asked 'who in law in my neighbour?'\n \"If you were to ask lawyers from around the world to name the most famous tort case in legal history, they would say without hesitation Donoghue v. Stevenson.\"\n http://www.thepaisleysnail.com/information.shtml\n \n The idea of 'love thy neighbour' is an old one...\n Muhammad urges people to look after their brothers; by this he means other Muslims.\n The Jews had a similarly narrow outlook on 'neighbour'\n For Hammurabi, it was your immediate neighbour\n \n However, Jesus Christ ruled that all men are your brothers.\n \n The Jews had the 'eye for an eye' concept: Exodus 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21\n They also had the 'love thy neighbour' concept: Lev. 19:18\n both of which Jesus touches upon in St. Matthew's Gospel\n \n Look at what He says in the Gospel of St. Matthew on the 'eye for an eye'.\n Mat 5\n 38 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\n 39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\n \n That is, He's completely over-turning the notion of revenge! Next, what does He say about 'neighbour'?\n Mat 5\n 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, \n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n \n Note He says \"you've heard this...\" then \"BUT I tell you...\". He's over-turning the rules of the past and preaching universal love.\n \n He repeats the message\n Mat 19\n 19 Jesus replied, \" 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbour as yourself.'\n \n Mark 12\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \n 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\n 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'\n 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \n 32 \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.\n 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" \n 34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.\n \n Especially important is...\n Luke 10\n 25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" \n 26 \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" \n 27 He answered: \" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind' ; and, 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' \n 28 \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" \n 29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbour?\"\n ....(see parable of the Good Samaritan at this point)\n 36 \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" \n 37 The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"\n \n He is not referring to a literal neighbour at all, but one who has concern for someone else.\n \n It is why St. Paul said...\n Romans 13\n 10 Love does no harm to its neighbour. Therefore love is the fulfilment of the law.\n \n Galatians 5\n 14 The entire law is summed up in a single command: \"Love your neighbour as yourself.\"\n \n And James said...\n James 2\n 8 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" you are doing right.\n \n The prominence of 'neighbour' as being all men whom you might have some contact/influence with was the idea behind Lord Aitken's ruling...\n \n I shall give a bit of info about the case. Ms Donaghue attended a restaurant wherein she had a meal and a bottle of ginger-beer. The bottle was opaque (so you couldn't see the contents), and was still sealed (that it had come like that direct from the factory). She had some of the drink, then a bit more and noticed the decomposing bits of a snail inside the drink. She became ill. She took Stevenson to court (his company made the drink), however, it was the rule of law that as no contract existed between her and the drink maker, that she had no right under existing law (because the contract existed between the Stevenson and the restaurant, and then a contract between Donaghue and the restaurant.\n \n This case went all the way to the House of Lords. The minority ruling was against the applicant. That up till this point people were unprotected in law. Lord Buckmeister, one of the two dissenting Law Lords said basically \"There's no law protecting her, therefore it should be thrown out!\"*\n \n Commenting on a lower court... \"The Court below had proceeded on the general principle that in an ordinary case a manufacturer is under no duty to any one with who he is not in contractual relation...\"**\n 1932 Law Reports, House of Lords, p534. also cited as 1932 Law Reports 534\n \n However, speaking for the majority, Lord Aitken said... \"The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omission which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\" \n http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case5.html\n \n \"Doubtless, any lawyer vaguely familiar with the development of tortious liability appreciates the consequences of the decision handed down on 26 May....In order to reach that conclusion, it was necessary for the court to formulate a broad principle that went beyond the categories previously recognised. In fact, the specific categories were replaced with a principle so wide in scope that it laid the foundation for the modern law of negligence.\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 379\n \n \n \"In the House of Lords, her appeal was upheld. What interests us here is the very practical application made by Lord Aitkin of Christ's teachings.\"\n \n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=2883\n \n \n \n \"For the Christian Church, it was the legal affirmation of the basic moral precept that one should \"love thy neighbour\" or at least not to do anything to hurt him or her...\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 382\n \n \n \n Once this had been established by the ruling in the House of Lords (where the case was heard), it had an immediate effect on all courts within the common law world; including America through 'persuasive effect'.*** From this, legislators began to enact laws protecting the end user of products... to those that owe a 'duty of care' to the end user.\n \"This decision was immediately accepted in England as a milestone in the development of common law - as recognising a 'tort of negligence... Donoghue v Stevenson has had almost revolutionary importance to the common law world as a whole. The trail of the snail leads from London to Adelaide, from Ottawa to Singapore.\"\n Smith, T B, \"British Justice: The Scottish Contribution\" (1961), pp51-52\n \n \"The case established the general principle of (tort of) negligence, that is, that persons who have some relation or proximity owe a duty of care to each other. Since it was established, this precedent has been further refined and applied and referred to in thousands of fact situations where a person complains of physical harm to their person or property.\"\n http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/repor...nsf/pages/clr_4\n \n \n *Lord Buckmesiter said \"Now the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance...There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food apart from that implied by contract or imposed by statute.\"\n \n \n \n **There were two legislated exceptions...\n a) when the product was of its nature dangerous (e.g. TNT)\n b) when the article is dangerous to the knowledge of the manufacturer.\n \n \n \n ***persuasive effect is where a court deals with a new issue, it will look to similar courts rulings within similar jurisdictions, and if not, to further afield.\n \n \n \n \n \n The original text of the case can be found at\n \n http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm",

This is much more a restricted use then 'neighbour' is in the Judeo-Christian sense, where Jesus says ALL men are my brother, not just those that believe as I do.\n Again, the next use of the word 'brother'\n \"Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you, O servants of Allah, brothers. A muslim is the brother of a muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here-and he pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother muslim in contempt. The whole of a muslim for another muslim is inviolable: his blood, his property, and his honor.\"\n So, there is no universal in the sense that Jesus used, therefore I am correct in saying that the Muslims do not have the same sense of it.\n All quotes from http://mac.abc.se/home/onesr/ez/hdth/40h-naw_e.html\n \n I put forward the challenge on another forum that there's no Koranic equivalent to \"Love thy neighbour\". Aside from the Hadith quited first above (which itself is not from the Koran), the closest anyone could come to it was\n Sura 8:61\n \"But if they incline to peace, you also incline to it, and (put your) trust in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=27&bid=8\n This means, if your enemy has stopped fighting you, and you want to stop fighting, then okay, call a halt to hostilities.\n It is no where near as broad as Jesus' command \"Love thy neighbour\"\n Jesus said\n Mat: 5\n 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor* and hate your enemy.' 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n \n *reference to the Old Testament",

   "I don't think it's incumbent on me, let alone possible, for me to demonstrate why Western civilization flourished and others languished, within the confines of one singular reason-the adoption or absence of Christianity. If this is the direction this thread is going, my contributions will be limited, because my knowledge of such things is limited more so. \n \n Could it not, for instance, be said the Bubonic plague which decimated Europe was the impetus for Western civilization's eventual dominance? A myriad of other stand-alone or inter-connected events could be as likely possible. Similarly, are you willing to argue for the success of every society which has embraced Christianity, and the decline of those who haven't? \n \n My contribution to this thread will probably be limited to examining-however cursory-- the impact of Jesus' teaching, particularly the Sermon on the Mount with which you draw much of your material from in post #5. Specifically, what lasting effect it has had on law.

I would like to consider the Sermon on the Mount in the light of that select group, because it is widely considered to be the pinnacle and the crux of Jesus' teachings, on what Christianity's foundation is composed of, and because of your use of it in making your point about its effect on modern law. And, most importantly, does it meet the requirement for greatness; that is, are we a better people for it? \n \n \n\n The idea of 'love thy neighbour' is an old one...\n Muhammad urges people to look after their brothers; by this he means other Muslims.\n The Jews had a similarly narrow outlook on 'neighbour'\n For Hammurabi, it was your immediate neighbour\n \n However, Jesus Christ ruled that all men are your brothers.\n\n \n In a kind of preamble to his sermon, Jesus in Matthew 5:17-18 states,\n \n \"Do not think I have come to destroy the law...I have come to fulfill. For amen I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or tittle shall be lost from the Law till all things have been accomplished.\"\n \n This is a particularly problematic statement. A tittle is a small mark over a word or letter, and this statement is an unqualified endorsement of support for the letter of the Jewish law in practice then, right down to the last period, including laws on slavery and polygamy. Thus, if the Jews had a narrow outlook on what qualifies as \"neighbor\" then Jesus had no quibble with it. One could not give a more hearty, unequivocal commendation of support than that.\n \n The trouble, of course, is that we are to believe the self-same person then contradicts this statement and immediately launches into a major reworking of Jewish Law just two verses later! For me, it won't do. There is something wrong here. Good law, for one thing, is based on removing all ambiguity.\n \n \n\n Look at what He says in the Gospel of St. Matthew on the 'eye for an eye'.\n Mat 5\n 38 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\n 39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.

Every court recognizes and accepts the idea of personal self-defense. Everyone I know, including myself, has taught his son the right to defend himself and others against assault. \n \n \n\n \n Next, what does He say about 'neighbour'?\n Mat 5\n 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, \n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.

I recall them only if something triggers a memory of them, then I remember I hate them and they're gone again. It could be just me and my personal quirks, I don't know, but is it practical or even possible to love someone who hates you in return? What kind of mental gymnastics are required to practice that dictate? \n \n \n\n Mark 12\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \n 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\n 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'\n 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \n \n\n \n Jesus may have been confused. Love your neighbor is not one of the Ten Commandments. Loving God is part of the second commandment, IIRC.\n \n In summary, is the Sermon on the Mount worthy of a place among the other great works that have helped elevate mankind in its quest for justice? IMO, it isn't. We seem to have embarked on that path in spite of, not because of, it.",

   "I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s incumbent on me, let alone possible, for me to demonstrate why Western civilization flourished and others languished, within the confines of one singular reason&#8212;the adoption or absence of Christianity. If this is the direction this thread is going, my contributions will be limited, because my knowledge of such things is limited more so. \n\n Well what you are then offering is a lazy form of debate. I gave a series of (I hope) well-thought out steps. You bring in a myriad of other religious dogmas with no connection to the case at hand and state now that you don't need to show any connection of causality at all. You could well be correct in your assumptions about Buddha, for example, but you've yet to develop any theory, but give a list of 'evidences' that don't as yet point to anything.\n You also need to follow why those Buddhists didn't develop such laws. We did. That is a known. You're mainly dealing in supposition.\n \nCould it not, for instance, be said the Bubonic plague which decimated Europe was the impetus for Western civilization&#8217;s eventual dominance? A myriad of other stand-alone or inter-connected events could be as likely possible. Similarly, are you willing to argue for the success of every society which has embraced Christianity, and the decline of those who haven&#8217;t? \n\n a) The plague didn't just affect western Europe, and there was not just 'one' plague.\n b) Show an hypothesis of how this particular plague, or all of them affected western Europe in the manner you believe; with reference to the fact that it somehow negated Christian teaching/influences, and thus was of itself a major cause of modern legal development.\n \nMy contribution to this thread will probably be limited to examining&#8212;however cursory-- the impact of Jesus&#8217; teaching, particularly the Sermon on the Mount with which you draw much of your material from in post #5. Specifically, what lasting effect it has had on law. I appreciate your inclusion of almost all the important mileposts in mankind&#8217;s march to enlightenment, from the Code of Hammurabi to the Declaration of Independence.\n\n The Code of Hammurabi, while it most likely had some influence on Jewish law was largely unknown to the world until rediscovered in the 1800s. What the Declaration of Independence has to do with the law of Negligence in torts, is yet to be detailed by your goodself. However, you need look at post #1 first.\n \nWe can probably agree these monumental works greatly aided future generations by building upon the foundations they provided to further advance civility, yes?\n\n No. As stated Hammurabi may have influenced the Old Testament laws. However, as already shown, the OT laws were highly restrictive in their application of justice. Jesus' rule was revolutionary. Further, Lord Aitken doesn't quote as an influence the Law of Hammurabi, but Jesus' rule of 'neighbour', and it was Lord Aitken's ruling that created the modern law of negligence in tort.\n For you to debate this you might need to\n a) that Lord Aitken was influence by other religious dogma\n or\n b) show that torts law was not created by Lord Aitken's decision AND show who did found such law, and what religious dogma (or not) influenced them.\n \nI would like to consider the Sermon on the Mount in the light of that select group, because it is widely considered to be the pinnacle and the crux of Jesus&#8217; teachings, on what Christianity&#8217;s foundation is composed of, and because of your use of it in making your point about its effect on modern law. And, most importantly, does it meet the requirement for greatness; that is, are we a better people for it? \n\n I disagree with this speculation about what Christians believe. The Sermon on the Mount is but part of Christian teaching. Christ's teaching was that Christ was the Son of God, the redeemer of Man. The central teaching of Christ, is Christ.\n \nThe idea of 'love thy neighbour' is an old one...\n Muhammad urges people to look after their brothers; by this he means other Muslims.\n The Jews had a similarly narrow outlook on 'neighbour'\n For Hammurabi, it was your immediate neighbour\n However, Jesus Christ ruled that all men are your brothers.\n\n (See also Endnote in post #12)\n \nIn a kind of preamble to his sermon, Jesus in Matthew 5:17-18 states,\n &#8220;Do not think I have come to destroy the law&#8230;I have come to fulfil. For amen I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or tittle shall be lost from the Law till all things have been accomplished.&#8221;\n This is a particularly problematic statement. A tittle is a small mark over a word or letter, and this statement is an unqualified endorsement of support for the letter of the Jewish law in practice then, right down to the last period, including laws on slavery and polygamy. Thus, if the Jews had a narrow outlook on what qualifies as &#8220;neighbor&#8221; then Jesus had no quibble with it. One could not give a more hearty, unequivocal commendation of support than that.\n\n This is simply wrong. Jesus quite clearly defines what was said by Jewish law, and then says what we should do, which is different. Jesus' fulfilment of the law was Himself.\n \nThe trouble, of course, is that we are to believe the self-same person then contradicts this statement and immediately launches into a major reworking of Jewish Law just two verses later! For me, it won&#8217;t do. There is something wrong here. Good law, for one thing, is based on removing all ambiguity.\n\n You are digressing from 'the laws' to a different issue of doctrine. Jesus is the truth of Christianity. He is whom we follow.\n He is the covenant with Abraham fulfilled. He is the promise made to David fulfilled.\n We follow Christ, and Christianity is how we follow Christ. Thus Jesus is both saying \"I am the truth\", and \"This is how you should follow the truth\". Thus He is the fulfilment of Jewish prophecy/laws/covenants etc. The Jews believed that in following the laws of God, the Messiah would come. Jesus is the result. The laws are not destroyed by Jesus. They are fulfilled by Him.\n \nLook at what He says in the Gospel of St. Matthew on the 'eye for an eye'.\n Mat 5 38 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\n 39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\n\n \nThat is, He's completely over-turning the notion of revenge! \n\n Hate begets hate. Yes, the laws He proposes are revolutionary. That is why I posted them, with the links from there to Lord Aitken's ruling some 1900 years later. Lord Aitken believed that a responsibilty, or a 'duty of care' extended beyond those of your immediate relations.\n \nThis is horrid advice, let alone law. We must stop evil where and when it is found, and use force if necessary. We are doomed as a society otherwise. \n\n You are again digressing into a different debate; on other doctrine. But now I too must follow your lead.\n God is love. God loves us. He gave us free will, that is, the choice not to love Him; that is to sin. When we sin, we separate ourselves from God. Hell is the ultimate separation, which God allows us, because that is our choice. It is out of love for us that He respects our wish to exercise the gift of Free Will that He gave us. Likewise, we must always be God-like, and love one another. We must love our enemies, even as they persecute us. This does not mean the same as agreeing with them, at all. But as I said, you are really moving from one debate, to others. The crux of the matter is Lord Aitken referred to Jesus, and despite your wish that it were otherwise, by this divergence of debate, it is but supposition, and it still doesn't account for the fact Lord Aiken states his own reasons were the influence of 'love thy neighbour'.\n \nLikewise, passivity does not work. Every court recognizes and accepts the idea of personal self-defense. Everyone I know, including myself, has taught his son the right to defend himself and others against assault. \n\n So?\n \nNext, what does He say about 'neighbour'?\n Mat 5 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, \n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. \n\n \nFor my part, I hate my enemies. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like to strain under the burden of trying to love them. Fortunately, I have collected very few in my half-century of life and they are far-removed from my mind. I recall them only if something triggers a memory of them, then I remember I hate them and they&#8217;re gone again. It could be just me and my personal quirks, I don&#8217;t know, but is it practical or even possible to love someone who hates you in return? What kind of mental gymnastics are required to practice that dictate? \n\n We Orthodox believe that we are called to be God-like. That does not mean 'to become a god', but to follow the example of God, as shown by Jesus Christ, in order to combat sin. God is asking us to love everyone. He is not asking you to condone sin.\n \nMark 12\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \n 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\n 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'\n 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \n\n \nJesus may have been confused. Love your neighbor is not one of the Ten Commandments. Loving God is part of the second commandment, IIRC.\n\n You are confused. Jesus doesn't say 'of the 10 Commandments', he says 'of all the Commandments'. Just look at the Book of Leviticus, it's full of commandments. God gave a commandment to Adam and Eve \"Do not eat of the fruit of a particular tree\". That is not one of the 10 Commandments.\n \nIn summary, is the Sermon on the Mount worthy of a place among the other great works that have helped elevate mankind in its quest for justice? IMO, it isn&#8217;t. We seem to have embarked on that path in spite of, not because of, it.\n\n I believe, unfortunately that your last comment contains some truth - that is, it is your opinion.",

Suppose such and such might have happened.

I merely have attempted to show that Christianity still influences law-making, and it does, because this particular law is directly attributable to Christ's teaching.\n \nFiling a claim of tort of negligence is the legal means used by a claimant to seek monetary compensation from an alleged wrongful act.\n\n A tort is a claim for compensation resulting between two parties where no contract exists, but a relationship in law is established; where one party owes a Duty of Care to the other party.\n \nWe get from Christianity the idea of tort of negligence&#8230; how? \n Blessed are the poor in spirit&#8230;but filthy rich from the lawsuit.\n Blessed are the meek&#8230;but hire the most aggressive, pompous lawyer you can.\n Blessed are they who mourn&#8230;but the cash sure dries the tears.\n Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice&#8230;your wait is over, a new class of tort lawyers await.\n Blessed are the merciful&#8230;but not right now. SUE!\n Blessed are the peacemakers&#8230;I&#8217;ll be living in my yacht named &#8220;Eden&#8221; when this lawsuit&#8217;s over. \n\n Yes, you are providing some novel attempt at straw-man. See post 5. Here, I'll make it easier for you...\n \n Jesus: Love thy neighbour.\n Lord Aitken: Who then is my neighbour? Someone who is owed a Duty of Care. Therefore I rule in favour of plaintiff, despite the fact no contract existed.\n Precedent established by which two parties can have a relationship, in law, even though they do not know each other.\n It might be a good suggestion if you read the post before entering into this with your opinion again, although this is unlikely to happen, as you seem to believe that honey drips from your lips and regardless of what you say (devoid of evidence, or not), it's priceless and we're all just waiting to here your next glorious proclamation.\n \nOut the window goes &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221;. Your neighbor wants your cloak, and accordingly, you&#8217;re supposed to offer him not only your cloak but your tunic? Forget it\n\n I see you are one of many who believes their purpose is to entrain, rather than inform.\n \n Not the least, the tort of negligence shreds to pieces one of Christianity&#8217;s most sacred teachings, The Lord&#8217;s Prayer:\n &#8220;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.&#8221;\n\n Now for the third time; maybe third time lucky... God's love is not about ignoring wrongs.\n Did you even read any of the responses I gave?\n \n Because some guy in a powdered wig and a title of Lord invoked a passage from the Bible in making a decision for tort of negligence--a 180 degree turn from the teachings of the supposed founder, and probably tertiary --does not convince me that modern law is based on Christianity.\n\n This is almost laughable. You're saying that in a common law system, just because a judge sets a precedence, where he operate on broader principles of justice, and quotes the Bible, that it's irrelevant? If only you'd actually provide an argument constructed to show how, but you seem to be one of many here who have decided that their opinion, unsupported by fact, is worth gold.\n \nParticularly American law. It seems it is nothing more than wishful thinking.\n\n American law is a common law legal system (excepting the state of Louisiana). Common law works on what is commonly called 'judge-made' law, or precedent. When a case arises where there is no guidance from statute, the judge looks to the decisions of other judges for similar cases; and if there are none within his jurisdiction, he/she will look to other similar jurisdictions, even to other nations that practice common law. A case in one jurisitiction, if it influences his/her decision, is said to have a persuasive effect. You'd have realised this is you'd read post #5 where I dealt with this.\n \n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=2883 is also a good site (which I also cited in said post)\n \n But, hey, let's just hear your un-supported opinion much repeated.\n \n \n \n Does anyone here believe that debate should be evidence-free?",

Every one written by mean-spirited religionists trying to legislate morality as they saw it. All these should be an embarrassment to kind-hearted individuals, especially those who endeavour to love their neighbours. Why you want to bring this ugliness to light is not clear to me. \n\n The only thing 'ugly' I see is someone determined to drag Christianity through the mud by use of repeated statements of opinion; with no wish to post anything referenced, for the sake of actually avoiding a reasoned debate. IMO :)\n And what is an embarrassment is that this same person would thus undermine any idea anyone would have that he is a reasoned debater, determined to make connected statements of fact.\n \nAnother is in the continual influence in modern formation of law; such as the tort of negligence which offers people great consumer protection.\n\n \nLord Aitken wrote a twenty page opinion, grounded entirely in common law\n\n This is false. It clearly shows that you don't understand the legal system you are now referring to. Lord Buckmeister, one of the dissenting judges stated quite correctly that there was nothing in common law to protect the plaintiff in this case. I stated as much in post #5 where I showed the only two exceptions common law would apply.\n I'm going to have to give you a brief run-down.\n England uses common law. Scotland uses statute law. Statute law is a system where-by judges are allowed to use broader principles of justice. Common law is in general bound by specific statutes, or to precedent.\n By a quirk of the British legal system, both these schools of thought are united at the top by the Parliament of a single unified United Kingdom, who's House of Lords can act as a common court of appeal from either jurisdiction. The findings of this supreme legal body is, however, binding on both systems.\n This particular case began in Scotland.\n In this particular case five 'law lords' sat. Two from England, two from Scotland, and Lord Aitken, who had a very interesting history, starting out in Ireland, worked some time here in Australia etc.\n The two English law lords stated that there was nothing in common law that pointed to some guidance of precedence that would allow the plaintiff's application to be successful. The other three, able to use broader concepts of legal justice were able to look further afield. With no precedence to guide them, in law, Lord Aitken was able to go to the Bible and draw from the concept of 'who is my neighbour?'\n When this case was finalised, it was binding back down the chain through the common law system; becoming for that system a case of precedence.\n I must emphasise this point, in common law, precedent is paramount\n &#8220;If we now turn to the common law of England, we will find that, as far as administrative principles and forms of procedure are concerned, it is the opposite of the Roman civil law as it was molded under the empire. The principle which, in the practical administration of the two systems, marks the primary essential distinction between them, is the relative obligatory force under them of precedent or former decisions. Under the common law, former decisions control the court unconditionally. It is deemed by the common law indispensable that there should be a fixed rule of decision, in order that rights and property may be stable and certain, and not involved in perpetual doubts and controversies. Under the civil law the principles is different.&#8221;\n http://www.svpvril.com/comcivlaw.html\n It is why Lord Buckmesiter said \"Now the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance...There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food apart from that implied by contract or imposed by statute.\" (quoted in post #5 which you should have read).\n Thus, in common law the ruling of Lord Aitken, by applying broad Christian terms was deemed &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; \n &#8220;This decision was immediately accepted in England as a milestone in the development of common law - as recognising a 'tort of negligence... Donoghue v Stevenson has had almost revolutionary importance to the common law world as a whole. The trail of the snail leads from London to Adelaide, from Ottawa to Singapore.&#8221;\n Smith, T B, &#8220;British Justice: The Scottish Contribution&#8221; (1961), pp51-52\n \nin which he included no more than a mere 70 words about the most universal precept ever, in a most tertiary way, and not mentioned by any other judge pro or con, and yet we are to believe without Christianity&#8217;s influence we&#8217;d all be swigging decomposing snail guts with our ginger-beers. \n\n That is why it was absent from common law. The three other judges were able to draw upon broader principles of justice. And yes, Lord Aitken did use Christ's teaching. At the very least you've shown you've made some effort to read what was posted.\n [quote=Montalban]The model, as demonstrated in my opening posts, shows that you have consumer protection laws precisely because of the influence of Christ's teachings - love thy neighbour.

Taken out of historical context, I guess if would be possible for you to make such an assumption.\n Here's some more statements to show context\n James Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1763)\n \"It is . . . true in fact and experience, as the great, the incomparable Harrington has most abundantly demonstrated in his Oceana and other divine writings, that empire follows the balance of property. 'Tis also certain that property in fact generally confers power, though the possessor of it may not have much more wit than a mole or a musquash: and this is too often the cause that riches are sought after without the least concern about the right application of them. But is the fault in the riches, or the general law of nature, or the unworthy possessor? It will never follow from all this that government is rightfully founded on property alone. What shall we say then? Is not government founded on grace? No. Nor on force? No. Nor on compact? Nor property? Not altogether on either. Has it any solid foundation, any chief cornerstone but what accident, chance, or confusion may lay one moment and destroy the next? I think it has an everlasting foundation in the unchangeable will of GOD, the author of nature, whose laws never vary. The same omniscient, omnipotent, infinitely good and gracious Creator of the universe who has been pleased to make it necessary that what we call matter should gravitate for the celestial bodies to roll round their axes, dance their orbits, and perform their various revolutions in that beautiful order and concern which we all admire has made it equally necessary that from Adam and Eve to these degenerate days the different sexes should sweetly attract each other, form societies of single families, of which larger bodies and communities are as naturally, mechanically, and necessarily combined as the dew of heaven and the soft distilling rain is collected by the all-enlivening heat of the sun. Government is therefore most evidently founded on the necessities of our nature. It is by no means an arbitrary thing depending merely on compact or human will for its existence. .\"\n ...\n \"...on order to form an idea of the natural rights of the colonists, I presume it will be granted that they are men, the common children of the same Creator with their brethren of Great Britain...\"\n ...\n http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/b...urces3_5_2.html\n \n Resolution of the House of Burgesses in Virginia (1774) This resolution was inspired by similar resolutions made in the Puritan Revolution of 1641; the Burgesses resolved to commit their crisis to prayer and fasting.\n \n \"Resolutions of the House of Burgesses\n Designating a Day of Fasting and Prayer.\n Extracts from the Journal \n of the Proceeding of the House of Burgesses, of Virginia\n This House being deeply impressed with Apprehension of the great Dangers to be derived to British America, from the hostile Invasion of the City of Boston, in our Sister Colony of Massachusetts Bay, whose Commerce and Harbour are on the 1st Day of June next, to be stopped by an armed Force, deem it highly necessary that the said first Day of June be set apart by the Members of this House as a Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, devoutly to implore the divine Interposition for averting the heavy Calamity, which threatens Destruction to our civil Rights, and the Evils of civil War; to give us one Heart and one Mind firmly to oppose, by all just and proper Means, every Injury to American Rights, and that the Minds of his Majesty and his Parliament may be inspired from above with Wisdom, Moderation, and Justice, to remove from the loyal People of America all Cause of Danger from a continued Pursuit of Measures pregnant with their Ruin.\n Ordered, therefore, that the Members of this House do attend their Places at the Hour of ten in the Forenoon, on the said 1st Day of June next, in Order to proceed with the Speaker and the Mace to the Church [/b[in this City for the Purposes aforesaid; and that [b]the Reverend Mr. Price be appointed to read Prayers, and the Reverend Mr. Gwatkin to preach a Sermon suitable to the Occasion. \n Ordered, that this Order be forthwith printed and published. \n By the HOUSE of BURGESSES. \n GEORGE WYTHE, C.

Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our Christian kindness.

We are not yet in a fit state to make war.

'If anyone would go to law with thee and take thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well.'\" \n \n \"SHUT UP AND DRINK YOUR GINGER-BEER!\"\n \n Such is the disconnect we are faced with whenever claims are made that Christianity is the guiding light behind modern law. We read the recorded words in the New Testament and listen to the vapid sermons and then write the diabolical opposite into law, and call it Christian influence of the most beneficent kind. It won't do, IMO. :) \n \n Let us examine this so-called \"guiding light\" closer. \n \n The medieval legal system was an admixture of Roman, ecclesiastical and common law. The Inquisition began when Ecclesiastical law felt it possessed the dominating position and immediately went about flexing its muscle, until well into the 19th century. (Not that it's gone anywhere: \"As the need to combat Protestantism decreased, the Roman Inquisition turned into an ordinary judicial system of government for the Vatican. During a reorganization of administrative procedures in 1908 it was absorbed into the \"Holy Office\", in charge of questions related to purity of faith. In 1965 its role became part of the new Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\")\n http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/science+society/lectures/illustrations/lecture13/inquisition.html\n \n Here's a fine example of Christian legal minds at work, using the guiding light:\n \n \"So the notion of trial by ordeal arose. In theory, since God involves himself in the most petty aspects of human existence and since God would not let an innocent person suffer, God would ensure that the innocent passed the ordeal. The same logic would be used to underpin the legal trial by combat.\" \n http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/gage/inquis/law.html\n \n Trial by fire. Heretics on trial. Torture to extract confessions of heresy. Confiscation of property of those found guilty. An unholy alliance of church and state.\n http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0858833.html\n \n ... the accused, after having taken a solemn oath of his innocence, might be required to undergo any of a variety of ordeals to prove his innocence. Such ordeals included that of cold water, in which the defendant was bound hand and foot and thrown into a pool of water that had been previously blessed by a priest. On the belief that holy water would reject a liar who had foresworn a holy oath, it was believed that the guilty would float and the innocent would sink.\n http://historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&bookid=64&cid=10\n \n The Church could hold the patent on every imaginable torture device ever invented, if it so wished, and if truth be told. Racks to stretch the flesh to bursting, iron neck braces crowned with needle-sharp points to slowly suffocate, boiling pots, instruments designed with nothing more in mind than to inflict the most pain imaginable. And the old standby for those unwilling to see things properly, the burning stake. \n \n The western world had gone mad. To the extent the Church had now gained legal power, to that very extent it wielded it, not one molecule less. Well over a millennium after Jesus taught \"love thy neighbor\". The second millennium is hardly better, until the force of religion finally begins to sputters and true justice begins to be written in a different, new light, this one from the natural rights of man. This is the inescapable, ugly truth of Christianity's influence in law. It is indisputable and despicable. To think it is somehow only a matter of trying to smear its good name--running it through the mud, in your words---is absurd. \n \n Again, why, I ask, do you want this history drudged up? This isn't news to you I assume. Is it really necessary for me to link to more sites about the Salem witch trials, South Carolina's slave laws, American blasphemy laws still on the books (http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0807863.html), and thousands of other statutes which were written with the guiding light of Christianity? If I do, I smear the institution, according to you. If I don't, I'm not truly debating, merely \"supposing\". Kind of like the cold water ordeal: If innocent one drowns, if guilty one floats to the top for immediate punishment. \n \n I've concluded the subject of this thread is totally about proper perspective. I've got nearly two thousand years of unfathomably cruel Christian history to back my statements and contentions, and I can provide sites ad naseum to support it if you feel it is necessary. You know I can continue to supply them until one of us pukes. My position contains a true sense of proportion of Christian heritage in modern law. I say your position is lacking it, by your trotting out a snail, a bottle of ginger-beer, a guy in a powdered wig and some scraggly old bones. All, of course, JMO. :)",

   "Are we arguing this together with the Aitken case? Taken out of historical context, I guess if would be possible for you to make such an assumption.\n Here's some more statements to show context\n James Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1763)\n \"It is . . . true in fact and experience, as the great, the incomparable Harrington has most abundantly demonstrated in his Oceana and other divine writings, that empire follows the balance of property. 'Tis also certain that property in fact generally confers power, though the possessor of it may not have much more wit than a mole or a musquash: and this is too often the cause that riches are sought after without the least concern about the right application of them. But is the fault in the riches, or the general law of nature, or the unworthy possessor? It will never follow from all this that government is rightfully founded on property alone. What shall we say then? Is not government founded on grace? No. Nor on force? No. Nor on compact? Nor property? Not altogether on either. Has it any solid foundation, any chief cornerstone but what accident, chance, or confusion may lay one moment and destroy the next? I think it has an everlasting foundation in the unchangeable will of GOD, the author of nature, whose laws never vary. The same omniscient, omnipotent, infinitely good and gracious Creator of the universe who has been pleased to make it necessary that what we call matter should gravitate for the celestial bodies to roll round their axes, dance their orbits, and perform their various revolutions in that beautiful order and concern which we all admire has made it equally necessary that from Adam and Eve to these degenerate days the different sexes should sweetly attract each other, form societies of single families, of which larger bodies and communities are as naturally, mechanically, and necessarily combined as the dew of heaven and the soft distilling rain is collected by the all-enlivening heat of the sun. Government is therefore most evidently founded on the necessities of our nature. It is by no means an arbitrary thing depending merely on compact or human will for its existence. .\"\n ...\n \"...on order to form an idea of the natural rights of the colonists, I presume it will be granted that they are men, the common children of the same Creator with their brethren of Great Britain...\"\n ...\n http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/b...urces3_5_2.html\n \n Resolution of the House of Burgesses in Virginia (1774) This resolution was inspired by similar resolutions made in the Puritan Revolution of 1641; the Burgesses resolved to commit their crisis to prayer and fasting.\n \n \"Resolutions of the House of Burgesses\n Designating a Day of Fasting and Prayer.\n Extracts from the Journal \n of the Proceeding of the House of Burgesses, of Virginia\n This House being deeply impressed with Apprehension of the great Dangers to be derived to British America, from the hostile Invasion of the City of Boston, in our Sister Colony of Massachusetts Bay, whose Commerce and Harbour are on the 1st Day of June next, to be stopped by an armed Force, deem it highly necessary that the said first Day of June be set apart by the Members of this House as a Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, devoutly to implore the divine Interposition for averting the heavy Calamity, which threatens Destruction to our civil Rights, and the Evils of civil War; to give us one Heart and one Mind firmly to oppose, by all just and proper Means, every Injury to American Rights, and that the Minds of his Majesty and his Parliament may be inspired from above with Wisdom, Moderation, and Justice, to remove from the loyal People of America all Cause of Danger from a continued Pursuit of Measures pregnant with their Ruin.\n Ordered, therefore, that the Members of this House do attend their Places at the Hour of ten in the Forenoon, on the said 1st Day of June next, in Order to proceed with the Speaker and the Mace to the Church [/b[in this City for the Purposes aforesaid; and that [b]the Reverend Mr. Price be appointed to read Prayers, and the Reverend Mr. Gwatkin to preach a Sermon suitable to the Occasion. \n Ordered, that this Order be forthwith printed and published. \n By the HOUSE of BURGESSES. \n GEORGE WYTHE, C.

But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\"\n http://www.pointsouth.com/csanet/gr...enry/henry1.htm\n \n The Virginia Declaration of Rights (A document which Thomas Jefferson had in mind when writing the Declaration of Independence)\n June 12, 1776\n ...\n XVI \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\"\n http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/D/1776-...ence/virdor.htm\n (it's taken as read that people believe in God!)\n \n Even when Thomas Paine calls for religious tolerance, it's in a Christian context. Writing in Common Sense he states.\n \"As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all government, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our Christian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the same family, differing only, in what is called their Christian names.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/paine-common.html\n \n It's unbecoming to watch some one so caught up in their own ego that they believe that this allows for the posting of uninformed opinion to be deemed of equal value with a reasoned, researched debate.\n any church.

Indian communities crippled by epidemics and the growing New England power found in the colonists' offerings a \"Marshall Plan\" of \"moral rearmament, social reconstruction, and religious revitalization\" that saved them from complete dissolution. Second, personal prestige and authority was very important to the Indians. In this sense, the messenger--John Eliot--may have been as important as his message. \"\n \"'Changes in Latitude: Changes in Attitude': Indians and Puritans, 1640-1740\" by Daniel Mandell\n http://muweb.millersville.edu/~colu...oc/MANDELL1.SOC\n \n Even your allies were very Christian!\n \"These, and a hundred other seditious and revolutionary sayings, the ardent Frenchman repeated to Vergennes, the most energetic of the ministers of King Louis, and said in a formal letter: \"The Americans will triumph, but they must be assisted in their struggle; for if they succumb, they would join the English, turn round against us, and put our colonies in jeopardy. We are not yet in a fit state to make war. We must prepare ourselves, keep up the struggle, and with that view send secret assistance in a prudent manner to the Americans.\" This was the key-note to the boasted \"friendship\" of his \"Most Christian Majesty\" - the prime motive for the \"assistance\" rendered by the king of France to the Americans during the war of the Revolution.\n http://www.publicbookshelf.com/publ...anceame_ja.html\n \n Also, the Spanish king was titled \"His most Catholic Majesty\"\n \"Taking the British by total surprise, the tiny army from St. Louis was victorious. After this raid, St. Louis received much attention back in Spain, since the Spanish flag was raised above St. Joseph, proclaiming all the land below Lake Michigan belonging to \"His Most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain.\" Never again was St. Louis threatened by foreign attack and the valley of the Illinois river became claimed by Spain in 1783.\"\n http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/coun...ouis/attack.htm\n \n I suspect that the Dutch had some type of 'Protestant' title too.

   "First, let me make an observation; \n\n Another one?\n \nwhether it is true or not, that will at the very least allow me to put down in writing what I feel about your contributions on this thread. You will correct me if I&#8217;m wrong I&#8217;m sure.\n I feel as though you are simply rushing through this thread without bringing much thought or reflection to bear. I get the impression my responses are quickly chopped into bits and a few cursory remarks added, then you leave for the Evolution/Creation threads. Perhaps it&#8217;s understandable&#8212;it&#8217;s rather hot up there of late, which can translate to a lot of excitement and traffic. I admire the number of debates you can conduct at one time, but perhaps your heart really isn&#8217;t in this particular subject right now&#8212;also understandable-- seeing it was originally posted by you some four months ago, but for whatever reason I feel like my efforts to discuss this issue are being treated in a most dismissive and precipitant manner, with only half-engagement on your part. I guess I expected more.\n\n That's very funny Billsco. Let me make an observation. I posted a connected series of statements backed by evidence from experts in the field. You interject based on a lack of knowledge of law, but fuelled with a passionate disbelief in what I say, so to combat this you make opinionated statements devoid of fact. That you feel I am not responding with the attention you feel I should make to you adds to my sense of the arrogance you possess, as you believe your opinion is equal in weight to a body of legal professionals whom I have cited; including from law societies, and my first year law books. \n I'm sorry to have taken you away from otherwise pressing engagements :)\n \n\"Let all the laws be clear, uniform and precise. To interpret laws is almost always to corrupt them.\" Voltaire.\n\n \nWhat non-sequitur is this? What has it to do with the case at hand? Where is it believed that Voltaire was worthy to comment on law?\n And anyway...\n All law must be interpreted for it to be effective, or better, to be put into effect. Do you have 'judges' where you come from? \n\n \nThe point was to provide a quote that good law is simple and straight-forward, not contradictory as in &#8220;Love thy neighbour&#8221; but &#8220;sue him for every last dime&#8221; mentality implicit in tort of negligence, which should be obvious to anyone formulating a point of law. It does not follow. The two statements are sworn enemies. That you bristle at Voltaire shouldn&#8217;t have kept you from seeing the disconnectedness.\n\n Again, you must be kidding. So your insertion of this generalised statement of law by a cultural satirist equates to evidence for you that there is no Christian influence in law?\n You make a continual leap of logic which it is hard pressing to follow... the connections between statements are so far missing.\n \"Love thy neighbour\" is indeed something Jesus said.\n \"sue him for every last dime\" (??) what's this got to do with anything? That there is a law to protect consumer interests, and that this might be sometimes abused does neither\n a) negate that the law was established on Christian principles\n or\n b) mean anything to this debate. Lots of laws are abused. Should we then criticise the law for 'murder' because some innocent people are sometimes wrongfully convicted - where is your point?\n \n&#8230;Jesus has already made it clear what Christians are to do. &#8216;If anyone would go to law with thee and take thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well. \n\n \n Yes, often people like yourself do make such disconnected statements. So, even a whole body of lawyers, legal professionals, who acknowledge the links, means naught, IYO (in your opinion). I'm certainly glad you don't claim it to be a 'humble' one, oh great one. \n\n \nPlease explain this disconnect. Why ignore the teaching of Jesus in crafting a court decision while claiming to draw on the teaching of Jesus? \n\n I don't.\n Lord Aitken did not draw upon every single idea of Jesus' in making his decision. It was not my desire to state that. I showed quite clearly a teaching of Jesus and its application, most importantly, acknowledged by all my sources, and equally importantly those sources are continually ignored by you based on YO (your opinion) of how you wish things to be.\n Example of other teachings...\n Jesus said things about the Sabbath. They didn't, as far as Lord Aitken was concerned, have any bearing on the case at hand, so he didn't cite them. You do cite other teachings for what purpose?\n \n I&#8217;ve got nearly two thousand years of unfathomably cruel Christian history to back my statements and contention&#8230; \n\n \n No, you've made no contention about the case at hand. You've listed a whole lot of citations that have nothing to do with Lord Aitken's ruling. What you could do is state that there are negative Christian influences in society, but this doesn't\n a) negate the idea of the thread; that there are influences, per se\n or\n b) negate anything about the connection I've demonstrated with regards to Lord Aitkin, in which, despite copious amounts of references from legal experts, and commentators on law, you just feel uncomfortable with, so continue to post an opinion that you just don't want to believe it. \n\n \nHere&#8217;s where I really begin to feel like the neglected housewife.\n\n Another strange statement, but, let's just plough on.\n \nThe name of this thread is what?\n\n We know what it is.\n \nI have stated that Christianity has had a negative impact on the formation of modern law, especially in the U.S. and I consequently supplied some history to support my statement.\n\n Doesn't negate the actual example at hand.\n Doesn't negate that there has been influence per se.\n Your citations however are just a bunch of citations of things that happened in the Middle Ages, and the Salem witch trials - which one must ask\n a) are these trials precedents for US law makers?\n b) directly related to the Inquisition (which was a Catholic creation; whereas the Salemites were Protestant; thus where's the connection?)\n In other words you list some incidents in the middle ages and an example of something in colonial America which is not practiced since the 1600s, and only in that locale.\n It is akin to putting an argument along the lines of\n i) In the middle ages some people practiced witchcraft.\n ii) They also did so in colonial America.\n iii) Therefore there's an influence of witchcraft in mainstream America.\n \n That history includes laws regarding blasphemy and heresy, slavery laws, blue laws, etc., then offered my opinion that, in the balance, Christianity&#8217;s influence in law, both historically and in modern-day, has been infamous.\n Your response? &#8220;It&#8217;s not about the Aitken case.&#8221; \n\n Indeed. This generalised statement is indeed true... that there have been laws on blasphemy etc. True you now come close to showing an influence on America, but your interpretation of it being 'negative' rests solely on your say so. How does this\n a) negate the question of influence per se\n or\n b) negate the case I made regarding Lord Aitken?\n Which argument do you want to make this time?\n \nThis thread has never been exclusively about Aitken, and I&#8217;m wondering why you are attempting to put such a constriction on it now.\n\n Not at all. But you have specifically fought against the idea of influence, by specifically debunking Lord Aitken, and then introducing a generalised statement that shows the opposite; that there has been influence, albeit negative. Therefore I would prefer you to stick to an argument; do you argue that there's been no influence, or some? Or, do you think that Lord Aitken's ruling doesn't show Christian influence? It would help you to stick to an argument.\n \nI have an opinion ( ) as to why you would attempt to squeeze me into such a narrow tunnel and I will offer my opinion forthwith, because this forum, as I have come to believe (another opinion) is not only a proper place, but a great one, to offer opinions. My opinion is this: I believe you can see the train wreck up ahead, the smouldering, mangled wreck and ruin of Christianity&#8217;s legal influence in countless people&#8217;s lives, and you want to switch tracks. \n\n So you do believe there's a Christian influence. I do too.\n If you want to have a generalised debate about Christian influence, I will meet your argument as you make it.\n \n&#8230;and I can provide sites ad naseum to support it if you feel it is necessary. You know I can continue to supply them until one of us pukes.\n\n \n That's what you've posted\n\n \nI&#8217;m happy to hear you&#8217;re puking. I mean, sorry to hear you&#8217;re puking, but happy that you&#8217;ve realized the extent of the tragedy of Christianity&#8217;s influence in law. \n\n I'm not puking. I suggested what you post is. It's a wave of hate against Christianity that's come so fast that you seem to be arguing against influence on one hand, then negating it on the other. Even with Lord Aiken's decision, you try everything at once; that it's lead to negative lawsuits, but still you deny the Christian influence, which would suggest that you believe it's negative, but not influence by Christ's teachings; so how this fits into anything you're trying to prove is a mystery. It would help if you take a few breaths, collect your thoughts, make a connected series of statements and avoid interjections of strange statements about housewives.\n \nMy position contains a true sense of proportion of Christian heritage in modern law. I say your position is lacking it, by your trotting out a snail, a bottle of ginger-beer, a guy in a powdered wig and some scraggly old bones. All, of course, JMO.\n\n \n Then you do concede that Christian influences continue in law? Thanks for coming over to my side on this one, though I disagree with how you came to the conclusion, I am glad you've change your mind on this. \n\n \nI truly believe you&#8217;re disengaged and distracted from this subject.\n\n I'm sure you do. How does this answer the fact you're arguments all over the place...\n Lord Aitken wasn't influenced by Christ BUT Lord Aitken's ruling has lead to a plethora of spurious legal suits.\n There's no Christian influence BUT there is, only negative, but that it's been negated, in which case its NOT an influence.\n \n There can be no disputing that now. I can only lead you back to my original post #7 where I stated the obvious, our common ground, but I can&#8217;t make you take it in if you&#8217;re unwilling. I&#8217;ve tried to set the table, prepare a good repast, but you brush it all aside and hurry off to greener pastures, perhaps to see someone else like Mach the Magnificent. Sniff. \n\n Very poetic, but it still doesn't pull you from the mess you're making. It is, however the most entertaining statement you've made so far.\n \n Where in, by the way, did you get the feeling that your opinion is so great? It's just that I'm curious to know why you obviously feel it holds more weight than people who actually have studied law&#8230; \n\n \nThis is in your opinion, right?\n\n Based on your retorts of Lord Aitken, yes, it's a learned opinion - based on evidence; the lack of from your side -v- the strong case of my side.\n \nYou want me to respond to your opinion that my opinion is weightier than your opinion or other people&#8217;s opinions, in my opinion?\n\n Sure. They have studied law. What makes an unlearned opinion of an individual equal to that of several citations from people who are learned? What makes your non-sequitur and opinion equally valid to their clear and concise statements of learned opinion?\n \nEspecially when I&#8217;ve never implied any such thing about my opinion?\n\n Yes, you have. By disputing learned opinion with unlearned opinion; without resorting to research and evidence on Lord Aitken's ruling\n \n I&#8217;m not happy about the neglected housewife role, so don&#8217;t begin battering me besides.\n\n Still an odd phrase that seems to be unconnected with anything.\n \nI have made these claims, which remains unexamined by you:\n The Aitken case is contradictory in its Christian construction and plays no great role in the whole consideration of the case. \n\n Yes, that is your opinion. Learned people I've cited disagree with you. You see no reason to contend with this distortion of evidence.\n \nChristianity has had a much more negative effect, than a positive one, in modern law, particularly American law.\n\n You've stated a number of laws, you've yet to show fully how they are 'negative'. For instance, why is the law of blasphemy negative?\n \nThe examples you have provided are the equivalent of peeing one&#8217;s pants every time God is mentioned. They are examples are bones being thrown to a religious majority.\n\n Yes, again you come up with some interesting phrasing. I expect you to make no citation to evidence in rebutting my contentions re: Aitken.",

Mrs Donoghue drank part of a bottle of ginger beer bought for her by a friend when they were taking refreshments in a cafe in Paisley\"\n http://www.iuscivile.com/materials/reprints/ej-1.htm#titre10\n Lord Atkin's statement about the foreseeability of the effects of one's acts on one's neighbours is central to the existence of a duty of care in the law of torts, especially on the then developing nascent tort of negligence. In this judgement he formulates what is commonly known as the \"neighbour principle\".\n http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/d/do/donoghue_v__stevenson.html\n also at\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donoghue_v._Stevenson\n It is easy to do this, because it is taught to first year law students the world over.

Your whole effort is based on an irrational tirade against Christianity, underscored by a patent wish to ignore any evidence that goes against your own a priori beliefs. Thus I welcome your continual challenges as they go to undermine your cause immensely. What you could have done is researched the development of tort of negligence in the USA and tried to suggest that this was the only way such law was developed. But you haven't even attempted a rational debate, just a rather odd dismissal of major pieces of evidence on a 'gut-feeling'. :)\n And, as stated before you were trying to argue that there was an influence, but negative. Now you're arguing that in this case there is no influence. You know it is said that a goldfish has a memory of only 15seconds!",

Not one! \n \n I have said all along that I am willing to accept the influence this case has had in legal circles, despite your attempts to try to make it look as though I'm not.

To date, all you've provided is that another person seemed to vaguely recall that Atkin's daughter wrote a letter some time in the distant past mentioning something about a conversation the Atkin's family had once in regard to the case. It is extremely unreliable third-party gossip at best, years removed. And hardly the trail I was expecting you to blaze for us.\n \n I have sought to throw light on how disconnected the idea of tort of negligence is to Jesus' teachings.

   "\"The modern law of negligence was established in the famous English case of Donoghue v Stevenson, in which Mrs Donoghue discovered the decomposed remains of a snail in her bottle of ginger beer, most unfortunately after she had consumed the greater part of its contents. Suffering from shock and gastroenteritis, she sued Mr Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer.\n In what is arguably the 20th century&#8217;s most influential judicial decision to affect the lives of ordinary citizens, the biblical precept to love thy neighbour became in law &#8212; you must not injure your neighbour. Your neighbour is anyone you can reasonably foresee might be injured by your careless actions.\"\n http://www.choice.com.au/viewarticleasonepage.aspx?id=104324&catId=100528&tid=100008&p=1\n 'On May 26, 1932, Lord Atkin rose at last, amid the splendour of the great chamber of the House of Lords, to deliver his immortal speech in Donoghue v. Stevenson.16\n Lord Atkin reminded the House of the words of Lord Esher in Le Lievre v. Gould:17 &#8220;If one man is near to another, or near to the property of another, a duty lies on him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.&#8221; Using the thoughts he had expressed the previous autumn at King&#8217;s College, Lord Atkin then melded Lord Esher&#8217;s dictum with the parable of the good Samaritan. Neighbourhood was a mental rather than a physical state. It would be enough to impose on David Stevenson a duty of care such that those in the position of May Donoghue ought to have been in his mind when he was bottling the ginger beer. She was his neighbour in spirit.\"\n http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/keycases/dvs/mrs-donoghue-journey.html\n \"In Donoghue v. Stevenson, Lord Atkin said: \n \"To seek a complete logical definition of the general principle is probably to go beyond the function of the judge, for the more general the definition, the more likely it is to omit essentials or to introduce non-essentials.\" \n The moral which I draw from these words is that simplism combines fatally with generalization in two ways: it so extends the general as to take insufficient account of the peculiar requirements of the particular; and it takes the particular as in every respect an exemplar of the general. That, in his paraphrase of the parable of the Good Samaritan, Lord Atkin himself exceeded his function is, in my respectful submission, implicit in the speech of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Lupton v. F.A. & A.B. Ltd, where he refers to the distinction drawn in Farr v. Butters Bros & Co.\"\n http://www.ucc.ie/law/restitution/rdg/9912007.htm\n \"House of Commons Session 1997-98 Publications on the internet\n Standing Committee Debates National Minimum Wage Bill\n ...\n I must not digress into tales of Lord Chancellors, except to say that I think that Lord Atkin presided in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson. He cited the parable of the good Samaritan in his rationale, by way of explaining what one's duty ought to be from first principle.\"\n http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm199798/cmstand/d/st980210/pm/80210s01.htm\n \" have drawn the well-known distinction between the public and the private in terms of direct equality. I believe this way of drawing the distinction brings out the special qualities of the neighbour principle in tort first formulated by Lord Atkin in 1932 in Donoghue v. Stevenson. We have duties to others in the sense that we must not omit to treat them as our equal. That there are such circumstances is clearly explained by the intuitive trust we have in the parable of the Good Samaritan in which passers-by omitted wrongly to assist the sick person in the ditch. The neighbour principle makes use of this distinction because it rests fundamentally on the idea that the test of who is your neighbour is not the person whom you actually thought would be affected by your act. It is, instead, the person whom you ought reasonably have contemplated. So, when the duty is breached, liability is imposed for your omission to act properly.\"\n http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctlsfd/papers/freedom.html\n \"Stepping on brake pedal\n General principle that there is no duty to rescue another who is in peril or injured, although there is a clear moral duty (the Good Samaritan) - see Horsley v. Maclaren per Lacourciere and Jessup. \n Authority: \n Horsely v. MacLaren (1972)\n Lacourciere: law leaves remedy to person's conscious\n Jessup: DvS ratio has not yet been extended (this has caused heartburn among the academics as neighbour test of L. Atkin includes errors and omissions)\n http://outlines.law.uvic.ca/courses/torts/torts_9900_outline_carolanne.htm\n &#8216;But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?\n And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\n And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.\n And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.\n But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,\n And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\n And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\n Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among thieves?\n And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.&#8217; (Luke, 10:29-37)1\n From a private law point of view, the parable of the Good Samaritan raises two questions:\n 1) Do we have a legal duty to give aid to our fellow human beings? In particular: can we be held liable for damages if we fail to do so? This question falls mainly in the area of tort-law.\n 2) If we do come to the rescue, like the Samaritan did, will we have any claim for the expenses that we incurred in doing so? Such claims could arise in tort, in unjust enrichment or in \"negotiorum gestio\".\n This thesis will only deal with the first question: do we have a duty to give aid to our fellow human beings? Lord Atkin's speech in Donoghue v Stevenson2 gives reason to believe that the answer is affirmative under English law:\n The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; (...) Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\"\n http://ouclf.iuscomp.org/articles/kortmann.shtml\n \"Good Samaritan Law/Unterlassene Hilfeleistung\n The latest programme in the BBC radio series &#8216;Law in Action&#8217; can be heard here till the next programme on Friday June 11th) has a section on whether Britain should have what is called a Good Samaritan law or good citizen law.\n It&#8217;s difficult to draft such a law. One of the questions is &#8216;Who is the passer-by?&#8217; The good Samaritan story has been called on before, in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson in the early 1930s, extending the law of tort, when Lord Atkin (&#8216;the Denning of his day&#8217; passes through my mind) asked, &#8216;Who, then, in law is my neighbour?

Or that it only influenced someone in Singapore (which itself straw-man as pointed out above)\n You claim that I've not shown a link, but I have, including a law journal, which twice, for some mysterious reason, you've forgotten to refute. The other retutations are that the sites are religious. That alone seems to you a reason to dispute the veracity of their statements (instead it shows anti-religious bias)\n You challenge me to cite links between Atkin and Christ's teaching, and when I do, you claim I've veered away from my other argument! How bizarre! Still, when you want to give an anti-Christian rant, you've a right to do so.",

Sure enough, the second link:\n http://www.scottishlawreports.org.u...ue-journey.html\n Quote:\n &#8230;sixteen pages further on, Lord Atkin stated the principle on which his judgement rested &#8212; the ratio decidendi of May Donoghue&#8217;s case:23\n [A] manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer&#8217;s life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.\n It is for this simple statement of the law, the &#8220;products liability principle&#8221; let us call it &#8212; and for that alone, as its author was at pains to emphasize &#8212; that Lord Atkin&#8217;s decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson actually stands. \n\n Often people comment on things they don't understand; and your post is evidence of that. Your lack of knowledge on the meaning of \"ratio decidendi\" leads to a very silly post. Instead of just asking what it meant, which would have saved you any embarrassment, you've decided to give an opinion based on what you'd like to think; coloured by your refusal to accept evidence that flies in the face of your own irrational hatred of Christianity\n ratio decidendi*\n This is the core legal reason which, when applied to the facts found, turns the decision on way rather than the other.\n http://www.swarb.co.uk/lawb/genLegalLatin.shtml\n To put it in context. Lord Atkin using the Good Samaritan as a guide for the application of the law of liability. The ruling on liability is the ration decidendi, and it is rested in law that no product should harm a person. However the application of who is that 'other', in this case a 'neighbour' is crucial to interpretation of the law; hence Lord Buckmeister, quoting Common Law said that the only two times that this application COULD BE MADE were already stated; (and I quoted in post #5, which again seems to be something you continually miss)\n Lord Buckmesiter said \"Now the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance...There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food apart from that implied by contract or imposed by statute.\"\n AND the two applications IN LAW were\n There were two legislated exceptions...\n a) when the product was of its nature dangerous (e.g. TNT)\n b) when the article is dangerous to the knowledge of the manufacturer.\n That is, as far as he was concerned, the application of liability, his ratio decidendi finished at this point, because the law stated where the law should be applied. So, had it been Lord Buckmesiter's ruling we'd have followed, then the ratio decidendi of the case would be along the lines of \"a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer&#8217;s life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care, as under the laws already in existence.\" He would not have applied 'liability' in this case. And his ruling in law would have been based in law!\n If you lack the honesty to admit you don't understand these terms then you continually show yourself to be a very biased poster; determined to refuse to acknowledge the Christian INFLUENCE despite the fact now that I've posted more than a dozen sites that acknowledge this. It is amazing that you would lay this down for the world to see; advertising just how unreasonable a debater you are; refusing to acknowledge evidence, making assumptions based on misunderstanding, all because of an anti-Christian bias.\n It shows you completely missed the point of the quote I made, which I will repeat...\n \"Lord Atkin reminded the House of the words of Lord Esher in Le Lievre v. Gould:17 &#8220;If one man is near to another, or near to the property of another, a duty lies on him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.&#8221; Using the thoughts he had expressed the previous autumn at King&#8217;s College, Lord Atkin then melded Lord Esher&#8217;s dictum with the parable of the good Samaritan. Neighbourhood was a mental rather than a physical state. It would be enough to impose on David Stevenson a duty of care such that those in the position of May Donoghue ought to have been in his mind when he was bottling the ginger beer. She was his neighbour in spirit.\"\n http://www.scottishlawreports.org.u...ue-journey.html\n The reason in law which you quote is clear and refers to the product of one person harming another; this is liability. HOWEVER, how do we apply that law? Lord Atkin used the parable of the Good Samaritan as a guide. It influenced him to apply a law to a circumstance that was not at that point covered by law. This is the product of judge-interpreted law; a system we both live in (assuming you live in the USA outside Louisiana). When a case comes up not covered by law (except Lord Buckmeister would have claimed that it already was)* a judge may apply a law (in this case the dictum of protection). That Lord Atkin did, was based on his understanding of the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\n *Lord Buckmeister wanted to say in effect \"This isn't covered by either two cases, therefore I see no reason to make a novel application of the law to the circumstance\"\n But despite your complete lack of knowledge on the area, you make pronouncements on your own understanding of the law DESPITE the fact I've now posted over a dozen citations from legal bodies et al that all recognise that Lord Atkin's application of the law was revolutionary! It is because Lord Atkin was influenced by Christ's more general idea of 'neighbour' that Lord Atkin applied the law of liability in this case in a circumstance where the applicant would, under existing rulings, have had no success. In fact she had failed in lower courts... because those judges had made strict applications of the law of liability as covered in the two circumstances stated in post #5. It is fortunate that she gained an appeal to a court where someone was willing to use Christ's teachings in order to apply the law of liability to her case! Here is a free law lesson for you. It is near crazy that you'd continue with a line of reasoning so readily refuted by all the law sources that I've quoted that recognise that Lord Atkin's ruling, based on his application of the law, in a circumstance that was both revolutionary, and couched in the terms of Christ's teaching.\n Another key to understanding this is also mentioned in my quote...a reference to a judgment made by Lord Esher.\n Lord Buckmesiter states...\n In this case Lord Esher seems to have qualified to some extent what he said in Heaven v. Pender (11 Q. B. D. 503, 509.), for he says this: \"But can the plaintiffs rely upon negligence in the absence of fraud?\n The question of liability for negligence cannot arise at all until it is established that the man who has been negligent owed some duty to the person who seeks to make him liable for his negligence. What duty is there when there is no relation between the parties by contract?\n http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm\n Lord Atkin states...\n \"I think the judgment of Lord Esher expresses the law of England\"\n http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm\n In other words, both judges refer to a ruling in law made by the same, previous judgment of Lord Escher. Lord Buckmeister would have applied that judgement as guided by what influenced him. Lord Atkin was influenced by Christ to make a different interpretation.\n This is another thing you just happened to miss. :) But, then again you believe your opinion, based on an irrational hate of Christianity, is equal to these bits of evidence. You would have done far better, and would have lost no credibility had you concentrated on the other part of my argument; the formation of the USA, in which there are far more experts that agree with you (far more, because none agree with you in this case) :)\n \n If you wanted to ask a question, feel free to, but understand that a question is different from a prouncement.\n \n \n *Ratio decidendi Lat - reason for deciding.

I looked it up in preparation of my last post. All one needed to do was read the bold words to understand the passage I quoted.\n\n What you are doing is ignoring not only what it means, but that the very site states the link explicitly. You would have to wonder why, if you were correct, it should do so, only to seemingly refute itself, and the common knowledge of the law fraternity (who are taught this in 1st year, and hence the abundance of other sites that also acknowledge the link). That you've not even considered this is hilarious.\n It is illogical. If you accept the site as authoritative, then your failure to recognise the following statement is - well, odd.\n 'On May 26, 1932, Lord Atkin rose at last, amid the splendour of the great chamber of the House of Lords, to deliver his immortal speech in Donoghue v. Stevenson.16\n Lord Atkin reminded the House of the words of Lord Esher in Le Lievre v. Gould:17 &#8220;If one man is near to another, or near to the property of another, a duty lies on him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.&#8221; Using the thoughts he had expressed the previous autumn at King&#8217;s College, Lord Atkin then melded Lord Esher&#8217;s dictum with the parable of the good Samaritan.

She was his neighbour in spirit.\"\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=74953#post74953\n It is a decision in law as the site later says, which you quote. For you to reconcile your novel law theory with the statement (just posted) you would need to ask why Lord Atkin made a decision in law, and Lord Buckmeister wouldn't have made the same decision; in fact he argued against it, when both men are judging the same case, seems to not only have slipped past you, but so has the fact that every one of my posts also recognise the link. :) Lord Buckmeister's decision in law would have been to dismiss the case. Maybe you've forgotten/not read that Lord Buckmeister et al was also sitting on the case.\n \n &#8220;It is for this simple statement of the law, the &#8220;products liability principle&#8221; let us call it &#8212; and for that alone, as its author was at pains to emphasize &#8212; that Lord Atkin&#8217;s decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson actually stands.&#8221;\n Translation: No Christian influence.\n\n As I suggested, you don't know what it means. The legal stance is to do with liability. Lord Buckmeister would not have applied protection in this case; that is his summary. Lord Atkin did... based on his understanding of the parable of the Good Samaritan. To call your appraisal considered, or even honest would do an injustice to both words. You really are a hoot that you'd even re-post this nonsense, even after I've explained it. And, of course, it didn't even occur to you to wonder why the same site, and all the others I posted recognise the link. Could it really be that Billsco is wrong?

He was making a decision in law; the application of his decision was influenced by Christian teaching. You've merely re-stated a third time something that is out of the context of the case.

Hey, I note you take several days to reply, why not come up with some 'evidence'? You missed that these 'universal precepts (if you're referring to a case of doing no harm), would not have won the case, had Lord Buckmeister been with the majority. This major thing undermines your case.\n There were five law lords. Two of which argued against the application of broad principles, based solely on their interpretation of existing laws. They would not have applied the 'universal precepts to this case. Case dismissed. Lord Atkin, speaking for the majority did apply the law of 'damages' to this case based on his reading of Christ's teachings.\n The more you keep missing this, the funnier your response becomes!\n \nCan anything be plainer than that? No, a melodramatic video for sale which recasts the story in some director's maudlin vision won't do. The apologetics page only reminds us of how out of touch and crass religion is to all of this. Non-working links, links which have absolutely nothing to do with this subject, and sites which contradict your assertions complete your case.

Hate often over-rides common sense; hence you close your eyes to dozens of citations from the legal world that just, quite inconveniently perhaps, disagree with you. Which is why you attempt dishonest straw-man in reducting ALL of my evidence, to just two particular pieces (one of which you actually agree with!) :) Sorry, I have to suppress a laugh. I pass your comments on to work-colleagues of mine. A paralegal at work whom I spoke to on this got a chortle. as I have pointed out, it's 1st year law stuff. There's a feeling here in Australia with regards Americans having an opinion on anything and everything. In that sense, you fit the stereotype, which is unfortunate... you've made no effort to break this notion by actually coming up with a rational argument.\n \n Note, your questions will continue to get 'brushed-aside' while you continue dishonest straw-man argument, even when it's highly amusing; attacking a source you've already stated you agree with! Whilst you continue with this, so I shall continue to respond to it. If you had any sense of honesty you'd have left it to rest after finding out you were wrong.

However I was able to search for a contained phrase.\n \n &#8220;The closest that the common law has come to providing a general remedy in respect of injurious conduct is the modern law of negligence with its hypothetical \"neighbour\" and associated test of \"reasonable foreseeability\". The common law duty to a \"neighbour\" has, however, scant in common with its New Testament equivalent; both priest and Levite ensured performance of any common law duty of care to the stricken traveller when, by crossing to the other side of the road, they avoided any risk of throwing up dust in his wounds ... .

The significance of the requirement contained in the words \"so closely and directly affected ... that\" is that they constitute a control upon the test of reasonable foreseeability of injury.&#8221;\n \n The priest and the Levite passed the test set out by Lord Atkin!\n\n What an amazing piece of illogical posting. Do you actually get pride in saying \"Hey everyone, look how little I understand\"? I will try once more, but it's very difficult, as you seem so set on ignoring proof.\n \n \n\n quote from...\n http://ouclf.iuscomp.org/articles/kortmann.shtml\n \"It has been confirmed in later judgments that English law does not in principle recognise an affirmative duty to act, and thus in general does not require us to give aid to our neigbours [sic] in need.\"\n claim...\n There goes all your influence right out the window.\n\n In English law up till this case in law, someone like Donoghue would have lost the case, because in English law, the idea of duty to care would not have applied in the circumstance presented to the court.\n Lord Atkin reading the teachings of Christ decided to apply a law to this case.\n hence\n \"As explained by Lord Atkin, the components of an action in negligence in such a case are a duty of care, determined by reference to the related tests of reasonable foreseeability and proximity, breach of that duty of care and damage.\"\n http://www.canberra.edu.au/uc/lectures/mantech/law/sem981/unit0765/lecture15may.html\n \n He applied a test 'of law' influenced by the Parable of the Good Samaritan. This is influence. The fact that the parable itself differs 'in law' from modern law is highly superfluous. And you simply have made this mistake several times now. No one contends that Lord Atkin picked up the Bible and said \"The Bible says this... therefore this (the Bible) is the law\". However his application 'of law' to this case was 'in law' sound, (which is what your quotes say). However the very reason he applied this ruling in this case was because of the Bible influence. I stated this right at the beginning but you either don't understand the difference, or worse.\n \n In law, someone argued...\n \"However, in Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd4 Lord Diplock criticized Lord Atkin's test in Donoghue. In the view of Lord Diplock omissions give rise to no legal liability:\"\n http://ouclf.iuscomp.org/articles/kortmann.shtml\n That is, he argued that the application of the idea of duty; this ruling in Donoghue -v- Stevenosn should not have happened in this case. But it did. And it was applied in this case because of Lord Atkin because of the influence of the Bible upon him.\n \n Look at it this way. You go to court\n case Billsco -v- Montalban. You are wishing to seek damages because of a poisonous substance in a bottle of drink that you bought from a tavern, that had bought it from me, the maker and bottler of the drink. Lord Buckmeister is judging alone instead of on a bench with four others. You say \"My Lord, this drink injured me, and it was caused by faulty manufacturing\".\n Lord Buckmeister, being a strict literalist would say \"Although in law their is an idea of 'negligence' I can not apply it to this case because under existing laws your circumstances are not covered\" Case dismissed. He made his ruling 'in law', and that is the reason he did so is influenced by his stance of being a legal conservative. He is influenced by his belief that the law should be literally adhered to. Thus it shows the application 'in law' of his ruling, and the influence 'on law' on him specifically, in when to apply his ruling.\n However, your case goes on appeal before five law lords, including Lord Buckmeister, and now including Lord Atkin.\n Lord Buckmeister continues to defend a literal interpretation of the law. So does another judge. However, Lord Atkin and two of his colleagues are more liberal minded, and might perhaps apply a more general principle. But why should they? Lord Atkin goes home at night and he reads the Good Samaritan; he is moved by the idea of 'love thy neighbour'. Does he believe this Bible is a law book? No. Does it give him moral guidance? Yes! He returns to court and persuades two other law lords to back him (as it is Lord Atkin who makes the statement for the majority). He says something along the lines of \"The law of negligence was not meant to be so strictly defined. I believe that it is meant to protect one's neighbour. Who 'in law' is my neighbour? It is anyone with whom I might foreseeably harm. I rule that in this case the manufacturer, Montalban could reasonably foresee harm upon Billsco. The law of negligence should be applied to protect a 'legal' neighbour. I apply the protection of negligence in this case.\n \n The case ends, with you winning, because Lord Atkin applied the law as influenced by his reading of the Good Samaritan. Does this mean he believed that I should be stoned or crucified? Not at all, because those laws have passed. He is not reading the Bible as a guide 'in law', but 'of law'. He clearly was influenced in applying a legal ruling in this case. The influence is so clear, that it enters into first year law books, law sites, consumer sites etc... His application of the law in this case is revolutionary, because up till then people have been like Lord Buckmeister; strict literalists. Lord Atkin's decision to apply the principle of negligence was clearly monumental, and was influenced by his reading of Christ's teachings. My quotes have stated this over and over again. All you do is ignore that influence, and look at the actual legal decision which is something I'm not arguing with exactly as you think, or you think. His decision in law was right 'in law'; if it wasn't then no matter how influenced by the Bible he was/or wasn't it'd been unlawful. His application of a legal principle to this case was lawful, you seem to think that this alone is the coup de grace to my thread; unfortunately it shows a monumental misunderstanding of the thread; for it does not address the part about the influence to apply a ruling in this case; which clearly was based on the Bible. Thus it constitutes a continuance of Christian influence in law.\n \n \n Otherwise, quit while your behind.\n \n Further to that, you've still got to address the claim you made in post #10 and #13 where you believe that some other religion might well have influenced modern western law formation, where you haven't connected your statements about other religions to actual examples of influence.\n \n Then we can get on to debate about the 'formation of the United States' part of this thread. This should be harder for me, admittedly, because if you fail to understand what is in fact an open and shut case, heaven help us when we get on to more recognisably contentious issues. I put this case forward, by the way, because it is so clear cut. As stated, it's taught in 1st year law about the importance of the case on law formation, on the idea of the 'neighbour principle' (aka \"Good Samaritan\") and the influence of Christianity upon Lord Atkin. But anyway, your posts are highly valued around the office.",

Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.\n --Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper (Feb.10, 1814)\n\n He was wrong on a technicality about 'common law'. You need to know a bit of history, so I hope you'll read on.\n \n The various Germanic tribes that formed nascent kingdoms in what we now call England brought their tribal laws with them. By the time of the Norman Conquest of 1066 the Germanic areas had all become Christian; the late Anglo-Saxon kings were devout followers of the church; Alfred the Great's father took him on a pilgrimage to Rome, and later, as king himself he ordered oaths taken on Christian relics (http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/KingAlfred/part1.html), built churches etc. These times and even produced saints such as the king; Edward the Confessor (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05322a.htm). However the various regions of a now united England kept their laws; modified as they were over time; and that influence of Christianity.\n \n When the Norman kings began to codify and standardise the law (they were big on administration), they commissioned people to go out and record the laws of the various localities. These people returned and they discussed what laws were in common amongst the various regions.\n \n Those laws that were common, were kept. That is the origins of common law. It was codified by Henry II, and it is the 'common law'; the laws held in common.\n \n Some laws, you can say, this originated in the year 'x', but although it has such pedigree, the actual 'common law' was not in being until Henry II. Prior to this, it would be more accurate to call it customary law, and prior to that 'tribal' law. Thus by the time the common law came into being, under Henry II, it had already been influenced by Christianity for five hundred years.\n \n Henry II who codified the common law has his constitution of Clrendon state:\n \n &#8220;The declaration of the above-mentioned royal customs and dignities has been made by the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, and the nobler and older men of the kingdom, at Clarendon on the fourth day before the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, lord Henry being present there with the lord king his father. There are, indeed, many other great customs and dignities of holy mother church and of the lord king and barons of the kingdom, which are not included in this writing, but which are to be preserved to holy church and to the lord king and his heirs and the barons of the kingdom, and are to be kept inviolate for ever.&#8221;\n \n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cclarendon.html\n \n \n \n Thus\n \n &#8220;Justice Joseph Story and Chancellor James Kent were among many sitting judges during the nineteenth century who cited the maxim that &#8220;Christianity is part of the common law.&#8221; As early as 1764, Thomas Jefferson attributed the phrase to a misinterpretation made by Sir Henry Finch in 1613 that had subsequently been perpetuated by Matthew Hale and William Blackstone. But Justice Story disputed Jefferson's contention that it was a &#8220;judicial forgery&#8221; and quoted the opinion of Chief Justice Prisot of the Court of Common Pleas, which established the precedent in 1458: \n As to those laws, which those of holy church have in ancient scripture, it behooves us to give them credence, for this is common law, upon which all manner of laws are founded; and thus, sir, we are obliged to take notice of their law of holy church; and it seems they are obliged to take notice of our law&#8221;*\n \n http://www.reformed.org/webfiles/antithesis/v2n2/ant_v2n2_law.html",

It is because Lord Atkin changed the application of the law that this case is so monumental. Why he did it, is what we're arguing. So far you've offered two posts of quotes stating that he did change it; as if this refutes anything I've said; that Lord Atkin applied the law in a revolutionary way. However, you quoting other bits of the Bible is again a failure to grasp the facts of this case.\n It doesn't matter about the totality of verses in the Bible, and that Lord Atkin didn't apply. It is superfluous. It is the fact that he did apply some teaching that is important. I have argued that Christ's teachings have influenced the law, and Lord Atkin applies one of these teachings in deciding a case. End of story, one would think, but you remain adamant that a series of arguments not connected to the issue at hand will do something; hence.\n \nTo argue for a precedent where lawsuits can begin to flow like water through the floodgates?

Repeat, it won&#8217;t do! You can argue all day about &#8216;in law&#8217; and &#8216;of law&#8217;, it still won&#8217;t do.\n\n It is the same non-argument. It doesn't matter that he applied 2 verses or 20. The fact is that he did. The influence is there.

Are you arguing that Lord Buckmeister was influenced by the Bible?\n This still remains the fundamental flaw with your stance; your opinion is only backed by your opinion. The weight of evidence in this case rests with my argument. You can speculate all day about which verses Lord Atkin didn't use; why he didn't use them, etc, and it is a rather pointless exercise demeaning any credibility of yours; the inability to either face evidence presented, or come up with alternate evidence.\n \n The bare summary of argument made by me is...\n i) The influence of the Bible on Lord Atkin in deciding a case\n ii) The application of a law to a case, by Lord Atkin based on the influence.\n Arguing the second happened is pointless, because it is a fact agreed to both sides. And yet you dedicate swathes of words to state what everyone knows; Lord Atkin made a decision 'in law'. The bit you contend with (and odd that you don't argue your own argument) is the first part. I gave you a number of citations to this effect. You criticised them for being religious. I gave you a number of secular citations; from government, law studies sites etc, confirming my original statement. You tried to counter 'arguments'. One was to claim you couldn't access the sites, based on your own copying of those sites. Two was, when you then argued passed them to stress only point ii). It is a fact of the case agreed to by all; Lord Atkin applied a decision of law to a case. You need to concentrate on 'why' (point i) ).

It is this repeated non sequitur of yours which explains why we can't get beyond this point. He did not apply Jesus' teaching of the Good Samaritan to any extent, nor to any degree, nor to any stretch of the imagination. What Lord Atkin argued for was the polar opposite of the lesson-plan of this pericope. \n \n It is not a fact, it is fiction to believe Atkin's decision was influenced by Christianity and let's dispel with it, hopefully for the last time.\n \n After relating how the priest and Levite passed by the mugged person, and how the Samaritan rendered assistance, Jesus asked the lawyer, \"Which of these three, in thy opinion (Look! Jesus asks for and respects other people's opinions! Maybe even American's!), proved himself neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\" And he [the lawyer] said, \"He who took pity on him.\" And Jesus said, \"Go and do likewise.\" \n \n Let us imagine Atkin did apply the Good Samaritan precept to this case we've been examining. What would his argument have been?\n \n \"Who is thy neighbor? In law, it becomes love everyone equally. We must have pity on the defendant with her gastroenteritis and all, and the bottler alike. Therefore, I plead my Lords, let us take up a collection ourselves for the poor woman, but to dismiss this case, as no decision can be made which will not harm the poor bottler, whom we love equally.\" \n \n I have stated before, and I will reiterate again, that I agree this case was important legally, precedent-wise. It has nothing to do with Christianity however. Additionally, \"love thy neighbor' is a universal precept belonging to every civilized society as I have also pointed out. If Lord Atkin had practiced Shintoism, he could still have referenced it in the same, irrelevant, passing fashion in his 20 page decision, and perhaps in the process made some Shinto practitioners the world over swoon.\n \n \n\n The bare summary of argument made by me is...\n i) The influence of the Bible on Lord Atkin in deciding a case\n\n \n None. No influence. Period. Did you mean \"barren summary\".\n \n \n\n \n ii) The application of a law to a case, by Lord Atkin based on the influence. \n\n \n None.

   "So far my opposition on this issue believes in not addressing the huge amount of citations that directly show the link between Lord Atkin's decision and Christian teaching. The appeal to incredulity is being applied. He has tried to re-work the authority of some of the citations; such as restating one is for a video sales site; even though he accepts the facts of the case that they present.\n \n The argument given by myself has two prongs...\n \n a) Lord Atkin read the Bible and was influenced by the Parable of the Good Samaritan \"the neighbour principle\" to apply a ruling of negligence in a particular matter.\n b) Lord Atkin then applies a ruling of negligence in this particular matter; in a matter that is revolutionary.\n \n Billsco's best efforts have been to ignore a) and go straight for re-stating b). Even when my citations state both, he has ignored a) and posted only words associated with b); that Lord Atkin made an application 'in law' to a case. This is terribly poor use of the sources given; to use them as an authority, but to be selective in their use; by ignoring the many clear instances where it is acknowledged; the link between Lord Atkin's decision, and the Christian teaching of the Good Samaritan. He has done this with one of my sources in particular. The problem in doing so remains that, in using it as a source, he is accepting its authority, but in ignoring the same source where it disagrees with him, he is showing that he is unwilling to deal with the fact; due to the appeal to incredulity.\n \n Here they are again, which you can read, but which Billsco ignores.\n \"The modern law of negligence was established in the famous English case of Donoghue v Stevenson, in which Mrs Donoghue discovered the decomposed remains of a snail in her bottle of ginger beer, most unfortunately after she had consumed the greater part of its contents. Suffering from shock and gastroenteritis, she sued Mr Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer.\n \n In what is arguably the 20th century&#8217;s most influential judicial decision to affect the lives of ordinary citizens, the biblical precept to love thy neighbour became in law &#8212; you must not injure your neighbour. Your neighbour is anyone you can reasonably foresee might be injured by your careless actions.\"\n \n http://www.choice.com.au/viewarticleasonepage.aspx?id=104324&catId=100528&tid=100008&p=1\n \n 'On May 26, 1932, Lord Atkin rose at last, amid the splendour of the great chamber of the House of Lords, to deliver his immortal speech in Donoghue v. Stevenson.16\n \n Lord Atkin reminded the House of the words of Lord Esher in Le Lievre v. Gould:17 &#8220;If one man is near to another, or near to the property of another, a duty lies on him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.&#8221; Using the thoughts he had expressed the previous autumn at King&#8217;s College, Lord Atkin then melded Lord Esher&#8217;s dictum with the parable of the good Samaritan. Neighbourhood was a mental rather than a physical state. It would be enough to impose on David Stevenson a duty of care such that those in the position of May Donoghue ought to have been in his mind when he was bottling the ginger beer. She was his neighbour in spirit.\"\n \n http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/keycases/dvs/mrs-donoghue-journey.html\n \n \"In Donoghue v. Stevenson, Lord Atkin said: \n \n \"To seek a complete logical definition of the general principle is probably to go beyond the function of the judge, for the more general the definition, the more likely it is to omit essentials or to introduce non-essentials.\" \n \n The moral which I draw from these words is that simplism combines fatally with generalization in two ways: it so extends the general as to take insufficient account of the peculiar requirements of the particular; and it takes the particular as in every respect an exemplar of the general. That, in his paraphrase of the parable of the Good Samaritan, Lord Atkin himself exceeded his function is, in my respectful submission, implicit in the speech of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Lupton v. F.A. & A.B. Ltd, where he refers to the distinction drawn in Farr v. Butters Bros & Co.\"\n \n http://www.ucc.ie/law/restitution/rdg/9912007.htm\n \n \"House of Commons Session 1997-98 Publications on the internet\n Standing Committee Debates National Minimum Wage Bill\n \n ...\n I must not digress into tales of Lord Chancellors, except to say that I think that Lord Atkin presided in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson. He cited the parable of the good Samaritan in his rationale, by way of explaining what one's duty ought to be from first principle.\"\n \n http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm199798/cmstand/d/st980210/pm/80210s01.htm\n \n \" have drawn the well-known distinction between the public and the private in terms of direct equality. I believe this way of drawing the distinction brings out the special qualities of the neighbour principle in tort first formulated by Lord Atkin in 1932 in Donoghue v. Stevenson. We have duties to others in the sense that we must not omit to treat them as our equal. That there are such circumstances is clearly explained by the intuitive trust we have in the parable of the Good Samaritan in which passers-by omitted wrongly to assist the sick person in the ditch. The neighbour principle makes use of this distinction because it rests fundamentally on the idea that the test of who is your neighbour is not the person whom you actually thought would be affected by your act. It is, instead, the person whom you ought reasonably have contemplated. So, when the duty is breached, liability is imposed for your omission to act properly.\"\n \n http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctlsfd/papers/freedom.html",
