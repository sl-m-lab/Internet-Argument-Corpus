   "The following is info I pulled from a website a long time ago when I was debating whether God existed. This has quite possibly been the greatest influence in me deciding that the God depicted in the Bible does not exist or at the very least we have to assume the Bible doesn't give the correct information about God. Tell me what you all think about this if it hasn't already been covered before.\n \n \n http://members.tripod.com/ColoradoWeb/failed_prophecies.htm\n \n \n Some Bible prophecies that failed to occur\n \n ---\n \n Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong.\n \n Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon will conquer Egypt utterly destroying it, slaying and scattering it's people, and that it will stay uninhabited for 40 years.\n \n In 568 BCE Nebuchadrezzar tried to conquer Egypt and Egypt survived with no apparent damage.\n \n Aahmes ruled for another generation over a prosperous Egypt and lived to see Nebuchadrezzar die. No Egyptians were scattered or dispersed.\n \n (Ezek 29:10 NRSV) therefore, I am against you, and against your channels, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.\n \n (Ezek 29:11 NRSV) No human foot shall pass through it, and no animal foot shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.\n \n (Ezek 29:12 NRSV) I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.\n \n (Ezek 30:10 NRSV) Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt, by the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.\n \n (Ezek 30:11 NRSV) He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.\n \n \n \n ---\n \n Ezekiel predicts the destruction of Tyre (Tyrus) by Nebuchadrezzar and is wrong again.\n \n Ezekiel incorrectly predicts that the island of Tyre (Tyrus) will be utterly destroyed and \"made a bare rock\" which will \"never be rebuilt\".\n \n At the time of the prediction, it seemed like to be a sure thing, but 13 years of seige later Nebuchadrezzar gives up. The Island of Tyre is not destroyed or even conquered. It is not made \"a bare rock\" that will \"never be rebuilt\".\n \n Ezekiel admits his error in Ezek 29:17\n \n (Here the conquest of Trye looks like a sure thing so Ezekiel makes his prediction)\n \n (Ezek 26:1 NRSV) In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:\n \n (Ezek 26:7 NRSV) For thus says the Lord GOD: I will bring against Tyre from the north King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, king of kings, together with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great and powerful army.\n \n (Ezek 26:14 NRSV) I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for spreading nets. You shall never again be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord GOD.\n \n (Ezek 27:32 NRSV) In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you, and lament over you: \"Who was ever destroyed like Tyre in the midst of the sea?\n \n (13 years of futile effort by Nebuchadrezzar later...)\n \n (Ezek 29:17 NRSV) In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:\n \n (Here Ezekiel admits he was wrong)\n \n (Ezek 29:18 NRSV) Mortal, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had expended against it.\n \n (So he then predicts that God decides to give Egypt to him instead, another Ezekiel prophecy that completely failed)\n \n \n \n ---\n \n Micah predicts the destruction of Jerusalem (which at the time was about to be invaded by Sennacherib and seemed inevitable) blaming the destruction on the corruption of the priesthood of Judah.\n \n Jerusalem was sieged, but the destruction didn't happen.\n \n A century later Jeremiah quotes Micah and tries to excuse the failed prophecy by saying that \"the Lord changed his mind\" about that destruction.\n \n (Micah 3:12 NRSV) Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.\n \n (~100 years and no destruction later...)\n \n (Jer 26:18 NRSV) \"Micah of Moresheth, who prophesied during the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'\n \n (Jer 26:19 NRSV) Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah actually put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD change his mind about the disaster that he had pronounced against them? ...\n \n \n \n ---\n \n The prophet Daniel incorrectly states that in the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar is king and that he conquers Judah.\n \n The third year of Jehoiakim's reign was 606 BCE, at which time Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king of Babylon. It was in 597 BCE that Nebuchadnezzar takes Jerusalem, by then Jehoiakim had died.\n \n (Dan 1:1 NRSV) In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.\n \n (Dan 1:2 NRSV) The Lord let King Jehoiakim of Judah fall into his power, as well as some of the vessels of the house of God. These he brought to the land of Shinar, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his gods.\n \n \n ---\n \n Jeremiah incorrectly predicts 70 years for the Babylonian exiles but they only lasted 59 years.\n \n The 1rst exile started in 597 BCE when Nebuchadnezzar first takes Jerusalem and appoints Zedekiah king (Judah's last king). Nebuchadnezzar has temple equipment taken away.\n \n The start of the 2nd exile was in 586 BCE when Nebuchadnezzar takes Jerusalem a second time putting down a rebellion and destroys the temple.\n \n The end comes in 538 BCE when Cyrus takes Babylon and ends the Babylonian kingdom. Jews are then allowed to return to Judah.\n \n (Jer 29:10 NRSV) For thus says the LORD: Only when Babylon's seventy years are completed will I visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place\n \n \n \n \n Just for fun I went back to that site I mentioned above for the first time in probably a year.\n \n I followed a link to another site that pointed out a lot of biblical contradictions. Of course everyone knows the Bible contradicts itself repeatedly and seemingly without care. But this site puts it in a very comical format as well as educational ;)\n \n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/inconsistencies.shtml\n \n Examples:\n \n GE 6:4 There were Nephilim (giants) before the Flood.\n GE 7:21 All creatures other than Noah and his clan were annihilated by the Flood.\n NU 13:33 There were Nephilim after the Flood.\n \n GE 6:6. EX 32:14, NU 14:20, 1SA 15:35, 2SA 24:16 God does change his mind.\n NU 23:19-20, IS 15:29, JA 1:17 God does not change his mind.\n \n GE 11:26 Terah was 70 years old when his son Abram was born.\n GE 11:32 Terah was 205 years old when he died (making Abram 135 at the time).\n GE 12:4, AC 7:4 Abram was 75 when he left Haran. This was after Terah died. Thus, Terah could have been no more than 145 when he died; or Abram was only 75 years old after he had lived 135 years.\n \n GE 10:5, 20, 31 There were many languages before the Tower of Babel.\n GE 11:1 There was only one language before the Tower of Babel.\n \n EX 9:3-6 God destroys all the cattle (including horses) belonging to the Egyptians.\n EX 9:9-11 The people and the cattle are afflicted with boils.\n EX 12:12, 29 All the first-born of the cattle of the Egyptians are destroyed.\n EX 14:9 After having all their cattle destroyed, then afflicted with boils, and then their first-born cattle destroyed, the Egyptians pursue Moses on horseback.\n \n \n \n \n Out of further curiosity I went on to look at more interesting writting. Biblical absurdities...\n \n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/absurd.shtml\n \n 1KI 6:2, 2CH 3:3 Solomon's temple was only about ninety feet long by thirty feet wide, yet: \n 1KI 5:15-16 153,300 persons were employed to build it. \n 1KI 6:38 It took seven years to build. \n 1CH 22:14 13,100,000 lbs. of gold and 116,400,000 lbs. of silver were used. \n 1CH 23:4 24,000 supervisors and 6,000 officials and judges were employed to manage it.\n \n 1SA 2:8, JB 38:4, PS 104:5 The earth has a foundation and cannot be moved.\n JB 9:6 (KJV) God shakes the earth out of its place and makes its pillars tremble.\n \n 2CH 13:17 500,000 Israelites are slain in a single battle. (Note: This is more than were lost in any single battle of World War II, and even exceeds the number of deaths that resulted from the dropping of the atomic bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. At Gettysburg, the greatest battle of the Civil War, the defeated army lost 5,000 men.)\n \n PS 58:8 Slugs and/or snails melt as they move.\n \n PS 121:6 It is apparently possible to suffer moonstroke as well as sunstroke.\n \n IS 11:12, RE 7:1 The earth has four corners.\n \n IS 24:1 (KJV) The earth can be turned upside down so as to scatter its inhabitants.\n \n IS 30:26 The moon will someday be as bright as the sun now is. (Note: Until relatively recent times, the moon and the planets were thought to give off their own light.)\n \n MT 7:7-8, LK 11:9-10 Ask and it will be given. Seek and you will find. Everyone who asks, receives.\n MT 18:19 If two [believers] agree about anything they ask, God will do it for them.\n \n RE 14:1-4 Heaven is to be inhabited in part by 144,000 virgin men who have not been \"defiled\" by women.\n (Guess that means that not many children make it to heaven)",

   "IS 11:12, RE 7:1 The earth has four corners.\n if shakespeare can use figuritive language, so can the bible\n\n \n I'll grant you this but this raises more questions about the Bible. How many more things in the Bible are figuritive? How many important things that you hold true about the Bible are only figurative?\n \n \nMT 18:19 If two [believers] agree about anything they ask, God will do it for them.\n I have experienced this many times, but many who claim to believe in god dont, and many who do believe in god fail to ask for what god already has in store for them\n\n \n I think more than two believers in this world wish that everyone could see God the way that they do. But we will assume 'anything' is an exaggeration. I only make this assumption because so many believers that I have debated accept that the Bible is filled with exaggerations that are not meant to be literal. Do you agree or disagree with my assumption?\n \n \nRE 14:1-4 Heaven is to be inhabited in part by 144,000 virgin men who have not been \"defiled\" by women.\n (Guess that means that not many children make it to heaven)\n not exclusively. the 144,000 virgin men are from the remenant of the tribes of israel left on earth during the tribulation period\n\n \n Since I'm not sure and am particularly lazy, I'll assume your correct.\n \n \nPS 58:8 Slugs and/or snails melt as they move.\n somewhat true, have you ever paused to watch?\n\n \n I'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt.\n \n \nIll consult some of my friends to help me on these issues if you dont mind.\n\n \n Sounds good.",

A month ago, I read over your 'failed prophecies' and if you are ready to listen, there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt.\n \n It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes, but the long and short of it is this: you don't even begin to know the God you are dealing with. \n \n If you give me a space of time to get things together, I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you're his \"buddy\" then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses (Ps. 50)\n \n Here's a hint though about what happened in Egypt: God changed his mind. But you didn't know he could do that? You would be surprised how much like you he really is. He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible: Abraham tried to get Him to but couldn't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God was out to kill Moses' sons, but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind, also Moses succeeded in changing God's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites, God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented, God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins, I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them. \n \n But be careful - when He is set on doing something, it gets done. Just when you think you have a \"pal\" in God, he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel: when a land sins against Me, though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it, they will deliver but their own souls.\n Even righteous Noah couldn't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world. \n \n Real quick: one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king. Happens time and time again in scripture. Don't have time to elaborate right now. Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations. So while God is using him to punish Egypt, He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well. Get it? Is it too mature for you? Don't believe it? Too bad....it's true. God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations. When He is through using them, He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original \"servant\" so to speak. This is mature teaching. Most Christians don't like it. Too bad....it's true. You don't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day. One day, He will be finished with you as well. Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this (God is speaking): All these things you have done and I kept silent. You thought I was altogether like you, but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces. Ps 50:21\n \n Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy?' God changed His mind! Maybe you ought to start praying that He will change His mind about your destiny as well.",

I'll grant you that since he changed his mind in the prophecy directly before this one.\n \n What we are debating is the fact that the Bible has a flaw in it. The prophecy before this one was incorrect. A correction was made later to make up for this. Then this prophecy was incorrect. There is no correction ever made. Hence there is a flaw in the Bible. Most Christians will accept the Bible as flawless and this single flaw could have the power to change minds and make people question how a perfect God allowed the only proof of him to be flawed. So if you are correct that God did change his mind, then you have to also accept that my point has been made and that there is a flaw in the Bible. You can downplay this flaw but it is still there for all to see.\n \n To expand on some of what you said, don't you think what you detailed there would go against what most Christians believe about God? You're saying that he used trickery and lies to accomplish goals. God works in mysterious ways, but in devious ways? I don't know how willing Christians would be willing to accept that.\n \n \n PS - I really don't want to lead this topic in a new direction, but I don't think your really explaining Christian principles in much of your response. Your ideas would probably be shunned by the majority of Christians and your insistences that 'it's true' as far as your writing goes is a little too cocky. I hope you will write a post concerning some of these issues and explain whether you feel like you fit into the role of the typical Christian or if you have your own and original ideas about God and/or the Bible.",

I suppose I should look it up and read it again if you could mention the passage. Anyways, the way you describe it, Jonah went to the cities, gave them a warning, they repented which canceled the warning, and therefore nothing happened just like God said. Jonah may have felt stupid, but the story makes perfect sense. All the loose ends are tied up. I guess you will have to expand on why you believe this is a failed prophecy.",

   "Listen, I can tell this is not going to be easy or go well. You are the kind of person that will make it next to impossible to convey truth to. You are like a leaky sieve but you don't know it. You are a very ill individual but you are not even aware of your terminal illness. There is always hope for those who know something is wrong with them because usually they begin seeking out help, say of a doctor - in this case, truth. \n \n The old saying that knowledge is not borne out in the heart of fools is all too true. If you had the character that agreed rather with this statement: the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, then I would think that we could make progress in this little exchange. I suspect though that you are bent on somehow informing me and others that the Bible is not valid and further, that God is not to be believed in.\n \n I can tell you that you have totally swallowed the information you copied from the website above. You have already decided that you will not believe. Because you do not want to. Because you do not have to right now. All is too easy for you. Only when you are hollowed out and depleted of yourself and possibly drawing your last breaths or watching someone you love draw their last breath, will you be ready to listen.\n \n I will tell you plainly again, but then no more. And though these doctrines are hard for Christians, they are not impossible because we more understand the God we serve than you understand your own Creator. That is because we have submitted to Him and do our best to study, accept, believe, and follow the layout He has prepared. You do not believe because you are not one of us. You refuse to believe because you do not want to be one of us. Right now, you are content to be who you are and are always ready to contend with God rather than submit to Him.\n \n Here it is in ABCs, but you will have to read the text for yourself. Keep in mind that the website has predisposed you to the idea that there is a flaw in the Bible. They have added this language: \"Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong. Ezekiel predicts the destruction of Tyre (Tyrus) by Nebuchadrezzar and is wrong again. Ezekiel admits his error in Ezek 29:17. (Here Ezekiel admits he was wrong). (So he then predicts that God decides to give Egypt to him instead, another Ezekiel prophecy that completely failed).\" If you agree with these statements and have set your heart to prove them, then there is no need to go any further with this. You can stop here. I will continue to argue science with you in other threads, but I will not be able to hold out hope for your conversion from your base idealogies at this time. \n \n None of these players are in God's favorite line-up of people: Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre, Egypt. He has determined judgments on all players in this game. Tyre is first to receive the penalty of her errors and God sends Nebuchadnezzar to lay a siege against her. In judging Tyre, God also judges Nebuchadnezzar. Not all of the prophecies against Tyre are fulfilled because God changes his mind about his immediate judgment of the city. He is not under duress to give us his reason why, though you can be sure of this: he completely fulfills his words against the wicked city at a later time. Like a puppet under his control, he turns the heart of Nebuchadnezzar toward Egypt and placates him through the words of the prophet by saying that he will pay the king back for his hard work which ended in frustration. (By the way, that frustration wherein Nebuchadnezzar never completely \"took\" Tyre was nothing short of an additional judgment against the evil king.) Never in the text does Ezekiel \"admit he was wrong\" as you believe or in any way accuse God. The prophet utters a lengthy judgment against Egypt and the king turns his wrath toward that southern country. He labors hard to conquer it but he does not succeed. God has again changed his mind for the immediate time for reasons we do not understand. God will fully bring his predictions against Egypt to pass at a later time. In the end, three entities are brought low, wasted, assets evaporated, judged: Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre, and Egypt. God has had his way with them. Ezekiel never \"admits he was wrong\" and he never accuses God. \n \n That is it. The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do. Anything you glean from contrary-to-Christian websites will tend to require the most difficult types of answers. Some of the Christians reading here in this Forum might have a little trouble with some of this doctrine, something which you and others will doubtless find pure delight in. But I think that once they begin to try to construct an answer of their own, they will see the enormous difficulty of the enterprise and some will abandon the effort altogether. \n \n A warning because it would not be fair to send you off without one: I am not at all pleased with this whole matter. I am distressed that you have caused me to print things that no one wants to hear and no one wants to have to assimilate. You have made a mockery of God and his Word and have caused others, perhaps even you, to find some degree of pleasure in. I am not a prophet, so I am not making any predictions, but I fully believe what I typed to you in my first post from Psalms 50. Believe me, you do not know....you do not know who you are dealing with. God is not a joke and he always has his way in the end. Knowledge is not borne out in the heart of fools. The only hope for one like you is to accept this position: the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. I am pleading with you to adopt an emotion of fear and reverence for him in exchange for your mockery. \n \n Please do not reply to me any more about this issue, only address the others. I will not go any further with you on this. Science is fun to argue about and to kick back and forth. This is not fun nor funny to me. This is the most serious of undertakings. I am not optimistic that you are going to believe much of anything I have posted here, and that is why I say I do not want to hear from you about this anymore. Good day.",

   "I remember the story that you speak of only vaguely. I suppose I should look it up and read it again if you could mention the passage. Anyways, the way you describe it, Jonah went to the cities, gave them a warning, they repented which canceled the warning, and therefore nothing happened just like God said. Jonah may have felt stupid, but the story makes perfect sense. All the loose ends are tied up. I guess you will have to expand on why you believe this is a failed prophecy.\n\n \n I too am going from a long-time memory - I am not deeply versed with the Old Testament as some of my Protestant colleagues.\n \n I believe it was because Jonah expected that God would carry out his punishment. He got quite angry with God.\n \n By the way, I notice that Babylon was mentioned a few times... is this the literal Babylon or the metaphorical one...? It could be the one that some people have applied to Rome (the Papacy), or to the USA (the American Babylon).\n \n \n I should also point out that it is not good form to take single lines out of the Bible ... from all over the Bible to build your case ...(if in fact you were trying to build a case for something - I missed that too). This is because like evolutionary theory, it can be reworked to what ever you want - hence Nazis could use evolutionary science to prove their campaigns of hate.",

   "Listen, I can tell this is not going to be easy or go well. You are the kind of person that will make it next to impossible to convey truth to. You are like a leaky sieve but you don't know it. You are a very ill individual but you are not even aware of your terminal illness. There is always hope for those who know something is wrong with them because usually they begin seeking out help, say of a doctor - in this case, truth.\n\n \n What am I supposed to think of this? You stated a broad opinion about me being next to impossible to convey the truth to when you barely know me. The truth is, and I have stated this time and time again, that I am looking to learn the truth and I hope that truth is that God exists. Does that sound like the opinion you gave about me?\n \n I get the sense that your not really here to debate a topic. You're here to stir up an argument. There is another poster on these board which I won't debate with because he fits under that description and your one I that I might add to that list.\n \n But just to debate what you said, how do you know that you're the one that isn't 'like a leaky sieve'? How do you know that you're not a 'very ill individual'? Are you sure you shouldn't be 'seeking out help'? You're the one who believe in invisible spirits and think that I am very ill for not have the same mindset as you. Do you believe everyone who believes in other religions are very ill? BTW, I do believe in a God different than yours. Am I very ill?\n \n \nThe old saying that knowledge is not borne out in the heart of fools is all too true. If you had the character that agreed rather with this statement: the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, then I would think that we could make progress in this little exchange. I suspect though that you are bent on somehow informing me and others that the Bible is not valid and further, that God is not to be believed in.\n\n \n The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?\n \n I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here.\n \n \nI can tell you that you have totally swallowed the information you copied from the website above. You have already decided that you will not believe. Because you do not want to. Because you do not have to right now. All is too easy for you.\n\n \n \n Actually looking back I wish I hadn't posted a lot of what is on those websites. It is a lot of poor arguments and I'm glad I was able to realize that over the last 3 months.\n \n Had I already decided to believe that all of it was true I wouldn't be here debating you now.\n \n You say I don't want to know. I wonder if you would want to know if God didn't exist. Is that why at the end of your post you seem so unhappy to debate this further?\n \n \nYou do not believe because you are not one of us. You refuse to believe because you do not want to be one of us. Right now, you are content to be who you are and are always ready to contend with God rather than submit to Him.\n\n \n I don't to believe because the evidence doesn't seem to support it. As you spell out you believe unconditionally so you don't need evidence. I have a more scientific mind and need evidence to back decisions such as this. I am content in know that the decisions I make are based on logic and not hopes. If I ever do become a believer in God again then it will be based on evidence and what would seem to be likely rather than a simple hope and faith in something that is unseen.\n \n \nNone of these players are in God's favorite line-up of people: Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre, Egypt. He has determined judgments on all players in this game. Tyre is first to receive the penalty of her errors and God sends Nebuchadnezzar to lay a siege against her. In judging Tyre, God also judges Nebuchadnezzar. Not all of the prophecies against Tyre are fulfilled because God changes his mind about his immediate judgment of the city.

In the end, three entities are brought low, wasted, assets evaporated, judged: Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre, and Egypt. God has had his way with them. Ezekiel never \"admits he was wrong\" and he never accuses God.\n\n \n So once again you're steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.\n \n [QUOTE]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\\QUOTE]\n \n It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.\n \n \nA warning because it would not be fair to send you off without one: I am not at all pleased with this whole matter. I am distressed that you have caused me to print things that no one wants to hear and no one wants to have to assimilate. You have made a mockery of God and his Word and have caused others, perhaps even you, to find some degree of pleasure in. I am not a prophet, so I am not making any predictions, but I fully believe what I typed to you in my first post from Psalms 50.

The only hope for one like you is to accept this position: the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. I am pleading with you to adopt an emotion of fear and reverence for him in exchange for your mockery.\n\n \n You're distressed about this? You're the one who is putting words on God's mouth and isn't that making a mockery of God and his word? I guess there is reason for you to be distressed. You then claim not to be a prophet or make predictions yet you predicted that God would make true on his original statements in the future. There is no reason to believe this and therefore you are making a prediction. Is this what you are distressed about?\n \n 'Knowledge is not borne out in the heart of fools.' Knowledge is borne of not just Christians as well. There is much knowledge that shows that Christian knowledge in certain areas is flawed. So which one would you believe? Just saying knowledge is not borne out of the heart of fools doesn't say a whole lot to support to contrast your opinion.\n \n And stop pleading. If you're that desperate to make everyone believe what you believe then I think you better just back away from this type of debate in the future. Desperation doesn't influence people. Strength does. At least most of the Christians here show strength in their debates and not total fear and desperation to try and change minds.\n \n \nPlease do not reply to me any more about this issue, only address the others. I will not go any further with you on this. Science is fun to argue about and to kick back and forth. This is not fun nor funny to me. This is the most serious of undertakings. I am not optimistic that you are going to believe much of anything I have posted here, and that is why I say I do not want to hear from you about this anymore. Good day.\n\n \n You ask me not to reply and had this been an issue that wasn't that important to me perhaps I wouldn't have. This isn't the first thread I ever made for no reason. This is the topic that I signed up here to find opinions on. This topic is something I consider of great importance to myself. Especially when such information as you gave is stated referring to this topic, I have to reply. If your not having fun in a debate it is a conscious choice you can make to ignore it.",

So even if the Bible is based on a true God, it is still untrustworthy to some extent because of human errors.

Science endeavours, to the best of it's limited scope of discovering 'scientific truths'\n\n \n Like I commented once before - You have never taken a single science course, have you?\n Science does not start out \"knowing\" the answers - it seeks to find them. You and yourn, on the other hand, KNOW that the bible is 100% true and accurate, and endeavor to seek ways to 'prove' this. Indeed - you quotes Augustine in that if there is something wrong with a bible verse, it is the interpretation of it, that is, it cannot be wrong.\n \n That is most certainly NOT at all like science...\n\n \n What was science 2,000 years ago is not necessarily science now.\n\n \n Not true. Science, as a methodology to try to find 'truth', is much the same. The technologies have changed - and the mindsets - allowing us to discover that much that was thought to be 'true' - young earth, etc. - to be false. That does not mean that the belief that illness was caused by imbalances of bodily humors was not science, it just means that the belief was incorrect due to a dearth of information.\n\n \n Same with you. When you were young you understood the world differently from now. The world is still there, but you know that the sky isn't blue 'because it's not green'. You can develop a deeper understanding.\n\n \n Indeed. Just as I no longer believe in talking serpents and pillars of salt...\n\n \n \n The tooth that fell from your mouth wasn't taken by the tooth fairy.\n \n Do you belittle science because it used to support a flat earth?\n \n\n \n I doubt science ever postulated a flat earth. The ancient Greeks had figured it out using simple math.\n\n Do you belittle yourself, for what you believed as a child?\n\n \n No, because as we grow we learn more., Which is what science is about - learning more. Creationism is about learning less - or learning only that which props up Doctrine and Dogma.\n\n \n No, of course not. You respect that life is a quest for truth.\n \n Blessed Augustine recognised these truths. He was being humble. Seems to be an unpopular trait nowadays.\n\n \n You mean the blessed Augustine that you quoted re: if a bible verse seems wrong, it is you, not the verse? That is not humble, that is plain stupid.\n\n \n He realised that the Bible was the truth. He put himself in the position of saying what he seemed not to understand, was, simply because he didn't understand it.\n\n \n How did he realise this? How can you know something to be true then try to force reality to conform to that 'truth'? Is that logical? Is that 'scientific'?\n\n \n Sometimes scientists forget this. They come up with terms like 'junk DNA' for the bits that they don't understand - therefore it musn't have a function. \n\n \n Misrepresentations and strawman caricatures are not doing your position much good. No one ever claimed, as far as I know, that 'junk DNA' must not have a function. Do you know why it is called junk DNA? \n\n \n Or, vestigal organs, must be leftovers because they don't know what they do.\n\n \n Same as above.

   "Same with science. Science endeavours, to the best of it's limited scope of discovering 'scientific truths'\n\n \n Like I commented once before - You have never taken a single science course, have you?\n Science does not start out \"knowing\" the answers - it seeks to find them You and yourn (sic), on the other hand, KNOW that the bible is 100% true and accurate, and endeavor to seek ways to 'prove' this. Indeed - you quotes (sic) Augustine in that if there is something wrong with a bible verse, it is the interpretation of it, that is, it cannot be wrong.[/QUOTE]\n \n Do you not even see the circular reasoning here? (I've highlighted it for you). So, it's seeking answers, and has never come up with one, because it's never able to know them.\n \n They're your words. You just say them like a mantra without even thinking about how patently stupid they are. And look, below (I've highlighted it too), it is to find the truth. So the truth in not an answer?\n \n This is so amazing. Another writer keeps telling me that science isn't about finding 'the truth' at all.\n \n \n\n Not true. Science, as a methodology to try to find 'truth', is much the same. The technologies have changed - and the mindsets - allowing us to discover that much that was thought to be 'true' - young earth, etc. - to be false. That does not mean that the belief that illness was caused by imbalances of bodily humors was not science, it just means that the belief was incorrect due to a dearth of information.\n\n \n Now it's the truth. Is that different from an answer? Now you see that science made mistakes, because of limited understanding.\n \n But I've got to go back to what you said earlier....\n \n \nIndeed - you quotes (sic) Augustine in that if there is something wrong with a bible verse, it is the interpretation of it, that is, it cannot be wrong.\n\n \n It is the interpretation of it that is, it cannot be wrong? Huh? It's hard to follow this... I said the interpretation can be wrong.\n \n \nI doubt science ever postulated a flat earth. The ancient Greeks had figured it out using simple math.\n\n \n Talk about stupid, again. Who do you think the scientists were? Were they some tribe of people whom the Greeks met, or can you stop for a moment, before you write and figure out that lots of the scientists were Greek. The Greek scientists postulated that the earth was at the centre of the solar system, that the human body is composed of four elements, that the female has sperm that fights with male sperm to determine the sex of the baby. The list goes on.\n \n \n \nYou mean the blessed Augustine that you quoted re: if a bible verse seems wrong, it is you, not the verse? That is not humble, that is plain stupid.\n \n How did he realise this? How can you know something to be true then try to force reality to conform to that 'truth'? Is that logical? Is that 'scientific'?\n\n \n No, it is being humble. Understanding the limits of your understanding is also the first step to wisdom. It means you don't make as many non sequiters and leaps of logic as you have done. You've already said science is about finding truths, but not answers, and that scientists were a separate people to the Greeks.\n \n But worst still, Augustine is saying about the Bible exactly what you're saying about science. That he doesn't know everything, and when he's in doubt, it could be because he's got it wrong somewhere. But, you're so full of hate for religion, and the a priori understanding that it is irrational, that when you call his actions irrational, you're quite unaware that you describe the same actions as rational, when conducted by scientists.\n \n \nMisrepresentations and strawman caricatures are not doing your position much good. No one ever claimed, as far as I know, that 'junk DNA' must not have a function. Do you know why it is called junk DNA? \n\n \n Do you? junk implies rubbish, uselessness etc. But is it?\n http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s898887.htm\n \n \nSame as above. Your misunderstanding is not evidence fo the absence of vestigial structures.\n\n \n I never said it was. I said, science has labelled as vestigial organs that is doesn't know what they are for.\n \n \nBetter than claiming that the extensor coccygis MUST have a function because God would not put useless muscles in His prize creations, no?\n\n \n Now you're off on a tangent, arguing a different argument. I'm not saying vestigial organs prove God, or such and such an organ does. But, don't let that stop you when you're on a rant, just pretend that I did, and argue against it... much the same way as AMD4EVER does... because you've both got arguments to make, regardless of what someone else has said, you just spill it out regardless in the hope that some of it actually addresses the topic at hand.\n \n \n \n \n AMD4EVER, Sorry if this shatters your faith, pity you're such a lapdog\n \n \n \n \n Also \nLike I commented once before - You have never taken a single science course, have you?\n\n How do you know?

Men could not be allowed by the Almighty to live there, since if they did they could not see Christ at his second coming descending through the air\"; and, he says, the supporters of this geographical heresy \"give the lie direct to King David and to St. Paul, and therefore to the Holy Ghost!\" The\n Antipodeans, argues Father Procopius, according to a text of Luke,\n are theologically impossible. \"If there be men on the other side of\n the earth, Christ must have gone there and suffered a second time\n to save them; and therefore there must have been, as necessary\n preliminaries to his coming, a duplicate Adam, Eden, serpent, and\n Deluge!\"\n \n Now you have just got to laugh... But wait there's more!\n \n \"Father St. Boniface appealed to Yahveh's Vicar, Pope Zaebary,\n to combat this heresy of the antipodes, of men who were beyond the\n appointed means of salvation; and the Pope, inspired of the Holy\n Ghost, issued his bull, embellished and fortified with passages\n from Job and the apocryphal \"Wisdom of Solomon,\" against the\n heretical doctrine, declaring it \"perverse, iniquitous, and against\n the soul\" of whoever maintained it. And the Holy Ghost, speaking\n further through this bull, harshly condemned the good Saint\n Vergilius, who heretically held the earth to be round; declaring\n that such doctrine involved errors as to original sin and the\n universality of redemption; for, averred the Holy Ghost, if there\n were antipodes, the \"other race of men\" could not be descendants of\n Adam and were not redeemed by Christ.

So much for the quest for honest debate huh? What is it this time; a chemical imbalance? A random mutation?\n \n So you've now shown your true colours. The gloves are off.\n \n SLP wrote:Science does not start out \"knowing\" the answers - it seeks to find them.\n \n Ah Theomorphic, what a pity you don't follow this. You've already concluded there's no God. And you've concluded that the only way to test would have been involving a system you admit can't possibly do it. So much for a no-brainer in logic.\n \n As I said on another post. You've determined that to tell if anything is right or wrong, you will use science, and your own rational and reasoned interpretation of the results of science. Fine.\n BUT\n you say that science can't test for God, but you keep hounding me to come up with a way of proving God, when you\n a) don't admit the evidence as evidence, because it's not scientific\n b) admit that science couldn't possibly prove God anyway.\n \n So, based on the fact that you can't possibly test that God exists, you say He doesn't. Wowee! And whoosh, the speed of that thought was so quick you didn't even have time to think about it before telling the whole world. It's like you had the giant urge to announce \"Look at me, I'm stupid!\"\n \n How could anyone prove to you God exists? They couldn't because of the constraints you've imposed.\n \n It's like an idiot saying... \"I'm going to close my eyes from now on and believe only in what I can touch (experience). You can only prove to me something exists by being provable by this criteria only... that I can touch it.\"\n And then someone saying, \"But what about the moon? Open your eyes, and you can see it.\"\n The idiot responds, \"No, I've told you the criteria I've set, if it can't be proven by it, I won't believe it!\"\n \"But thousands of people have seen the moon, it's been observed for thousands of years\"\n \"No, inadmissible... I have to touch it to prove it exists.\"\n \n Of course even if you flew the person to the moon they'd still doubt it because they've got gloves on which may inhibit the actual experiential criteria.\n \n As Beethoven wrote 'Dum dum dum dum\"\n \n \n \n Obviously you guys have no knowledge of humility either.\n \n I don't either; that's why I'm glad that I can argue against all of you, combined;\n Imakenosense\n AMD4EVER\n SLP\n Lurch\n TheoMorphic\n \n I'm still here!

(I've highlighted it for you). So, it's seeking answers, and has never come up with one, because it's never able to know them.\n\n Do you see the illogic employed by this guy? How can one find an answer - or rather, why would one - if they 'already know it'? I suggest you find out what circularity really is, genius...\n\n They're your words. You just say them like a mantra without even thinking about how patently stupid they are. And look, below (I've highlighted it too), it is to find the truth. So the truth in not an answer?\n\n I so enjoy being told that my words are 'stupid' by a guy that relishes in his own stupidity. the irony is rich. I really know that you have never taken a science class, and have absolutley ZERO knowledge about what science is and how it operates if you really think that seeking to find answers is an example of circular reasoning.\n\n This is so amazing. Another writer keeps telling me that science isn't about finding 'the truth' at all.\n\n Well, not Truth as you \"know\" it, no. \n\n Now it's the truth. Is that different from an answer? Now you see that science made mistakes, because of limited understanding.\n \n\n I never said that science did not make mistakes, and if you actually think that YOU pointed this out to me you are truly delusional.\n The same limited understanding that produces errors in science also produces the \"knowledge\" of the TRUTH od Scripture... Thankfully, the more we find out, the less we rely upon superstition and absolutist nonsense. Some of us, anyway...\n\n But I've got to go back to what you said earlier....\nIndeed - you quotes (sic) Augustine in that if there is something wrong with a bible verse, it is the interpretation of it, that is, it cannot be wrong.\n\n It is the interpretation of it that is, it cannot be wrong? Huh? It's hard to follow this... I said the interpretation can be wrong.\n\n Allow me to make it clearer:\n \n Indeed - you quote Augustine in that if there is something wrong with a bible verse, it is the interpretation of it that is wrong - that is, the verse itself cannot be wrong.\n\n Talk about stupid, again.\n\n Yes, i usually do when I encounter folk like you, but I try not to let myself get carried away.\n\n Who do you think the scientists were? blah blah blah.\n\n \n That is correct. Sadly, none of that was usurped by biblical lore. Indeed, if we were to interpret the bible the \"right\" way, we would not have dermatologists, we would have priests trying to cure \"skin disorders\" by killing pigeons over running water...\n\n \n \nYou mean the blessed Augustine that you quoted re: if a bible verse seems wrong, it is you, not the verse? That is not humble, that is plain stupid.\n \n How did he realise this? How can you know something to be true then try to force reality to conform to that 'truth'? Is that logical?

I do not hate religion, nor do I hate religionists. I pity them. \n \n I am not saying anything at all like Augustine the Dotard was saying about the bible. I am not saying that Science is Absolutely Correct, we just might not understand it. Augustine, according to you, is saying that the bioble is 100% correct, and if it might not seem that way, it is our puny mental capacity that makes it seem so.\n \n I am saying that science provides the tools to find answers - 'truths' with a lower-case t - not that it alread has all answers.\n \n Please try to read what is written, not what you want it to say as you apparently do with yout bible.\n\n \n \nMisrepresentations and strawman caricatures are not doing your position much good. No one ever claimed, as far as I know, that 'junk DNA' must not have a function. Do you know why it is called junk DNA? \n\n \n Do you? \n\n \n Yes, I do. 'Junk' Dna was originally so-called because it does not encode protein, and therefore appeared to have no function.\n\n \n junk implies rubbish, uselessness etc. But is it?\n http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s898887.htm\n\n \n That story, as are all 'human-intererst' news stories, a bit loose with the facts. I have never heard of this chap, but I do know that functions were poroposed for 'junk DNA' decades ago. That some junk DNA has a function is no mystery to actual geneticists, your tabloidy-ABC news story notwithstanding.\n \n Indeed:\n \n Cell. 1975 Feb;4(2):107-11. \n \n \n The general affinity of lac repressor for E. coli DNA: implications for gene regulation in procaryotes and eucaryotes.\n \n Lin S, Riggs AD.\n \n By equilibrium competition experiments, the dissociation constant (K(RD)) of lac repressor for E. coli DNA carrying a deletion of the lac operon was measured at a variety of salt concentrations. These data are used in the consideration of several aspects of protein-DNA interaction: Quantitative estimates of specificity are made. Specificity changes only slightly with salt concentration. We calculate that in vivo, 98 percent or more of repressor is bound to DNA predominately at sites other than the lac operator. Inducers shift repressor from operator to nonoperator DNA, but do not free it from DNA. The general affinity of repressor for E. coli DNA is sufficient to support a model where repressor slides along DNA for significant distances. The effective dissociation constant of repressor for operator (K(eff)) is very sensitive to the total DNA concentration. We propose that \"junk\" DNA in eucaryotes functions to maintain total DNA at an optimum concentration. We consider the lac operon in the nucleus of a lymphocyte, point out that severe difficulties would be encountered, and suggest possible solutions.\n \n \n So at least 28 years ago, functions were being proposed for 'junk DNA'. This old canard about 'junk DNA' is almost as silly as the arguments over 'gill slits.'\nSame as above. Your misunderstanding is not evidence fo the absence of vestigial structures.\n\n \n I never said it was. I said, science has labelled as vestigial organs that is [sic]doesn't[sic] know what they are for.\n\n But Scripture does, right? \n So, maybe YOU can tell me a function for the extensor coccygis muscle?Of course, vestigial does, in fact, NOT mean 'functionless.' Like all science, the use and definition of terms change as evidence warrants. Surely you know what the contemporary definition of vestigial is?\n\n \n \n \nBetter than claiming that the extensor coccygis MUST have a function because God would not put useless muscles in His prize creations, no?\n\n \n \n Now you're off on a tangent, arguing a different argument. I'm not saying vestigial organs prove God, or such and such an organ does. But, don't let that stop you when you're on a rant, just pretend that I did, and argue against it...\n\n \n I find it ironic that you would declare my pst a rant. have you ever stopped and looked at the path of spamming devastation you leave on boards?\n \n Anyway, it is no tangent, it is relavant to the overall issue.\n\n \n \n much the same way as AMD4EVER does... because you've both got arguments to make, regardless of what someone else has said, you just spill it out regardless in the hope that some of it actually addresses the topic at hand.\n\n \n \n The Projection is palpable...\n\n \n \n \n \n AMD4EVER, Sorry if this shatters your faith, pity you're such a lapdog\n\n Nice. Let me guess - Agape love?\n AMD seems to make very sound and quite damning arguments all by himself. You should try that sometime.\n\n Also \nLike I commented once before - You have never taken a single science course, have you?\n\n How do you know? What if I did, and still got it wrong. You are basing this statement as a rhetorical question because it helps you to believe that this is the case. Where is the evidence?\n\n Inference. I find it hard ot belioeve that someone that has taken science course could be so wrong about what science is. Of course, you could have taken some with the sole purpose of trying to weasel out 'damning' statments, as have some other creationists I know of.\n Or you could have simply ignored everything that did not support your childhood brainwashing.\n Either way, it is pretty clear that you have no clue and rely on propaganda and disinformation to formulate your opinions.",

I just wanted to note how some of your comments are incredibly hypocritical and ironic.\n \n For that reason I did not mention the difference between greeks and scientists (nor will I now). If STP and AMD feel like that should be addressed, so be it. But I suggest you don't draw conclusions about their level of scientific knowledge based on the lack of a reply to a comment of yours. You say so much, and some just doesn't deserve any though for a reply. \n \n \nSo you've now shown your true colours. The gloves are off.\n\n \n so you're going to start insulting me now? Can I expect an even lower quality of \"debate\" with you from here on out?\n \n \nSLP wrote:Science does not start out \"knowing\" the answers - it seeks to find them.\n\n \n Ok, I'll have to amend an earlier statement. Your ignorance of topics does not stop at the scientific method... it appears you also have no knowledge about logical fallacies (and maybe even perhaps why they should not be used as reasoning).\n \n \nAh Theomorphic, what a pity you don't follow this. You've already concluded there's no God. And you've concluded that the only way to test would have been involving a system you admit can't possibly do it. So much for a no-brainer in logic.\n\n \n Please cut and paste ANY quote from me that has me stating there is no God (remember to keep your quote in context) along with a link to the thread, or just the name of the thread and post number.\n \n If you start looking and find that I've always said something along the lines of \"I see no evidence that god exists\" then rest assured all my comments about god are similar. I have repeatedly characterized myself as agnostic, and I believe have only once said I was \"agnostic/atheist\".\n \n \nSo, based on the fact that you can't possibly test that God exists, you say He doesn't. Wowee!\n\n \n based on the fact that I can't possible test if god exists, I conclude that I don't know if he exists. \n \n \n \n \"Look at me, I'm stupid!\"\n\n \n this is an example of an out of context quote... please don't do this.\n \n \nHow could anyone prove to you God exists? They couldn't because of the constraints you've imposed.\n\n \n yup, that's why science.... Shoot I'm getting into this debate even though I didn't want to. Please disregard any comments that you feel you have the need to reply to... wait... except for the one where I asked you to find where I stated there was no god.

   " Imakenosense wittily you reduced my argument to :.\n pathetic drivel snipped...\n Do you belittle science because it used to support a flat earth?\n more pathetic whining snipped.\n \n You're an interesting bloke. I've got to ask you for some advice...because \n\n \n I'll take that as a backanded compliment...\n I'll be happy to give you some advice.\n Monty, it is blindingly obvious that you have made a huge personal investment in what you believe and this manifests itself in the way you see the world and present your arguments. You need to step back for a moment and take a look at the way you are presenting these arguments and the sources from which your information comes from. If you do this what you will find is that it is all very very one sided. You approach everything from your perspective, never once actually looking at the other side of the coin, in other words you are seeking to bolster your side by looking negatively at the other side. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?\n If you are serious about trying to find the truth then you wouldn't be acting this way.\n Here's an intersting quote from that source that you hold so dear.\n \n Let us discern for ourselves what is right;\n let us learn together what is good.\n \n (Job 34.4)\n \n What does this tell you? Something that I fear you have trouble doing as you place so much store in what others such as your church fathers have told you. You need to find out for yourself Monty, but this is what you find so difficult to do, you have to let go of these apron strings that you are so tightly holding on to.\n Intellectual honesty, do you understand what this is? A person who is intellectually honest is someone who accepts the facts, whatever they may be. \n \n The truth may lead us where we sincerely do not want to go. But if we are genuine truth-seekers, we must follow the truth anyway. \n [Todd S Green]\n \n This applies to you Monty in the truest sense. look at the posetive side to evolution, learn about the bible, not what's in the bible, examine the evidence that you hold so dear (the bible) and question it's veracity, don't take anything at it's word, either for or against.\n Had you read my last post to you in the other forum, you would have seen that I to have an orthodox background, we may have even run into each other, but unlike you I questioned and probed and in the end I made the decision not to continue going to church. This was an easy decision to make. I was never pressured to go to church, I did it out of a sense of respect, wanting to please my parents. I now realise that your beliefs are a product of your environment, nothing more.\n \n Stick around Monty, do some research about your own belief system, the bible and religious history, learn a bit about science and why the definitions that are used actually aren't rubbery as you so succinctly put it and keep contributing.\n If you leave this forum and jion another all that will happen is the same as here and creation talk. The only safe place for you to go is to a heavily moderated christian forum, but then how will you learn anything? You will just end up slapping each other on the back.\n \n I have chosen the path of intellectual honesty. \n \n Someone might argue, \"If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?\" Why not say - as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say - \"Let us do evil that good may result\"? Their condemnation is deserved.\n - Romans 3:7-8 \n \n \n\n Had I done the same SLP would have applied these words...\n \n \"You replied with vacuous gibberish to anyone and everyone that responded.

   "This thread should really be under 'religion'. The moderator or whatever should fix this up.\n \n Rather than just call Augustine's humility stupid or dishonest I will now put his words in historical context.\n \n Millenarian groups have risen up through-out the history of Christianity. These groups centre themselves on passages of the Bible concerning the end-times.\n \n I recall reading some histories of what are (wrongfully) called \"The English Civil Wars\" and there were many groups each interpreting the Bible their own way; There were amongst many, Adamaists, 5th Monarchists, Levellers, Diggers etc. Some if not most were believers in the 'end time,' and for them, that end-time had come.\n More recently (mid-80s) someone discovered that Chernobyl means 'wormwood' in Russian... wormwood being a referred to in Revelations; and the disaster that happened there was seen as a sign of the end-times.\n \n This is one of the reasons that I don't rely on personal interpretation of Scripture. It is fraught with danger.*\n \n Blessed Augustine writes a guide to interpreting the Bible... for instance he says \"Where, however, the ambiguity cannot be cleared up, either by the rule of faith or by the context, there is nothing to hinder us to point the sentence according to any method we choose of those that suggest themselves.\"\n http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/augustine/ddc3.html\n \n Even the Blessed Augustine made mistakes. He was being humble when he realised that he could make mistakes in interpreting the Bible. NOT DISHONEST.\n \n It is dishonest for evolutionaries to say that the Bible is all meaningless, and then criticise an Orthodox like Blessed Augustine for having the guts to admit he can make mistakes in interpretations.\n \n Which brings me to the interpretation of Genesis. Is it allegorical, literal, or just myth? For me as a Christian, as an Orthodox Christian (if that is to have any meaning); I must consider the views as expressed by my Church.\n \n \"Though creation has been widely discussed, the length of the six days of creation, as held throughout the ages of church history, was generally agreed: they were ordinary or sidereal days. There were few exceptions to this: Clement, Origin and Augustine being the main ones. Clement and Origin, of course, followed an allegorical method of interpretation and denied the historicity of much of the Bible. Augustine's statements, on the other hand, are unclear but it seems that he believed that God actually created the world all at once (i.e., in an instant of time, the six days being repetitions of the one day of creation) but related the story of a six-day creation to us to accommodate our limited understanding. To be sure, there is much in the Bible that is difficult (if not impossible) for our finite minds to grasp, but in this case one must wonder how a six-day account would be any easier to comprehend than an instantaneous creation. In any case, the non-literal views of the days of creation were uncommon and not highly regarded\"\n http://stjohnsrcus.inetnebr.com/page23.htm\n \n Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyons c.177-200) says \"...in the first Adam we offended God by not performing his command; in the second Adam we have been reconciled, becoming 'obedient unto death'.\" Adversus Haereses v.xvi.3 \n \"Fellowship with God is light and life...separation from God is death.\" Ibid v.xxvii.2 \n Right down to our own day... \n \"A knowledge of the beginning and end of all things is essential for us to understand the purpose of our existence here on this earth, and what lies beyond it\" Fr.Seraphim Rose's commentary on St. Symeon The New Theologian's \"The First-Created Man.\" \n \n They are talking about an historical person, a real Adam.\n \n It goes beyond this too, to the implications of evolutionary theory...\n \n \"If you believe that man came up from savagery, you will interpret all past history in those terms. But according to Orthodoxy, man fell from Paradise. In evolutionary philosophy there is no room for a supernatural state of Adam. Thos who want to keep both Christianity and evolutionism, therefore, are forced to stick an artificial Paradise onto an ape-like creature. These are obviously two different systems which cannot be mixed.\" \n Fr. Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Ma: The Orthodox Christian Vision, pp324-5 \n \"The most important question which is raised for Orthodox theology by the modern theory of evolution is the nature of man, and in particular the nature of the first-created man Adam.\" (Ibid, p46) \n \n With all respect to Iamthetruth's advice, I will remain firm with the beliefs of Orthodoxy. It was the nature of this post to suggest that their are failed Biblical prophecies. I know of none.\n \n I appreciate your honest advice...\n \n Let us discern for ourselves what is right;\n let us learn together what is good.\n (Job 34.4)\n \n This is, I believe however, a passage taken out of context. John Chysotomon, Epharim the Syrian, Basil the Great, Ambrose of Milan, John Damascene, Anthanasius the Great, Gregory of Nyssa et al. have taught, and so has the Orthodox Church as a whole. Interpreting the Bible for yourself (without reference to Orthodox teaching) is not the Orthodox Way. I am not prepared to go out on a limb.\n \n \n \n *\"To speculate on the date of the Second Coming, even if it be only the year, is to seek to wrest a secret from God that Jesus explicitly states only the Father possesses. Therefore, speculating on the timing of our Lord's return is arrogance bordering on blasphemy. As Bible commentator William Barclay explains, \"It is not any man's duty to speculate; it is his duty to prepare himself, and to watch.\"...The aim of Jesus' discourses on the Second Coming was always to one end: not to give us clues to dates His return, but to exhort us to be prepared.' \"Voice in the Wilderness\", Vol. 11, No.2 Apr-June 2003, p24 (published by Apostoliki Diakonia Committee Greek Orthodox Parish-Community of Saint George, Brisbane)",

It also proves that terminology like four corners of the earth makes perfect sense and is referring to N S E W... okay?\n \n Which of those verses would you like me to explain, because I assure you, every prophecy has or will (for those which are refering to end times) come true.\n \n this site explains the slug and briefly touches on circle of the earth http://www.cdu.jesusanswers.com/custom2.html (i could give you numerous other sites that have details explanations of the earth being described as a sphere or circle)",

When you look carefully at the passage of John, you'll notice that the part about the baptism (verses 32-34) is out of context with the rest of the passage. The key is in verse 32\n \"Then John gave his testimony\" [about the baptism] which shows that John the Baptist is simply reflecting on the past and not telling a chronological story. Compare verses 29 and 35-36.\n They are identical. John (the Apostle) is repeating himself after telling of John the Baptist's recollection of the baptism in verses 32-34. \n \n Remember: John (the Apostle) is the author of this book and is telling the story of John the Baptist, occasionally inserting quotes.\n -------------------\n \n You see, most alleged Bible contradictions can be explained by the following:\n \n (1) Reading a verse out of context. Make sure you read the entire chapter to see what context the verse is in. Sometimes the begining of the chapter will reveal the subject in the following verses.\n \n (2) Change between old and new covenants. As Christians, we are not under the laws of the old covenant listed in the old testement. Because we are not under the law, some people confuse verses in the new testement to contradict those of the old. Not a contradiction, simply just a change in covenants.\n \n (3) Bad translation. Not all Bibles are good translations. Whenever you translate from one language to another you have the potential for mistranslations. Also some cult groups have bad translations that are slanted to match thier doctrine. The New World Translation of The Holy Scriptures (Jehovah's Witness Version) is a good example of a very bad translation.\n \n Websites like the one you mentioned at the beginning are probably breaking one of those three rules which is why they seem to be able to reveal that the Bible is flawed, when in fact it is them, themselves that have made the mistake, the Bible is the perfect word of God.",

   "we just explained it, if you don't accept that as an answer then fine, I have nothing more to say on that verse, but that is what it means, I'm sorry if you don't understand analogies like that... there hundreds of verses in the bible like this, in fact many of the terminology like this is because of the imperfect translation. For example:\n \n [It is] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof [are] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in... Isaiah 40:22\n \n the hebrew word circle 'if' translated correclty would actually be sphere. This proves two things, one that back then when man thought the earth was flat, the authors of the Bible new different, the earth was and is a sphere. It also proves that terminology like four corners of the earth makes perfect sense and is referring to N S E W... okay?\n \n Which of those verses would you like me to explain, because I assure you, every prophecy has or will (for those which are refering to end times) come true.\n \n this site explains the slug and briefly touches on circle of the earth http://www.cdu.jesusanswers.com/custom2.html (i could give you numerous other sites that have details explanations of the earth being described as a sphere or circle)\n\n \n I just copied this from a post made by Ursus maritimus recently on another thread where this subject came up.\n \n \nThe Hebrew word used in Isaiah 40:22 is chuwg which is translated as \"circle\": http://www.blueletterbible.org/tmp_...35-8463.html#22. Note that the translations listed generally indicate circle, circuit - flat, two dimensional shapes.\n \n Interestingly, there is the word duwr which can mean ball, that is a three dimensional object, that Isaiah does use in 22:18 http://www.blueletterbible.org/tmp_...25-1342.html#18. \n\n \n Personally I think the verse where Joshua states that he stopped the sun in the sky instead of stopping the earth from rotating is more of an indication the Bible is not scientifically accurate.",

That some people at some point chose to treat a metaphorical description as a literal description is what? Your proof that the Bible is not science? The teachings of many stated earlier are not good enough \n \n By your falsifying factor if I can find a scientist of some repute who made a claim later shown to be ludicrous, all of science is faulty. (But is it, is it science that is faulty?)\n \n Further, Jesus taught to love one another. Some Christians have committed wars; proof for you that Christianity is flawed.\n \n \n A hundred years from now if there is so much evidence that no one doubts evolution, this same debate will be taking place with evolution instead of the rotation of the earth around the sun. Every time something the church thinks is against their teachings is proven wrong, they just say 'well they were just not interpreting scripture correctly and it's because scientist influenced them in the wrong direction'. What the Bible REALLY says is........... \n\n \n Mmmm. As for the evidence of science being interpreted in different ways. On an earlier post I stated how evidence has shown the evolution of a mollusc has changed from A-B-C to C-B-A to they are all part of the same species. Over the years people have looked at the same evidence and drawn the order of evolution the opposite to what was previously cited.\n \n Your point? It escapes me. As a 'Christian' you seem to take delight in people making mistakes in interpretation, but not if they are scientists - which is still why you've not responded to when I mentioned about the four very different schools of thought on the rise of man.\n \n Yet, you are all for interpreting the Bible 'for yourself'. This is such a strange stance. At once you're both condemning people for making errors, and then promoting them in creating them.\n \n \nThe 'Dark Ages' are not generally considered to extend until the 17th Century. \n\n \nI was meaning to give one of the reasons for the dark ages and it sounded like I was saying the dark ages were in the 17th century.

I can pick up a book on Anatomy and it too won't say \"Don't interpret this for yourself\" Common sense tells you that a book that is 'heavy' requires more thought. If you have no common sense, and you believe that the worth of all books is equal then we are on totally different wave-lengths.\n \n Why was Treasure Island written? Why was the Bible written? You must think 'to entertain' or 'to deceive' are valid answers.\n \n I don't know what the church's stance on it is, of even if they have a stance. \n\n \nWHAT! You are thinking for yourself? Where do you believe that the Bible allows for you to interpret it for yourself? You'd better get your act together young man. LOL \n\n \n If the Church doesn't have a dogmatic approach to something then I can object. Even when the Church has tried to change dogma, I can object.\n \n There are laws in your country . There are penalties for breaking them. Has this ever taken your 'Free Will' away? Why do you think that people who follow a teaching are any less thinking than you.\n \n Obviously you hated your parents and rejected everything that they taught you; in the interest of pursuing this 'independent thinking' that you champion.\n \n \nI do know that there are churchmen who believe that the world is young; the late Fr Seraphim Rose. I like his books. He quotes a great many Church Fathers who believe in a literal six day creation. \n\n \nI took a look at the link you posted. The most interesting thing I saw was this part: \n Quote: \n \"I believe that our interpretation of Holy Scripture should be bound up with no scientific theory, neither \"evolutionary\" nor any other.

And you wonder why science and this type of religion are at odds? \n\n \n What 'evidence'? Evolution changes all the time. What you believe in now (neo-Darwinism), is not what Darwin believed in. You keep changing the thing, but you smile and say... sure we don't believe in this anymore, but what we have now is what you should believe. And in 20 years time (this by the way is the same argument you used a few paragraphs about the Bible) you can throw away some of the teachings that you're using now (and what you ridicule people over - if they don't believe in them).\n \n I don't wonder why science and religion are at odds. True science is not about finding ways to rule God out.\n \n What he's saying is that there is an arrogance to believe that the human mind can ever know it all. Sometimes, it's best just to appreciate a picture rather than to guess what it 'means'.\n \n You probably trust people who tell you that life began from non-life. There is no evidence.

The answer given is that either (A): Egypt's history isn't complete enough to be sure whether or not this happened, (B): God changed his mind, or (C): this even has yet to occur. (A) has already been addressed. Egypt was a major player back in those days so even if their history didn't mention them being completely desolate for 40 years someone elses history would have IE Babylons. (C) has also been covered and because of the names and specifics given about these people who are not alive today and based on the Tyre passage before this stating that Babylon would get rewarded right after the failed Tyre battle, I find it hard to believe that anyone would consider this an option. (B) is your best bet but it also has already been addressed and the key with this one is that with Tyre at least it said in the Bible that God changed his mind. With this one it mentions nothing of the sort. Therefore we can assumed that at any given time God may change his mind and never let anyone know. Therefore all of Revelations may be invalid as God could have already changed his mind on this and won't go through with it. This of course also shows that the Bible is NOT perfect and contains a failed prophecy without any explaination.\n \n Is this the type of answer you really wanted to explain this failed prophecy?\n \n I have seen this website in the past and probably even responded to it on these website. The answers given are shaky in my opinion and I'm not trying to be at all bias here. The fact is that this site should somehow prove that what is said in the Bible is true if you want it to provide an answer that works for your side of the debate. (A) is the only one that does as much and simply having a (B) and (C) option shows how unsure he was of (A) being correct. (B) basically says that there is a failed prophecy and really agrees with me more than anything else while the (C) argument is just a shot in the dark as it makes no sense.\n \n To respond to your opinion that this is a \"Misinterpretation\", (A) shows it not to be as such as it has nothing to do with interpretation, (B) would also have nothing to do with interpretation as it is simply something that was literal that never came true because God changed his mind, and (C) would be the only misinterpretation theory shown here and it seems the most unlikely to me.\n \n So, which of these options do you choose as the answer to this issue? Based on your misinterpretation idea it would have to be (C) but in reality I think almost inevitably you will go with (A) as it is your only hope of really defending this issue. (C) is difficult to defend to say the least and (B) is borderline agreeing that the Bible is not to be trusted especially in the predications of future events. In an unbiased view do you think that there is a possibility that Egypt was desolate for 40 years and no one wrote anything about it throughout the entire world including Babylon and the Egyption trade partners including the Greeks?\n \n I look forward to hearing which answer you agree with so we can narrow our debate towards that.",

YOU WILL NEVER EVER EVER PROVE GOD EXISTS, but at the sametime you will never prove he doesn't...\n\n \n This is not at all my point. My whole point was just proven by your statement here and that point is that the Bible is not 100% factual. Your statement that God will do certain things for a reason rather than just for the sake of truth is enough to show the Bible is not factual and therefore makes my point. Your belief and mine coincide but I don't think you really see what I am trying to argue here therefore you feel the need to debate me. All I am trying to say is that the Bible has a single failed prophecy in it therefore it may have more. I never said this failed prophecy isn't the word of God nor did I say that the purpose of this failed prophecy was lost on what it was intended to do. I simply state that the Bible has a failed prophecy in it. Do you really deny this at this point?\n \n \nI'm sorry that probably sounds like a scam, but the truth is Isaiah 6:9-10 pretty much rings true, the Bible is only for those that have faith, and if you don't have it, you will be blinded by lies.\n\n \n The Bible is for all of mankind unless you believe the Bible was created simply for those who already believed and shouldn't be used by those who don't. I use it to get a better understanding of what God is and I believe I have done so by realizing that what is said in the Bible really does have flaws in it. I was meant to realize this for a reason and I am going with this just as you are probably meant to spread the word of what you believe to be true. We are both serving a purpose here set forth by God and for a reason as well.\n \n \nHere is more information that will help you DOUBT even more prophecies... http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/bible.html\n\n \n You have to understand that I only focus on one prophecy for the sake of simplifying the argument and because all I need is one to make my point. I don't care if there are more failures in the Bible at this point. All I am trying to establish is that there is at least one flaw and I'm not even sure where I go from there.\n \n \nI'm giving it to you because the fact is everyone of those issues the author raises can be refuted. because like I said that's the point, we are supposed to have faith, that is the foundation of Christianity... we are not supposed to have proof of his excisitance unless we open our eyes... and trust me if you open your eyes you really start to see the truth...\n\n \n I have faith in God but not in the Bible. The Bible is not God and you don't need a Bible to have faith in God. The Bible lays down the basics but has alternate motives all throughout it which are there to achieve things that we do not understand but nonetheless are not completely true. Take for instance the Egyptian battle with Babylon. If it was a failed prophecy and it was meant for another purpose by God what purpose was it? Surely the world is different today in a way that God wanted it to be because of what was written here even if the prophecy was not true.\n \n \nSorry I could not supply hard scientifict fact, but no one can :) or ever will be able to... in fact all of this is really a waste of time and a dervision from our really purpose, and if you've read the Bible you will know what that is...\n\n \n Another point I'll make is that our purpose is not laid out in the Bible. Do you really think our purpose as a race is to simply exist and then vanish from the Earth after only a few thousand years? If enough people believe this then it will be true and perhaps this is what the Bible will lead us up to. But is this Gods purpose? Perhaps it is time for the world to see that the Bible is not what it seems and that we are not doomed to follow the path it shows being laid out for us. The Egyptian's controlled their own destiny! They did not follow the path of the Bible and they still exist today while the Babylonians are gone from this Earth. Do you think this thought alone may have any relevance at all to our future? I believe it does.\n \n \nOn a side note, have you actually read the Bible? or do you just read peoples opinions and what not?\n\n \n I have read parts of the Bible, revelations for the most part. Prophecies are my greatest interest in the Bible and I have read most of them. I've read many more peoples opinions on the Bible than I have of the actual Bible to be sure but I have learned more from you and other people who have shared their opinion with me than I did from the Bible itself. The Bible has shown me one key to understanding God while you and others have shown me many. Truely he speaks to us all and our opinions reflect that much better than the Bible does. The Bible was my base while the building blocks were laid by the people I discussed the Bible with. Soon I will have my own temple of knowledge and will hopefully be able to use it to make a difference in my life and others.",

Would you blindly follow God as the Babylonians did? Since you have really yet to answer my questions in past posts I don't expect you will answer this one either.\n \n On a side note, trying to compare LOTR to the Bible does sound a bit foolish to me, doesn't it to you?",

I feel the answer that have been given are sufficient and more importantly I believe that is rather unimportant anyway... if you know anything about christianity it is about living a life for jesus and spreading his saving word. Life is about saving God's creation so that it can live forever in the after life, in heaven, rather then in hell. So I don't waste my time debating little verses that will never be proven one way or the other until God's return, and the fact is even if we did prove all the prophecies of the Bible people would still doubt. Jesus performed MIRICLES right in front of people and still they doubted, so what will proving some prophecies accoumplish... on a side not if you do prove them all I would still consider that a huge accomplishment.\n \n\n The Bible is very complex, there is no doubt about that.

When you die Jesus reveals that to you anyway,so why waste time now? why not save some more people? why not use your life in that way?\n \n I'm not arguing anything or debating anything, I'm open to discussion but I'm also busy, and most of these discussions are circular, and many of the verses of the Bible have been debated over for centuries... all that really matters is that you agree that Jesus must come into your life and save you...",

This essentially puts to rest the idea that the actual events of the Bible did occur.\n \n Logically it seems to me that there is a conflict between what was supposed to happen and what did happen. The explaination for how this prophecy could have been fulfilled escapes me and has led me to believe that this is a failed prophecy. If this is the case then the ramifications of this are that the Bible can not be considered to be 100% factual and that puts into question the idea that we are destine to follow the path laid down for us in Revelations.",

I never said this failed prophecy isn't the word of God nor did I say that the purpose of this failed prophecy was lost on what it was intended to do. I simply state that the Bible has a failed prophecy in it. Do you really deny this at this point?\n \n \n \n The Bible is for all of mankind unless you believe the Bible was created simply for those who already believed and shouldn't be used by those who don't. I use it to get a better understanding of what God is and I believe I have done so by realizing that what is said in the Bible really does have flaws in it. I was meant to realize this for a reason and I am going with this just as you are probably meant to spread the word of what you believe to be true. We are both serving a purpose here set forth by God and for a reason as well.\n \n \n \n You have to understand that I only focus on one prophecy for the sake of simplifying the argument and because all I need is one to make my point. I don't care if there are more failures in the Bible at this point. All I am trying to establish is that there is at least one flaw and I'm not even sure where I go from there.\n \n \n \n I have faith in God but not in the Bible. The Bible is not God and you don't need a Bible to have faith in God. The Bible lays down the basics but has alternate motives all throughout it which are there to achieve things that we do not understand but nonetheless are not completely true. Take for instance the Egyptian battle with Babylon. If it was a failed prophecy and it was meant for another purpose by God what purpose was it? Surely the world is different today in a way that God wanted it to be because of what was written here even if the prophecy was not true.\n \n \n \n Another point I'll make is that our purpose is not laid out in the Bible. Do you really think our purpose as a race is to simply exist and then vanish from the Earth after only a few thousand years? If enough people believe this then it will be true and perhaps this is what the Bible will lead us up to. But is this Gods purpose? Perhaps it is time for the world to see that the Bible is not what it seems and that we are not doomed to follow the path it shows being laid out for us. The Egyptian's controlled their own destiny! They did not follow the path of the Bible and they still exist today while the Babylonians are gone from this Earth. Do you think this thought alone may have any relevance at all to our future? I believe it does.\n \n \n \n I have read parts of the Bible, revelations for the most part. Prophecies are my greatest interest in the Bible and I have read most of them. I've read many more peoples opinions on the Bible than I have of the actual Bible to be sure but I have learned more from you and other people who have shared their opinion with me than I did from the Bible itself. The Bible has shown me one key to understanding God while you and others have shown me many. Truely he speaks to us all and our opinions reflect that much better than the Bible does. The Bible was my base while the building blocks were laid by the people I discussed the Bible with. Soon I will have my own temple of knowledge and will hopefully be able to use it to make a difference in my life and others.\n\n \n Wow, I strongly agree with you. I am glad to see that I am not the only one who feels that you can believe in God and not in the Bible. It is a great book with a great lesson, but so is War in Peace. LOL",

   "This is a half-truth. You have shifted the belief in a geocentric universe from all of Christendom to those at the trial. You were given plenty of quotes earlier about Church teaching on this factor, this is not good for your anti-religious stance however, so you ignore them and focus on a few. That some people at some point chose to treat a metaphorical description as a literal description is what? Your proof that the Bible is not science? The teachings of many stated earlier are not good enough \n\n \n What is a geocentric universe? LOL\n \n \nBy your falsifying factor if I can find a scientist of some repute who made a claim later shown to be ludicrous, all of science is faulty. (But is it, is it science that is faulty?)\n\n \n The nature of science is to come up with theories as to why and how things happen, use the evidence to verify or falsify the theory, continue to check the theory with new evidence as it is discovered. If the \n evidence at any time contradicts the theory, then the theory must be discarded. The nature of your religion is to state that you have the whole truth and that all the evidence must be interpreted in light of what you know to be the truth. Therefore science is self-correcting and expects to have some theories falsified. You shouldn&#8217;t have to correct anything is you have the whole truth.\n \n \nMmmm. As for the evidence of science being interpreted in different ways. On an earlier post I\n stated how evidence has shown the evolution of a mollusc has changed from A-B-C to C-B-A to they are all part of the same species. Over the years people have looked at the same evidence and drawn the order of evolution the opposite to what was previously cited.\n \n Your point? It escapes me. As a &#8216;Christian&#8217; you seem to take delight in people making mistakes in interpretation, but not if they are scientists &#8211; which is still why you&#8217;ve not responded to when I mentioned about the four very different schools of thought on the rise of man.\n\n \n I&#8217;m not an expert in the different schools of thought on the rise of man so I&#8217;ll wait for the experts to work it out. The exact path that evolution followed that resulted in man is still being debated. However it&#8217;s obvious from the evidence that man evolved. When I investigate the collapse of a structure I&#8217;m not always able to come up with the exact cause. But I can always tie it down to two or three different possibilities based on the evidence. And the structure did collapse regardless of whether I can determine the exact cause or not. And mankind did evolve regardless of whether we ever discover every detail or not.\n \n Were you saying that you think I am a Christian?\n \n \nYet, you are all for interpreting the Bible &#8216;for yourself&#8217;. This is such a strange stance. At once you&#8217;re both condemning people for making errors, and then promoting them in creating them. \n\n \n I can see how you would think that thinking for yourself is strange. In fact I can see where you would think that thinking at all is strange. LOL\n \n \nThis is a western Protestant response. The Orthodox Church maintained much of the science which gave birth to the Renaissance &#8211; when the east was over-run by the Turks, and many learned men fled west. The tying in of Church to ignorance as you do here is based on bias. \n\n \n I wasn&#8217;t tying the church to ignorance. They knew exactly what they were doing. They were persecuting anyone that didn&#8217;t toe the line.\n \n \nAnd I trust the Church. They&#8217;ve been learning and studying for 2,000 years. \n\n \n Well they have been studying, don&#8217;t know about the learning. LOL\n \n If you had been alive during the time of Jesus, you would have been one of those that went right along with the condemning of Jesus because you wouldn&#8217;t have seen anything but what the church told you.\n \n \nAgain your a priori beliefs. It is not dogma to determined when I go to the loo. \n\n \n You mean that&#8217;s not a religious experience. LOL\n \n \nWhat about the Orthdoox? Again your western bias; we don&#8217;t even get a mention. \n\n \n So I left out the minor denominations. Get over it and quit whining.\n \n \nWhy was Treasure Island written? Why was the Bible written? You must think &#8216;to entertain&#8217; or &#8216;to deceive&#8217; are valid answers. \n\n \n Well some of the parts where they are describing in detail the sexual exploits of the kings are pretty entertaining. LOL\n \n \nIf the Church doesn&#8217;t have a dogmatic approach to something then I can object. Even when the Church has tried to change dogma, I can object.\n\n \n Well you said you didn&#8217;t know if the church had a stance. You could be sinning and going to hell and not even know it.\n \n So does the church ever change their dogma?\n \n \nThere are laws in your country . There are penalties for breaking them. Has this ever taken your &#8216;Free Will&#8217; away? Why do you think that people who follow a teaching are any less thinking than you.\n\n \n Because you blindly follow a dogma regardless of the evidence.\n \n \nObviously you hated your parents and rejected everything that they taught you; in the interest of pursuing this &#8216;independent thinking&#8217; that you champion. \n\n \n When I was a little boy, I believed everything my parents said. Thankfully my parents taught me to think for myself and as I got older, I made up my own mind about what I believed based on the evidence and logical thinking. If you grow up and believe everything someone has taught you, even your parents, you are a robot.\n \n \nWhat &#8216;evidence&#8217;? Evolution changes all the time. What you believe in now (neo-Darwinism), is not what Darwin believed in. You keep changing the thing, but you smile and say&#8230; sure we don&#8217;t believe in this anymore, but what we have now is what you should believe. And in 20 years time (this by the way is the same argument you used a few paragraphs about the Bible) you can throw away some of the teachings that you&#8217;re using now (and what you ridicule people over &#8211; if they don&#8217;t believe in them).\n\n \n The theory of evolution hasn&#8217;t changed. The exact details of how it works has been revised over the years. All theories are exactly like that. The theory of gravity hasn&#8217;t changed but the details of how it works has been revised because we have learned a lot more about it.\n \n \nI don&#8217;t wonder why science and religion are at odds. True science is not about finding ways to rule God out.\n\n \n Science has nothing to do with God.\n \n \nWhat he&#8217;s saying is that there is an arrogance to believe that the human mind can ever know it all. \n\n \n Science is always looking at new evidence. The church is the only one that says they have the whole truth and they know it all.\n \n \nSometimes, it&#8217;s best just to appreciate a picture rather than to guess what it &#8216;means&#8217;.\n\n \n Yep most creationist would love it if no one ever asked questions.\n \n \nYou probably trust people who tell you that life began from non-life. There is no evidence. There were no witnesses.\n\n \n Well even for those that believe God created man 6k years ago, he created it from non-life. What difference does it make to you whether he created it in five minutes or five billion years?\n \n Anyone that believes there is no evidence that life began from non-life is either mentally challenged, or ignorant of the facts, or just plain doesn&#8217;t want to look at the facts. There are no witnesses to lots of murders either but lots of people get convicted.",

What other than your parents influence made you change your mind on this?\n \n \nand i mistakenly said Iraq is Iraq.... I meant Iraq is Babylon.\n\n \n I looked at a map of Babylon and although it extended into parts of Iraq it also was part of many other nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and I believe even Iran. But for sake of argument lets assume Babylon is Iraq. Who is the king that is spoke about in the prophecy who faught against Tyre and lost? Tyre is Lebanon. Who in the world is going to lose a war to them at this point?\n \n But that whole point is moot anyways. Try to deny this while maintaining an open mind on this situation. The war against Tyre actually happened and was very literal. God addressed it as already having occurred so it will not happen again. He then said he would provide a repayment to the armies who faught against Tyre as well as the King who led that army. Now, how would that army still get repayment along with that king? Even if Iraq went to war with Lebanon today and lost it still wouldn't make any sense that this would have been the war against Tyre mentioned in the Bible as that war has already occurred. Even if Iraq managed to get Egypt to be completely desolate for fourty years it still wouldn't make any sense that this event would have been the one foretold about in the Bible as no one who faught in the war against Tyre would be getting any spoils from it. If you would open your mind to this situation you would see it is not possible that it will happen in the future. The Bible already addresses all of this well enough to show that the fall of Egypt was to happen at the hands of those who failed in Tyre and they would be the ones to reap the spoils.\n \n \nSo put that into perspective..

   "Just thought I would jump in (I know, I know, you're so glad to see me)...\n If I try giving the Biblical prophesies the benefit of the doubt, knowing what I know about visions and prophesies in general; \n a) visions are very difficult to explain in words, especially when things in the vision go beyond the understanding of the visioner,\n b) sometimes things get mixed up or mangled in this dream-like state, such that a current super-power (say, Egypt or Babylon) could get mixed up with a future super-power, \n therefore even if the the Biblical prophesies seem slightly inconsistent (like clearly speaking of Babylon, then all of a sudden meaning a Babylon-like future Nation), it might be possible that some have yet to come to be.\n However, this doesn't seem to be consistent with the belief that every word of the Bible is verified by God.\n\n \n That is a very good post! (at least so far)\n (I'm sure you're thrilled that I like it :) )\n \n When you say 'verified' do you mean like in quality control?\n \n My understanding is that the Holy Spirit had been a guiding force behind the Bible. It's not the same as the Koran - where Muslims believe that the angel of their god actually dictated word for word.\n \n David's Psalms for instance are in many ways collections of prayers (songs) based on how he felt towards God. They are inspired by God.\n \n Then there are 'politics' involved. The Bible of the Luther Church, we know has been slightly modified to suit Martin Luther's spin on certain beliefs; such as salvation through sola fide.\n \n It is for these reasons the Orthodox Church does not rely solely on the Bible. We believe in teachings through Church Councils, through Holy Tradition, through Church Fathers inspired also by the Holy Spirit.\n \n Even when a Church Council has made a ruling, it has to be accepted by the people of the church. Twice significant council rulings (there could be more; I'm only aware of two) were overturned by the people; the issue raging around the iconoclasm controversy in the 800s and the filioque clause in the 1400s)\n \n \nNonetheless, I could accept a slightly wonky prophesy because I know that visions and powers of that nature are hard to bring into concrete \"rational\" terms.\n What I don't understand at all is what I think the more fundamental logical inconsistency- re: the Second Coming-\n If you accept the Biblical world-view that the Universe was created in six days, and has only existed for a few millennia,\n and that in Biblical times people were going around saying \"the Kingdom is at hand\" (2000 years ago, that is some 1/3 of the total time the Universe is supposed to have existed in total),\n would you say that either \n a) God changed his mind, he's keeping his son to himself and given up on us \n b) Jesus was a fake, Elijah has not returned yet (through John the Baptist, etc), and the Messiah has yet to save us \n c) these visions/stories were political and contemporary of the time, and were not about all of humanity nor of one God\n d) ?\n \n\n \n Err? God did send His Son! I've no idea what you're talking about here.\n \n The problem with divine revlation as I see it is sort of like playing a whizz bang stereo DVD on a small mono b/w tv system... it looses something along the way. God is hardly knowable by us, but we try.",

The prophets either weren't able to fully understand or describe their prophesies.\n\n \n Yes, they put the Bible before the Church. We put the Bible together, so we put the Church before the Bible. We believe that Holy Tradition is the Bible as best understood. But, we do believe in a literal creation - at least those of us who hold true to our teachings - because a great many church thinkers have spoken out so.\n \n We for instance hold Mary to be the highest of all humans (Jesus though human was also divine; and of course is higher than her because of this). This is something that Protestants will want us to show Biblical evidence for. There is some. But there is also Tradition that teaches about Mary as well. (Our church year is based around her - the first feast for the year is to do with her, as is the last - so much for being misogynists!). We venerate her and we call her Theotokos (Mother of God).\n \n If you want; ask a Protestant for Biblical proof that they should worship on a Sunday. There is virtually none (if memory serves there is none), but they rely on the fact that the early church switched days - founding a tradition :)\n \n We do hold the word of the Bible true - but as interpreted by our Church :)*\n \n There are times when Orthodox will not try to work something out - we just say 'it's a mystery... we are but feeble men ... we accept it as a mystery'.\n \n \nErr? God did send His Son! I've no idea what you're talking about here.\n\n \n \nI'm talking about the Second Coming.

So, here we are.... where's the Son of God?\n\n \n Sorry. I misunderstood you (again). Indeed, the terms were used 'kingdom of God is at hand'. And indeed, some early churchmen may have taken that to mean pretty soon.\n \n But we're also taught not to speculate on when 'it' will be. Orthodox aren't supposed to second-guess this one. It's a mystery!**\n \n \n *We believe that the first person to interpret the Bible for himself, was the Pope, who began to acquire powers not known in the collegiate system of the early church; where all bishops were equal.\n \n Once he lead the Catholic Church away from orthodox teaching he began to innovate. (Catholics will claim that we broke from them). Martin Luther in turn broke away from the excesses of the Catholic Church, and rather than return to original teachings, innovated with new doctrine; such as the primacy of the Bible.\n \n **I did a quote somewhere else on this forum from \"Voice in the Wilderness\" (printed by the Greek Orthodox Parish in Brisbane) about this very speculation - but I'm too lazy to look it up again.",

   "LOL when did I say I knew what God was thinking... ROFL have you even read the BIBLE? You can not take every passage literally, it's like any book, it has analagies it has metaphors it has parables... Jesus even clearly states he uses parables...\n \n You can not take ever passage literally... in fact the Bible speaks of many creatures that are in fact just tanks or helicopters, BUT they are explained in John's limited knowledge of todays technology so how could he explain them with literal terms?

ONCE AGAIN I ask you what does the BIBLE teach about man's purpose on earth? if you don't even know that then don't even think about picking apart the Bible...\n\n \n What you are failing to realize is that science has forced you to interpret the Bible.

   "No more or less than Christianity. Many people choose/chose to convert to Islam, and many people have been forced, as with Christianity.\n\n \n I have gone over this in much more detail in the \"Religion\" forum under the topic of Islam.\n \n Although you are in part correct, your argument might be the type to say \"Nazism, sure it killed some people, but so did the democracies\" There are fundamental differences though between the Nazism and democracy.\n \n Christians have been cruel in spite of Christ. Moslems have been cruel because of Muhammad.\n \n Compare the teachings of the two... even if you believe both are mere men.\n \n Christ said to turn the other cheek. There is no such equivalent in Islam.\n \n Muhammad lead forces into battle. He ordered the killing of PoWs. He married a six year old girl - consummating the 'marriage' when she was nine - though he had desired her for a lot longer. Christ did none of these things.\n \n Compare the first 300 years of their histories...\n \n Christianity was widely despised and persecuted, but still spread throughout the Roman Empire\n \n Islam conquered vast areas of Christian lands and then imposed harsh laws against non-converts - who were given special status \"dhimmi\" - they were made to wear special clothing, pay special taxes etc (sounds like the Nazis hey?). They eradicated whole Arab tribes that refused to convert. They knocked down churches and temples, and were even more harsh on the Zoroastrians of Persia.\n \n Simply put there is no sense of proportion to your understatement. It is like the reasons white colonists used for decimating whole indigenous populations - because they too were 'barbaric' the scale of things, and the reasons for these barbarisms are different - even if they result in death. You were on another forum champion the rights of 'savages'. Now you've seem to switch arguments that would allow for the excusing of the cruel suppression of 'savagery.\n \n Wiccan and pagan beliefs are even less tolerated in Muslim nations.

That means that they taught their offspring about God....and so on and so forth. Where was this chain broken? It doesn't make sense.\n\n \n The chain was broken when Adam and Eve sinned. They came to know imperfection. Everything they did there after was tinged with their fallen state. Even their teaching of their children would have been flawed. Witness their own sons - one slew the other, evidence of the imperfect world into which we as humans had entered.\n \n The Old Testament talks of the sins carried out in the time of Noah, and in the time of the Tower of Babel. All the way up to St.Peter who knew Jesus, who still denied knowing Him, and Judas who betrayed Him.\n \n We are imperfect beings.\n \n \n It makes more sense to think that as we slowly started to evolve and communication became better and better and we migrated all over the world religion began to take over. Everyone has the hunger to know where we came from. In order to explain this each area of the world and their people tried to tell the tale of the start of the world.\n\n \n This linear thinking of a progression from less to more does not always work. We know that ancient people knew a lot more than what we used to give them credit for. If you believe in the continual progress of man, then so be it. I believe man can know more, but because he is fallen, will always display this fallen state - hence wars are getting worse because our knowledge (of how to kill) has gotten better, but our fallen state has not prevented us from killing.\n \n I think knowing and understand the true state of man best explains why we're still acting like arses and treating people in the third world like nothings - only now we can treat people as commodities by computer.\n \n Why do you think there is a 'great flood' 'tale' in most places around the world?\n \n \nYes some people in other countries believe the same thing, but you must admit that more than likely where you are born dictates your beliefs.

I haven't 'seen' it, but I know of one. But it wasn't solely about evolution. Churchill was a social Darwinist who believed in social evolution - weeding out undesirables etc. He went to war with a more extremist point of this view - Nazism.",
