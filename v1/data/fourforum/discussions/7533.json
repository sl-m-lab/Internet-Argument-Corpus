   "Very difficult choice with so many to choose from, I'm just interested in hearing which books people out there have really enjoyed or been affected, even changed by. Pick one book, pick ten, I don't mind.\n Personally I don't read nearly enough 'serious' fiction; whenever friends recommend books to me and I actually read them, there are some that are fascinating and some authors who just write beautifully, but mostly I stick to non-fiction (mostly history, politics and science), and, I'll admit it, sci-fi and fantasy.\n Anyway, my choices:\n \n Joseph Heller - Catch 22\n George Orwell - 1984\n Iain M. Banks - Excession\n Stephen King - The Gunslinger\n Hunter S. Thompson - The Great Shark Hunt\n Philip Short - Mao: A Life\n Stephen Baxter - Evolution: A Novel\n Mervyn Peake - Gormenghast\n \n And, just for the hell of it, the undisputed worst book I have ever read\n \n Dan Brown - The Da Vinci Code",

   "Catch-22 because it's the funniest, cleverest and most poignant book I can ever imagine being written.\n 1984 because it may be the most important book ever written.\n Excession because Banks has the world's most extraordinary imagination and is leagues ahead of the rest of contemporary sci-fi.\n The Gunslinger because I love the Dark Tower series and this is the best (and first) one, it really sets the otherworldly, epic, apocalyptic tone for the series.\n I could have mentioned any HS Thompson book because his writing style is unique, but this was the first one I read. RIP.\n The Mao book is just literally unbelievable, when you read about the events of his life it's easy to see why he has been practically deified by the Chinese.\n The Evolution book is just really ambitious: a billion-year story in which almost all the 'characters' are animals, links in the evolutionary chain leading to humans and continuing after our demise. \n And Gormenghast because I just fell in love with Peake's poetic descriptive passages and eccentric characters; his writing is somehow beautiful and ugly at the same time.\n \n As for the Da Vinci Code, what an over-hyped, underwhelming, pointless, boring, predictable, unfulfilling, pretentious piece of pseudo-intellectual trash this is.\n In fact it's basically a scam; a blatantly formulaic thriller with enough controversial subject matter to ensure huge publicity and a big wad of cash.\n Dan Brown should have his arms removed to stop him writing any more books, then he should be bound, gagged, riveted into a steel container, shot into space and vapourised with nuclear weapons, all paid for by the money that he made from a book whose sole contribution to my life was to steal an evening from it.",

(I believe I heard or saw or read with Tom Hanks.)\n \n As for my favorite book, let me just say that I don't do much reading. I got turned off of a lot of reading in Elementary School where all we read were stories about school aged girls who just sit around and talk. Now, for a boy in the 5th grade, that is the boringest thing you can think of. Then all through school, I hated reading what we had to read. Sometimes, we'd get the chance to read what we chose to read. These were the ones I had a greater chance of enjoying. At the same time, I wound up hating most of the books that we were forced to read.\n Now when I was in Elementary school (and early middle school) I enjoied the Bunnicula books by James Howe. Those were stories surrounding a dog, a cat, a vampire bunny that would suck the juces out of fruits and later on, a dochand puppy. The novels included Bunnicula; Howliday Inn; Return To Howliday Inn; Nighty Nightmare; and The Celery Stalks At Midnight.\n \n As I got older (and more into Science Fiction) I started to read Star Trek books and various others of that genre. I started liking a trillogy of Star Trek books called The Q Continuum. Also, I read The Hitchhicker's Guide To The Galaxy and then I read The Restaurant At The End Of The Univers. I think I liked the second one better. But that may be changed eventually.\n \n Now, I've gotten somewhere to the middle of Don Quixote and enjoying it. And that's where I am in reading books.",

   "Well, if you like your science fiction, can I suggest Philip K. Dick, Peter F. Hamilton, Iain M. Banks (why they all feel the need to include their middle initial I don't know), Stephen Baxter, Alistair Reynolds and Tad Williams.\n Their writing is less accessible than Star Trek books or Douglas Adams (sorry, hope that doesn't sound patronising), but I love these authors because their inventiveness knows no bounds and they are all great storytellers to boot. One quote from the back of a Banks novel sums up why I love this genre: \"It's a gymnasium for the imagination!\". And I can't recommend Banks highly enough. The man is a genius.\n I know a lot of people who've been turned off reading for one reason or another, but if you've taken the plunge with something like Don Quixote I can only congratulate you. I haven't read it but it's one of those that my friends keep trying to get me to start. Hope you enjoy it!",

   "Nothing to be embarassed about reading Sci-Fi and fantasy. Despite the reputation for being escapist or simply poorly written, I don't think it is any more than other fiction. There are some masterpieces of both genres, and they have the advantage over contemporary fiction in that they are largely not aspirational. Bridget Jones and the like are of the wish-fulfillment ilk, sci-fi and fantasy tend to be more explicitly plot and character focussed, and importantly able to explore complex issues without some of the cultural baggage that contemporary fiction must endure.",

Slaughterhouse Five is a standout as well as Cat's Cradle.\n \n The Dune series was pretty damned good and so was the Lord of the Rings books (before the movies came out) as well as the Silmarillion (sp?) but that one was a tad boring, but interesting.",

   "My absolute favorites:\n Forrest Carter: The Education of Little Tree- I don't think any other book has made me laugh out loud and cry as much and to the degree this has. It is an amazing story. And for anyone who is looking for something new to read, this isn't too long or too difficult to read, but it will impact you.\n \n J.K. Rowling: The Harry Potter series- Years from now all you haters (emoticon_xangel ) will be astonished when this is looked at as great literature. It's not just hype. It's not just a fad. It is a great series. I put the whole series up here for the same reason I put all of Lord of the Rings as one, because it really is one continuous story, but if I had to pick just one, it would probably be The Order of the Phoenix.\n \n J.R.R. Tolkien: Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit- I don't think I really need to explain myself here:) . Suffice it to say that there is a reason these books are second only to the Bible in terms of level of readership.\n \n John Irving: A Prayer for Owen Meany- A great story of fate and friendship. Complex and deeply layered without being pretensious or contrived.\n \n Other favorites:\n John Steinbeck: Of Mice and Men- I could put any John Steinbeck book on here and be satisfied. John Steinbeck writes like the blues feels: raw, gritty, direct, and visceral, and nobody does it better.\n \n Ray Bradbury: The Illustrated Man- Not a novel so much as a series of interconnected short stories. \"The Veldt\" is great and a favorite among many fans of this book. I love it too, but my personal favorite is \"Kaleidoscope.\"\n \n Joseph Heller: Catch 22- For all the reasons mentioned above. The fact that it is written out of chronological order can make it difficult to follow at first, but is extremely unique and fascinating once you get the feel for it. And few novels have made me laugh so hard.\n \n T.R. Reid: Confucious Lives Next Door- Somewhere between a memoir and a sociological study, this is an absolute must read for anyone interested in how we in the West, and particularly the U.S. could be doing better, or for anyone interested in Southeast Asia in general. Since reading this book, I have not looked at such things as crime, drugs, education, health care, and business the same as I did before and never will again.\n \n Michael Patrick Macdonald: All Souls- A deeply touching memoir of a man's growing up in South Boston. I was completely wrapped up in the story of this guy's family and his neighborhood. I never wanted to put it down.\n \n A lot of these books are \"classics\" I know. I'm not saying these are my favorites to be snotty, I simply haven't done as much reading as I'd like to outside of school, and many, although certainly not all, of these I read for school at one point or another.\n \n If I think of others, I'll put them up here.\n \n \nThe Dune series was pretty damned good and so was the Lord of the Rings books (before the movies came out)\n\n The books are no longer good because there are films of them? That doesn't make much sense.",

   "Lewis Carroll Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass\n My all time, top all, bar none favorite books. Equally the most frightening and amusing literature I've ever read. You could study these books for years and still not know everything about them.\n \n David Anthony Durham Pride of Carthage\n Mostly because I love ancient history.\n \n Wilbur Smith River God\n Again, ancient history.\n \n Robert Heinlein Starship Troopers\n Not a big fan of his other stuff, but I love this book simply because of the way you can use it to support almost any point, even opposing ones.\n \n Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex\n Simply an excellent book.\n \n J.R.R Tolkien Lord of the Rings Trillogy\n Really, do I need to explain why?\n \n There are others, but these are the top ones.",
