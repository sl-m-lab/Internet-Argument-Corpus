   "Muslims ransack Christian village\n By KHALED ABU TOAMEH\n TAIBA\n \n \n Efforts were under way on Sunday to calm the situation in this Christian village east of Ramallah after an attack by hundreds of Muslim men from nearby villages left many houses and vehicles torched. \n \n The incident began on Saturday night and lasted until early Sunday, when Palestinian Authority security forces interfered to disperse the attackers. Residents said several houses were looted and many families were forced to flee to Ramallah and other Christian villages, although no one was injured. \n \n The attack on the village of 1,500 was triggered by the murder of a Muslim woman from the nearby village of Deir Jarir earlier this week. The 30-year-old woman, according to PA security sources, was apparently murdered by members of her family for having had a romance with a Christian man from Taiba. \n \n \"When her family discovered that she had been involved in a forbidden relationship with a Christian, they apparently forced her to drink poison,\" said one source. \"Then they buried her without reporting her death to the relevant authorities.\" \n \n When the PA security forces decided to launch an investigation into the woman's death, her family protested for fear that the relationship would be exposed. The family was further infuriated by the decision to exhume the body for autopsy. \n \n \"More than 500 Muslim men, chanting Allahu akbar [God is great], attacked us at night,\" said a Taiba resident. \"They poured kerosene on many buildings and set them on fire. Many of the attackers broke into houses and stole furniture, jewelry and electrical appliances.\" \n \n With the exception of large numbers of PA policemen, the streets of Taiba were completely deserted on Sunday as the residents remained indoors. Many torched cars littered the streets. At least 16 houses had been gutted by fire and the assailants also destroyed a statue of the Virgin Mary. \n \n \"It was like a war, they arrived in groups, and many of them were holding clubs,\" said another resident. \n \n \"Some people saw them carrying weapons. They first attacked houses belonging to the Khoury family [looking for the man who had the affair with the women, not realizing he had already fled the village.] Then they went to their relatives. They entered the houses and destroyed everything there. Then they tried to enter the local beer factory, but were repelled by PA security agents. \n \n The fire engine arrived five hours later.\"\n Col. Tayseer Mansour, commander of the PA police in the Ramallah area, said his men arrived late because of the need to coordinate their movements with the IDF. \"The delay resulted in the torching of a number of houses and cars in the village,\" he said. \n \n Taiba, the only West Bank village that is completely inhabited by Christians, is famous for its Taiba Beer factory, which was established by the Khoury family in 1994. \n \n The residents are Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox or Greek Catholic. The village was originally called Ephraim, and is thought to be the city to which Jesus came with his disciples before his crucifixion: \"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim\" (John 11:54). \n \n According to some accounts, Salah a-Din, who led the war against the Crusaders, was responsible for the name change. He is said to have found the villagers there to be nice and kind - in Arabic, taybeen - and the name stuck, to become Taiba.\n \n \n \n http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1125831262546\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1321 Tolerance and Pluralism: Indonesian Muslims call for death for Christians \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1326 Islam's Supremacist Past Is Its Present \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1314 Islam's Torture of Lebanon \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1312 The Myth of Islamic Tolerance \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1255 Islamic Honour Killings in review \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1112\n Imperialism and Colonialism: \"Jihad is the murdering\n of Christians and Jews\"\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/737\n \"Islamophobia\" and other made up words\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/667\n Murder of Samuel shows height of religious\n intolerance\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/435\n Muslims convert Church of Christ the Savior into\n public toilet",

Till allegedly touched Carolyn Bryant, propositioned her, and thus crossed over into the white man's sexual world. Till's behavior became \"uncivilized\" and, to the likes of extreme white supremacists, justified the actions of Bryant and Milam. People in control have historically employed extralegal or vigilante justice to enforce social customs. In this case they used racial violence to enforce community/racial standards, codes of behavior, in a ritual of racial fear and hate.\n \n Stephen Whitfield:\n \n Till not only engaged in a wolf-whistle, but was accused of squeezing the arm of Mrs. Carolyn Bryant and asking her for \"a date.\" To him it was a joke, done to impress local young blacks. To her husband and his brother-in-law, it was a crude and crass violation of the etiquette of Jim Crow, an insult that required punishment, lest other blacks try to cross the color line in such a fashion. The whistle itself did not \"result in a lynching.\" But if Bryan and Milam can be believed, in testimony they presented to a journalist, William Bradford Huie, after they had been acquitted (and could no longer be tried for the same offense), it was Till's impudence, his apparent defiance and perhaps lack of fear, that pushed the two abductors into killers\n \n",
