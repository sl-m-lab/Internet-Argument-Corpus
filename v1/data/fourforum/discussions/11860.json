   "The Iraqi government is trying to renegotiate a deal with the U.S. regarding the status of U.S. troops in Iraq. The main elements of the plan had been worked out between the two parties. However, after facing political opposition in Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has changed his mind on the plan and has now drawn up a new draft deal. The new agreement would call for the complete removal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by 2011, in three years. Source: Truly Newsworthy, Truly Newsworthy - Breaking U.S., International, Political and Economic News.\n \n This deal is stupid for everyone. The deal does not take into account any unknown future events. I want the troops out, but what happens if the Iraqi army losses grip in two years?",

This means that even although the government has approved it, should the Iraqi population reject the deal, then you could well be getting your marching orders within the next 12 months.",

For the first time in history, some tows/villages have running water and electricity; luxuries that we take for granted. So to you who say \"pull out now\", do you care for the Iraqis?\n \n Sad part three:\n People are saying \"Iraqis want us to do their dirty work!\" Really? It's not like lack of self-sufficiency could be the issue after all...\n \n Sad part four:\n The war has led to people saying vile things about Muslim. I feel like I am surrounded by hicks and rednecks who only comment on the 10% of Islam that is radicalized. Roughly 90% of Muslims are ordinary people.",

The Jihadist attack was a direct attack on the United States. If a bully on the playground attacks someone and you step in, they'll leave you alone once you step out so they can focus on the person they're specifically targeting.
