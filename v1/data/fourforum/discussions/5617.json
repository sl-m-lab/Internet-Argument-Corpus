   "My kind of \"military expert.\" Do what is required. I've listened to him several times and he tells it like it is.\n =======================\n \n Interview with Colonel David Hunt Fox News Military Analyst And Author Of The NYT Best Seller \"They Just Don't Get It\"\n \n It seems that in nearly 4 year after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 some in our country seem to have forgotten that horrible day. Even worse, those that are in charge of protecting us do not seem to have learned the lessons that could help prevent another attack.\n \n Luckily for Americans there are people like Colonel David Hunt out there. Col. Hunt is the no-nonsense, tell it like it is military analyst for Fox News, and has 30 years military experience, much of it in counter-terrorism. Most recently, he is the author of the New York Times best-selling book They Just Don't Get It: How Washington Is Still Compromising Your Safety--and What You Can Do About It.\n \n We were fortunate enough to have Col. Hunt speak with us about his new book, and the War on Terror, Iraq, the media and a host of other national security issues.\n \n Q: Since the book went to print, have you seen anything that we are now \"getting right\" in how we are fighting the war on terror that we weren't doing correctly while you were writing the book?\n \n A: Our soldiers, sailiors and marines, and air men and coast guard get it right everyday. Our cops get it right everyday. But just look at our reaction to the plane in DC a few weeks ago?\n \n Q: In the book you indicate that part of the problem with our military strategy is that they usually are \"preparing for the last war\", and clearly the war on terror is one we have never faced before on such a large scale. Many of the young officers currently in Iraq and Afghanistan are \"learning on the job\",not only in terms of actually fighting an urban guerilla war, but also are getting experiences in how to win \"hearts and minds\" of the local population through things like building hospitals, schools, and water treatment facilities. How are those experiences likely to influence how our military fights the war on terror in the future when these young Captains and Lieutenants are Generals and Colonels making \"big picture\" decision?\n \n A: It will take years, unfortunately--we have guys still fighting the Russians in the FULDA GAP!\n \n Q: How long will it take to get these young officers in positions of command where they're not \"fighting the last war\"?\n \n A: About 10 years. A big part of the problem is that many of the generals we have now are what's known as \"Clinton Generals\". These were people who were promoted during the Clinton years and are far to hesitant to take use the force and sometimes brutal tactics that are necessary to really fight and win this war...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Q: What would you do differently to combat the guerilla war in the urban areas like Baghdad?\n \n A: In addition to more special forces, I would have hundreds of sniper teams with much looser rules of engagement than we have now. For example, I would have shot looters on sight. When you start killing people from far away, that plays havoc with guerillas because they don't know where it's coming from or when.\n \n I think this would also be a very effective tactic on the Syrian border. We have too many people coming across that border whose only mission is to kill Americans. We have to kill as many of those type of people as we can...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.anklebitingpundits.com/index.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=83",
