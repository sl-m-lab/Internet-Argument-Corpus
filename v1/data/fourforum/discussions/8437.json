His pastor was on the news tonight telling everyone what a good christian Lay was. Some of the money that he extorted from the people of California he donated to worthy causes around Houston. He had some bucks in professional athletic stadiums and teams, for example. He was well liked by most who knew him (with the exception of the people of California). He was a friend of President Bush and shared the same sect of Christianity as well as the same morality.\n \n Great wealth is, of course, a sign of God's favor. There must have been something going on there, like in the book of Job. Except Lay had a heart attack and spoiled the bet.",
