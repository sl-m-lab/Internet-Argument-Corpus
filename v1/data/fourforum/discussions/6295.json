   "marc9000: Okay, that works ...Since we have that, my suggestion would be to use both 1000 words / 5000 characters,(not incl. spaces) whichever is LESSER. Example; If one of us made a post with 1000 words / 5010 characters, it would be okay. Or if the post was 1010 words with 5000 characters it would be okay as well. Agreed?\n\n \n Well then, as far as I know, we're all set!\n \n \nmarc9000: Would the penalty for going over be a complete forfeit of the debate, or just a consideration for the judges?\n\n \n I'd say it depends upon the degree of non-compliance. If someone goes over by 10 words that doesn't seem like a big deal (though one should attempt to avoid doing so). I guess the judges could use their own personal judgment on something like that. But if someone goes over by 100, or 250 words, then that's clearly in violation of the agreement and a severe penalty of some kind should be issued - possibly up to losing the debate.\n \n Anyway, I think we've got it all agreed on.

   "DamEtal, please monitor your PMs.\n\n \n Okay, I've responded to you last one. If marc9000 agrees, we should be all set.\n \n \n My only worry is, still, time. Besides my full time job, I am taking organic chemistry and embryology this semester. As just one example of what I have to do in just one of those two classes ... Besides learning the lecture material and the lab material, I have to write up 10 reviews of embryology-related article of my choice, and X more that the professor will choose, all before 12/06/05. Here is the first one. It alone took me probably 4 hours to write (including the amount of time to read the article a couple of times to understand it).\n \n \n \nThe newly discovered gene Rfpl4 (which encodes the protein RFPL4) is expressed only in germ cells and plays a key role in regulating the meiotic cell cycle in mammalian oocytes. \n \n Progression through the meiotic cell cycle is regulated by fluctuations in the cytoplasmic concentration of a protein called MPF, for maturation-promoting factor. MPF is a heterodimer composed of a cell-cycle protein called cyclin B1 and a second protein known as a cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase). One important method of controlling the concentration of active MPF is by regulating the amount of cyclin B1 present in the cytosol. When cyclin B1 synthesis is accelerated, the protein accumulates in the cytoplasm and binds with the cdk causing an accumulation of MPF, setting one stage of the cell cycle in motion. But, the MPF must then be deactivated in order to trigger the next stage. This can be accomplished by the degradation of cyclin B1 through a process called ubiquitination.\n \n The major pathway for controlled protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is ubiquitination. In this process, the target protein is enzymatically tagged with many ubiquitin molecules, which then serve as a signal for the cell's proteasomes to degrade the protein. The class of enzymes that physically tag target proteins with ubiquitin are called E3 proteins; these ubiquitin ligase proteins are numerous and are the component of the system that supplies the specificity (i.e., how a specific protein is selected as a target for degradation). E3 proteins obtain their ubiquitin molecules from one of a few types of E2 proteins. \n \n Returning to mammalian meiosis, oocytes are arrested twice. Before ovulation, oocytes arrest in prophase I. Later, ovulation causes them to progress to metaphase II, where they are arrested again (until fertilization). The concentration of cyclin B1 has been found to correlate with specific stages in meiosis: it accumulates just prior to metaphase (both I and II) and is degraded during the transition from metaphase to anaphase (both I and II). Combined with the fact that cyclin B1 is one of the two components of MPF, it is clear that regulation of cyclin B1 plays a key role in progression through meiosis.\n \n In mammalian oocytes, the RFPL4 protein was found to interact with an E2 enzyme called HR6A, as well as with ubiquitin B, cyclin B1, and a subunit on proteasomes. Experiments to detect RFPL4 in early embryos showed a lower concentration in the two-cell stage relative to the oocyte, and an absence of RFPL4 in the eight-cell stage (RFPL4 may itself become a 'victim' of regulated degradation via ubiquitination).\n \n The newly discovered, germ-cell specific, RFPL4 protein has been found capable of forming a 'bridge' between the various components of a ubiquitin degradation complex: it can interact with an E2 \"ubiquitin-presenting\" enzyme, the ubiquitin molecule itself, regions of proteasomes, and the cell-cycle-regulating protein targeted for degradation, cyclin B1. These interactions clearly suggest that RFPL4 is a ubiquitin ligase protein. Further, RFPL4 shares a protein domain common among E3 enzymes. Hence, RFPL4 is a germ-cell specific, E3 enzyme that plays a key role in regulating the meiotic cell cycle in mammalian oocytes.\n \n\n \n This isn't simple stuff ... this takes a lot of time and effort, for both reading/understanding the article and to write a review of it. \n \n I am currently already 5 pages behind in my lecture notes (that is, in writing up self-test questions to drill the material by myself), and with this article-review burden - on top of my job, organic chemistry class, and having my kids every other weekend - I fear that time limitations will force me to produce lesser quality arguments than I could otherwise work up (at least on the weekends that I have the boys).",
