   "I support Michigan Congressman John Conyers campaign to investigate the conduct of George W. Bush during Bush's actions to embroil my country into a war with Iraq.\n\n \n I agree. If the Downing street memo is correct, there are some serious questions that need to be answered. \n \n the Us has laready lost most if the credibility we previously enjoyed in the world. If we wish to regain that credibility, a full review of our elected officials who made the decision to go to war, and the circumstances regarding those decisions, need to be explored. If indeed we were lied to and intellignece was manipulated, as seems to be the case, the Bush administration needs to be held accountable for it.\n \n Now, off my idealogical soapbox, I don't think there is a snowballs chance in hell that this will happen. Accountability of american politicians went out with hula hoops. No matter who is calling for investigation, it will be stonewalled and ignored. XXXXXX will continue to believe that the president was acting in good faith (lets face it, you have to be a XXXXX to believe that now with all the evidence to the contrary).",

INC WELCOMES IRAQ LIBERATION ACT, PRESS STATEMENT, OCT 31\n \n Today is the 89th day without weapons inspections in Iraq and the first \n day without UNSCOM monitoring.\n \n \"Iraq News\" is preparing an issue on Iraq's decision to suspend UNSCOM \n monitoring. Meanwhile, this issue deals with the developments \n regarding the policy promoted by Congress to deal with the Iraqi threat, \n namely to overthrow Saddam. \n \n On Oct 30, Radio Free Iraq began broadcasting. In an Oct 30 press \n statement, David Newton, head of RFI, explained \"that in addition to \n local news about Iraq, programs will focus on democracy, free speech and \n human rights. 'Under the dictatorship of President Saddam Hussein, \n people in Iraq never a chance to hear about these issues,' said Newton, \n a former US ambassador to Iraq. He says broadcasts to Iraq will \n eventually expand to six hours a day, airing in the Arabic as well as \n Kurdish languages.\" Transcripts and RealAudio of the broadcasts will be \n available at http://www.rferl.org\n \n Yesterday, Clinton signed into law HR 4655, the \"Iraq Liberation Act \n of 1998.\" In a presidential statement, issued by the White House, \n Clinton said, \"This Act makes clear that it is the sense of the Congress \n that the United States should support those elements of the Iraqi \n opposition that advocate a very different future for Iraq than the \n bitter reality of internal repression and external aggression that the \n current regime in Baghdad now offers. . . . On October 21, 1998, I \n signed into law the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n Appropriations Act, 1999, which made $8 million available for assistance \n to the Iraqi democratic opposition. . . My Administration, as required \n by that statue, has also begun to implement a program to compile \n information regarding allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity, \n and war crimes by Iraq's current leaders as a step towards bringing to \n justice those directly responsible for such acts.\"\n Indeed, Sec 590 of the omnibus appropriations bill stated that \"not \n less than $8,000,000 shall be made available for assistance to the Iraqi \n democratic opposition. Of this amount, not less than $3,000,000 should \n be made available as a grant for the Iraq National Congress. The \n conferees also direct the Administration to provide not less than \n $3,000,000 as a grant to the Iraqi Campaign to Indict Iraqi War \n Criminals to be used to compile information to support the indictment of \n Iraqi officials for war crimes. The conferees direct the Administration \n to provide not less than $2,000,000 for the conduct of activities by the \n Iraqi democratic opposition inside Iraq.\"\n The president of the INC's Executive Council welcomed Clinton's \n signature of the Iraq Liberation Act, in an Oct 31 statement that began \n by condemning Saddam's suspension of UNSCOM monitoring, while hailing \n the president's signing of the legislation and thanking the US Congress. \n The statement concluded, \"Saddam is the problem and he cannot be part of \n any solution in Iraq. Therefore, President Clinton's action today is \n the most appropriate response to Saddam. Let him know that Iraqis will \n rise up to liberate themselves from his totalitarian dictatorship and \n that the US is ready to help their democratic forces with arms to do so. \n Only then will the trail of tragedy in Iraq end. Only then will Iraq be \n free of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n \n I. CLINTON SIGNS IRAQ LIBERATION ACT\n October 31, 1998\n The White House\n Office of the Press Secretary\n For Immediate Release\n October 31, 1998\n Statement by thePpresident\n Today I am signing into law H.R. 4655, the \"Iraq Liberation Act of \n 1998.\" This Act makes clear that it is the sense of the Congress that \n the United States should support those elements of the Iraqi opposition\n that advocate a very different future for Iraq than the bitter reality \n of internal repression and external aggression that the current regime \n in Baghdad now offers.\n Let me be clear on what the U.S. objectives are:\n The United States wants Iraq to rejoin the family of nations as a \n freedom-loving and law-abiding member. This is in our interest and that \n of our allies within the region.\n The United States favors an Iraq that offers its people freedom \n at home. I categorically reject arguments that this is unattainable \n due to Iraq's history or its ethnic or sectarian make-up. Iraqis \n deserve and desire freedom like everyone else.\n The United States looks forward to a democratically supported \n regime that would permit us to enter into a dialogue leading to the \n reintegration of Iraq into normal international life.\n My Administration has pursued, and will continue to pursue, these \n objectives through active application of all relevant United Nations \n Security Council resolutions. The evidence is overwhelming that such \n changes will not happen under the current Iraq leadership.\n In the meantime, while the United States continues to look to the \n Security Council's efforts to keep the current regime's behavior in \n check, we look forward to new leadership in Iraq that has the support of \n the Iraqi people. The United States is providing support to opposition \n groups from all sectors of the Iraqi community that could lead to a \n popularly supported government.\n On October 21, 1998, I signed into law the Omnibus Consolidated \n and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, which made $8 \n million available for assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition. \n This assistance is intended to help the democratic opposition unify, \n work together more effectively, and articulate the aspirations of the \n Iraqi people for a pluralistic, participatory political system that will \n include all of Iraq's diverse ethnic and religious groups. As required \n by the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY 1998 (Public Law \n 105-174), the Department of State submitted a report to the Congress on \n plans to establish a program to support the democratic opposition. My\n Administration, as required by that statute, has also begun to implement \n a program to compile information regarding allegations of genocide, \n crimes against humanity, and war crimes by Iraq's current leaders as a\n step towards bringing to justice those directly responsible for such \n acts.\n The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 provides additional, \n discretionary authorities under which my Administration can act to \n further the objectives I outlined above. There are, of course, other \n important elements of U.S. policy. These include the maintenance of \n U.N. Security Council support [for] efforts to eliminate Iraq's \n prohibited weapons and missile programs and economic sanctions that \n continue to deny the regime the means to reconstitute those threats to \n international peace and security. United States support for the Iraqi \n opposition will be carried out consistent with those policy objectives \n as well.\n Similarly, U.S. support must be attuned to what the opposition can \n effectively make use of as it develops over time. With those \n observations, I sign H.R. 4655 into law.\n WILLIAM J. CLINTON\n THE WHITE HOUSE,\n October 31, 1998\n \n II. '99 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, IRAQ OPPOSITION\n Sec. 590. Iraq Opposition \n The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by the Senate \n that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the funds made \n available in this Act and any prior Acts making appropriations for \n foreign operations, not less than $8,000,000 shall be made available for \n assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition. Of this amount, not less \n than $3,000,000 should be made available as a grant for the Iraqi \n National Congress. The conferees also direct the Administration to \n provide not less than $3,000,000 as a grant to the Iraqi Campaign to \n Indict Iraqi War Criminals to be used to compile information to support \n the indictment of Iraqi officials for war crimes. The conferees direct \n the Administration to provide not less than $2,000,000 for the conduct \n of activities by the Iraqi democratic opposition inside Iraq. The \n conferees also direct the Secretary of State to submit a detailed report \n to the Committees on Appropriations thirty days after the enactment of \n this Act on the implementation of these activities.\n \n III. INC WELCOMES IRAQ LIBERATION ACT\n INC Welcomes President Clinton's Signature of the Iraq Liberation Act\n London (October 31, 1998)\n Following is a statement by Ahmad Chalabi, President of the Executive \n Council of the Iraqi National Congress.\n Saddam has shown once again that he is irredeemable. His defiance of \n the United Nations Security Council and his rejection of all reasonable \n attempts to resolve the impasse, which he made, demonstrate that he has \n no concern for the well being of the Iraqi people. He puts his power \n megalomania above the life and happiness of the Iraqi people.\n The Iraqi people are the first to suffer from the expulsion of UNSCOM \n and the cessation of all its activities. They have repeatedly been the \n victims of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. They call for the \n elimination of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.\n Saddam has pushed further the day when sanctions on Iraq would be \n lifted. He has challenged the combined will of the international \n community and thus he has opened the door for UN action against Iraq \n under Chapter VII resolutions. He is responsible.\n Today, October 31, 1998 is a great day for the Iraqi people. Today \n President Clinton signed into law the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. The \n American people have given their support for the end of dictatorship and \n for democracy in Iraq. The INC welcomes this courageous and historic \n action by President Clinton and thanks him for it.\n I will begin immediate consultations with leaders in the INC and \n others to work for a united response on how best to take advantage of \n the provisions of the Iraq Liberation Act. We will present a united \n front to maximize the chances of success. We look to President Clinton \n to support and work with a united INC to achieve our common goals.\n The INC has worked long and hard to energize the conscience of world \n to the decades long suffering of the Iraqi people. We have worked hard \n to persuade the US Congress for action to help the Iraqi people to \n liberate themselves. We thank with gratitude the US Congress for their \n support of democracy in Iraq. They have created a strong bond between \n the people of the US and the people of Iraq in the pursuit of liberty.\n Saddam is the problem and he cannot be part of any solution in Iraq. \n Therefore, President Clinton's action today is the most appropriate \n response to Saddam. Let him know that Iraqis will rise up to liberate \n themselves from his totalitarian dictatorship and that the US is ready \n to help their democratic forces with arms to do so. Only then will the \n trail of tragedy in Iraq end. Only then will Iraq be free of weapons of \n mass destruction.",
