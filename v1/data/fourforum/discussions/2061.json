   "...like a Democrat, Republican or Texan?  \n \n You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and \n \n children. Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge \n \n knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams \n \n obscenities, raises the knife, and charges. \n \n You're carrying a Smith & Wesson revolver and you are an \n \n expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you \n \n and your family. What do you do? \n \n \n \n Democrat's Answer:  \n \n Well, that's not enough information to answer the question! \n \n Does the man look poor or oppressed? Have I ever done \n \n anything to him that would inspire him to attack? Could we \n \n run away? What does my wife think? What about the kids? \n \n Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife \n \n out of his hand? What does the law say about this situation? \n \n Does the pistol have an appropriate safety built into it? Why \n \n am I carrying a loaded gun and what kind of message does \n \n this send to society and my children? Is it possible he'd be \n \n happy with just killing me? Does he definitely want to kill \n \n me or would he just be content to wound me? If I were to \n \n grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while \n \n he was stabbing me? This is all so confusing! I need to \n \n debate this with some friends for a few days to try to come \n \n to a conclusion. \n \n \n \n Republican's Answer:  \n \n BANG! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Texan's Answer:  \n \n BANG! BANG! BANG! \n \n BANG! BANG! BANG! \n \n click click click....... emoticon_xhoho",
