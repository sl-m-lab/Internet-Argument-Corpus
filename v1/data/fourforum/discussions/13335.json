I would expect them to agree with creationists 90 or more percent of the time in politics, and despise atheists political beliefs. Not the other way around, as they always do here. \n\n Most of the prominent religions of the world either hold monotheistic beliefs in an omnipotent creator God (mainstream Christianity, Islam, Judeism, etc.) or have polytheistic beliefs where some gods are involved in creation and some are not (Hinduism). There are very few religions that have no belief in supernatural creations and, from the examples that I have heard, those tend to be more alternative - ex. Wikka - so they might not espouse conservative beliefs. You should also keep in mind that Christians hold various views on God's role in creation - some holding to a strict literal interpretation of the Bible and its Genesis story, while others interpret it more symbolically (apparently so do most Biblical scholars) in a way that allows for beliefs such as theistic evolution. Either way, believing in God and His involvement at some level in creation does by no means mean that those believers will have conservative political views. The only thing I would agree to there is that those that have very strict literal interpretations of the Bible, including literal interpretations of Genesis, would tend to be more conservative. However, many (possibly most) Christians don't hold views of creation that are nearly as strictly literal and their political views vary much more widely. Either way, this thread was started as a general philosophical question and was not meant to address any political contraversies. I think the philosophical question is interesting enough on its own.\n \nThat concept is also related to the foundation of the U.S. government. In the current culture war in the U.S. those long past beliefs are irrelevant. \n\n Again, this thread was not meant to address the culture war or political issues. It was meant as a general philosophical issue to discuss. \n \nIt was defined like that in the 18th century when U.S. foundations were laid. I'm no expert on Christian history, but as far as I know the Bible wasn't even translated into English until the 16th century.

Bible scholars like Martin Luther and many others made significant contributions. I think it makes sense - just because discoveries about Christianity weren't made immediately after the Bible was written, doesn't mean they weren't there all along.\n\n The recent discoveries were not made because of the Bible being translated into English. It was already known for centuries that the council of Niceae strictly limited Christian belief, rejecting many earlier beliefs. The recent decades have revealed archeological finds of buried, decaying texts from those early times, as well as more efforts at independent scholarly research to find out about the origins of scripture based on archeology, comparative analysis, etc. These efforts in independent scholarship and archeology really only started around the 19th century and took off more in the 20th - relatively recent times. \n \n Either way, if you take a look at Gnostic beliefs (where the Gnostics were one of the most prominent Christian beliefs in early Christianity, after proto-orthodox), then you will see how very different they are from our current belief systems in Christianity. Here is a link: Gnosticism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (where you could also look at their section on Gnosticism and Christianity - i.e. the beliefs in Jesus held by the Gnostics). Gnostics believed that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, associated with the God of Abraham (which is also the God of Christianity). Gnostic beliefs themselves varied widely. From that link:\" Jesus of Nazareth is identified by some Gnostic sects as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gn&#333;sis to the earth. In others (e.g. the Notzrim and Mandaeans) he is considered a m\u009aiha kdaba or \"false messiah\" who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John the Baptist. \" Also, the fairly recently unearthed Gospel of Thomas was associated with the Gnostic version of Christianity. The bottom line is that this is one example of a Christian belief that once existed that was detroyed due to the politics of the Council of Nicaea and whose beliefs were very different than the range of beliefs that Christians currently hold.",

Rather than masses of organized religion, belief in God would be based on isolated personal situations. Perhaps the concept of God would completely fade away eventually.\n\n I think that one has to see that there are certain psychological needs that many religions, whether actually real or not, address better than does purely secular thought and that is why I would guess that religion of some sort will take a very long time to disappear and might indeed last indefinitely. Some of religion's answers to these psychological needs may indeed be a crutch but not a complete one. For example, one psychological advantage of religion is in letting people get a sense that God might be helping in directing their lives - something that gives them more confidence in a direction that they choose to pursue. However, just because they feel that God is helping to guide them doesn't mean that they don't recognize that they also need to be proactive - thus the expression \"God helps those who help themselves\". Also, another psychological advanatage of certain religious beliefs is a sense of cosmic justice attributed to those guilty parties that never suffer justice here on earth. That sense of cosmic justice is very sattisfying to those who have been wronged or exploited - which constitutes the great majority of the people of the world, to a larger or smaller extent. However, that doesn't mean that they themselves will not also try to pursue justice here on earth. \n \n Both of these issues are issues that are hard for a purely secular world to fully address. However, there is another psychologically beneficial aspect of religion that the secular world could address but is doing a relatively poor job of doing. Namely, many people go to religion for a sense of community and support - especially those people who are facing grave problems in their lives. This has drawn many converts to religion - especially the more fundamentalist religions that reach out their hands to such people in trouble. The secular world could help stem that flow by being much more welcoming to such marginalized people.",

So, it is not surprising that most writings that we do know of from that early time were just the gospels that were allowed to survive because they were of the accepted version of Christianity. Any others would have had a high chance of being purposely destroyed as heresy - especially given all the centuries during which they would have remained heretical. Either way, Gnostics (only one of many heretical creeds) apparently did not believe in writing down their religious views since they viewed physical existence as impure and that writing them down would befowl the views. \n \n There is a good web site that summarizes much of early Christian history and debunks the myth of Christianity starting only from one pure source.

It is worth a glance: Early Christian History Home Page\n \n Anyway, whatever you might think of these early Christian beliefs, they do demonstrate my main point that Christian beliefs of Christianity's earliest phases varied much more widely than they do today.

I call it suspect liberal scholarship with a very small \"s\". One of the articles had this statement:\n \n \"The Trinity concept did exist as a tentative or nebulous idea in the heads of some early Christian writers, but was never laid out specifically until the middle of the 4th century.\"\n \n \"...never laid out specifically until the middle of the 4th century...?\" The New Testament, as well as supporting scriptures from the OT, are full of examples of the Trinity. What's more, you have a number of early Trinitarian quotes from various sources (before Nicea) that clearly speak about the Trinity. The following link has some of them:\n \n Early Trinitarian Quotes:\n \n Early Trinitarian Quotes | Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry\n \n After a number of Trinity quotes from early Christian leaders, we have the following:\n \n \"If, as the anti-Trinitarians maintain, the Trinity is not a biblical doctrine and was never taught until the council of Nicea in 325, then why do these quotes exist? The answer is simple: the Trinity is a biblical doctrine and it was taught before the council of Nicea in 325 A.D.\n \n Part of the reason that the Trinity doctrine was not \"officially\" taught until the time of the Council of Nicea is because Christianity was illegal until shortly before the council. It wasn't really possible for official Christian groups to meet and discuss doctrine. For the most part, they were fearful of making public pronouncements concerning their faith.\n \n Additionally, if a group had attacked the person of Adam, the early church would have responded with an official doctrine of who Adam was. As it was, the person of Christ was attacked. When the Church defended the deity of Christ, the doctrine of the Trinity was further defined.\"\n \n There was also an article questioning whether there was ever an actual Jesus. I don't find those arguments the least bit credible. \n \n \nAnyway, whatever you might think of these early Christian beliefs, they do demonstrate my main point that Christian beliefs of Christianity's earliest phases varied much more widely than they do today. So, Christianity also once encompased beliefs in an imperfect God, as well as beliefs that Jesus was not divine but God's perfect human creation. Which particular belief is right, if any, is an argument that we might never be able to answer since the evidence is so very limited from that time.\n\n \n Well you're right about one thing - there were always some screwball sects around who either always questioned the historical Jesus, or who mixed paganism in with Biblical Christianity, including the gnostics. But there was also the real thing all along. A resurrected Jesus is the Occam's Razor that best fits the NT scenarios.",

   "I think that one has to see that there are certain psychological needs that many religions, whether actually real or not, address better than does purely secular thought and that is why I would guess that religion of some sort will take a very long time to disappear and might indeed last indefinitely. Some of religion's answers to these psychological needs may indeed be a crutch but not a complete one. For example, one psychological advantage of religion is in letting people get a sense that God might be helping in directing their lives - something that gives them more confidence in a direction that they choose to pursue. However, just because they feel that God is helping to guide them doesn't mean that they don't recognize that they also need to be proactive - thus the expression \"God helps those who help themselves\". Also, another psychological advanatage of certain religious beliefs is a sense of cosmic justice attributed to those guilty parties that never suffer justice here on earth. That sense of cosmic justice is very sattisfying to those who have been wronged or exploited - which constitutes the great majority of the people of the world, to a larger or smaller extent. However, that doesn't mean that they themselves will not also try to pursue justice here on earth. \n \n Both of these issues are issues that are hard for a purely secular world to fully address. \n\n I think its not that difficult to address these issues. Its called taking responsibility. A secular viewpoint espouses the laws of nature, particularly \"survival of the fittest\". When one takes the position of being dependent on the guidance of a god, they give themselves an excuse to adopt a passive stance, or to withdraw themselves from the consequences of their actions or inactions. Similarly with the idea of divine justice, or with the hope of being reunited with loved ones, or any other popular religious ideal that allows one to detach themselves from reality rather than taking up the challenge of taking life head on and dealing with the bad and good from an autonomous proactive stance. \n \n In a way, maybe we could look at dependence on these beliefs as a survival mechanism in an of itself. I feel, however, that people who must depend on detaching themselves from reality in order to survive are not using their full potential. It isn't necessary to feel that you can't deal with life's issues indepedently. You can. People do it all the time. You become a lot more in tune with opportunities and obstacles when you recognize that noone else can take the glory or the blame for the way you react to life than yourself. \n \n \nHowever, there is another psychologically beneficial aspect of religion that the secular world could address but is doing a relatively poor job of doing. Namely, many people go to religion for a sense of community and support - especially those people who are facing grave problems in their lives. This has drawn many converts to religion - especially the more fundamentalist religions that reach out their hands to such people in trouble. The secular world could help stem that flow by being much more welcoming to such marginalized people.\n\n That I agree with. Even though I just ranted on about independence in action, belonging to and acceptance in a social group is a basic human need. Many people are not cut out for, or willing to, be the leader of their own group, so they follow already existing groups, looking for acceptance. Religious groups are usually very accomodating to people who are looking for acceptance. \n \n The thing is, imo, religion actually propogates this sort of dependency from its onset. It rewards people for adopting a follower mentality, and feeds off this lack of autonomy in its members for its own survival. Whereas, if more people realized how beneficial being independent was, religion wouldn't be needed at all.",

   "I submit the basic teachings of Christianity were what was mainstream since the get-go, as evidenced in what Christ, the Apostles, and Paul taught. \n\n This just means that you have chosen to take the leap of faith in fully trusting that the Council of Niceae had it right in choosing the proto-orthodox as the official faith of Christianity (proto-orthodox is the name by which the sect is called that eventually became the mainstream Christian belief). As for the evidence, since it was the texts of the proto-orthodox that survived (since they did not suffer centuries of persecution as herecies), then it is natural to assume that those are the only teachings of Christ and the apostles and that those sayings were true. The Gospel of Thomas, that has relatively recently been unearther, shows that early Christians attributed many other teachings to Jesus as well. You only choose to discount those because of your leap of faith in the divine inspiration of the men of the Council of Niceae. I choose not to take that same leap of faith without strong evidence.\n \nI've never heard that one before. Is that a theory or do you have some evidence to bolster that? In all appearances it appears to be a redacted 2nd century work. No one in the first century ever wrote about it to my knowledge.\n\n Unless you question this as a source, Wikipedia has a nice article about the Nag Hammati texts (the ones that contain the Gnostics texts - including the Gospel of Thomas) - from Nag Hammadi library - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia :\n \nThe Nag Hammadi library (popularly known as The Gnostic Gospels) is a collection of early Christian Gnostic texts discovered near the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi in 1945. That year, twelve leather-bound papyrus codices buried in a sealed jar were found by a local peasant named Mohammed Ali Samman.[1][2] The writings in these codices comprised fifty-two mostly Gnostic tractates (treatises), but they also include three works belonging to the Corpus Hermeticum and a partial translation / alteration of Plato's Republic. In his \"Introduction\" to The Nag Hammadi Library in English, James Robinson suggests that these codices may have belonged to a nearby Pachomian monastery, and were buried after Bishop Athanasius condemned the uncritical use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 AD.\n\n So the texts were buried in sealed jars at around the time when the local bishop outlawed non-mainstream texts.\n \nI reviewed some of those articles and it looks like something the liberal Bishop Spong would have embraced. I call it suspect liberal scholarship with a very small \"s\". One of the articles had this statement:\n \n \"The Trinity concept did exist as a tentative or nebulous idea in the heads of some early Christian writers, but was never laid out specifically until the middle of the 4th century.\"\n \n \"...never laid out specifically until the middle of the 4th century...?\" The New Testament, as well as supporting scriptures from the OT, are full of examples of the Trinity.

When the Church defended the deity of Christ, the doctrine of the Trinity was further defined.\"\n \n There was also an article questioning whether there was ever an actual Jesus. I don't find those arguments the least bit credible. \n\n Given your strong faith in the validity of the texts which became the New Testament and the invalidity of the other sexts that competed with the proto-orthodox prior to the Council of Niceae, I am not surprised that you hold these views. Again, there was no \"official\" church doctrine until the Nicene Council. For one, as your quoted article says, the illegality of Christianity within the Roman Empire made it difficult to maintain official doctrine when meetings to discuss such doctrine would have been illegal. Also, there were still questions on how to interpret the main doctrine - which included questions about the trinity. One of the main goals of the Council of Niceae was to iron out those differences about views of the trinity to come to some conclusion.\n \n This article tries to present all sides of the issue so it mentions a wide range of theories, including theories that Jesus did not exist. Since most of the web site talks about different versions of Christianity, then it is hard to argue that the author has made up his mind that Jesus did not exist - that was only one theory held by some scholars that the author felt compeled to mention in order to summarize the range of scholarly opinion.\n \n I have not read every linked section of the web page, but those sections which I have read have coincided well with other sources I have accessed on early Christianity (including an interesting \"Teaching Company\" course which I bought on the subject, and which I recommend). It is a web site meant to lay out all the facts, not to come to any conclusions based on faith. The only complaint I myself have against it is that I would have preferred if he had referrenced his sources not as one big list in a separate link but point-by-point within his essays themselves. It makes it harder to ascertain where he got the information from on a particular point.\n \nWell you're right about one thing - there were always some screwball sects around who either always questioned the historical Jesus, or who mixed paganism in with Biblical Christianity, including the gnostics. But there was also the real thing all along. A resurrected Jesus is the Occam's Razor that best fits the NT scenarios.\n\n Again, the NT texts were the ones that were chosen for survival by the Nicene Council so, of course, current religious dogma of Christ's resurrection would be consistent with the only texts allowed to survive. However, even when examining the official scriptures, there are large differences between the approaches that Mark's gospel has toward Jesus (where he is called the Son of Man, not the Son of God, for example) and that of John (on which much of mainstream theology relies). Since the Gospel of Mark was written much earlier than the Gospel of John, Mark would seem more authentic and less vulnerable to the distortions that happen to stories over time.",

It reminds me of the movie \"Laurence of Arabia\" where Laurence ends up saving the life of an Arab soldier that disappeared during their crossing of the desert despite all the earlier protestations of the other soldiers that such effort was not worth it since \"it is written\" that the lost soldier will die. I liked Laurence's line that \"Nothing is written\" (i.e. nothing is pre-determined). He was fighting the very crutch-type reasoning that you argue against.\n \n However, I think that you are overly pessimistic in thinking that religious belief automatically forces people to lose that sense of action and fully rely on religion as a crutch. I would say that most people do take responsible action in their lives and don't let themselves be pushed around, despite their religious beliefs. In some cases, it is the very religious beliefs that let them gain the psychological strength necessary to overcome their adversities.

   "Most of the prominent religions of the world either hold monotheistic beliefs in an omnipotent creator God (mainstream Christianity, Islam, Judeism, etc.) or have polytheistic beliefs where some gods are involved in creation and some are not (Hinduism). There are very few religions that have no belief in supernatural creations and, from the examples that I have heard, those tend to be more alternative - ex. Wikka - so they might not espouse conservative beliefs. You should also keep in mind that Christians hold various views on God's role in creation - some holding to a strict literal interpretation of the Bible and its Genesis story, while others interpret it more symbolically (apparently so do most Biblical scholars) in a way that allows for beliefs such as theistic evolution. \n\n \n There are a wide range of views concerning Christian behavior, but I don't think the range is near that wide when the subject is creation - I don't think there is a strict literal, a not-so-strick-literal, a non-strict-literal, etc. Either one believes in creation or one does not. Either God was bound by scientific laws, or he was not bound by them. I don't think the views are \"various\". And I don't think \"most Biblical scholars\" believe in a limited God that was restricted by scientific laws. Anyone can call themself a Biblical scholar. \n \n \nEither way, believing in God and His involvement at some level in creation does by no means mean that those believers will have conservative political views. \n\n \n Disagree, there are exceptions to every rule of course, but I think it's the rule. It all stems from this phrase; \"....that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.....\"\n \n No creator, no unalienable rights - simple. And the political views take off in different directions from there. 'Big government Christianity' is not a noteable political force, as isn't 'limited government atheism'. \n \n \n The only thing I would agree to there is that those that have very strict literal interpretations of the Bible, including literal interpretations of Genesis, would tend to be more conservative. However, many (possibly most) Christians don't hold views of creation that are nearly as strictly literal and their political views vary much more widely. Either way, this thread was started as a general philosophical question and was not meant to address any political contraversies. I think the philosophical question is interesting enough on its own. \n \n Again, this thread was not meant to address the culture war or political issues. It was meant as a general philosophical issue to discuss. \n\n \n I don't think the philosophical question can arise without an inspiration from political thought. I think you proved it in your subsequent post #12 by speculating on when/if religion may disappear, or how people can go to religion for a sense of community comfort and support. Many people go to science, or the community of organized humanism, for comfort and support as well. It's important to always remember that there's no neutral, perfect position. People with no religion who consider themselves neutral and thoughtful, often have powerful political views. \n \n \nThe recent discoveries were not made because of the Bible being translated into English. It was already known for centuries that the council of Niceae strictly limited Christian belief, rejecting many earlier beliefs. The recent decades have revealed archeological finds of buried, decaying texts from those early times, as well as more efforts at independent scholarly research to find out about the origins of scripture based on archeology, comparative analysis, etc. These efforts in independent scholarship and archeology really only started around the 19th century and took off more in the 20th - relatively recent times. \n \n Either way, if you take a look at Gnostic beliefs (where the Gnostics were one of the most prominent Christian beliefs in early Christianity, after proto-orthodox), then you will see how very different they are from our current belief systems in Christianity. Here is a link: Gnosticism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (where you could also look at their section on Gnosticism and Christianity - i.e. the beliefs in Jesus held by the Gnostics). Gnostics believed that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, associated with the God of Abraham (which is also the God of Christianity). Gnostic beliefs themselves varied widely. From that link:\" Jesus of Nazareth is identified by some Gnostic sects as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gn&#333;sis to the earth. In others (e.g. the Notzrim and Mandaeans) he is considered a m\u009aiha kdaba or \"false messiah\" who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John the Baptist. \" Also, the fairly recently unearthed Gospel of Thomas was associated with the Gnostic version of Christianity. The bottom line is that this is one example of a Christian belief that once existed that was detroyed due to the politics of the Council of Nicaea and whose beliefs were very different than the range of beliefs that Christians currently hold.\n\n \n I think the basics have always been there, and the current ones have stood the test of time.",

   "There are many beliefs in God and the supernatural that seem to be constant over a wide range of religions. These are assumptions that are often so taken for granted that they are rarely ever considered. I would like to bring up a couple here for discussion to see what people think...\n \n 1) Assumption: Belief in God necessarily includes a belief that God created Man and the Universe. Many earlier religions included gods that had no role in creation and I have heard that there are some minor religions that do not espouse supernatural creation stories. Why do we feel that, in order to properly believe in God, we need to believe the He created Man and the universe?

How would it change our view of God if God had limitations in that there were things which He wills, but cannot achieve? This is a question independent of the question of free will for people - since traditional belief in God says that He wants us to practice free will and, therefore, limits His actions by His own choice to let us make our own mistakes.\n \n So, what are your views in \"thinking outside the box\" about these assumptions we make about God?\n\n \n We christians take for granted that God created the heavens/universe and the earth because He said He did in His word.

   "There are a wide range of views concerning Christian behavior, but I don't think the range is near that wide when the subject is creation - I don't think there is a strict literal, a not-so-strick-literal, a non-strict-literal, etc. Either one believes in creation or one does not. Either God was bound by scientific laws, or he was not bound by them. I don't think the views are \"various\". And I don't think \"most Biblical scholars\" believe in a limited God that was restricted by scientific laws. Anyone can call themself a Biblical scholar.\n\n Recent Gallup polls show that 77% of Americans self-identify themselves as Christian (from This Easter, Smaller Percentage of Americans Are Christian ). However, Gallup polls and other polls show that it is only a minority of Americans that believe that God created man in his present form within the last 10,000 years. At least half of Americans espouse Evolution of some form - either purely secular Evolution or, more commonly, essentially theistic Evolution which is Evolution viewed as being guided by God. From Science and Nature (reformatted since column alignment is not easily implemented in 4forums.com):\n \nGallup Poll. May 8-11, 2008. N=1,017 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3.\n \n \"Which of the following statements comes closest to your views on the origin and development of human beings? (1) Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process. (2) Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process. (3) God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.\" Options rotated 1-3, 3-1\n \n 5/8-11/08: 36% say Guided by God, 14% say God Had no Part, 44% say God Created in Present Form, 5% say Other/Unsure. \n\n These numbers are fairly constant through polls taken all the way back to 1982. Also, the same page shows the February 2009 poll that was expounded upon in the media where only 39% of the respondents say they believed in Evolution. However, what was not expounded upon in the media is that the same poll showed that 36% had no opinion either way (Evolution vs Creation). This is consistent with the idea that many people don't want to commit to purely one side or the other but try to take views that are in between - such as theistic Evolution.\n \n These polls tell me that a large number of American Christians do not interpret Genesis literally but try to find some common ground with Science and its Theory of Evolution. I am currently in discussion with jyoshu in another thread where he is just one of numerous examples of people who espouse theistic evolution.\n \nDisagree, there are exceptions to every rule of course, but I think it's the rule. It all stems from this phrase; \"....that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.....\"\n \n No creator, no unalienable rights - simple. And the political views take off in different directions from there. 'Big government Christianity' is not a noteable political force, as isn't 'limited government atheism'. \n\n The unalienable rights is just another term for the philosophical idea of natural rights. Indeed, there were many who viewed natural rights in a religious light - i.e. that they came from God, but other philosophers had more secular approaches to the idea of natural rights. However, either way, the reason that natural (a.k.a. unalienable) rights were never included in the structure of our government (i.e. the US Constitution) but remained only a vague philosophical statement in the Declaration of Independence was that philosophers and theologians could never agree on exactly what these unalienable rights were. Certainly, the founders of this country did not agree on whether they should be applied to people of African descent. \n \n From what I understand from summaries of the Federalist Papers, where the founders essentially illucidated their thinking process behind many directions taken by government, \"All men are created equal\" meant that all men should be viewed as equal under the law. This was in reaction to their experience with the British system where nobility were privilidged in not being as subjected to the rigorous justice system as were everyday people. Our current justice may be flawed in that those who can afford good lawyers are far more likely to get off, but at least technically the laws apply equally to everyone. That was not always the case.\n \n Outside of the law, we all know that there are wide ranges of human capabilities so that a bank CEO will be treated better by his fellow human beings than a homeless man. That is an aspect of human nature that broadly cuts across all political affiliations. One reason that Democrats support large government is that they view that government can be one of the few institutions that can have the power to try to at least slightly level that playing field so that, in the ideal case, the son of the homeless man might get the same opportunities for growth (through education, etc) as might the son of the bank CEO. Government is necessary to provide him with those opportunities through help in funding, anti-discrimination laws, etc. Republicans far too often think that things can work out on their own without government intervention but they forget that it was government intervention that gave us 40 hour work week, relatively safe working conditions, safe food to eat, drugs which were monitored for safety, social security for our old age, anti-discrimination laws, etc. \n \n At this point, we have stayed pretty far from the original purpose of this thread and I am partly to blame for letting you lead us in that direction. I will be more limited in my responses on the political front after this post...\n \nI don't think the philosophical question can arise without an inspiration from political thought. I think you proved it in your subsequent post #12 by speculating on when/if religion may disappear, or how people can go to religion for a sense of community comfort and support. Many people go to science, or the community of organized humanism, for comfort and support as well. It's important to always remember that there's no neutral, perfect position. People with no religion who consider themselves neutral and thoughtful, often have powerful political views. \n\n Everyone - from the nonreligious to the religious - can have powerful political views but those don't necessarily have to be purely because of their religious views. My views of the economy, for example, have nothing to do with my religious views. There are trends in religious views vs political views in that those who are fundamentalist Christians tend to be on the political right while those who are agnostics and atheists tend to be on the political left, but even where those extremes are concerned, the alignment is not perfect. Furthermore, most Americans are neither fundamentalist Christians nor atheists or agnostics but are somewhere in the middle and their political views are far more mixed and unaligned.\n \nI think the basics have always been there, and the current ones have stood the test of time.\n\n Many of the other early Christian sects might also have stood the test of time if they had been given the same chance as the proto-orthodox (precursor to mainstream Christianity) had in terms of being the official religion of the Roman empire with all other religions persecuted. If the proto-orthodox sect had suffered the same persecution as the Gnostic sect had, then I highly doubt that it would have survived.",

There certainly was a lot of buying and selling going on - mainly through people working in state-owned industry but there was a very lively private black-market of goods as well that was unofficially allowed by the government. The main disadvantage of the communist system was not that everyone was supported by the government - since very few were while the great majority worked. The main disadvantage (speaking economically) was that there was no incentive to work particularly hard since one gained nothing from hard work, so the economy remained very inefficient and, therefore, relatively poor.\n \n In a previous post, you also referred to \"government-mandated socialism via taxation\".

Neither party is at the extremes of this political spectrum - just the minority extremists that sometimes get the most press.\n \n I personally consider myself a left-of-center moderate in that I think that one needs to balance the needs of businesses, consumers and employees when thinking about labor laws and regulations controlling business practice. It should be obvious from the many failures of business to regulate itself (the latest financial crisis being one of many examples) that business cannot be trusted to fully limit itself - especially in a climate where the quest for short term gain overcomes any concerns about long term problems. As for personal responsibility, the great majority of Democrats are just as personally responsible as Republicans. Democrats, on average, do favor government programs to help alleviate the problems of the poor (to help give them opportunities to get out of poverty) where Republicans favor charity for the poor. Charity is all well and good and I do applaud the fact that Republicans do seem to give more in personal charity, but they often don't realize that charity isn't enough to overcome the social/economic obstacles of the poor. I last read that total US charity giving is about 350 billion dollars a year. That would not be enough to cover things such as support for the poor elderly (which is now covered by Social Security and Medicare), for the handicapped, etc. Charity, generous as it is, is simply not enough. What other option would there be - let the poor elderly die out or live homeless on the streets? It is compassion for the poor that drives Democrats to push for these social programs.\n \nI've never been all that comfortable with a number of the programs you cite, but I think the fact that all but #'s 4 and 5 are basically in non-sustaining shambles is telling. (Note these are always topics that many, many people talk about as needing reform!) I don't consider #5 a socialistic matter necessarily, and #4 at least has some theoretical return in the long run.\n\n Many of these programs will become unsustaining since we are demanding more and more of them every year while being unwilling to pay for those increased benefits. In the past, with average lifespan being closer to seventy, then social security would have only needed to support the average elderly person for a bit over five years. Now it is closer to 15 years. Medicare also faces not only rising numbers of seniors (given the higher lifespans) but ever improving medical technology where access to that medical technology involves higher costs. What are the options? I would say that there are no good options. Either way, if we are to avoid sky-rocketing costs of health care in the future, health care will have to be rationed. It will not be pleasant but it is better than letting our country go broke in future debt. I propose biting the political bullet and reducing benefits to a point that is long-term sustainable while cutting un-necessary costs wherever one finds them and slightly raising social security / medicare taxes to make that bullet more palatable. What solution do you propose to this crisis? If you think that charity can cover the costs of care for the elderly, then you grossly underestimate how much is needed. Otherwise, do you think that we should, as a country, leave them out in the cold to fend for themselves - meaning many early deaths? It is easy to criticize - much harder to propose a real solution.",

It's pro-charity on a voluntary basis.\n\n \n Show me where in the bible does it say that a bible can not.\n \n Argument from silence anybody? \n \n Render onto Caesar's what is Caesar's. It says nothing about that that is.\n \n Of course, it also says to give up all your wealth to follow Jesus. Have you given up all your wealth<?",

You forgot that part.\n \n Why don't all you bleeding heart liberals take up a collection on your own and give the Fed all you want? You don't need to wait for tax day.\n \n You know why you don't? As far as giving, you liberals suck at it (but you're real good at spending OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY). Conservatives give more and are more generous.\n \n Study: Conservatives More Generous Than Liberals - Bright Hall\n \n \n Conservatives vs. Liberals\n \n If a conservative doesn&#8217;t like guns, he doesn`t buy one.\n If a liberal doesn't like guns, he wants all guns outlawed. \n \n If a conservative is a vegetarian, he doesn`t eat meat. \n If a liberal is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned for everyone. \n \n If a conservative sees a foreign threat, he thinks about how to defeat his enemy. \n \n A liberal wonders how to surrender gracefully and still look good. \n \n If a conservative is homosexual, he quietly leads his life. \n If a liberal is homosexual, he demands legislated respect.\n \n If a black man or Hispanic are conservative, they see themselves as independently successful. \n \n Their liberal counterparts see themselves as victims in need of government protection.\n \n If a conservative is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation. \n \n A liberal wonders who is going to take care of him. \n \n If a conservative doesn&#8217;t like a talk show host, he switches channels. \n Liberals demand that those they don&#8217;t like be shut down. \n \n If a conservative is a non-believer, he doesn&#8217;t go to church. \n A liberal non-believer wants any mention of God and religion silenced. (Unless it&#8217;s a foreign religion, of course!) \n \n If a conservative decides he needs health care, he goes about shopping for it, or may choose a job that provides it.\n A liberal demands that the rest of us pay for his. \n \n If a conservative slips and falls in a store, he gets up, laughs and is embarrassed. \n If a liberal slips and falls, he grabs his neck, moans like he's in labor and then sues.",
