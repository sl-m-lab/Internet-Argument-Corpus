   "With thanks to electrolyte who provided a link that led to:\n \n From the Los Angeles Times\n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-harris24dec24,0,5826036,full.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail\n \n 10 myths -- and 10 truths -- about atheism\n By Sam Harris, SAM HARRIS is the author of \"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\" and \"Letter to a Christian Nation.\"\n December 24, 2006 \n SEVERAL POLLS indicate that the term \"atheism\" has acquired such an extraordinary stigma in the United States that being an atheist is now a perfect impediment to a career in politics (in a way that being black, Muslim or homosexual is not). According to a recent Newsweek poll, only 37% of Americans would vote for an otherwise qualified atheist for president. \n \n Atheists are often imagined to be intolerant, immoral, depressed, blind to the beauty of nature and dogmatically closed to evidence of the supernatural.\n \n Even John Locke, one of the great patriarchs of the Enlightenment, believed that atheism was \"not at all to be tolerated\" because, he said, \"promises, covenants and oaths, which are the bonds of human societies, can have no hold upon an atheist.\"\n \n That was more than 300 years ago. But in the United States today, little seems to have changed. A remarkable 87% of the population claims \"never to doubt\" the existence of God; fewer than 10% identify themselves as atheists - and their reputation appears to be deteriorating. \n \n Given that we know that atheists are often among the most intelligent and scientifically literate people in any society, it seems important to deflate the myths that prevent them from playing a larger role in our national discourse. \n \n 1) Atheists believe that life is meaningless.\n \n On the contrary, religious people often worry that life is meaningless and imagine that it can only be redeemed by the promise of eternal happiness beyond the grave. Atheists tend to be quite sure that life is precious. Life is imbued with meaning by being really and fully lived. Our relationships with those we love are meaningful now; they need not last forever to be made so. Atheists tend to find this fear of meaninglessness ... well ... meaningless.\n \n 2) Atheism is responsible for the greatest crimes in human history.\n \n People of faith often claim that the crimes of Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot were the inevitable product of unbelief. The problem with fascism and communism, however, is not that they are too critical of religion; the problem is that they are too much like religions. Such regimes are dogmatic to the core and generally give rise to personality cults that are indistinguishable from cults of religious hero worship. Auschwitz, the gulag and the killing fields were not examples of what happens when human beings reject religious dogma; they are examples of political, racial and nationalistic dogma run amok. There is no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable.\n \n 3) Atheism is dogmatic. \n \n Jews, Christians and Muslims claim that their scriptures are so prescient of humanity's needs that they could only have been written under the direction of an omniscient deity. An atheist is simply a person who has considered this claim, read the books and found the claim to be ridiculous. One doesn't have to take anything on faith, or be otherwise dogmatic, to reject unjustified religious beliefs. As the historian Stephen Henry Roberts (1901-71) once said: \"I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.\" \n \n 4) Atheists think everything in the universe arose by chance.\n \n No one knows why the universe came into being. In fact, it is not entirely clear that we can coherently speak about the \"beginning\" or \"creation\" of the universe at all, as these ideas invoke the concept of time, and here we are talking about the origin of space-time itself. \n \n The notion that atheists believe that everything was created by chance is also regularly thrown up as a criticism of Darwinian evolution. As Richard Dawkins explains in his marvelous book, \"The God Delusion,\" this represents an utter misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. Although we don't know precisely how the Earth's early chemistry begat biology, we know that the diversity and complexity we see in the living world is not a product of mere chance. Evolution is a combination of chance mutation and natural selection. Darwin arrived at the phrase \"natural selection\" by analogy to the \"artificial selection\" performed by breeders of livestock. In both cases, selection exerts a highly non-random effect on the development of any species.\n \n 5) Atheism has no connection to science.\n \n Although it is possible to be a scientist and still believe in God - as some scientists seem to manage it - there is no question that an engagement with scientific thinking tends to erode, rather than support, religious faith. Taking the U.S. population as an example: Most polls show that about 90% of the general public believes in a personal God; yet 93% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences do not. This suggests that there are few modes of thinking less congenial to religious faith than science is. \n \n 6) Atheists are arrogant.\n \n When scientists don't know something - like why the universe came into being or how the first self-replicating molecules formed - they admit it. Pretending to know things one doesn't know is a profound liability in science. And yet it is the life-blood of faith-based religion. One of the monumental ironies of religious discourse can be found in the frequency with which people of faith praise themselves for their humility, while claiming to know facts about cosmology, chemistry and biology that no scientist knows. When considering questions about the nature of the cosmos and our place within it, atheists tend to draw their opinions from science. This isn't arrogance; it is intellectual honesty.\n \n 7) Atheists are closed to spiritual experience.\n \n There is nothing that prevents an atheist from experiencing love, ecstasy, rapture and awe; atheists can value these experiences and seek them regularly. What atheists don't tend to do is make unjustified (and unjustifiable) claims about the nature of reality on the basis of such experiences. There is no question that some Christians have transformed their lives for the better by reading the Bible and praying to Jesus. What does this prove? It proves that certain disciplines of attention and codes of conduct can have a profound effect upon the human mind. Do the positive experiences of Christians suggest that Jesus is the sole savior of humanity? Not even remotely - because Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims and even atheists regularly have similar experiences. \n \n There is, in fact, not a Christian on this Earth who can be certain that Jesus even wore a beard, much less that he was born of a virgin or rose from the dead. These are just not the sort of claims that spiritual experience can authenticate. \n \n 8) Atheists believe that there is nothing beyond human life and human understanding. \n \n Atheists are free to admit the limits of human understanding in a way that religious people are not. It is obvious that we do not fully understand the universe; but it is even more obvious that neither the Bible nor the Koran reflects our best understanding of it. We do not know whether there is complex life elsewhere in the cosmos, but there might be. If there is, such beings could have developed an understanding of nature's laws that vastly exceeds our own. Atheists can freely entertain such possibilities. They also can admit that if brilliant extraterrestrials exist, the contents of the Bible and the Koran will be even less impressive to them than they are to human atheists.\n \n From the atheist point of view, the world's religions utterly trivialize the real beauty and immensity of the universe. One doesn't have to accept anything on insufficient evidence to make such an observation.\n \n 9) Atheists ignore the fact that religion is extremely beneficial to society.\n \n Those who emphasize the good effects of religion never seem to realize that such effects fail to demonstrate the truth of any religious doctrine. This is why we have terms such as \"wishful thinking\" and \"self-deception.\" There is a profound distinction between a consoling delusion and the truth. \n \n In any case, the good effects of religion can surely be disputed. In most cases, it seems that religion gives people bad reasons to behave well, when good reasons are actually available. Ask yourself, which is more moral, helping the poor out of concern for their suffering, or doing so because you think the creator of the universe wants you to do it, will reward you for doing it or will punish you for not doing it?\n \n 10) Atheism provides no basis for morality.\n \n If a person doesn't already understand that cruelty is wrong, he won't discover this by reading the Bible or the Koran - as these books are bursting with celebrations of cruelty, both human and divine. We do not get our morality from religion. We decide what is good in our good books by recourse to moral intuitions that are (at some level) hard-wired in us and that have been refined by thousands of years of thinking about the causes and possibilities of human happiness. \n \n We have made considerable moral progress over the years, and we didn't make this progress by reading the Bible or the Koran more closely. Both books condone the practice of slavery - and yet every civilized human being now recognizes that slavery is an abomination. Whatever is good in scripture - like the golden rule - can be valued for its ethical wisdom without our believing that it was handed down to us by the creator of the universe.",

   "Electrolyte, go bite the Wall Street Journal:\n \n Without God, Gall Is Permitted\n By SAM SCHULMAN\n January 5, 2007; Page W11\n When the very first population of atheists roamed the earth in the Victorian age -- brought to life by Lyell's \"Principles of Geology,\" Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" and other blows to religious certainty -- it was the personal dimension of atheism that others found distressing. How could an atheist's oath of allegiance to the queen be trusted? It couldn't -- so an atheist was not allowed to take a seat in Parliament. How could an atheist, unconstrained by a fear of eternal punishment, be held accountable to social norms of behavior? Worse than heretical, atheism was not respectable.\n \n In the 21st century, this no longer seems to be the case. Few acquaintances of Dr. Richard Dawkins, the world's most voluble public atheist, wonder, as they might have a hundred years ago: Can I leave my wife unchaperoned in this man's company? Indeed, the atheists are now looking to turn the tables: They want to make belief itself not simply an object of intellectual derision but a cause for personal embarrassment. A new generation of publicists for atheism has emerged to tell Americans in particular that we should be ashamed to retain a majority of religious believers, that in this way we resemble the benighted, primitive peoples of the Middle East, Africa and South America instead of the enlightened citizens of Western Europe.\n \n Thanks in part to the actions of a few jihadists in September 2001, it is believers who stand accused, not freethinkers. Among the prominent atheists who now sermonize to the believers in their midst are Dr. Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett (\"Breaking the Spell\") and Sam Harris (\"The End of Faith\" and, more recently, \"Letter to a Christian Nation\"). There are others, too, like Steven Weinberg, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Brooke Allen (whose \"Moral Minority\" was a celebration of the skeptical Founders) and a host of commentators appalled by the Intelligent Design movement. The transcript of a recent symposium on the perils of religious thought can be found at a science Web site called edge.org.\n \n There are many themes to the atheist lament. A common worry is the political and social effect of religious belief. To a lot of atheists, the fate of civilization and of mankind depends on their ability to cool -- or better, simply to ban -- the fevered fancies of the God-intoxicated among us.\n \n Naturally, the atheists focus their peevishness not on Muslim extremists (who advertise their hatred and violent intentions) but on the old-time Christian religion. (\"Wisdom dwells with prudence,\" the Good Book teaches.) They can always haul out the abortion-clinic bomber if they need a boogeyman; and they can always argue as if all faiths are interchangeable: Persuade American Christians to give up their infantile attachment to God and maybe Muslims will too. In any case, they conclude: God is not necessary, God is impossible and God is not permissible if our society -- or even our species -- is to survive.\n \n What is new about the new atheists? It's not their arguments. Spend as much time as you like with a pile of the recent anti-religion books, but you won't encounter a single point you didn't hear in your freshman dormitory. It's their tone that is novel. Belief, in their eyes, is not just misguided but contemptible, the product of provincial minds, the mark of people who need to be told how to think and how to vote -- both of which, the new atheists assure us, they do in lockstep with the pope and Jerry Falwell.\n \n For them, belief in God is beyond childish, it is unsuitable for children. Today's atheists are particularly disgusted by the religious training of young people -- which Dr. Dawkins calls \"a form of child abuse.\" He even floats the idea that the state should intervene to protect children from their parents' religious beliefs.\n \n For the new atheists, believing in God is a form of stupidity, which sets off their own intelligence. They write as if they were the first to discover that biblical miracles are improbable, that Parson Weems was a fabulist, that religion is full of superstition. They write as if great minds had never before wrestled with the big questions of creation, moral law and the contending versions of revealed truth. They argue as if these questions are easily answered by their own blunt materialism. Most of all, they assume that no intelligent, reflective person could ever defend religion rather than dismiss it. The reviewer of Dr. Dawkins's volume in a recent New York Review of Books noted his unwillingness to take theology seriously, a starting point for any considered debate over religion.\n \n The faith that the new atheists describe is a simple-minded parody. It is impossible to see within it what might have preoccupied great artists and thinkers like Homer, Milton, Michelangelo, Newton and Spinoza -- let alone Aquinas, Dr. Johnson, Kierkegaard, Goya, Cardinal Newman, Reinhold Niebuhr or, for that matter, Albert Einstein. But to pass over this deeper faith -- the kind that engaged the great minds of Western history -- is to diminish the loss of faith too. The new atheists are separated from the old by their shallowness.\n \n To read the accounts of the first generation of atheists is profoundly moving. Matthew Arnold wrote of the \"eternal note of sadness\" sounded when the \"Sea of Faith\" receded from human life. In one testament after another -- George Eliot, Carlyle, Hardy, Darwin himself -- the Victorians described the sense of grief they felt when religion goes -- and the keen, often pathetic attempts to replace it by love, by art, by good works, by risk-seeking and -- fatally -- by politics.\n \n God did not exist, they concluded, but there was no denying that this supposed truth was accompanied by a painful sense of being cut off from human fellowship as well as divine love. To counter it, religious figures developed a new kind of mission -- like that of the former unbeliever C.S. Lewis: They could speak to the feeling of longing that unbelief engenders because they understood it -- and sympathized not only with atheism's pain but with the many sensible arguments in its favor.\n \n There is no such sympathy among the new apostles of atheism -- to find it, one has to look to believers. Anyone who has actually taught young people and listened to them knows that it is often the students who come from a trained sectarian background -- Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, Muslim, Mormon -- who are best at grasping different systems of belief and unbelief. Such students know, at least, what it feels like to have such a system, and can understand those who have very different ones. The new atheists remind me of other students from more \"open-minded\" homes -- rigid, indifferent, puzzled by thought and incapable of sympathy.\n \n The new atheists fail too often simply for want of charm or skill. Twenty-first century atheism hasn't found its H.G. Wells or its George Bernard Shaw, men who flattered their audiences, excited them and persuaded them by making them feel intelligent. Here is Sam Harris, for instance, addressing those who wonder if destroying human embryos in the process of stem cell research might be morally dicey: \"Your qualms...are obscene.\"\n \n The atheists say that they are addressing believers. Rationalists all, can they believe that believers would be swayed by such contumely and condescension? They seem instead to be preaching to people exactly like themselves -- a remarkably incurious elite.\n \n Mr. Schulman is publishing director of the American, a magazine of ideas for business leaders.",

   "On the 10 myths about atheism ...\n \n The first thing that strikes me is how a number of those supposedly debunked \"myths\" don't jibe with experiences I've had with many atheists.

   "The thing is, if atheists are simply in \"defense\" mode, and attacking Christianity because of things like evolution being opposed in schools, then it doesn't speak well for atheists at all, and here's why ....\n \n Fundies, not Christians in general, are out to do these things. And too many atheists here don't seem too interested and willing to take note of the obvious distinction. Note, for example, how Kronos above didn't say \"And of course the people doing this are overwhelmingly fundamentalist\"; instead his comment above was \"And of course the people doing this are overwhelmingly Christian\".

No, it was fundamentalist Muslims. Was it mainstream Christians that have fought to get an anti-gay amendment passed? No, it has been fundamentalist Christians. It's not mainstream Mormons that engage in patristic polygamy with teenage women; it's the fundamentalist factions of Mormonism. Yet another sign of prejudice is a tendency to color an entire group by it's worst elements. Just because atheists are doing it, in this case, makes it no less wrong. \n \n Now, there are only two reasons why atheists, in defense of the nation from religious-based laws, would be unwilling to simply attack fundamentalism rather that Christian belief in general. 1.) they don't know the difference, or 2.) they know the difference, and don't care. I suspect most atheists know the difference--atheists generally aren't ignorant people. So what we have left is an unwillingness to draw the distinction--they just don't care.

I have no reason to think the atheists I've interacted with think life is meaningless or that they have no basis for some morality (though certainly a different basis!). And atheism certainly has connection to science, though I disagree with the blanket statements that \"engagement with scientific thinking tends to erode\" religious belief.\n \n I'm also struck by the fact that I see many, many more posts here of athiests criticizing religion in some way, than religious people criticizing atheists.\n \n * note how the article exemplifies spiritual experience only in completely NON-divine ways--atheists certainly are closed to the idea of spiritual experience that would have to do with the divine\n \n ** I've seen many not only ignore that religion is beneficial to society, but some even claim religion is bad for society \n\n \n Thats funny, because I find most religious people, conservative ones anyway, to be dogmatic and arrogant in their religion.

If a high profile fundie preacher says something outrageous and bigoted from their pulpit, it gets reported. If a moderate says something in repudiation of fundies from their pulpit, it's not as likely to be reported. If you visit a more \"liberal\" church, I'm confident you'll hear fundamentalism condemned at times.",
