   "I got to wonder what is the reason that (baseball players are usually the ones who get punished for this prodominately these days) athletes use steroids.\n I question this because I know some people who have to have steroids for medical purposes. They have some kind of medical problem (I don't want to go into it because of privacy for one and this thread isn't about the conditions they have but about the steroids) and the steroids, while helping their problem that it's needed for, affect there bodies in other ways. But it helps where it's needed to help. I'm all for drug usage if it's to help a medical problem. Everytime I hear about what the Steroids do negatively to their bodies, I got to know this.\n Does anyone know just why atletes (or anyone for that matter) who don't need Steroids uses them?",
