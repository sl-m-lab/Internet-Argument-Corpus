   "I am sorry, I didn't mean 5th, I meant the 2nd, the right to bear arms. Sorry for the confusion.\n\n \n No problem, Zachvac. I have actually heard someone argue that a requirement of filling out a firearms transaction form forces convicted felons to incriminate themselves when they go buy a gun (by an attorney, no less, which once again proves that lack of intelligence is no bar to success in the profession). \n \n I believe that the entire \"collective right\" theory is a sham. I believe that some of my gun control friends know in their hearts they are unable to debunk the overwhelming historical evidence which proves the Second Amendment was intended to recognize an individual right. I believe the reason why they are unwilling to admit that the right is individual is because they fear doing so will unleash a torrent of litigation that will abolish every law which regulates the possession of firearms. I want to again say that recognition of an individual RKBA will not have this doomsday effect. There are laws, like the ban on possession by felons, which will justly survive an individual right interpretation. I just wish I could get some of my more ardent (and unabashedly liberal) civil libertarian friends to give the Second Amendment a fair shake. They will rant and rave all day long about governmental abuse of other civil liberties. Yet, whenever the RKBA is mentioned, these staunch defenders of constitutional liberty will blanch and fall silent. Such conduct in my opinion reflects the triumph of the dictates of political correctness over reason.\n \n Well, I for one do not believe that the Second Amendment should be treated like it is the red headed step child of the Constitution-that it must be kept locked up in the restrictive basement which some legislators reserve to bury rights they disagree with or for hiding those which they fear may frighten the more enlightened guest who visits us from overseas; where they know that another government's long deprivation of the RKBA has caused its more timid subjects to become accustomed to its absence. So, my gun control friends, I say the time has come. It's time to let her come out of the windowless basement you have sought to regulate her to and let her enjoy the sunlight we reserve for all our constitutional liberties. It's time to stop the Orwellian double-think you force yourselves to engage in when you seek to cut and paste the Second Amendment out of our body of liberties. It's time to recognize the reality that the right is individual and move on to discuss what restrictions should or would survive a constitutional challenge. In doing so you have nothing to fear but fear itself.\n \n ------\n \n \"We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable....With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\"\n From The Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, As adopted by the Continental Congress, JUly 6, 1775 (Authored by Thomas Jefferson)",
