   "abortion is not an easy thing to do. in a way, it is murder- which i define as 'taking life away from another human being without trial or combat'. yes its a sick thing to do. but thats a good thing about it, not a bad thing: i strongly believe that abortion is a good thing. if you're dumb enough to take it lightly, you shouldn't be having kids in the first place. and if you understand what it is you're doing, you're less likely to do it and would make a much better parent than the aforementioned happy-go-luckies who take it lightly.\n \n my two cents, you're all perfectly welcome to jump down my throat for this.",

   "[QUOTE=TheDingo8MyBaby]f.y.i - Killing in trial or combat is still murder\n \n <Murder is punishable by law. Many kninds of killing are not legaly concidered murder.\n \n More importantly - you miss the point, nobody thinks killing in any way shape or form, at any age, birth or prebirth is O.K.\n \n <That's not true. We condone killing in many ways and places in life. War kills fetuses, babies and children, but it's okay becuase the govenment says so. Killing of animals in another. A cow is way more alive by all standards than a six week pregnancy and some people like the Hindus think they have souls but it's okay because most Americans are not Hindus. Killing those who have comit severe crimes, but it's okay because the court ordered it. Doing controled burns in the the forests kills more plants animals and oganisams than abortions done in one year in this country but it's okay becuase we need to do it so fires won't spread to the towns right? There are many religions that believe nature is sentient and has a soul but not the previaling religion in America.\n \n If you are going to purley look at the govenmental isuse of who has the right to choose the woman or the govenment then I think you have to leave it with the woman. Roe v. Wade already decided this in 1973. \n \n If you are going to argue that a fetus has rights of it's own then you have to try to decide what it's rights are and if there is a point at which the rights become appliciable and when they would not. That is a Philosphical issue and has been debated forever and can be debated forever. So the only logical legal answer is to tell the women she must take respondibility for her own choice to kill. I think women are willing and capable of doing that. We won't realy be able to say for everyone if abortion is immoral. Everyone has differant beliefs. If the Hindus are right then all beef eaters are killing and eating thier grandparents. \n ",
