I really think there are a lot of people in this country that, if they see two people walking arm on each shoulder, or (gasp) hand-in-hand, cant' get past the idea that the two have to be gay.

One friend who's from over there remarked how Americans seem so stand-offish to him in general (he's visited the U.S. himself). He knows it's because of the prevalence of homosexuality over here and the effect it's had on our culture.

Men in america are still non-sexually affectionate towards each other. Youy cannot take cultural differences between Afica and America and blame them on homosexuals. That is called heterosexualism.

I dare say I know MANY more gay people than you, and I certainly don't see any such tendancy in stereotyping anyone.

My partner is from Davao City, Philippines. I lived and worked in Mexico for 17 years. I see much more tolerance and acceptance of gay people there than here in the USA. You imply that homosexuality is more prevelant in the USA than in this un-named African country you allude to. I must disagree with you based on scientific studies ( as oppesed to your biased, prejudiced personal opinion) which indicate the incidence of homosexual orientation to be much the same throught different societies and geographic locations. Perhaps gays in the USA are more open than in the un-namrd Afircan country you allude to, but the factual evidence is that it is no more prevelant than anywhere else. What IS more prevelant is the homophobic prejudice openly displayed by people such as you. I personally know at least 5 gay people from Nigeria, and they describe a very robust gay comunnity there. Any redifinition of \"so many good things\" has been done by the homophobic people like you.\n \n \nWe have a lot we could learn from our African neighbors--there is still a level of innocence there that has long been lost in our country.\n\n \n We most certainly do: tolerance and understanding.
