   "The New York Times < Log In\n \n \nMayor Richard M. Daley has long insisted that the city's restrictive gun laws - including the handgun ban that was essentially nullified recently by the United States Supreme Court - have been a key crime-fighting tool.\n \n But court records show that relatively few people were convicted of violating the laws, and even top city officials have questioned how useful they are in deterring crime.\n \n Since 1982, when the city tightened its gun ordinances to include the handgun ban, there have been just 2,201 convictions under the laws, according to data obtained by the Chicago News Cooperative from the office of the Cook County Circuit Court clerk. That works out to an average of about 79 convictions a year.\n \n Jody Weis, the police superintendent, has said that the police have little reason to try to prosecute under the city laws because state and federal gun regulations carry much more serious penalties. The city ordinance carries a maximum sentence of three months in prison for first-time offenders, compared with three years for violation of commonly-used state gun-possession statutes and five years under federal laws.\n \n \"Those are much heavier hits than we'd have using the city ordinance to try to combat and to try to serve as a deterrent against this gun violence,\" Mr. Weis said Aug. 16 at a news conference.\n \n Yet Mayor Daley has repeatedly said it is essential for the city to have tough gun laws. \"When the wrong people have access to guns,\" he said in June, \"needless violence is likely to happen.\"\n \n The flow of firearms into the city continues to frustrate law-enforcement officials, despite the Daley administration's defense of the firearms ban that was effectively overturned by the court in June, just when Chicago was in the midst of a number of highly publicized shootings.\n \n From January through mid-August, the police department recorded 1,168 incidents of aggravated battery with a firearm, virtually the same as last year for the same period, the department's most common categorization of shootings, according to a department spokesman. During that time, the police recovered 5,195 illegal guns, also roughly the same as last year.\n \n Both police and city officials say the ordinance has not been the primary means for getting violent offenders off the streets.\n \n In June, Mara Georges, the city's top lawyer, told reporters the law was rarely invoked to put criminals behind bars. But later, Jennifer Hoyle, Ms. Georges's spokeswoman, sought to clarify her boss's remarks.\n \n \"We do bypass our ordinance because the penalties are more serious under state laws,\" Ms. Hoyle said. \"But there's this idea that we didn't really enforce the ordinance, and that's just not true. We prosecute people all the time.\"\n \n Those prosecutions, however, rarely result in convictions, according to the data from the clerk's office. While the police have made 12,967 arrests since 2000, city attorneys have won just 2,068 convictions.\n \n Gun owners in Chicago are required to register their weapons with the police department, to acquire a state identification card and to keep their guns in their home. Starting in 1982, Chicago also prohibited the registration of handguns, but two years ago, opponents of the ordinance filed suit in federal court, asserting that the ban infringed on their right to defend themselves.\n \n The Supreme Court ruled in June that cities and states could not pass laws that superseded the right to bear arms guaranteed in the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\n \n Ms. Hoyle said the city spent $90,000 on outside counsel to defend the ordinance before the court, including $20,000 covered by a grant from the nonprofit Joyce Foundation. In addition, she said, six city attorneys, who earn $57,000 to $149,000 a year, worked part time on the case as it proceeded through the courts.\n \n Charles Boesel, director of communications for the Joyce Foundation, said in a written statement that the city's gun ordinance was worth defending regardless of how often it was enforced, because a decision to apply the Second Amendment to states and municipalities \"could have profound implications for current and future gun policy in Chicago and nationwide.\"\n \n On July 2, four days after the court ruling, the City Council amended the gun ordinance at the mayor's behest. Handguns are now allowed within the city limits under strict regulation: Owners must undergo classroom and firing-range training by certified instructors; there is a limit of one handgun registration per person per month and only one handgun can be assembled in the home at a time; no handguns can be taken from the home, even onto a front porch, unless they are disassembled.\n \n When someone is picked up with an illegal weapon, the Chicago police and the Cook County state's attorney - and sometimes federal law-enforcement officials - decide whether to bring felony charges, which fall under federal and state laws. Violating a city ordinance is not a felony.\n \n Records show that while some arrests for violating gun laws have been made for violent offenders, others were made for failure to follow the registration rules. But the police have rarely arrested anyone solely for violating the city's gun ordinance. From 2005 through 2009, there were fewer than 100 arrests a year, on average, in which a violation of the ordinance was the most serious charge, according to the police department.\n \n It is far more common for the police to bring both city and state charges against someone caught with a gun. In February, Timothy Johnson, 23, was arrested on the South Side for allegedly threatening his mother with a loaded .38-caliber handgun. He was charged with aggravated assault and possessing a weapon without a valid state identification card, both state charges, as well as violating the city's handgun ban. The case is pending.\n \n The city ordinance has also been used to keep guns from citizens who try to register them legally. Gun owners rejected for registration violations have the right to appeal the decision and have an administrative hearing.\n \n In 2009, Niles Sherman's effort to register a handgun was denied, even though he had been allowed to register the weapon and four others since before the handgun ban went into effect. Mr. Sherman, 81, an alderman of the 21st Ward from 1979 to 1987, is supposed to be exempt from the handgun ban because he had been a Chicago police officer. But last year he was told that the city had no evidence that he was collecting a police pension.\n \n Mr. Sherman said that was because his police pension was wrapped into the pension he got from his time on the City Council. Presented with further documentation, a hearing officer reversed the police department's decision.\n \n \"The whole thing was so much you-know-what,\" Mr. Sherman said. \"I earned the right to have those guns, I bought them and, last but not least, if need be, I can use them.\"\n \n Mr. Sherman said he recently tried to register under the new ordinance, along with 255 others as of mid-August, a police spokesman said, adding that 156 applications have been approved. Mr. Sherman's was not one of them; he was told he had to undergo a new round of training on a shooting range.\n \n The original intent of the handgun ban was to make it more difficult to get a firearm in Chicago. Now, Mr. Sherman said, weapons are so much easier to obtain illegally that the gun laws only make it more cumbersome for citizens to register firearms.\n \n \"Why don't I just do like these punks on the street have done,\" he said, \"and put my guns away and pull them out and use them when I want?\" \n\n \n Now, all you gun control crazies, let's see you even try to defend Chicago's old gun control laws, when all the facts are now in.\n \n Go ahead and try. Give it your best shot. Defend their rightfully dead handgun ban.",
