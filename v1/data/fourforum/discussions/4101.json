   "All in all, I don't think creating a 'special' public school for gay kids is a good idea, even if some gay kids do get 'harassed.' There is no reason to think that gay kids get harassed any more in public school than kids with other issues that might set them apart from the rest. Shall we also create a special public school for kids who talk funny? What about kids who are smaller than others and get pushed around everytime a member of the football team comes into the room? High school is full of situations like this. What if the gay kids get to go to a different one together to get away from harassment, and other kids who get harassed for other reasons have to stay? Is that really fair?\n \n Also, if it's true (as some gay lobby folks indicate) that there is no outward difference between a gay person and a straight person, it seems that this problem wouldn't be as prevalent as it supposedly is. I suspect that part of the problem is that some kids perceive others as being effiminate, and therefore are harassed for maybe being gay. But I think kids tend to alienate and harass other kids who are simply different in numerous ways. Harassing a kid because he is effiminate may not be about him being gay at all.

Anti-gay bullying and assaults are common nationwide. It is the single most frequent reason for, or form of, harassment in schools, whether the recipient is gay or not.

   "jyoshu:\n \n On the most part, I actually agreed with you about the public school for gays only. But, what I don't agree with you on is idea that prejudice in kids doesn't come from their parents. \n It is a parents job to teach their children about the world and society. It is also a parents job to supervise what a child is exposed to and how that child processes that information. \n If a parent doesn't talk to their child and allows anti-social behavior to persist, it is most definitely a parent's fault. \n \n All too often parents are too preoccupied with their own lives to really know what is going on in their child's life. At least this is what I have observed in my area. I see too many kids just left to their own devises. Where they hang out with the wrong crowd, play way too many video games, watch too much violence on television and in movies, and are simply \"paid off\" by their parents. \n Many kids in my area are actually bought expencive cars/vehicles on their sixteenth birthdays. These parents do it for a number of reasons. One being that it's all social status, \"keeping up with the Jones'.\" Another is simply because the parents just can be bothered to be available to their children to drive them to the movies with their friends or to car pool them to school. \n All too often both parents must work outside the home just to retain their homes in \"good\" neighborhoods, to buy the designer clothes the other kids are wearing and to ensure they have their mini-dish television systems. \n It's all about status! \n And that is most definitely a value system we are teaching our children.",

   "I have mixed opinions on this school, and I think my true feelings about it depend primarily on the school's position on the matter itself. It is easy for the media to find a high school named after a slain gay person and call that school \"a school for gay and bisexual students\", even if those who run the school would not use those words themselves.\n \n In truth, I have just as much problem with a school saying that it is \"for LGBT people\" as I would if a school said it was \"for straight people\". I would have a similar problem with a school for black people and a school for white people. The concept that we can simply keep the gays away from the straights to stop students from harassing each other only delays problems. The world is not segragated, and students need to learn to deal with one another.\n \n Now, I have no problem with a school naming itself after a slain gay person and making the claim that any LGBT students will not be discriminated against, and harassment of them will not be tolerated. In fact, I would encourage all schools to do this. From reading those stories, it is entirely possible that this is all the school said; but if the school does claim to be \"for gay people\", then I would not approve of it.",

   "Before this thread goes any further, maybe folks should learn a bit about the school we're \"debating\". \n \n If you visit the site, you'll notice a very high percentage of non-white students in the photos. To an extent, that reflects the diversity that is NYC. More to the point, however, it reflects the fact that gay kids in poor, ethnic communities face far more hostile anti-gay environments at home and are far more likely to be kicked out of their homes for being gay. \n \n They are far more likely to give up.\n \n \n http://www.hmi.com\n \n <<Our mission\n \n \n \n The Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI), Home of The Harvey Milk High School, believes all young people, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, deserve a safe and supportive environment in which to achieve their full potential. HMI creates this environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth between the ages of 12 and 21 and their families.\n \n Through a comprehensive package of direct services and referrals, HMI seeks to foster healthy youth development. HMI's staff promotes excellence in the delivery of youth services and uses its expertise to create innovative programs that other organizations may use as models.<<\n \n \n <<Q: What's the Harvey Milk High School?\n \n A: The Harvey Milk High School is an inclusive voluntary public high school focusing on the educational needs of children who are in crisis or at risk of physical violence and/or emotional harm in a traditional educational environment. The Harvey Milk High School has been in existence for almost two decades, and is now a four-year, fully-accredited high school. 95% of HMHS students graduate, well above the NYC average, and over 60% of HMHS students go onto advanced programs or college.<<\n \n \n <<Q: Why can't at-risk children remain in their current schools? Isn't this segregation? \n \n A: These are children that have been in traditional schools, but have needed to leave or have dropped out because of physical violence and/or emotional harm. Thanks to HMHS they have a safe place to learn so that they can graduate with an education, a diploma and their lives ahead of them. Being in a separate space during the school day doesn't mean that these students will never learn how to adjust to the demands of the larger world. Every day they face real-life pressures, including harassment.\n \n It is not segregation to remove a child from a dangerous situation in order to give them a chance to learn safely. HMHS is a successful refuge for a small portion of youth, who have fled unsafe schools in order to secure their right to a safe educational environment; no one is arguing for a totally separate school system. <<",
