Cellular structures ARE determined by genes and upon mutation the structure and functions involved may be changed greatly. If you do not think so then consider that hemoglobin produced by the sickle cell trait mutation has a different structure and differing function from normal hemoglobin.

   "First you prove ABSOLUTELY that your GOD exists. Or alternatively PROVE ABSOLUTELY that the sun will \"rise\" in the sky tomorrow.\n\n \n More obfuscation chemist ? You know that you're nothing but a blow hard who is making huge unprovable and unsupportable assumptions so just vacate and derail the debate rather than simply support what you say happened more than 400 million years ago on a dead planet void of all life. I mean, you speak with such all knowing confidence, surely you must have proof of what you assume happened, dont you chemist ? \n \n No matter how you slice it, you believe that from the simplest single celled life form cam creatures with organs, limbs, nervous systems and brains that even developed the ability to reason and be self aware. All through RANDOM MUTATIONS. By accident according to your logic. Forget the odds of such diverse and complex life happening by accident and you still have the problem of all this happening by accident in only 400 million years. The best objective minds don't believe such incredible calculations could result accidently in 400 trillion years without some intelligent help.\n \n \nActually new organs are developed only by MODIFICATION of existing ones. But those modifications are due to chages in the existing physical and chemical structures. New chemical structures can however arise easily by mutation. For example mutation of a single base in chloroplast DNA results in effectively total resistance to the microbial peptide tentoxin. One can indeed turn it on and turn it off with a little genetic manipulation. In addition the specific mechanisms involved are well described in the literature. Glad to supply a set of links if anyone really wants to read them, but will not do so unless requested. CF1 I might add is one of the most important body parts to be found anywhere - most of our food supply depends on its turbine like function.\n\n \n \n..\n \n Flagella are composed of proteins, all the proteins present are specified by genes which fix the primary structure of the proteins. The physicochemical interactions between the proteins are structurally dependent. Change the structure and you can and do change the functioning of the flagella. For example there are right rotating and left rotating flagella! Much like right and left handed nuts and bolts.\n \n And by the way there is no CREATION involved at all, just more and more detailed and well understood chemistry. Its not purposeful, its not intentional and it need be neither.\n\n \n \nI'll post the links here tomorrow, the story goes back to the 1970s or so and is rather interesting if you follow if top to bottom.\n \n And yes I know SS has a perspective more or less limited to anatomical organs in multicelluar animals, but that is giving him far too much leeway. To show him how it works I would choose a botanical context, but he would not get that either. Going from a primoidal stem to say a corn plant would stress his capacity beyond its limits. Maybe he would be more comfortable with nematode development and genetics its well characterized or with D. melanogaster which is also well known.\n\n \n \nAnd yea I say unto thee that the modification of a single gene in a very primitive organism IS in fact the way \"organs\" were initially modified and that such modification is common as dirt, is easily demonstrated, and is well documented. And the changes are NOT so small that you cannot see them. Again I refer you to the way in which the CF1 organ of chloroplasts can become resistant to the attack and inhibition of tentoxin. A single point mutation does the job nicely. And an organ consisting of many proteins assembled in a sophisticated way is brought to its knees by a simple small molecule! Some of the relevant links were posted earlier, enough to get you into the spceific scientific literature. Of course if you do not read it thats not my loss or my problem.\n",

   "Just as in your mind evo itself is a fact, but there is no more reliable evidence of it beyond the huge and unprovable assumption you infer than your imaginary and self made sour grapes argument.\n\n \n Really? Is it really unproven? If so, why is it that even though we all supposedly come from the same two people, some humans have no appendix? It's the process of evolution kicking in, mutating out those useless organs. What about the fact that no human fossil has ever been found outside the pleistocene period? Not to mention the fact that it would be impossible for any of the larger mammals to survive that meteor that hit 65 million years ago because the food chain went awry, and I'm pretty sure blue whales can't eat worms.",
