   "According to the leaders of Georgian opposition parties and political movements, the current anti-corruption campaign in Georgia is apparently of a selective character and is aimed mainly against President Saakashvili's opponents and his closest entourage. At the same time, those loyal to President Saakashvili along with Georgian enterprisers related to the regime, oligarchs and officials who are firmly identified with venal practices and criminality are still inapproachable for Georgian law-enforcement authorities. Some of them feel so safe that even started openly patronize local organized criminal groups!\n \n According to a member of opposition Pikria Chikhradze from the parliamentary Block \"Right Opposition - Industrialists - New Rights\", the three dominating smuggler groupings in Shida Kartli region (Georgia) are patronized by certain upper officials.\n \n A so-called group of Tkviavi is under patronage of Defence Minister Irakli Okruashvili (ex-Minister for Home Affairs) and his best friend Mikheil Kareli - Presidential Envoy and Governor of Shida Kartli region.\n \n Bondo Vacheishvili - the Chairman of Gori District Court - coordinates the group of Akhrisi.\n \n Nukri Papuashvili (Gori Chief Administration) and Samson Kebadze (agriculture and food regional department officer) are carefully patronizing the group of Devidze brothers.\n \n On the authority of Shalva Natelashvili, the Chairman of Labor Party of Georgia, during the year 2004, Georgi Baramidze (the State Minister for Euro-Atlantic Integration) had the \"income\" of over $60 Mio out of U.S. and E.U. Trust funds destined for Georgian security ministries. During the same period, the head of defense department Irakli Okruashvili also had got a substantial sum of money from trade in arms and the sale of distrained property of Adzhar leader Aslan Abashidze and from \"privatization\" of a number of Adzhar enterprises.\n \n Georgian oppositionists do not close out the fact that other politicians from the top echelon of authorities might also have access to the \"black moneybox\" packed with the profit from arms smuggling and Adzhar privatization.\n \n Maybe that is apparently the reason for Georgia to be in the top state corruption list.",
