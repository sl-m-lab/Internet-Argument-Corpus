   "LORD Fellow of Woodhenge founded Stonehenge College University.\n \n Stonehenge Chalk Extraction Mine\n Chalkboard Bluestone Mine School\n \n http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy140/images/blackboard.jpg\n \n Stonehenge lecture hall at Stonehenge College University was a large area outside the Double Bluestone Horseshoe used for instruction. Unlike the inside Double Bluestone Horseshoe traditional Stonehenge classroom having a small capacity, the capacity of Stonehenge lecture hall outside the Double Bluestone Horseshoe measured in the hundreds. Stonehenge lecture hall had a pitched bank so those in the rear were elevated higher than those in the front, giving them visual access to the Bluestone blackboards and instructor. Bluestone chalkboard:\n \n The Black Igneous Bluestone\n Chalkboards are Blackboards\n \n http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2314/2400177805_0b382416da.jpg\n \n Stonehenge classroom at Stonehenge College University was a smaller area room inside Double Bluestone Horseshoe where teaching and learning activities took place. Interesting enough Stonehenge lecture hall and Stonehenge classroom each had their own large writing surface areas because of Double Bluestone Horseshoe, where the Bluestone blackboard Stonehenge lecture hall instructor and Bluestone chalkboard classroom instructor shared knowledge and notes with other members of classes. Lecture and classroom instructors taught simultaneously.\n \n We Never Ran Out of Chalk\n LORD Fellow of Woodhenge\n \n http://www.crayolastore.com/imagesEdp/p36835b.jpg\n http://www.crayolastore.com/imagesEdp/p36835b.jpg\n \n Happy Solstice\n Garry Denke",
