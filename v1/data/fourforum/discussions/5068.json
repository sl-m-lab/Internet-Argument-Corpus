   "I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. Tax receipts are up although somewhat expected but could still be an indicator of future economic performance. Stock market should tell the tale.\n ========================\n \n Tax Receipts Exceed Treasury Predictions\n Early Surge Lowers Deficit Projections\n \n By Jonathan Weisman\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Thursday, May 5, 2005; Page E01\n \n After three years of rising federal budget deficits, a surge of April tax receipts brought unexpected good news to fiscal policymakers -- the tide of government red ink appears to be receding.\n \n The Treasury Department this week reported there would be a $54 billion swing from projected deficit to surplus in the April-to-June quarter, after an unanticipated gush of tax payments poured into the Treasury before the April 15 deadline. That prompted private forecasters to lower their deficit projections for the fiscal year that ends in September.\n \n Budget analysts inside and outside the government said the positive turn is likely to be short-lived. Indeed, after a four-year absence, the Treasury Department announced yesterday it is considering reissuing its 30-year Treasury bond to help finance long-term government debt, jolting the bond markets and pushing down the price of existing 30-year securities.\n \n But in the short term, many forecasters said the budget deficit appears to have crested.\n \n \"I think it has turned the corner,\" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency. \"My guess is 2004 will have been the worst year.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402134.html",

   "Huh. \n \n \nAlso, by next year, costs from the new prescription drug benefit should start rolling in. By the end of the decade, pressure from the retiring baby boom generation will start pushing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security costs up significantly\n\n \n Yikes. \n \n \n\"The deficit has nothing to do with it,\" said Timothy S. Bitsberger, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets. \"In fact, we think the deficits are coming down.\"\n \n Wall Street wasn't buying it. \"If you weren't borrowing this much, you wouldn't be doing it,\" Wyss said. \"No question.\"\n\n \n hahahahahaha. emoticon_xgood",
