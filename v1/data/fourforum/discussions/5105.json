   "I really like this site......\n http://epistle.us/articles/responses.html\n \n God loves the sinner, but hates the sin.\n Yes, this is true and many fundamentalists will say the same thing about themselves.\n \"I love the sinner, but hate the sin\". Well...if they really LOVED the sinner (referring to us), why is it that chances are they haven't lifted a finger to talk to gay people, befriend us, invite us to dinner, or find out what we go through?\n The only contact they make with us is to tell us we're going to hell and usually from across the street or on a TV monitor. They like to say they love us because it makes them look like saints...\n but fact is...they don't want us anywhere near them. The same thing for the homeless, prostitutes, crooks, etc. (All the people Jesus cares about)\n Praise the Lord; Jesus loves us more than these nervous folks ever will.\n \n Gays live a wild promiscuous life.\n Yes, there are some gay men who live a wild sex crazed life. But there is also a large segment of the straight population...for example...during College Spring Break who indulge in wanton wild drinking sex parties.\n Of course, I have heard rumors that 60 something percent of married people cheat on their spouses...and judging from some daytime TV...it seems that straight people are running amok screwing each other and their cousins. Is it just me?\n Those in glass houses shouldn't throw bricks (or as Jesus said...throw the first stones).\n Just as there are wild straight men running around looking for a good time, there are also boring, quiet gay monogamous couples who stay at home, watch TV and read, like everyone else...oh and by the way...they love the Lord and go to church every Sunday and even sing in the choir.\n \n Being Gay is a Choice.\n If some straight people really believe that sexuality is a choice, then that means they believe every person is bisexual (has the capacity to go either way) and if they think we have a choice, then that means there was a time in their own lives when they themselves had to decide if they wanted to be straight or gay. So you do agree then that God made YOU bisexual, yes?\n And you made a choice to be straight...am I correct? Because that is what you are basically saying when you say that \"we chose to be gay\". Why would we have the ability to choose to be gay...but you were born straight? I don't get it. Where was I when all the kids at school were trying to decide whether to be gay or straight? Were there discussions and forums with adults helping to lead us to the better decision?\n If it was a choice, why are there so many tormented teens who commit suicide? They could just have easily chosen to switch rather than kill themselves.\n If we were able to, we would have ALL chosen to live in the safer, easier world of heterosexuality, but we couldn't because our sexuality is something that we cannot choose or change.\n And if it were a choice...why would anyone choose a lifestyle that causes divisions and harassment with friends, family and society?\n Fundamentalist like to say we have a choice because it makes us responsible for making ourselves gay. In so doing, it makes it OK for them to make judgments about us that ONLY GOD CAN MAKE.\n And it seems even the Father does not judge us. See John 5:22\n In condemning us, they are putting themselves in the position of God...and we know what Jesus said about these kinds of people.\n The only real choice we do make, is to accept the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ and to rest in His eternal love.\n Jesus came not to judge us, but to save us. (John 3:17, John 12:47)\n And protects us from unhappy control freaks. Praise the Lord!",

Not surprising that they did not enact \"equal rights\" to pagans, heretics nor homosexuals. In fact, Christianity was the only allowed religion practiced. Since their descendants (fellow professing Christans) still were the driving force in the country at the time of the American Revolution, the intent was for Christianity would be the driving force into the future.

Since God chose Pharoah ahead of time to be destroyed then it is not by lifestyle. You see that Pharoah was chosen by God for destruction before Pharoah repented of his life- style. In fact, it says that God hardened Pharoah's heart so he would be destroyed.\n \n Psalms 147: 19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. (his word: Heb. his words) 20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.\n \n Ex 4: 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: 23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.\n \n Ex 7: 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. . . . . 13 And He (The Lord) hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n \n Ex 9: 25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were , was there no hail. 27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. (mighty...: Heb. voices of God) 29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. 30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. 32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. (not grown...: Heb. hidden or, dark)\n \n Rom 9: 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.\n 14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. 19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? 21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?\n \n So thank you for the out of context sermon.\n \n Oh BTW here is Jesus discriminating against someone for who she IS also.\n \n Matt 15: 21 And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan coming forth from those borders cried out to Him, saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is vilely demon-possessed. 23 But He did not answer her a word. And coming near, His disciples asked Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us. 24 But answering, He said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 25 But coming, she worshiped Him, saying, Lord, help me! 26 But answering, He said, It is not good to take the bread of the children to throw it to the little dogs. 27 But she said, Yes, Lord; for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their lords. 28 Then answering, Jesus said to her, O woman, your faith is great; let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.\n \n Mark 7: 24 And rising up from there, he went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entering into the house, He desired no one to know, but He could not be hidden. 25 For hearing about Him, a woman came up, one whose daughter had an unclean spirit. And she fell down at His feet. 26 And the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phenocian by race. And she asked Him, that He would cast out the demon from her daughter. 27 And Jesus said to her, First, allow the children to be satisfied, for it is not good to take the children's bread and to throw it to the dogs. 28 But she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of the children. 29 And He said to her, Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out from your daughter. 30 And going away to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter was laid on the couch.",

How is it separated from the action, when the sinners, and non-believers, as people, are killed and then, as people, not let into God's little club? It's not just the sin that is killed and not let into heaven. Murder, blood baths and atrocities are comitted against sinners, even when they are one's own children, and to those who don't believe or act a certain way, in the Bible. If you believed in the God in the Bible, you would believe in a bloodthirsty and oppressing tyrant who leaves no room for debate or thinking for one's self. Under the \"inferior laws of humans\", a person who did these things would be in prison for life. Surely if we take a literal view of the Bible, God is a tyrant we need to rise up against. We wouldn't call such a human individual a suitable leader, so why call someone or something like that, \"God\"? Why would anyone want to be a part of God's kingdom, if that is what God is about?\n \n The following email is very facetious, but makes the same point, with the appropriate verses. It only deals with the New Testament...\n \n \n \nM E M O R A N D U M\n \n \n From: Pastor Harry Hardwick, Chairman of the Landover Baptist committee for sorting out True Christians from folks who only say they are \"Christians,\" but are really unsaved trash who make Jesus vomit\n \n \n \n Re: Your Staus as a Fake \"God is Love\" Christian \n \n \n \n Dear, Unsaved Fake Christian Trash: \n \n It has been determined conclusively by our committee that you are the type of pseudo-Christian who goes around making a fool of both yourself and the Lord by spouting the saccharine, annoying lie \"God is Love.\" There are no appeals from this righteous judgment. \n \n \n We delight in informing you that, contrary to your sissified view of things, the Bible isn't a tiny pamphlet with nothing more than namby-pamby verses that make the Lord Jesus sound like some prancing homosexual florist blowing air-kisses to everyone who comes in His overly-fragranced path.\n \n \n \n There are plenty of verses in the Bible that reveal what Jesus plans to do to people like you who ignore 99% of His Word in favor of emphasizing the two or three verses that, when taken completely out of context, create a soft, cuddly Jesus that more reflects your childish need for an imaginary friend straight out of a Disney cartoon than it does the authentic Jesus who shall sit on the White Throne of Judgment of the Bible!\n \n \n \n The real Jesus approved of His Father's command that children who curse their parents be put to death (Matthew 15:3-4). In fact, Jesus chastised the Pharisees for failing to kill children who defied their parents' wishes (Mark 7:9-13). Jesus told us we are to live our lives in utter fear of God for God has the power not only to kill us but also to torture us forever in Hell (Luke 12:5).\n \n \n \n Jesus told His disciples to bring before Him any man who didn't believe in Him and to violently slaughter that man while Jesus watched (Luke 19:27). Jesus killed one man by having his body eaten by a swarm of worms because the man failed to give Jesus His due (Acts 12:23). Jesus struck a Jew blind for thwarting His teachings (Acts 13:8-11). Jesus struck a man dead for failing to listen well (Luke 1:20). Jesus took the lives of a couple by scaring them to death for not forking over all of the money they made on a real estate transaction (Acts 5:1-10). Jesus had such a hot temper, not only was he wont to flip over merchants' tables (Matthew 21:12), He even killed a fig tree for failing to bear fruit even though figs weren't in season (Mark 11:12-14).\n \n \n \n Of course, Jesus knew He didn't have enough time to torture every sinner while He was alive, so He promised to do much more after He passed. Jesus said that, come Judgment Day, sinners will be gathered together and hurled into a furnace of fire where there will be uncontrollable wailing and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 13:41-42, 50). Entire cities of people who don't believe in Him will suffer a fate worse than that of Sodom and Gomorra (Mark 6:11). Jesus said that God will take vengeance on nonbelievers by burning them \"in flaming fire\" (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). The Lord will create horse-like locusts with human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth and scorpion's tails that will sting and inflict savage pain on sinners for five months (Revelation 9:7-10). \n \n \n \n After God sends fires, plagues and beasts God to Earth, the world will be covered in unburied dead bodies rotting everywhere while good Christians will \"rejoice over them and make merry, and shall send gifts to one another\" (Revelation 11:5-10). Meanwhile, the smoke of the burning, rotting bodies will ascend and plague the Earth forever (Revelation 14:10-11). And the smell will attract scavenger birds that will feast upon \"the supper of the great God\" (Revelation 19:17-18). \n \n \n \n Jesus will send an earthquake to kill 7,000 people (Revelation 11:13). He will inflict bodily sores, turn the seas and rivers to blood, scorch everyone with fire, cause people to consume their own tongues. Oh, and He'll cause horrendous storms, too (Revelation 16:1-21).\n \n \n \n Now, what was it you said about unconditional love? In the United States, if you engaged in the acts Jesus promised to do, you would find yourself in prison for the rest of your life. Contrary to the way you view Him, Jesus was no sissy! He doesn't sit around meekly crying over sinners not worshiping Him enough - He kills them. And then tortures them for good measure!\n \n \n \n So, phony Christian, continue ignoring all the parts of the New Testament you don't like, and latch onto the little nancy-boy verses you prefer. But bear in mind that the single page of the Bible you like to quote will incinerate in less than a second when your sorry XXX is hurled into the furnace of an everlasting Hell!\n \n \n \n Praying those who pick and choose which parts of the Bible to quote are the first plunged into the fiery abyss,\n \n \n \n Brother Harry Hardwick\n \n \n Chairman, Landover Baptist Salvation Evalution Subcommittee\n\n \n http://www.bettybowers.com/oprah.html",

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. 16But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'[b] 17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.\n \n ummm irrelevant...but it totally contradicts Matt 7:3-5 (3\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\")\n \n 2 Thess 3:6\n 6In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching[a] you received from us.\n \n Don't hang out with sinners, we get it\n \n 2 Cor 6:14-18\n 14Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 15What harmony is there between Christ and Belial[a]? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 16What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: \"I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.\"[b]\n 17\"Therefore come out from them\n and be separate, says the Lord.\n Touch no unclean thing,\n and I will receive you.\"[c]\n 18\"I will be a Father to you,\n and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.\"[d]\n \n Yeah yeah, don't hang out with sinners...again...we get it! Though, Jesus DID hang out with tax collectors and whores...so, doesn't that make it okay to be friends with sinners? Since, ya know, we're all sinners? If we weren't friends with sinners, we'd have no friends.",
