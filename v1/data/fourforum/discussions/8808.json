   "The fact is that Yuschenko and Timoshenko lost control over radical Crimean Tatars' representatives. Look, it's well-known that Yuschenko wanted to use them against Russian-speaking population of the peninsula. He hoped that Tatrs would help him to change the situation in the Crimea to the benefit of the orange team and supported them. As a result of it Tatars who got Ukraine president support felt their own might and now they are trying to blackmail Ukraine officials. \n It's well-known that Turkey has been supporting Crimean Tatars too in hope to get the Crimea back. Through Turkish intelligence the Tatars got close ties with al Qaeda and using this connection they are trying to blackmail Ukrainian officials. \n In addition to it Tatars threaten by organizing of mass disorders in the Crimea so that the local officials could see the Tatars' intentions are quite serious. IMHO Tatars dream that Ukraine officials will close their eyes to their moves against Russian-speaking people. And now Yuschenko is likely to have become aware that if he washes his hands of it the result will be a civil war. But he is in a dead-end now and can't refuse Tatars' demands.",
