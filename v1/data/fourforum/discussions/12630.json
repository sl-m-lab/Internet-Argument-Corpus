   "But the problem with your first statement Waxy is that YEC believes that oil and gas deposits were created by the flood, that the weight of the water was the primary force of compression. That would essentially be uniform globally on land masses thus a YEC view on oil and gas exploration should expect that deposits are almost uniformly found everywhere on land because the compression force of flood waters is equal. Even more strange, since it was the water of the flood compression was primarily on land, there should not be deposits underwater. Reading seismic logs and other data that is specific to locations and specific geological areas to determine where to drill contridicts YEC as we should be able to find oil and gas everywhere on land according to that belief. \n \n Understanding basic gas and oil geology refutes one of the biggest beliefs in YEC.

And then he goes on to ask an unprovable question which just confirms that this is a baiting thread which has no more validity to it than his ability to dream up ridiculous assumptions which are born in his warped and disturbed imagination. \n \n One further question I would aske those who do believe in evolution is, if you are such an intelligent and insightful lot then why don't any of you, and I mean ANY OF YOU AT ALL ever have the intellectual honesty or fortitude to challenge him or others who create these strawman and fallacious threads? I mean, after all, this obvious child is the guy who said this in another baiting thread he started, and I quote him precisely: If god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?

In fact, this entire forum is full of posts detailing how YEC is merely one belief within the greater religion, one not held by many Christians. You, on the other hand, have been shown to constantly tie and lie YEC to equate to Christanity despite that being obviously full of #### and complete untrue.

   "How you figure that?\n\n \n Already explained that to you yesterday. Again, from Archangel:\n \n \"An acceptance of YEC IS NOT A SALVATION ISSUE WHICH DETERMINES IF ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL BASIS IN ANY WAY. SO I HAVE NEVER SAID EVEN ONCE ON THIS OR ANY FORUM, NOR HAVE I SAID TO ANY PERSON EVER THAT UNLESS YOU ACCEPT YEC, THEN YOU CAN'T BE SAVED.\"\n \n Source\n \n \n\n The OP and everyone else is discussing YEC. Waxy specifically was discussing YEC. No one was talking about Christanity as a whole. Then Arch comes and notice it is HIM who takes the whole discussion as an attack on Christanity rather than YEC. It was HIS post that specifically said Christanity rather than YEC like the rest of us.\n \n Notice the first use of the word \"Christian\" It is in post #8. Arch's post. \n \n This is the exact quote: \"But hey it's child and he needs to post any fallacious attack on christians he can dream up.\" Never mind how everything up to that point was specifically about YEC. \n \n\n \n It could be possible that Archangel thinks that you really are anti-Christian. One could express being anti-Christian by attacking the most salient part of the group of Christians (i.e. the Creationists). One doesn't have to equate Christianity with YEC to perceive an attack on YEC to be the primary means of waging a broader offensive on Christianity as a whole. \n \n \n\n Outside of quotations of Arch's post, the next time we see the equating is in post #17:\n \n \"One is an atheist and the other is a christian/creationist.\" Again, another Arch post. The even more obvious thing is that arch tries to make this into an atheist vs Christian argument rather than science vs YEC. The sheer amount of tying is insane. \n\n \n I think that this quote works against you a bit. If Archangel really did believe what you say, that Christianity and YEC are the same thing, then why mention both? Wouldn't that be like saying a US American? If Christianity and YEC are the same, maybe he would just use one term instead of both. \n \n \n\n Post #27 has Arch linking to a Christian geologist website despite no one except him talking about the religion as a whole. Remember that the title of the thread is \"YEC in oil fields\" NOT \"Christanity in oil fields.\" \n\n \n Well, let's pull out an essay from the website that was referenced and pull out a passage:\n \n \n Age of the earth.\n \n Agreement: Young-earthers, by definition, and scientific creationists both agree that the earth is about 10,000 to perhaps 20,000 years old.\n \n Conflict: Most conventional geologists would accept the 4.5 billion year old age given by several independent lines of evidence.\n \n Comment: Unfortunately, here is where many scientific creationists err. The Bible clearly states the age of the earth &#8211; in the beginning (Genesis1:1). Why is a young earth necessary? From my own correspondence, scientific creationists and young-earthers \"want\" a young earth so that evolution will not have time to operate. Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO! (But remember, in science one is never 100% certain. There is always the possibility of error.) But is this a problem? Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I haven&#8217;t. I fully believe that God has given us talents to use &#8211; to investigate his creation. Should we fear the results?\n \n I have struggled many, many years with the creation/evolution debate. The questions raised above represent only a small number of the ideas, thoughts, and queries I have had. While writing this I happened across a Bible verse that put the debate in perspective: For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. (Isaiah 65:17) Until this time, I welcome your comments and thoughts.\n \n While the author is not saying he is 100% sure that creationism is true, it's clear that he clearly leans towards creationism. Therefore, Archangel's listing of the website as a site of people who believe in YEC is fair enough, given that part of the selected reading is very favorable to creationism.\n \n \n\n need I go on or will you accept that Arch argues YEC = Christanity?\n \n\n \n What you really need to prove your argument about Arch is a slam dunk. Something along the lines of this:\n \n People who do not believe in creationists are not real Christians.\n \n \n That's would be a slam dunk for you, if you could ever show that Arch said anything like that. \n \n \n\n He's not equating the two by using the terms interchangeably? So a part that is interchangeable with another in similar machine is not the same part? So a standard spark plug used in every Toyota car is not the same since they are interchangeable? That doesn't make much sense. If any. \n \n\n \n Already addressed this in response to your quote on post #8.\n \n \n\n Where did you go to school? And was your English teacher fired after you left?\n\n \n A better school than yours. You obviously took the little bus to school. :)\n \n \n\n Actually, if you bothered to read the thread, everyone except Arch is talking about YEC and geology. Arch has attempted to turn this into Christanity vs detractors despite no one attacking Christanity.\n\n \n I bothered to read the thread, you bothered to see only what you wanted to see. Although the evidence does not prove such a conclusion, I could accept Arch being wrong. The dishonesty you show means that you cannot accept the possibility that you are wrong.",

That being said, it's possible that he lied. It's possible that you lied. It's possible that everyone on this thread is lying. The error of your reasoning is that you assume what COULD BE with what is LIKELY. From the point of view of someone who doesn't like Arch, it's still reasonable to believe that Arch:\n \n * Actually believes you are a Christian basher\n \n OR\n \n * Has used some hyperbole in denigrating your position \n \n Those are reasonable assumptions based upon someone who does not like Arch. You reject them out of hand (which seems unreasonable) and immediately proceed to the worst scenario: \n \n * Arch is lying about what he believes. \n \n \n\n You yourself have failed to even address the actual evidence of his tying arrangement. \n\n \n I'll admit that I didn't see it until about half an hour ago. Those posts are at the bottom of the thread and people posted after it, pushing the thread into a new page. You don't have to believe that and you are free to use that as fodder for insults against me. I will be sure to return the favor. :)\n \n \n\n And if you bothered to read the thread, you would have noticed I stated that YEC is one of many beliefs within Christanity and often not held by many Christians. How can I imply that Creationists are not Christians (well, some aren't, namely the Muslims and Jews) when I stated that early on in the thread? \n\n \n I could accuse you of lying.....the same way you do to Arch.\n \n \n\n Seriously? Before we took you serious, now it looks like you're just supersport back with a new account. \n\n \n You speak on behalf of the forum? I don't think so. Your last thread entitled \"YEC = Christianity\" was reported for trolling by someone who shares your politics, and it wasn't me. Someone else replied who gives a s*** about this? It seems that many people are on to your hatred for Arch and that you don't speak for them. \n \n As for supersport, that is not me. Perhaps, you are the old poster supermoron, who has come back with a new account. :)",

   "So? That means nothing compared to what he did. \n\n \n He \"did\" nothing. It's not a question of what he \"did\"; it's a question of your interpretation of what he did and the possibilities that you rule out without even considering them.\n \n \n\n Or more accurately, Arch thinks that anyone who disagrees with him is anti-Christian and an atheist. Including other Christians.\n\n \n Oh, more accurately? Then it should be very easy to prove that Arch doesn't simultaneously think:\n \n YEC is not equal to Christianity\n \n AND\n \n You are anti-Christian \n \n \n\n Seriously? If I was anti-Christian, I'd be making the bull**** threads like those in the gay and religion forum. \n\n \n I don't know if you are or you aren't, but given that you've just implied that there are anti-Christians, is it not reasonable to conclude that someone could believe you to be an anti-Christian rightly or wrongly? \n \n \n\n Don't know. But he doesn't do it for the rest. The rest he removes creationist or YEC and instead replaces it solely with Christianity. \n \n\n \n Which again can be explained by him possibly perceiving you as a Christian basher. \n \n \n\n What form of Creationism? He clearly rejects YEC. But that does not mean he rejects a Deist view of origin. But that is not what we are talking about. \n\n \n He says: \"Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I haven't.\"\n \n \n Before this he says: \"Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO!\" \n \n The Bible (read literally) supports a young earth. He says there is no scientific evidence to discredit this. So he's not just a deist, but more of the God made the universe like it says in the Bible kind of creationist.\n \n \n\n Except that it's not YEC and we have long been discussing just YEC. Grasping for straws you are. You are dishonestly arguing that all forms of Creationism are the same where this discussion was always focused on JUST YEC. \n\n \n What's dishonest is your claiming that the source is not YEC without providing proof, as well as your dishonesty in not recognizing that the author's very low relative value on science makes him closer to YEC than deism. Lastly, it's dishonest of you to say that I am grasping at straws, when it's your straws. You're the one who chose to pick Arch's source as evidence of her supposed YEC = Christianity views. You provide no quotes from the source, but instead find yourself on the defensive and that's me \"grasping at straws\"? Clearly delusional on your part.\n \n \n\n Maybe to you. The rest of us all accept that Arch believes YEC = Christanity. \n\n \n Again, given that two people who believe in evolution have commented on the dishonesty of your YEC = Christianity thread, and the thread was shat upon by a third person as well, your claim to be a spokesman of some sort is compromised.\n \n \n\n Cite. \n\n \n If you cannot remember comments I made in posts that are less than an hour old, then that is your problem. Find it yourself. \n \n \n\n hardly. You think that interchangeable use of words means that the person using the words interchangeably doesn't think they mean the same thing. Therefore parts made for multiple cars to be used interchangeably are not the same part. \n\n \n Believe that you have some intelligence if you wish, I know better than to try to get you to see reason. Again, you fail on two fronts here: you fail to distinguish between your subjective OPINION that someone uses a word interchangeably and the objective facts of how someone used the word. Secondly, your opinion is compromised by the fact that you have not provided any reason to reject alternative hypotheses to your opinion. \n \n \n\n Then why are the only one who thinks that way? \n\n \n Again, your YEC=Christianity thread was reported yesterday by another evolutionist besides myself and further condemned by a third poster.

Get it? \n \n \nProve this allegation that these locations oppose what creationism says is possible from our perspective.\n\n \n Simply put, is oil found everywhere? No. It's not. \n But the Flood argues it is. \n \n The Chemistry of Oil - Explained by Flood Geology\n Sedimentary Rock: Face of the Earth\n \n \nIf a \"high sedimentation rate\" will preserve organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate, such as we envision for the worldwide Flood, would uproot, kill, and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrins off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Under this model, flood geologists would predict that porphyrins should be commonly found in sedimentary rocks\n\n \n They argue that the compression of the water and sediment made the oil. They also argue that oil and gas are found largely in sedimentary rock. The thing is that such rock covers roughly 75% of the land and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, we should be finding oil pretty much everywhere according to flood geology models. \n \n Interestingly enough, Flood geology rejects plate tetonics as well as rejecting oil formation in ocean water. It's internally a bunch of contradictions. Oil can't form in ocean water, but the sea floor made of rocks where oil is expected to be is has oil. Wait what? emoticon_xbouncer I can go on and on. But you get the point. The flood model is inherently contradictory and wrong.\n \n \nI am arguing from reality according to my belief system which rejects your evolutionist belief system as rational or absolutely provable.

OK daewoo? \n \n \nSimply put, is oil found everywhere? No. It's not. \n But the Flood argues it is. \n \n The Chemistry of Oil - Explained by Flood Geology\n Sedimentary Rock: Face of the Earth\n\n \n Show me where the first link says that YECs say oil should be found everywhere? You post links and make blanket statements rather than just quote where that link specifically says what you claim it says. Just like daewoo who was also proven to be a dishonest liar and a poser as everything he said was also determined to be a mirage based on bluffs and bluster.\n \n \nThey argue that the compression of the water and sediment made the oil. They also argue that oil and gas are found largely in sedimentary rock. The thing is that such rock covers roughly 75% of the land and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, we should be finding oil pretty much everywhere according to flood geology models.\n \n \n Really??? Show where where the link you posted says this is the only interpretation of the existing evidence to the exclusion of all other formations.\n \n \nInterestingly enough, Flood geology rejects plate tetonics as well as rejecting oil formation in ocean water. It's internally a bunch of contradictions. Oil can't form in ocean water, but the sea floor made of rocks where oil is expected to be is has oil. Wait what? emoticon_xbouncer I can go on and on. But you get the point. The flood model is inherently contradictory and wrong.\n\n \n It does? Yet you don't actually quote where it says this directly at all, do you!!! Here is what the link you posted says. Show me where it rejects the current scientific and geological realities which exist and are scientifically observable facts? This debate is all about interpreting origins, not outcomes. But being the deceitful liar that you are, you must misrepresent every aspect of what Creationists actually believe. This makes it clear that we question the process that evolutions attribute to the formation of oil and gas deposits, not the current observable processes in finding them. That is just more of your twisted reasoning in order to mock that which you really don't understand at all. Thanks for the link.\n Christians, in particular, should be concerned about origins because the study of \"beginnings\" always brings us back to God's history book, the Bible, for resolution. The chemistry of oil strongly suggests that it was formed rapidly from the remains of plant and animal matter. Oil probably originates in sedimentary rocks which were originally deposited by moving water. This is exactly what we would expect from the year-long Flood of Noah's day. A very reasonable model of petrogenesis can be based on the assumption that most of the oil and gas deposits of our day date from the worldwide Flood of about 2500 B.C., or about 1600 years after Creation.\n \n BASIC PETROLEUM GEOLOGY\n The classic problem faced by the petroleum industry, since its U.S. inception by Drake in 1859, has always been how to find underground traps of the oil by looking and experimenting at the earth's surface. This is accomplished today by measuring folds and faults (structural geology), studying the detailed sequence of rocks in an area (stratigraphy), and testing using artificial earthquake energy (seismic exploration). But how did the oil and gas get into the trap? Most theories hold that the petroleum moved through porous rock, perhaps over great distances, to get to the final trapping area. This process is termed migration. The rocks in which the oil and gas originated, before migration, are called source rocks. 2 There is disagreement as to whether the origin of hydrocarbons (both oil and natural gas) in the source rocks was organic or inorganic. Some workers maintain that the source of natural gas, especially, must be deep within the earth, where igneous activity could generate it inorganically. 3 From this deep source, it could then migrate upward into sedimentary rocks. Proponents of the organic theory, on the other hand, suggest that most petroleum started out as plants and animals which were buried in the source rocks and then chemically altered into crude oil and gas. The chemistry of oil, therefore, holds one of the keys to understanding how petroleum originates.\n \n AN OVERVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE\n Petroleum is a complex mixture of organic compounds, all of which provide clues to some aspect of its origin, burial in sediments and chemical modification. A porphyrin is one such chemical that is found in crude oil and also in plants and blood. Interestingly, porphyrins break down rapidly in the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing conditions. Geologists often suggest that porphyrins are evidence for widespread reducing environments during the deposition of petroleum source rocks. However, this is not the best explanation for porphyrin preservation. Rapid sedimentation would also cut off the porphyrins from oxidizing agents and would allow their preservation as components of crude oil. Since crude oil porphyrins are indicators of rapid sedimentation, the details and context of these fascinating chemicals provide yet another evidence for a worldwide, catastrophic flood.\n \n ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF PORPHYRINS\n Porphyrins are structurally similar to both chlorophyll and hemoglobin molecules. They are classified as tetrapyrrole compounds and often contain metals such as nickel and vanadium. 4 Porphyrins are broken apart by two common geologic circumstances, oxidizing conditions and high temperatures. As Russell 5 puts it:\n \n Porphyrins are complex organic substances related to chlorophyll and hemoglobin, which are destroyed by oxygen and heat.\n In our present world, the areas of high sedimentation rates, 6 such as river deltas in coastal zones, have oxidizing conditions. Therefore, uniformitarian geologists have been forced to the point of view expressed by Levorsen 7 in one of the standard petroleum geology textbooks:\n \n The origin of petroleum is within an anaerobic and reducing environment. The presence of porphyrins in some petroleums means that anaerobic conditions developed early in the life of such petroleums, for chlorophyll derivatives, such as the porphyrins, are easily and rapidly oxidized and decomposed under aerobic conditions.\n But Tissot and Welte 8 have suggested another way that organic matter containing porphyrins can be preserved:\n \n The main reason for the higher preservation rate in the Black Sea is probably the slower degradation of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Up to a certain point, a high sedimentation rate can also help to preserve organic material.\n PREDICTIONS AND TESTS OF A FLOOD GEOLOGY MODEL\n CONCERNING PORPHYRINS\n If a \"high sedimentation rate\" will preserve organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate, such as we envision for the worldwide Flood, would uproot, kill, and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrins off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Under this model, flood geologists would predict that porphyrins should be commonly found in sedimentary rocks. This hypothesis can be tested in the published literature of petroleum geochemistry. Consider the following conclusion from Tissot and Welte: 9\n \n Petroleum porphyrins . . . have been identified in a sufficient number of sediments and crude oils to establish a wide distribution of these geochemical fossils.\n As to the percentages of these chemicals found in crude oils, Tissot and Welte report that porphyrins vary from traces to 400 ppm (.04%) 10 This is a small amount, but one which experiments would predict even under rapid burial and alteration conditions. DiNello and Chang 11 report the breakdown of a plant porphyrin in about three days under an experimental procedure which reached a temperature of 210 degrees C for about a 12-hour period. As they conclude:\n \n The yield of pure pyrrhoporphyrin is about .5 gm from 100 gm of crude chlorophyll extract.\n In other words, they produced a .5% concentration of a type of porphyrin found in oil from plant material in one day. A crude oil porphyrin can be made from chlorophyll (and presumably hemoglobin) in even less than 12 hours. Fuhrhop and Smith found that 80% of the porphyrins in a sealed glass tube were broken down when heated to 165 degrees C for four hours in the presence of vanadium tetrachloride. 12 Our young earth, Flood geology, model requires that this geochemical fossil, a porphyrin, be produced from starter chemicals very rapidly. The research of DiNello and Chang, along with Fuhrhop and Smith, shows that porphyrins can be produced from chlorophyll in a matter of hours. This substantiates at least one important aspect of this creationist model for the origin of petroleum.\n \nEnjoying the taste of fail?\n\n \n Yeah, I enjoy the taste of your failure to actually support or prove that any of the false claims and misrepresentations you make are true at all. You make claims about what YECs believe while proving nothing at all. And the Creationist link you posted proves that you are nothing more than bluff and bluster just like your teacher daewoo who has been MIA since our last debate when he too was shown to be a liar.",

   "Actually, what I said is exactly true. \n \n In order to produce those answers and thesis, the student would have to completely set aside their personal beliefs and faith by not responding to the questions asked or writing the thesis based on those personal beliefs.\n \n You cannot correctly answer the question \"What time period, in millions of years ago, does the Cretaceous Period represent?\" if you're a YEC, because to be truthful and faithful to your beliefs, your answer on the exam sheet would have to be \"There is no Cretaceous Period, the world is only 6000 years old\". You would have to completely set aside your personal beliefs and faith, and LIE in front of your god in order to answer that question correctly.\nThen I guess you've never heard of lying for Jesus. I understand your point, but I don't think that regurgitating the expected information on exams us necessarily abandoning faith. I know that I sometimes gave teachers the answers that they expected rather than what I thought was true. In my case it wasn't about faith in mythology but my understanding of the material, but still.\n \n Of course, the topics chosen by creationists for theses and dissertations could skirt any issues of the age of the earth or common ancestry.

He was admitted to Harvard on the basis of his BA, and Harvard actually granted his degrees. I have no basis to judge the motives of the man.

   "Good post pandion. Just two points I would like to comment on. The addition of the capped and bolded is to stress that creationists don't reject science, they interpret the same available evidence differently than secular scientists do.\nBullroar. Creationists begin from the conclusions and then \"interpret\" the evidence to support their position.\n \nThat is an important detail which conventional evolutionists refuse to acknowledge.\nNope. I just acknowledged it.\n \nFrom the creationists perspective it could be said that it is the secularists who reject the obvious by placing their faith in unreliable results and interpretations of the available evidence.\nRight. Scientists reject mythology as the basis of science. Just as Wise rejected the evidence and assumed that the mythological tale from the Bible was true. Science doesn't assume a great age for the earth. It is creationists who assume a young earth and then use some evidence that they can twist to support their position, and reject the vast majority of evidence that shows that YEC is pure nonsense. \n \nI say this because I find it demeaning and arrogant to matter of factly state that creationists must deny some reality in order to believe as they do, when they in fact accept the real world conditions as they exist but have a different explanation for how the evidentiary pieces fit together.\nBut you are demeaning yourself. Really, how old is the earth and what is your evidence for your opinion?",

I suspect that the problem is that you are not actually familiar with the Biblical mythology since it is so utterly stupid.\n\n \n Fair enough, still, the calculation is less ridiculous, but still pretty nuts. It's a mere 43 feet a day of sediment being deposited everywhere. I don't know of a single place on the planet where sediment is deposited at such high rates or anything even close to half of that. However, that doesn't make much sense because after the rain stopped for those 40 days and 40 nights (which is really just 40 days), then the flooded planet's waters would have stabilized and sediment would not have stayed in suspension. Thus, the 3 miles of sediment would have been deposited essentially all at once. I gotta wonder, where did 3 miles of sediment enough to cover every location on the planet come from? \n \n The surface of the planet is 510,072,000 km\u00b2 and after translating into miles and then multiplying by 3 miles, we get 950,832,139 cubic miles of necessary sediment (compacted). And I'm not even taking into account the erosion over the past 4,000 years since the flood occurred. \n \n That's even more ridiculous then the necessary water requirements I earlier calculated. \n \n You're right about one thing, Biblical mythology taken literally is stupid.",

   "Hows that? You said this: [Waxy] \n Firstly - A degree in Geochemistry would have very little to do with geology or oil/gas exploration. It would be focused on the chemistry of the hyrocarbons and minerals (rock) being examined.\n \n This link Applied petroleum geochemistry - Google Book Search states how Geochemistry is used specifically in locating Oil deposits. So how in the world do you then claim that a degree in geochemistry would have very little to do with oil exploration?\n\n \n Well, let's see, I work as a geologist in oil/gas exploration, and geochemistry has very little to do with the process used to explore for oil and gas. \n \n Geochemistry is the study of chemistry as it relates to geology. Organic geochemistry is the study of organic chemistry as it relates to geology and ancient organisms.\n \n Neither is particularly useful in exploring for hydrocarbons. Now, obviously, there are methods that involve geochemistry in exploration, the above paper is one of them, and there are others, but they do not in any way represent the normal method of exploration used, particularly in North America, where basins are mature. Furthermore, without the direct aid of other more conventional methods of exploration, geochemisty is largely useless. Unlike other methods of exploration, geochemistry is VERY rarely able to be used as a stand alone exploration tool, in fact, I can't think of a single case, the above one included. It's a complimentary tool, used primarily by the oil industry to increase our understanding of the known geology and reservoir parameters to aid in production.\n \n You'll also note that I stated this - \n has very little to do with geology and oil/gas exploration \n - I didn't say NOTHING, I said VERY LITTLE. \n \n A Robertson screw driver could be considered a part of manufacturing a car too, and it is, but it's not required, and has very little to do with it in reality. \n \n \nThanks, I'll believe you are sincere once you own up to yours then.\n \n \n Great, now that I've proven I'm sincere by explaining to you in detail why I haven't made a mistake, I'm looking forward to you being man enough to follow through with your promise of sincerity.\n \n \nHere's the thing waxy; you think you can and have explained the stratigraphic column rationally with the available evidence we have on it. And I could study the known facts derived from mapping and studying it if I was a geologist. But in the final analysis with all of the observable known facts which I would surely apply to my search for oil/gas deposits, I could still believe in my heart as a creationist that God made this happen according to his perfect timing and will even though we can't explain it at this time.\n\n \n Obviously convenience is something you really value, seeing as how you conveniently chose to ignore the details of my above post to respond with this blanket \"god did it\" statement.\n \n I suppose you could justify to yourself that way, if you're willing to live with that irrationality and dichotomy, but most people aren't.\n \n Waxy",

   "The repeated insistence that committed christians can't serve as scientists because of creationist convictions is wrong and only a problem for the sanctimonious evolution scientists who demand that all of their scientists accept and toe the party line or else they wont hire them. Here's an example from a very highly respected scientific institution.\n Has Modern Evolutionary \"Science\" Become Unscientific? \n Dr. Nathaniel Abraham, Ph.D., is a biologist, scholar, and research scientist specializing in zebrafish, developmental biology, and programmed cell death. He was fired from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a highly esteemed research facility based in New England in March of 2004. The reason? Dr. Abraham believes in Creation and does not accept evolution as a scientific fact. With his termination, Dr. Abraham became one of many scientists and academics who have dedicated years of their lives to the pursuit of scientific knowledge; but because they are unwilling to spout the \"party line\" with respect to evolution, they are being forced out of their field.\n Read how CLA is defending the rights of this Christian scientist to practice his profession consistent with his faith.\n \n Dr. Abraham came to the United States from India to earn his Ph.D. in biology at St. John's University in New York. While at St. John's, he became an expert in zebrafish. He did a groundbreaking doctoral dissertation in his area of research science. Dr. Abraham was well respected at St. John's, and it was no secret that he was a strong Christian who believed the Bible and believed in Creation. Many of his colleagues there enjoyed asking him questions about issues of science and religion. In the first sentence of the acknowledgements in his doctoral thesis, Dr. Abraham thanks his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n Fired for His Faith\n \n While Dr. Abraham was completing his Ph.D. program at St. John's, he began to look for a postdoctoral position where he could continue his research. He married, brought his wife to America, and they were expecting their first child. Life was looking very good. He applied for a research position at Woods Hole after seeing the opportunity listed on the Internet. Scientists at Woods Hole were interested in expanding their toxicology laboratory to include programmed cell death research using the zebrafish benchmark model, which was Dr. Abraham's specialty. In fact, Dr. Abraham was so valuable to them in this endeavor that he assisted them for several months in designing and building their lab before he was able to join them fulltime as a researcher. Dr. Abraham contributed greatly to the design of the new facility and his superiors were pleased with his work. \n The relationship between Dr. Abraham and Woods Hole was mutually beneficial and productive until one lunchtime shortly after Dr. Abraham began working fulltime at Woods Hole. In a passing conversation with his supervisor, Dr. Abraham happened to mention that he believed in Creation. His supervisor expressed concern that if Dr. Abraham believed in Creation, he was not qualified to do the job he had been hired to do.\n \n Dr. Abraham told his superiors in writing that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if that was warranted, but he was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as a scientific fact. Dr. Abraham pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing. After all, he had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University, where his faith had not been an issue. Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should merely do the experiments and follow the evidence wherever it led.\n \n The \"establishment\" scientists at Woods Hole were not convinced. They wanted Dr. Abraham to share their wholehearted acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact, or they felt he was not \"fit\" to work in the field of science-at least not at their prestigious laboratory. They finally told Dr. Abraham he would have to leave if he did not accept evolution as fact.  \n Dr. Abraham's decision to hold to his Biblical faith and to his belief in Creation was a very costly decision for him. His wife was about to have their baby. Without a job, Dr. Abraham would lose his visa, which would soon expire. Woods Hole was not willing to even permit Dr. Abraham to complete the first year of his potential three-year employment. As a result, Dr. Abraham was forced to send his expectant wife home to India, and he missed the birth of his first child. \n \n Attorneys for the Christian Law Association are now representing Dr. Abraham in a lawsuit against Woods Hole to test whether America's courts will permit this sort of blatant religious discrimination against scientists in America. \n Religious Discrimination in the Scientific Community\n \n Dr. Abraham's private Biblical faith did not affect his ability to do the job for which he had been hired, but his supervisors refused to tolerate his belief in Creation. This is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common in both the academic and scientific research communities. \"Establishment\" scientists have become increasingly willing to require that everyone who works in the field of science must accept the tenets of evolution as fact or be banned from the profession.\n Attorneys for the Christian Law Association believe that Title VII antidiscrimination laws protect scientists from being terminated because of their religious beliefs. In addition to limiting opportunities for Christian scientists and researchers, highly qualified professors are also losing their jobs and being denied tenure at some American universities merely because they do not toe the line regarding evolution.\n What the scientific community seems to be saying to creationists or to those who hold to intelligent design, is that if you are not willing to accept an evolutionary philosophy, we will indeed shun you, terminate you, and push you out of the field of science. Does that mean that in the future scientists will be forced to deny their belief in God or their belief that an intelligent designer played a part in the origins of the universe or of life on earth in order to work? Just where would such a repressive attitude lead?\n Interestingly, just as some secular university science departments and research laboratories are forbidding anyone to defy the new scientific principle recognizing \"evolution's role as the central organizing principle of modern biology\" (a quote from the press release for a new book called Science, Evolution and Creationism, published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences along with the Institute of Medicine, both advisory bodies to the U.S. government in the area of science and medicine), more and more scientists are coming to the conclusion that there is increasing scientific evidence for intelligent design in the universe. The Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington, has compiled a list of over 700 scientists who have signed the following statement.\n \n We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\n CLA believes it is very important at this point in history to defend Dr. Abraham's right to work as a scientific researcher no matter what his personal religious beliefs. We agree with Dr. Abraham that scientists should follow the evidence wherever it leads. Establishment scientists should not be allowed to put a thumb on the scale of evolutionary research outcomes. \n Dr. Abraham's lawsuit against Woods Hole represents more than one person's termination for refusing to abandon his religious beliefs. If those in the scientific establishment in America's laboratories and universities are permitted to fire anyone who does not accept evolution as \"the central organizing principle of modern biology,\" America will be on a slippery slope toward renouncing the traditional rules of scientific inquiry, which are based upon experimentation and observation that is always open to testing by competing theories. \n What is True Science?\n \n True science is founded on the proposition that everything we think we know about the natural world can, in principle, be rejected if it does not meet the test of observation and experiment. The very practice of science, at its core, is a constant exercise of extending what we do know about the world, and then correcting what we thought we knew for sure. The Academic Press Dictionary defines science as \"the systematic observation of natural events and conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate laws and principles based on these facts.\"\n We should remember that it was their observation of order in the universe that led the scientists of the Middle Ages to begin their quest to discern that order. Many of these early scientists were Christians who believed that the Creator God had made an orderly universe and that His order could be discerned by using scientific methods of experimentation and observation.\n The consideration of alternative explanations for scientific claims is vital to the development of a scientific mind. There are actually four terms used in science to address the results of experimentation and observation. They are hypothesis, theory, fact (near-certainty), and law.\n A scientific hypothesis is a testable scientific idea that can be proved right or wrong with experiments. It is an educated guess that can be verified or disproven by observation or experimentation. A scientific theory is defined as the culmination of many scientific investigations drawing together all the current evidence; thus, it represents the most powerful explanations scientists have to offer. The closest we can get to absolute truth in science are indisputable observations which we call facts or near-certainty. Finally, a scientific law generalizes a body of observations to which no exceptions have been found.\n \n It appears that modern establishment scientists, such as those at the Woods Hole research laboratory, no longer think of evolution as merely a \"hypothesis\" or even a \"theory.\" Instead, evolution has now become more like a \"law.\" In fact, the scientific establishment is now claiming that evolution is \"the central organizing principle of modern biology,\" a conclusion from which no working scientist or academic can apparently deviate.\n How did this happen? Did someone find the \"missing link\" that scientists have searched for to prove that men were formerly monkeys and we somehow missed it? If some scientist has conclusively demonstrated in a laboratory that evolution produced life on earth, we must have missed that too. \n Did some recent experiment contradict the work of Louis Pasteur who conclusively demonstrated in the mid-19th century that life cannot spring spontaneously from non-life? Pasteur's work in developing pasteurization through that experiment still appears to be valid in our milk cartons, and no verified ape/man is as yet on display in the Smithsonian Institute. Instead, evolutionary scientists appear to have taken a \"leap of faith\" and declared without evidence or proof that evolution is a verified \"fact\" or \"law,\" no matter how it is defined. \n \n The unsupported conclusory statement being touted not only by establishment scientists, but also by many high school and university teachers that \"evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported by multiple forms of scientific evidence\" throws an incendiary bomb directly into the heart of the traditional scientific method.\n \n The Evolution of Evolution\n \n In reality, the word evolution is a very slippery term. When simply defined as \"change over time\" within species it is relatively non-controversial. Fruit flies, moths, and Galapagos finches all provide examples of change over time. However, when modern scientists tout evolution as a near fact or law and then extrapolate from this meaning that it is also a fact that flies, moths, and finches all evolved from a remote common ancestor, the word becomes extremely problematic.\n When modern scientists or educators propound the philosophical notion that \"evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology,\" they are not confirming some grand new scientific development in our understanding the concept of evolution. What we have instead is merely evidence that the term evolution itself has now evolved. This gigantic leap in the evolution of evolution provides research facilities like Woods Hole with a rationale to fire a world renowned scientist like Dr. Abraham merely because he has a different belief-one based on the Bible and not on evolutionary philosophy.\n What is at Stake?\n \n When establishment scientists declare evolution as the winner in the contest of determining the origins of the universe and of life, their conclusion has nothing at all to do with traditional science. Darwin merely provided a rationale for science to reject religion and God. Ponder carefully that if evolution is allowed to become the \"the fundamental concept underlying all of biology\" by which all of life must be interpreted and understood, many more eminent and qualified scientists like Dr. Abraham will lose their jobs. In fact, we could reach a point in America where believing in God automatically disqualifies a person from working in the field of science, despite the fact that the whole field of modern science developed because early scientists believed God had created a rational and orderly universe with controlling principles that could be known.Christian Law Association - Has Modern Evolutionary \"Science\" Become Unscientific?",

In addition to limiting opportunities for Christian scientists and researchers, highly qualified professors are also losing their jobs and being denied tenure at some American universities merely because they do not toe the line regarding evolution.\n What the scientific community seems to be saying to creationists or to those who hold to intelligent design, is that if you are not willing to accept an evolutionary philosophy, we will indeed shun you, terminate you, and push you out of the field of science. Does that mean that in the future scientists will be forced to deny their belief in God or their belief that an intelligent designer played a part in the origins of the universe or of life on earth in order to work? Just where would such a repressive attitude lead?\n Interestingly, just as some secular university science departments and research laboratories are forbidding anyone to defy the new scientific principle recognizing \"evolution's role as the central organizing principle of modern biology\" (a quote from the press release for a new book called Science, Evolution and Creationism, published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences along with the Institute of Medicine, both advisory bodies to the U.S. government in the area of science and medicine), more and more scientists are coming to the conclusion that there is increasing scientific evidence for intelligent design in the universe. The Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington, has compiled a list of over 700 scientists who have signed the following statement.\n \n We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\n CLA believes it is very important at this point in history to defend Dr. Abraham's right to work as a scientific researcher no matter what his personal religious beliefs. We agree with Dr. Abraham that scientists should follow the evidence wherever it leads. Establishment scientists should not be allowed to put a thumb on the scale of evolutionary research outcomes. \n Dr. Abraham's lawsuit against Woods Hole represents more than one person's termination for refusing to abandon his religious beliefs. If those in the scientific establishment in America's laboratories and universities are permitted to fire anyone who does not accept evolution as \"the central organizing principle of modern biology,\" America will be on a slippery slope toward renouncing the traditional rules of scientific inquiry, which are based upon experimentation and observation that is always open to testing by competing theories. \n What is True Science?\n \n True science is founded on the proposition that everything we think we know about the natural world can, in principle, be rejected if it does not meet the test of observation and experiment. The very practice of science, at its core, is a constant exercise of extending what we do know about the world, and then correcting what we thought we knew for sure. The Academic Press Dictionary defines science as \"the systematic observation of natural events and conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate laws and principles based on these facts.\"\n We should remember that it was their observation of order in the universe that led the scientists of the Middle Ages to begin their quest to discern that order. Many of these early scientists were Christians who believed that the Creator God had made an orderly universe and that His order could be discerned by using scientific methods of experimentation and observation.\n The consideration of alternative explanations for scientific claims is vital to the development of a scientific mind. There are actually four terms used in science to address the results of experimentation and observation. They are hypothesis, theory, fact (near-certainty), and law.\n A scientific hypothesis is a testable scientific idea that can be proved right or wrong with experiments. It is an educated guess that can be verified or disproven by observation or experimentation. A scientific theory is defined as the culmination of many scientific investigations drawing together all the current evidence; thus, it represents the most powerful explanations scientists have to offer. The closest we can get to absolute truth in science are indisputable observations which we call facts or near-certainty. Finally, a scientific law generalizes a body of observations to which no exceptions have been found.\n \n It appears that modern establishment scientists, such as those at the Woods Hole research laboratory, no longer think of evolution as merely a \"hypothesis\" or even a \"theory.\" Instead, evolution has now become more like a \"law.\" In fact, the scientific establishment is now claiming that evolution is \"the central organizing principle of modern biology,\" a conclusion from which no working scientist or academic can apparently deviate.\n How did this happen? Did someone find the \"missing link\" that scientists have searched for to prove that men were formerly monkeys and we somehow missed it? If some scientist has conclusively demonstrated in a laboratory that evolution produced life on earth, we must have missed that too. \n Did some recent experiment contradict the work of Louis Pasteur who conclusively demonstrated in the mid-19th century that life cannot spring spontaneously from non-life? Pasteur's work in developing pasteurization through that experiment still appears to be valid in our milk cartons, and no verified ape/man is as yet on display in the Smithsonian Institute. Instead, evolutionary scientists appear to have taken a \"leap of faith\" and declared without evidence or proof that evolution is a verified \"fact\" or \"law,\" no matter how it is defined. \n \n The unsupported conclusory statement being touted not only by establishment scientists, but also by many high school and university teachers that \"evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported by multiple forms of scientific evidence\" throws an incendiary bomb directly into the heart of the traditional scientific method.\n \n The Evolution of Evolution\n \n In reality, the word evolution is a very slippery term. When simply defined as \"change over time\" within species it is relatively non-controversial. Fruit flies, moths, and Galapagos finches all provide examples of change over time. However, when modern scientists tout evolution as a near fact or law and then extrapolate from this meaning that it is also a fact that flies, moths, and finches all evolved from a remote common ancestor, the word becomes extremely problematic.\n When modern scientists or educators propound the philosophical notion that \"evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology,\" they are not confirming some grand new scientific development in our understanding the concept of evolution. What we have instead is merely evidence that the term evolution itself has now evolved. This gigantic leap in the evolution of evolution provides research facilities like Woods Hole with a rationale to fire a world renowned scientist like Dr. Abraham merely because he has a different belief-one based on the Bible and not on evolutionary philosophy.\n What is at Stake?\n \n When establishment scientists declare evolution as the winner in the contest of determining the origins of the universe and of life, their conclusion has nothing at all to do with traditional science. Darwin merely provided a rationale for science to reject religion and God. Ponder carefully that if evolution is allowed to become the \"the fundamental concept underlying all of biology\" by which all of life must be interpreted and understood, many more eminent and qualified scientists like Dr. Abraham will lose their jobs. In fact, we could reach a point in America where believing in God automatically disqualifies a person from working in the field of science, despite the fact that the whole field of modern science developed because early scientists believed God had created a rational and orderly universe with controlling principles that could be known.Christian Law Association - Has Modern Evolutionary \"Science\" Become Unscientific?",

Canning an astronomer who doesn't believe in the heliocentric theory?\n \n Where would this madness end!?!?\n\n \n I'll just quote the article in response to your condescending sarcasm, since it says it all:\n Dr. Abraham came to the United States from India to earn his Ph.D. in biology at St. John's University in New York. While at St. John's, he became an expert in zebrafish. He did a groundbreaking doctoral dissertation in his area of research science. Dr. Abraham was well respected at St. John's, and it was no secret that he was a strong Christian who believed the Bible and believed in Creation. Many of his colleagues there enjoyed asking him questions about issues of science and religion. In the first sentence of the acknowledgements in his doctoral thesis, Dr. Abraham thanks his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n [snip]\n He applied for a research position at Woods Hole after seeing the opportunity listed on the Internet. Scientists at Woods Hole were interested in expanding their toxicology laboratory to include programmed cell death research using the zebrafish benchmark model, which was Dr. Abraham's specialty. In fact, Dr. Abraham was so valuable to them in this endeavor that he assisted them for several months in designing and building their lab before he was able to join them fulltime as a researcher. Dr. Abraham contributed greatly to the design of the new facility and his superiors were pleased with his work. \n The relationship between Dr. Abraham and Woods Hole was mutually beneficial and productive until one lunchtime shortly after Dr. Abraham began working fulltime at Woods Hole. In a passing conversation with his supervisor, Dr. Abraham happened to mention that he believed in Creation. His supervisor expressed concern that if Dr. Abraham believed in Creation, he was not qualified to do the job he had been hired to do.\n \n Dr. Abraham told his superiors in writing that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if that was warranted, but he was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as a scientific fact. Dr. Abraham pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing. After all, he had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University, where his faith had not been an issue. Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should merely do the experiments and follow the evidence wherever it led.",

   "Creationists lying again?\n \n Huh. \n \n \nThe commission [the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination] dismissed his complaint earlier this year. The commission said Abraham was terminated because his request not to work on evolutionary aspects of the project would be challenging for Woods Hole because the research was based on evolutionary theories.\n\n \n Pharyngula: Irons on Abraham\n Pharyngula: Another expulsion vindicated\n Pharyngula: Slackjawed creationist surprised at his own incompetence at a scientific job\n Thoughts in a Haystack: The Other Guy's Court\n Hyphoid Logic: Did Nathaniel Abraham Lie About the Postdoc Job Terms?

Not to mention how they explain how the flood dumped 3 miles of sediment uniformly.\n \n Not going to happen. \n \n Arch defend his claims? I don't see pigs flying.\n \n And you're a massive liar for again arguing that Christanity = YEC especially after your tirade that you said they weren't the same.
