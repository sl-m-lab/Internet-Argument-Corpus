   "Well lets see, well there is the whole idea of the young Earth, which is better dealt with in the Evolution vs Creationism thread.\n \n There is the fact that the book of Daniel is historically inaccurate, and written in language not used at the time.\n \n The whole thing about insects with 4 legs, women who drink water mixed with dirt and brought to the altar of Yahweh getting sick or staying well and that is the criteria for innocence or guilt (sounds almost like trial by combat or fire, a barbaric legal practice)\n \n The whole thing about the \"prophecy\" of the virgin birth, when the word used in Isasiah is the word for young woman, and Immanuel refers to Isasiah's own son. (the LXX mistranslated it as virgin, and that is what the author of Matthew used. Oh, also, the first few chapters of Matthew weren't accepted at first by many eastern christians, nor were any of the other gospels)\n \n The genealogies of Luke and Matthew contradicting each other (and it isn't due to Mary and Joseph being the two different genealogies. Women were not considered important at this time period. They were considered \"soil\" for the person, in which semen could grow. An entire person was contained in the man's \"seed\" That is why women are often referred to as barren in the Bible. This went out of favor in the mid 19th century I -think-)\n \n The flood being in 2285 (or it may be 2385) according to genealogies in 1 or 2 Kings, can't remember which.\n \n Also, I dislike the fact that Christians disregard the specific ten commands listed as the Ten Commandments in the Bible. They are not the ones contained in Exodus 20. A little hypocritical I think, but oh well.\n \n By the way, why don't any of you do burnt offerings? They weren't ALL for sin. Most were just to please your God, because he likes the smell. So lets barbecue! (also, I read somewhere the burning of dung was commanded as well, will look for it)\n \n Also I have an Easter challenge (it's a little late, but still if anyone wants to take it, it was written by a former minister...)\n \n http://www.ffrf.org/lfif/stone.htm\n \n Freethought to all, I'm out",

It is very good about how an exact date of the Earth couldn't even be found, even IF creationists were correct. It is also a Creationist site\n \n http://www.asa3.org/archive/ASA/199605/0162.html\n \n This dates it around 3000 B.C., and while I do not agree with the dating (I personally think the flood was either a local one, or the giant black sea flood of about 6000-7000 B.C.) It also mentions several creation myths similar to the Genesis creation myth\n \n http://www.biblicalstudies.com/bstudy/miscstudies/chronology.htm\n \n This shows that a 4000 B.C. creation date doesn't even fit with scripture.

There are winged insects, including the bees, flies, and wasps, that walk with their six legs in the manner of four-legged animals.

   "IMMANUEL.\n A name first mentioned by the prophet Isaiah (7:14; 8:8) during the reign of Ahaz (761-746 B.C.E.). In Matthew 1:23, the only other occurrence, Immanuel is a name-title applied to Christ the Messiah.\n In view of the circumstances under which the prophecy was given, Bible commentators have looked for an \"Immanuel\" in Isaiah's day, one who fittingly served then as a sign that 'God was with them.' In that eighth century B.C.E., Pekah and Rezin, the kings of Israel and Syria, were bent on overthrowing Ahaz, king of Judah, in order to put the son of Tabeel upon his throne. (Isa 7:1-6) Jehovah, however, remembered his kingdom covenant with David, the forefather of Ahaz, and sent his prophet with this reassuring message:\n \"Listen, please, O house of David. . . . Jehovah himself will give you men a sign: Look! The maiden herself will actually become pregnant, and she is giving birth to a son, and she will certainly call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey he will eat by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good. For before the boy will know how to reject the bad and choose the good, the ground of whose two kings you are feeling a sickening dread will be left entirely.\"-Isa 7:13-16.\n Then, after telling about the birth of Isaiah's second son, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, the prophecy next describes how the threat to Judah would be removed. As an irresistible flood, the Assyrians would completely inundate Syria and the northern kingdom of Israel, not stopping until they had dangerously spread over the land of Judah, even \"to fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel!\" Then, in poetic grandeur, the prophet Isaiah warns all those in opposition to Jehovah: If you gird yourselves for war, if you plan out a scheme, if you speak a word against Jehovah-\"it will not stand, for God is with us [Immanuel]!\"-Isa 8:5-10.\n Some have suggested that in the type back there \"Immanuel\" was a third son of Isaiah, perhaps by a Jewish maiden who may have become a second wife of the prophet. Certain Jewish commentators endeavored to apply the prophecy to the birth of Ahaz' son Hezekiah. This, however, is ruled out, since the prophecy was uttered during Ahaz' reign (Isa 7:1), making Hezekiah at least nine years old at the time.-2Ki 16:2; 18:1, 2.\n Another possible candidate was Isaiah's second son, mentioned in the next chapter, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, concerning whom it was said: \"Before the boy will know how to call out, 'My father!' and 'My mother!' one will carry away the resources of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.\" (Isa 8:1-4) Certainly this echoes what was said about Immanuel: \"Before the boy will know how to reject the bad and choose the good, the ground of whose two kings [of Damascus and Samaria] you are feeling a sickening dread will be left entirely.\" (Isa 7:16) Also, the birth of Isaiah's second son is presented in close connection with the further prophecy involving Immanuel and, as Immanuel was to be a \"sign,\" so also Isaiah said: \"I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs.\"-Isa 7:14; 8:18.\n The principal objection to this identification of Isaiah's second son as the Immanuel of Ahaz' day is on the grounds that Isaiah's wife is spoken of as \"the prophetess,\" not as \"the maiden,\" as well as the fact that she was already the mother of Isaiah's firstborn, Shear-jashub, hence no \"maiden.\" (Isa 7:3; 8:3) It may be noted, however, that the Hebrew word here translated \"maiden\" is not bethu\u00b7lah', meaning, specifically, \"virgin,\" but is `al\u00b7mah', having a broader reference to a young woman, who could be either a virgin maiden or a recently married woman. The singular `al\u00b7mah' also occurs in six other texts, more than one of which involves a virgin maiden.-Ge 24:43 (compare \u00deGe 24 \u00dcvs 16); Ex 2:8; Ps 68:25; Pr 30:19; Ca 1:3; 6:8.\n The full and complete identity of Immanuel, of course, is found in the office and personage of the Lord Jesus Christ. The use, therefore, of the Hebrew word `al\u00b7mah' in the prophecy would accommodate both the type (if such was a young wife of Ahaz or of Isaiah) and the antitype (the betrothed and yet virgin Mary). In the case of Mary there was no question about her being a virgin when she became \"pregnant by holy spirit,\" both Matthew and Luke recording this historical fact. (Mt 1:18-25; Lu 1:30-35) \"All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet,\" Matthew observed. It was a sign that identified the long-awaited Messiah. So in keeping with these facts, Matthew's Gospel (quoting Isa 7:14) uses the Greek word par\u00b7the'nos, meaning \"virgin,\" to translate `al\u00b7mah', saying: \"Look! The virgin [par\u00b7the'nos] will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Immanuel.\" (Mt 1:22, 23) In no way was this taking liberties or distorting the text. Over a century earlier, the Jewish translators of the Greek Septuagint had also used par\u00b7the'nos in rendering Isaiah 7:14.",

Since insects have six legs and insects walk on six legs and even locusts walk on six legs, and since the Bible can't be wrong \n\n \n Wow, you actually understand...! \n \n \nin spite of the fact that it was written by bronze age nomadic herdsmen, \n\n \n I love your allegations. \n \n \nas good creationists we get to make it up as we go and create ad hoc explanations that the mode of travel of \"going on all fours\" means walking on all six legs.\n \n\n \n Why wouldn't it mean that?

Tsk. Didn't your mommy ever tell you that you didn't know everything? \n \n \nSure. In Leviticus \n \n ... [snipped wasted forum space]\n \n Of course the NKJV talks about \"creeping on all fours\" and the KJV, ESV, KJ21, ASV, YLT and Darby all talk about \"going on all fours.\" The Douay talks about \"going on four feet\".\n \n Glad I could help.\n\n \n Before I start, I would like to say my scripture references are from the King James Version, which I believe is the most accurate version of the Bible. \n \n \"Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing, that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; the locust . . . the beetle . . . and the grasshopper after his kind\" (Leviticus 11:21,22)\n \n a. The term \"flying\" refers to both insects and small animals that fly. (See below.)\n b. Our taxonomic categories are different than those the Bible uses. When the Bible says \"creeping thing\" it doesn't just mean insects.\n c. I hate to regurgitate statements and answers people have used for years and years, so most of this answer will be the last part of an article by Dr. John D. Morris, Ph.D, (that means he knows more than you, idiot) titled \"DOES THE BIBLE REALLY CLAIM THAT INSECTS HAVE ONLY FOUR LEGS?\" (BTG No. 151b July 2001) Before the article, though, I would like to point out that the scripture in Leviticus does NOT blatantly say incests have four legs, but says \"...that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet\" For someone so smart, idiot, you sure do like to ignore main points. Or maybe you do it on purpose...\n \n \nToday, locusts are considered migratory grasshoppers. They all have two large hind legs, quite different in appearance, size, and function from the front four legs. Their front legs are used for \"crawling, clinging, and climbing,\" while their back legs rest \"above\" their front legs and feet, and are used for \"jumping.\" Furthermore, the Hebrew word translated \"beetle\" actually comes from the verb \"to leap,\" implying a similar leaping insect, not our modern beetle. Thus, the Biblical description of grasshoppers turns out to be exactly anatomically correct. Far from being an embarrassment to Bible believers, this passage bears sterling testimony to the accuracy and inspiration of Scripture. As always, arguments which claim that the Bible is wrong are themselves wrong, and the Bible still stands!\n",

   "The Genealogy of Matthew and Luke contradicting each other \n \n Reliability of the Gospel Accounts The question arises: Why does Matthew leave out some names that are contained in the listings of the other chroniclers? First of all, to prove one's genealogy it was not necessary to name every link in the line of descent. For example, Ezra, in proving his priestly lineage, at Ezra 7:1-5, omitted several names contained in the listing of the priestly line at 1 Chronicles 6:1-15. Obviously it was not essential to name all these ancestors to satisfy the Jews as to his priestly lineage. Similarly with Matthew: He doubtless used the public register and copied from it, if not every name, the ones necessary to prove the descent of Jesus from Abraham and David. He also had access to the Hebrew Scriptures, which he could consult alongside the official public records.-Compare Ru 4:12, 18-22 and Mt 1:3-6.\n The lists made by both Matthew and Luke were comprised of names publicly recognized by the Jews of that time as authentic. The scribes and Pharisees as well as the Sadducees were bitter enemies of Christianity, and they would have used any possible argument to discredit Jesus, but it is noteworthy that they never challenged these genealogies. If either Matthew's or Luke's genealogy of Jesus had been in error, what an opportunity it would have been for these opponents to prove it then and there! For until 70 C.E. they evidently had ready access to the public genealogical registers and the Scriptures.\n The same is true regarding the first-century pagan enemies of Christianity, many of whom were, like those Jews, learned men who would readily have pointed to any evidence that these lists of Matthew and Luke were unauthentic and contradictory. But there is no record that the early pagan enemies attacked Christians on this point.\n Also, both Matthew and Luke achieved their objective, and that was all they needed to do. To prove that Jesus was descended from Abraham and David, it was not necessary to make a new genealogy. All they had to do was copy from the public tables that the nation fully accepted regarding the lineage of David and of the priesthood and all other matters requiring proof of one's descent. (See Lu 1:5; 2:3-5; Ro 11:1.) Even if there was an omission in these tables, it did not detract from what these Gospel writers intended and indeed accomplished, namely, presenting legally and publicly recognized proof of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah.",

Both ways lead to the same conclusion.\n \n And how do you know that? Do you know that all the guilty people got sick, and all the innocent stayed healthy? You simply have faith in this. I already told you, I can't take anything on faith.\n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n And if this happened then, why does it not happen now?\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Why should it happen now? \n \n \n Because if it is God given, isn't it the better set of rules?\n \n \n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Because the word Almah refers to young woman, and was referring to Isasiah's wife in the chapter it was taken from.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Uh, Hebrew scholar, I think you need to do more research on this subject. And please, try to use websites that are at least mildly fair and unbiased and not your regular christianssuck.com. \n \n \n I've studied ALL sides. And yes, technically the word can be used for a young maiden, who has not yet had sex, but in the context, it is refering to Isasiah's wife.\n \n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n And by Eastern Christians, I mean early Christians in areas such as Jersualem, Damascus, Antioch, and many of the other eastern churches. EARLY eastern christians, i.e. where the Christian church started. You do know you accept a canon first accepted in 280 C.E., correct?\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Yeah. Um, first, Christians are people who believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God. To disregard the Gospels (and the New Testament) means you are not a Christian. Secondly, the majority of Jews don't believe Jesus to be the Son of God either. Do some more research on the subject and you'll see why.\n \n \n They still Christians, they didn't accept the canon that Christians do today, they still thought Jesus was the son of God (well some sects didn't, some just thought he was a very holy and somehow somewhat divine man) but they didn't accept the three other gospels nor the beginning of matthew. You don't accept the Gospel of the Hebrews. You accept a canon made in 280. The Bible is not some simple document, the books have been disputed for the past two millenia. \n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n They are contradictory because they are different genealogies. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n I guess they're only contradictory if you haven't done enough research and stick to one anti-Christian website. \n \n They are DIFFERENET GENEALOGIES. THAT IS A CONTRADICTION. There is NOTHING - no substatial evidence WHATSOEVER to say that the genealogies are representing different people.\n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n And what the hell do you mean the Bible raised women? It treated them like PROPERTY.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Depends on how blind you want to make yourself when you read it, I guess.\n \n \n How blind? I realized that when I was a Christian. It's part of the reason I left the religion.\n \n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n There were a few cultures that treated women better than that. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n You're property too. The property of God. Young girls were property to their fathers, so were the sons. I know that seems kind of confusing, because, back then, the parents were responsible for raising the kids.\n \n \n People nowadays are responsible for raising their kids (for the most part) I see most parents, the great majority, taking care of their children. Sure, there are orphanages, and the like, but those have existed since the ancient world as well. Owning does not equal taking responsibility, anyway.\n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n For example, in the Bible, it says what to do with a woman if a man rapes her... make the rapist pay you a fine, and she is his wife. This would be considered absolutely horrible today. You don't see many Christians lobbying that women should have to marry their rapists. I can't think of anything the \"raised\" women. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n (Deut. 22:25-28).\n \n Research. Quit spending some much time at those anti-Christians website and look for some fair sources.\n \n \n I was referring to women who aren't engaged. And I was reading it straight from the Bible. Not some anti-Christian website. I did mention that I've read the book 3 times, correct? Over that in some parts.\n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n The Bible has been used throughout history to control women.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Someone else's misinterpretation of the Bible is not my problem. I cannot control what other people do. However, I bet you think Darwin's view on how women should be treated is better, huh? \n \n \n Oh, so YOUR interpretation is CORRECT now? People have been misinterpretating it for centuries, but NOW you've got it? And what the hell should I care for Darwin's view on the treatment of women? He was a 19th century scientist. He wrote Origin of Species, and I have to hand it to him for that, but he's not a moral teacher for me or anything like that. One could possibly call him the father of modern biology in a sense, and seeing as I want to get into biotechnology, of course I respect a man like that, in his scientific capacity, but I understand, with the social thoughts at the time, that the man had different opinions than me. Henry Ford hated African-Americans. I assume (tell me if I'm wrong) you drive, or have driven, in a motor vehicle, maybe in a Ford perhaps? Do you agree with racism? Also, I may want to mention that Darwin was into the pseudo-science of figuring out which of the human race was the perfect race. This was also part of 19th century thinking, and I, like many most others, throw this idea too, into the crapper.\n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Not really you didn't. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Yes I did. Saying the Bible has an error because genelogies are off is one of the stupidest things anyone can say. I already stated that there are a number of different factors you must take into account before making foolish statements like that.\n \n \n As I said, I've studied this extensively, from a Christian and a non-Christian perspective. You are too self-righteous to even examine it from a non-Christian standpoint, so what is the point in even trying to convince you? You'll give little tact responses, and tell me to read up on material I've told you several times, that I've read both sides of. BOTH SIDES OF. If you want me to get the records from my confirmation and all that, I suppose I could do that, if it could prove to you that once upon a time, I really WAS a Christian. If you want you can even have testimonials from my family, or possibly even my 6th grade school, where I was charged a fine for a book that I wrote an extremely religious note on, praising Jesus and asking the future owner of the book to accept Jesus into their heart and become a Christian.\n \n \n \n quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n I asked about the cultures who were already keeping time at that point. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n What about them again?\n \n If they were keeping time DURING the flood, isn't that a little odd?\n \n \n Cut off message, as it was too long to post in one thread",

   "Pikeman.\n \nThey are DIFFERENET GENEALOGIES. THAT IS A CONTRADICTION. There is NOTHING - no substatial evidence WHATSOEVER to say that the genealogies are representing different people.\n\n \n The difference in nearly all the names in Luke's genealogy of Jesus as compared with Matthew's is quickly resolved in the fact that Luke traced the line through David's son Nathan, instead of Solomon as did Matthew. (Lu 3:31; Mt 1:6, 7) Luke evidently follows the ancestry of Mary, thus showing Jesus' natural descent from David, while Matthew shows Jesus' legal right to the throne of David by descent from Solomon through Joseph, who was legally Jesus' father. Both Matthew and Luke signify that Joseph was not Jesus' actual father but only his adoptive father, giving him legal right. Matthew departs from the style used throughout his genealogy when he comes to Jesus, saying: \"Jacob became father to Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.\" (Mt 1:16) Notice that he does not say 'Joseph became father to Jesus' but that he was \"the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born.\" Luke is even more pointed when, after showing earlier that Jesus was actually the Son of God by Mary (Lu 1:32-35), he says: \"Jesus . . . being the son, as the opinion was, of Joseph, son of Heli.\"-Lu 3:23.\n Since Jesus was not the natural son of Joseph but was the Son of God, Luke's genealogy of Jesus would prove that he was, by human birth, a son of David through his natural mother Mary. Regarding the genealogies of Jesus given by Matthew and by Luke, Frederic Louis Godet wrote: \"This study of the text in detail leads us in this way to admit-1. That the genealogical register of Luke is that of Heli, the grandfather of Jesus; 2. That, this affiliation of Jesus by Heli being expressly opposed to His affiliation by Joseph, the document which he has preserved for us can be nothing else in his view than the genealogy of Jesus through Mary. But why does not Luke name Mary, and why pass immediately from Jesus to His grandfather? Ancient sentiment did not comport with the mention of the mother as the genealogical link. Among the Greeks a man was the son of his father, not of his mother; and among the Jews the adage was: 'Genus matris non vocatur genus [\"The descendant of the mother is not called (her) descendant\"]' ('Baba bathra,' 110, a).\"-Commentary on Luke, 1981, p. 129.\n Actually each genealogy (Matthew's table and Luke's) shows descent from David, through Solomon and through Nathan. (Mt 1:6; Lu 3:31) In examining the lists of Matthew and Luke, we find that after diverging at Solomon and Nathan, they come together again in two persons, Shealtiel and Zerubbabel. This can be explained in the following way: Shealtiel was the son of Jeconiah; perhaps by marriage to the daughter of Neri he became Neri's son-in-law, thus being called the \"son of Neri.\" It is possible as well that Neri had no sons, so that Shealtiel was counted as his \"son\" for that reason also. Zerubbabel, who was likely the actual son of Pedaiah, was legally reckoned as the son of Shealtiel, as stated earlier.-Compare Mt 1:12; Lu 3:27; 1Ch 3:17-19.\n Then the accounts indicate that Zerubbabel had two sons, Rhesa and Abiud, the lines diverging again at this point. (These could have been, not actual sons, but descendants, or one, at least, could have been a son-in-law. Compare 1Ch 3:19.) (Lu 3:27; Mt 1:13) Both Matthew's and Luke's genealogies of Jesus vary here from that found in 1 Chronicles chapter 3. This may be because a number of names were purposely left out by Matthew and possibly also by Luke. But the fact should be kept in mind that such differences in the genealogical lists of Matthew and Luke are very likely those already present in the genealogical registers then in use and fully accepted by the Jews and were not changes made by Matthew and Luke.\n We may conclude, therefore, that the two lists of Matthew and Luke fuse together the two truths, namely, (1) that Jesus was actually the Son of God and the natural heir to the Kingdom by miraculous birth through the virgin girl Mary, of David's line, and (2) that Jesus was also the legal heir in the male line of descent from David and Solomon through his adoptive father Joseph. (Lu 1:32, 35; Ro 1:1-4) If there was any accusation made by hostile Jews that Jesus' birth was illegitimate, the fact that Joseph, aware of the circumstances, married Mary and gave her the protection of his good name and royal lineage refutes such slander.",

   "Since we have looked at how the bible might be incorrect (all ideas were refuted), I though we should turn the tables a little bit and look at all of the bold prophecies the Bible has made.\n \n \n Reastablishment of the Jewish Homeland\n \n The most important of these end-time prophecies, the re-establishment of Israel as a nation in it's ancient homeland. That a nation could be completely destroyed as an organized entity by an invading army (by the Romans in 70 AD), it's people either slaughtered or scattered from one end of the world to the other, it's lands occupied and ruled by aliens for over 1900 years. Yet Israel survived as a distinct nationality, and then finally regained its homeland and became recognized as a viable nation once more by the other nations of the world. (1/191)\n \n \n Seems impossible? Even so, it was predicted to happen many centuries before it happened. Jesus Himself predicted the fall of Jerusalem in Luke 19:43-44, \"The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\" Deuteronomy 28:64 prophesies \"Then the Lord will scatter you among the nations from one end of the earth to the other.\" Jesus again predicts in Luke 21:24, \"They will fall by the sword and will be taken prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles, until the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled.\".\n \n \n \n The Jews began to return to Palestine in small numbers in the early part of the twentieth century, and then in much larger numbers after World War I. After World War II the Israeli nation was re-established in part in 1948, and in 1967 in the \"six-day war\" Israel recaptured the \"old city\" of Jerusalem. Amazingly, Jerusalem is now completely under Jewish control, except for one spot. This is on Mount Moriah where the Arabs have built their famous Dome-of-the-Rock, the second most holy place in the Muslim world. The Jews for political or other reasons have not yet dared to expel the Arabs from this site, raze it, and proceed to rebuild their temple, as they must want to do. (1/192-193) \"Last Days Prophecy\" is being fulfilled right before our eyes!\n \n \n \n TYRE\n \n \n \n In the 26th chapter of Ezekiel (592-570 BC) seven things are predicted to happen to the city of Tyre:\n \n \n \n 1) Nebuchadnezzar will destroy the mainland of Tyre (Ezekiel 26:8).\n \n 2) Many nations against Tyre (Ezekiel 26:3).\n \n 3) Make her a bare rock; flat like the top of a rock (Ezekiel 26:4).\n \n 4) Fishermen will spread their nets over the site (Ezekiel 26:5).\n \n 5) Throw the debris into the water (Ezekiel 26:12).\n \n 6) Never be rebuilt (Ezekiel 26:14).\n \n 7) Never be found again (Ezekiel 26:21) (2/285)\n \n \n \n Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to mainland Tyre three years after the prophecy and after a 13 year siege (585-573 BC) Tyre made terms and acknowledged Babylonian authority over them (4 xxii.452) When Nebuchadnezzar broke the gates down, he found the city almost empty. The majority of the people had moved by ship to an island about 1/2 miles off the coast and fortified a city there. The mainland city was destroyed in 573 BC, as predicted. The city of Tyre on the island remained a powerful city for several hundred years. (2/286)\n \n \n Alexander the Great, in his war on Persia, marching southward called on each city to open their gates to him, as part of his plan to deny the use to the Persian fleet. Tyre refused to do so, and Alexander laid siege to the city. Possessing no fleet, he demolished old Tyre, on the mainland, and with the debris built a causeway 200 feet wide across the straits separating the old and new towns, erecting towers and war engines at the farther end. (4/xxii. 452) Tyre continually raided the causeway with fire-ships greatly retarding progress, until Alexander pressured conquered subjects to make ships for his operation. After attaining a superior naval force, Alexander finished the causeway, battered the walls of Tyre down killed eight thousand of the inhabitants and sold thirty thousand into slavery. (5/153)\n \n \n \n A history book by a secular historian reads, \"Alexander the Great ... reduced Tyre to ruins... The larger part of the site of the once great city is now bare as the top of a rock --- a place where fishermen now spread their nets to dry.\" (5/55)\n \n \n \n Another historian, John C. Beck, says, \"The history of Tyre does not stop with after the conquest of Alexander. Men continue to rebuild her and armies continue to besiege her walls, until finally after sixteen hundred years, she falls never to be rebuilt again.\" (6/41)\n \n \n \n All the prophecies of Ezekiel about Tyre have come true: Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the mainland city of Tyre; Many nations were against Tyre; Alexander made her a bare rock and threw debris into the water to make the causeway; fishermen now spread nets over the site; (there is a city of Tyre today, but it is located down the coast from the original Tyre) the old city of Tyre has never been rebuilt, even though a great freshwater spring are located at the site, providing 10,000,000 gallons daily. It is still an excellent site today but has never been rebuilt, although many have tried. All seven of the predictions came true in the minutest detail.\n \n \n \n Some others examples of fulfilled Bible prophecy about history: \n \n \n \n Sidon (Ezekiel 28:22-23); \n \n Samaria (Hosea 13:16 & Micah 1:6); \n \n Gaza-Ashkelon (Amos 1:8; Jeremiah 47:5; Zephaniah 2:4); \n \n Moab-Ammon (Ezekiel 25:3-4; Jeremiah 48:47 & 49:6); \n \n Petra-Edom (Isaiah 34:6-15; Jeremaih 49:17-18; Ezekiel 25:13-14 & 35:57); \n \n Thebes-Memphis (Ezekiel 30:13-15); \n \n Nineveh (Nahum 1:8-10; 2:6; 3:10; 3:13; 3:19); \n \n Babylon (Daniel 2,7; Isaiah 13:19-22; 14:23; \n \n Jeremiah 51:26 & 43); \n \n Chorazin-Bethsaida-Capernaum (Matthew 11:20-24 );\n \n Jerusalem Enlargement (Jeremiah 31:38-40); and finally \n \n Palestine (Leviticus 26:31-33 & Ezekiel 36:33-35), where the events are happening before our eyes!",

   "Let's take a crack at these.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Pikeman85 \n Well lets see, well there is the whole idea of the young Earth, which is better dealt with in the Evolution vs Creationism thread.\n\n \n Not all Christians are YEC, although to be honest, some of their points of contention are interesting. The unreliability of radiometric testing for one. And the time it takes to petrify wood is another; there is a whole cottage industry built on artificial petrification of wood for use by the building industry. Something that evolutionary science says requires millions of years can be done in two years.\n \n But still, the most logical and the most... frightening is two strong a word but it is on the right track... to \"traditional\" science is the Testable Creation Model being developed by former NASA astronomer Hugh Ross. It has evolutionists up in arms -- although why is a mystery to me. It seems that creationists would be playing right into science's hands by creating a testable model, after all, that is what the theory of evolution is... a testable model. Still, Scientific American would rather run ad hominum attacks on Ross, Behe and those working on the model than examine it to see if it works or not. emoticon_confused \n \n This is understandable only in light of examining another, earlier controversy between religion and science - the Big Bang was controversial when it was first proposed because it is so simular to the Genesis account of creation. Scientists rushed to find ways to separate the two, pointing out that \"matter cannot be created from nothing\" and theorizing an osolating universe much closer to Hindu conceptions of creation (fueling the 60's \"guru\" movement and the rise of the New Age movement in the process). But discoveries made by the Hubble telescope have killed the osolating universe idea, and research into the Higgs particle (or more popularly the \"God\" particle) which creates mass out of nothing threaten to open the Genesis/Big Band debate again.\n \n \nThere is the fact that the book of Daniel is historically inaccurate, and written in language not used at the time.\n\n \n The issue of Daniel's historical accuracy is best dealt with here (http://www.tektonics.org/tekton_05_05_01.html) in an article by an aquaintance of mine.\n \n As to the issue of language, this is not correct, and is even a corruption of the actual arguement used against Daniel by liberal scholars like those in the Jesus Seminar. In a debate with Marcus Borg on Beliefnet a few years ago he admitted to me that language is not the reason for late dating of the second half of Daniel; a presupposition against prophesy was the reason Daniel was dated late.\n \n Theory has it that Daniel had three writers; the first half was completed near the time of Daniel's life, the second half was written 150-200 years later and a third redactor attepted to blend the two together another 100 years after that. Language is actually the proof that this theory is wrong, as the second half of Daniel uses Aramaic words that WERE in use at the time the story takes place but NOT when the account was alledged to be written. The second and third redactors would have had to have knowledge of words out of use by 150 years in a foreign language - to see this problem played out in modern terms, walk up to a group of modern teenagers in a mall and try speaking to them in 1960's slang (\"daddio\", \"I'm hep\", \"cat\", \"tune in, turn on, drop out\", etc.), and , IF they don't beat the XXXX out of you for trying and failing to act like one of them, you will at least see that they have no clue what you are talking about. And that is only after 30 years.\n \n \nThe whole thing about insects with 4 legs, women who drink water mixed with dirt and brought to the altar of Yahweh getting sick or staying well and that is the criteria for innocence or guilt (sounds almost like trial by combat or fire, a barbaric legal practice)\n\n \n Insect with four legs--- Ancients did not classify animals the was we moderns do. The word used here is 'owph, which means a creature with wings -- it is the same word used in verse 21 (flying). The reference in both cases is to insects. The scripture from Leviticus in context gives us the clue we need to show how they classified these animals:\n \n Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. \n \n Quite simply, they didn't view the longer legs as the same type of appendage as the other two. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n As to \"drinking dirt\", as Glenn Miller writes:\n \n: I think the answer might be found in the social understanding of ritual uncleanness. \n\n \n Which is a very long subject to get into, which is why I simply recomment the Book \"Handbook of Biblical Social Values\" by Malina and Neyrey. Both are sociologists who looked into ancient Near Eastern customs to discover their sociological roots and implications. (It eliminates nearly 90 percent of all the so-called \"contradictions\" found in the Bible all by itself.)\n \n \nThe whole thing about the \"prophecy\" of the virgin birth, when the word used in Isasiah is the word for young woman, and Immanuel refers to Isasiah's own son. (the LXX mistranslated it as virgin, and that is what the author of Matthew used. Oh, also, the first few chapters of Matthew weren't accepted at first by many eastern christians, nor were any of the other gospels)\n\n \n Funny, every Rabbi in both Talmuds except Rashi accepted \"virgin\" as the correct interpretation. And Rashi broke away from his usual literal interpretation to do it. And no Rabbi agreed with Rashi until Rabbi David Kimshi in the 15th century. The Talmud refers to this passage as messianic.\n \n Questions of canonization in the Eastern Church also involved issues of politics, which is why so many Councils were called. This is a non issue.\n \n \nThe genealogies of Luke and Matthew contradicting each other (and it isn't due to Mary and Joseph being the two different genealogies. Women were not considered important at this time period. They were considered \"soil\" for the person, in which semen could grow. An entire person was contained in the man's \"seed\" That is why women are often referred to as barren in the Bible. This went out of favor in the mid 19th century I -think-)\n\n \n I'm sorry skeptics don't like the Mary/Joseph genealogies answer, but I won't make up another one just to make skeptics happy. Luke and Mark were defending the attack by Rabbinical leaders questioning Jesus' messianic claims along the lines of his bloodline.\n \n Within the ancient world kinship was a person's determinant for status. The reputation of a person's ancestral house was an important factor in how one viewed one's self, and how others viewed you. The Jews are a good example of this; those descended from Levi or Aaron were allowed to serve for Temple ministry, while others of other bloodlines were not. \n \n Writing to different groups to establish Jesus' credentials was vital; Jews would have concidered bloodline to have been passed in one way, Gentiles in another. Both Matthew and Luke trace bloodline back to David, thus proving that any way you slice it, Jesus was the legitimate heir to the Messianic throne.\n \n \nThe flood being in 2285 (or it may be 2385) according to genealogies in 1 or 2 Kings, can't remember which.\n\n \n Ancient geneaologies often passed over numerous generations. This was not only common to Israel, but from Mesopotamia through Egypt.\n \n \nAlso, I dislike the fact that Christians disregard the specific ten commands listed as the Ten Commandments in the Bible. They are not the ones contained in Exodus 20. A little hypocritical I think, but oh well.\n\n \n This is a non issue, as there are hypocrites in everything done under the sun. \n \n As to the different versions of the Ten Commandments - there are actually three, BTW - it is easy to see with a CAREFUL reading of the text. One is commanded to be written by Moses, the other by the hand of God Himself - a ritual Decalogue and an ethical Decalogue differentiated by whose hand wrote it. \n \n \nBy the way, why don't any of you do burnt offerings? They weren't ALL for sin. Most were just to please your God, because he likes the smell. So lets barbecue! (also, I read somewhere the burning of dung was commanded as well, will look for it)\n\n \n God is a Southerner and He likes His barbeque. What's the problem?\n \n Interesting post - thanks for sharing!\n Peace, Tom",

   "Not all Christians are YEC, although to be honest, some of their points of contention are interesting.\n\n Until you actually try to think about those points. Then you find that they are either ignorance or misrepresentation.\n \nThe unreliability of radiometric testing for one.\n\n Exactly. The examples given by creationists are usually misrepresentations. For example, creationists often trumpet claims that lava from the 1801 eruption of Hualalai volcano in Hawaii was dated various ages in the millions of years. Thus, they conclude, radiometric dating is unreliable. Generally, creationists are uncritical in accepting anything that supports what they want to believe. So, without any effort to investigate the source of such claims, they claim that it shows that radiometric dating is unreliable.\n \n The truth of the matter is that the purpose of the study in question was not to date the lava. Here is the paper that creationists claim supports their view:\n \n Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii, J.G. Funkhouser and J.J. Naughton, Journal of Geophysical Research 73:14 pp. 4601-4607 (15 July 1968)\n \n One wonders how many creationists who make claims based on this paper have actually read even the title. Isn't it apparant that the paper deals with the dating of Inclusions in the lava and not the lava? The purpose of the experiment was to date chunks of olivine carried in the lava. Since the age of the lava was known (and was dated correctly, by the way), the purpose of the paper was to demonstrate that olivine inclusions are not suitable to use in dating lava, and in fact, yields dates all over the place. The olivine really was old and showed that its use in the dating of lava is inappropriate.\n \n You can read about creationist misrepresentation in THIS article.\n \nAnd the time it takes to petrify wood is another; there is a whole cottage industry built on artificial petrification of wood for use by the building industry. Something that evolutionary science says requires millions of years can be done in two years.\n\n You need to cite at least two sources to raise this above the level of babble. First, can you cite a reliable source that indicates that it takes millions of years for wood to petrify? There are several observations of wood that petrified by natural means in a short period of time under the right conditions. One example is in alkaline springs with high silica content, in Yellowstone Park for example. The process of petrifaction is well understood and wood can be artificially petrified by creating the right conditions. One method uses a solution of sodium silicate.\n \n Second, can you show that the conditions that you claim for rapid petrifaction occur in nature? It is meaningless to set up conditions that are artificial and do not exist naturally anywhere and then claim that is is evidence for or against something else. \n \nBut still, the most logical and the most... frightening is two strong a word but it is on the right track... to \"traditional\" science is the Testable Creation Model being developed by former NASA astronomer Hugh Ross.\n\n So he says. If you look into it you will find that the model isn't testable.\n \nIt has evolutionists up in arms -- although why is a mystery to me.\n\n Me too. Generally Ross is laughed at by scientists as far as I know. The ones who are really up in arms are the creationists. Ross is a progressive creationist. He actually hasn't added anything to the relevant fields of science. And why would an astronomer be concerned with evolution and why would biologists be concerned with some crackpot physicist?\n \n Do you know what evolution is? Are you aware that the origin of the universe is NOT part of evolutionary theory? I didn't think so.\n \nIt seems that creationists would be playing right into science's hands by creating a testable model, after all, that is what the theory of evolution is... a testable model.\n\n No need. There are certain predictions that can be made of what must should be observed if the Biblical story of creation and the flood is true. Not only are none of these predictions verified, they have actually been shown to be false. YEC has been falsified.\n \n As for Ross, I doubt that science will give him the attention he already gets from creationists. So far, he has no testable model.\n \nStill, Scientific American would rather run ad hominum attacks on Ross, Behe and those working on the model than examine it to see if it works or not.\n\n Cite the articles. Your ad hominem attack on Scientific American is noted. By the way, Behe accepts evolution. He just wants to find evidence that his God exists and that evolution is the way He works. By the way, disagreeing with someone and pointing out their errors are not ad hominem attacks.\n \nThis is understandable only in light of examining another, earlier controversy between religion and science - the Big Bang was controversial when it was first proposed because it is so simular to the Genesis account of creation. Scientists rushed to find ways to separate the two, pointing out that \"matter cannot be created from nothing\" and theorizing an osolating universe much closer to Hindu conceptions of creation (fueling the 60's \"guru\" movement and the rise of the New Age movement in the process). But discoveries made by the Hubble telescope have killed the osolating universe idea, and research into the Higgs particle (or more popularly the \"God\" particle) which creates mass out of nothing threaten to open the Genesis/Big Band debate again.\n\n Nonsense and thoughtless. Perhaps you are unaware that science does not deal with religion. There is no effort to disprove your god. If you wish to claim that the big bang is the moment of creation, feel free. It is irrelevant to science. What you perceived as a controversy is actually a one sided reaction by fundamentalist christians who cannot reconcile their religion with observations of science. That is, in fact, the origin of fundamentalism. It was an anti-science, anti-intellectual reaction to discoveries made by scientists who were, for the most part, Christians and who believed in creation.\n \n \nInsect with four legs--- Ancients did not classify animals the was we moderns do. The word used here is 'owph, which means a creature with wings -- it is the same word used in verse 21 (flying). The reference in both cases is to insects. The scripture from Leviticus in context gives us the clue we need to show how they classified these animals:\n \n Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. \n \n Quite simply, they didn't view the longer legs as the same type of appendage as the other two.\n\n That's all very interesting and ad hoc, but perhaps you have never noticed that beetles don't have jumping legs like grasshoppers. So quite simply, your ad hoc answer that grasshoppers have 4 legs and two other kinds of things which have legs above their feet (but not legs), doesn't include beetles. And the beetles are included in the creeping things that goeth upon all four.\n \n Perhaps you'd like to explain why you think that a bat is a fowl. Or maybe you actually understand the the whole point is that the Bible is neither scientifically (most of all) nor historically accurate in every detail. Whether you want to claim that it is inspired or not is your problem. Clearly it was written by men with the understanding of nature of their time. Thus the earth has four corners or is a big circle (not sphere) covered by a dome of firmament where the stars hang and where rain falls through windows. Surely you jest.",
