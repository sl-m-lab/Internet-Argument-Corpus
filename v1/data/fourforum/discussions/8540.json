   "Roger Clemens has become the 8th winningest pitcher in baseball history with his 343rd victory. Clemens beat Greg Maddux as the two best pitchers of their generation went head to head. Both will make baseball's Hall of Fame, Clemens with power, Maddux with finesse. Maddux has 325 wins. \n \n Winningest pitchers all time \n \n 1 Cy Young 511 \n 2 Walter Johnson 417 \n 3 Grover Alexander 373 \n 3 Christy Mathewson 373 \n 5 Warren Spahn 363 \n 6 Pud Galvin 361 \n 7 Kid Nichols 361 \n 8 Roger Clemens 343",

   "That's weird, I haven't heard of any on the list other than the top 3.\nMaybe it's your age, or even the fact that you don't give a rat's tootie about baseball. Funny that you have heard of Alexander and not Mathewson. Their careers overlapped and Mathewson may have been a bit better.\n \n Cy Young 1890-1911 (22 yrs - 511 wins) avg 23.23 wins/year (.618 w/l %)\n Walter Johnson 1907-1927 (21 yrs - 417 wins) avg 19.86 wins/year (.599 w/l %)\n Grover Alexander 1911-1930 (20 yrs - 373 wins) avg 18.65 wins/year (.642 w/l %)\n Christy Mathewson 1900-1916 (17 yrs - 373 wins) avg 21.94 wins/year (.665 w/l %)\n Warren Spahn 1942-1965 (24 yrs - 363 wins) avg 15.13 wins/year (.597 w/l %)\n Pud Galvin 1875-1892 (18 yrs - 361 wins) avg 20.06 wins/year (.540 w/l %)\n Kid Nichols 1890-1905 (14 yrs* - 361 wins) 25.79 wins/year (.634 w/l %)\n Roger Clemens 1984-2006 (23 yrs**) 14.91 wins/year (.665 w/l %)\n \n * sat out 2 seasons\n ** 2006 partial season incomplete. Through 2005 season - 15.5 wins/year\n \n Of course, such statistics are basically meaningless since the number of games played in any given season has changed. The number of wins is more indicative of a combination of things - staying power, skill, and supporting team.\n \n However, for purposes of discussion I supply the following list by W/L. These are the previous pitchers with the addition of some who I have seen pitch or who came to mind. This may not be meaningful either since Roger Clemens ranks at the top and hasn't had the hitting to support his pitching. He doesn't give up many runs, but he gets fewer in support. Feel free to add to the list.\n \n .690 Whitey Ford\n .665 Christy Mathewson *\n .665 Roger Clemens *\n .659 Randy Johnson\n .655 Sandy Koufax\n .654 Andy Pettitte\n .649 Lefty Gomez\n .642 Grover Alexander *\n .638 Jim Palmer\n .634 Kid Nichols *\n .631 Juan Marichal\n .627 Greg Maddux\n .621 Bob Feller\n .618 Cy Young *\n .607 Dave McNally **\n .599 Walter Johnson *\n .597 Warren Spahn *\n .587 Mike Cuellar\n .580 John Smoltz\n .540 Pud Galvin *\n .535 Dennis Eckersly\n .539 Robin Roberts\n .534 Mike Scott\n .526 Nolan Ryan\n \n * most wins list\n ** I went to high school and played ball with Dave. He died of lung cancer almost 4 years ago.",
