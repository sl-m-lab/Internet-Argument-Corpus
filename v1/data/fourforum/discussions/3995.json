If you really look at it from outside the box, it is pretty obvious that we as a race have doomed ourselves.

Even ice ages and world-wide droughts lasting thousands of years have occured without our being involved in heavy industry...which we have only been engaged in for a little over 200 years. The rate at which the planet is changing is startling. Who knows, perhaps the ardvarks will have taken over by then.
