   "Staying the order while the appeal process is taking place is logical. Here's the rationale: there's no reason to move it if it hasn't been decided whether it should be moved, and if the ruling is reversed after the cross is moved/dismantled, it will just cost more to be redone.\n \n \nI was very pleased to hear this. Last I heard, the property was purchased by the federal government to protect it from the ACLU.\n\n That would be very silly; the best way to protect the land from the ACLU is to put it in private hands.\n \n That said, this is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause. Whether our new right-wing court cares to admit this is another matter. I don't think our newbies will have the stones for anything but a 5-4 reversal. We can, however, hope for them to stick to their pledges of upholding stare decisis, or perhaps the Supreme Court will refuse to hear the case altogether (I'm not familiar with the procedural details of this case).",

   "WorldNetDaily - Senate Clears Way for Federal Government to Take Control of Mt. Soledad Cross \n \n August 2, 2006\n WorldNetDaily.com \n \n It's been called a \"red flag waved in front of a bull\" to those who want to strip America of its Christian heritage, but a memorial that honors United States' war veterans with a cross is another step closer to protection. \n \n The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation yesterday that would provide for the federal government to acquire the site of the Mt.Soledad Veterans Memorial and preserve it. \n \n It was a \"great victory\" for veterans, Richard Thompson, chief counsel for the Thomas More Law Center, said today. \n \n But he warned the fight, which already has lasted 17 years, isn't over. \n \n \"The presence of the cross atop Mt. Soledad enrages the ACLU much like a red flag waved in front of a bull,\" he said. \n \n The U.S. Supreme Court just last month intervened in the disagreement to stay a lower court's order that the city either remove the cross by Tuesday, or face fines of $5,000 per day. \n \n The legislation is \"strongly\" supported by President Bush. \n \n \"In the face of legal action threatening the continued existence of the current memorial, the people of San Diego have clearly expressed their desire to keep the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial in its present form,\" said a recent administration policy statement obtained by WorldNetDaily. \n \n \"The administration supports the important goal of preserving the integrity of war memorials,\" the statement said. \n \n The legislative plan would protect the 29-foot concrete cross atop Mt. Soledad that was targeted in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union after an atheist alleged it violated his belief that historic religious emblems couldn't be displayed on public property. \n \n The legislation is a second front to the effort to preserve the honor to this nation's fallen heroes. The court battle continues, with oral arguments on the issue scheduled for the week of Oct. 16. Earlier, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the most overturned appellate court in the federal judiciary, refused to stay a lower court order. \n \n That order from District Judge Gordon Thompson concluded the cross is unconstitutional, and he had imposed the Tuesday deadline. \n \n The U.S. House earlier had approved the same legislation, allowing the Senate approval to send the issue to the president. \n \n \"The congressional action underscores what most Americans understand - that the Mt. Soledad cross poses no constitutional crisis in honoring our war heroes,\" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice. \n \n The ACLJ represents a number of members of Congress, including Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who sponsored the House measure protecting the cross. \n \n The More Center, like the ACLJ a public interest law firm, has been involved in the defense of the memorial for several years already and expects there will be more work. \n \n \"The plaintiff and ACLU have already demonstrated their persistence and zeal to take down the cross and this political defeat will most likely intensify their legal efforts as they sense what they thought was sure victory slipping through their fingers,\" Thompson said. \n \n The issue had been resolved at one point in 2004, with Congress providing for a way for the land to be donated to the Department of the Interior and administered under the National Park System. \n \n However, the San Diego City Council refused to make the donation, triggering the organization of San Diegans for the Mt. Soledad National War Memorial, whose members concluded the cross is a \"national treasure.\" They collected more than 100,000 signatures calling on the council to reverse its decision. \n \n A subsequent special election on the issue resulted in 76 percent of the voters deciding to preserve the cross, which is surrounded by six walls holding 3,200 black granite plaques honoring veterans from all military branches.",

   "ACLJ Applauds Senate Vote to Preserve Mt. Soledad Cross \n \n August 2, 2006\n \n (Washington, DC) - The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) today applauded the U.S. Senate for joining with the U.S. House of Representatives in approving a measure to keep in place the Mt. Soledad cross in San Diego - part of a war memorial for 50 years. The Senate last night passed legislation by unanimous consent joining with the House which passed legislation in July which designates that the memorial be transferred to the federal government giving the Department of Defense authority to oversee it. The legislative victory comes on the heels of a Supreme Court order staying a federal court order that called for the removal of the cross.\n \n \"The Senate action clears the way for a legislative solution to keep the Mt. Soledad cross in place,\" said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ, which is involved in the legal battle to save the cross. \"With the Senate approval - coupled with the House vote last month approving the legislation - Congress has acted appropriately and in a bipartisan manner to protect a vital war memorial that honors so many men and women who gave their lives for this nation. The Congressional action underscores what most Americans understand - that the Mt. Soledad cross poses no constitutional crisis in honoring our war heroes. We look forward to President Bush signing this legislation. The legislative victory comes as legal efforts to protect the cross continue. The fact is that the San Diego memorial has captured the attention of the Supreme Court, Congress and the American people. We remain confident that the Mt. Soledad cross will stay in place.\"\n \n The ACLJ has been involved in working to keep the Mt. Soledad cross in place. The ACLJ represents 22 members of Congress - including Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) - who sponsored the House measure which passed last month by a wide margin.\n \n The ACLJ filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court successfully arguing that the federal district court's order should be stayed because important constitutional issues have been raised and that federal and state appeals have not been exhausted.\n \n In addition to Congressman Hunter, the ACLJ also represents the following members of Congress: Todd Akin, Gresham Barrett, Eric Cantor, Michael Conaway, Barbara Cubin, John Culberson, Phil Gingery, Gil Gutknecht, Jack Kingston, John Kline, Kenny Marchant, Patrick McHenry, Mike McIntyre, Gary Miller, Marilyn Musgrave, Randy Neugebauer, Joseph Pitts, Jim Ryun, Todd Tiahrt, Dave Weldon, and Lynn Westmoreland.\n \n Led by Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, the American Center for Law and Justice specializes in constitutional law and is based in Washington, D.C.",

Judge Thompson wrote, \"it is the exclusion of any other purchasers of or bidders for the land that gives the appearance of preferring the Christian religion that the California Constitution forbids.\" Judge Thompson also wrote that \"the City's attempt to comply with this Court's order by selling only a small portion of the land underneath the Mount Soledad cross still shows a preference or aid to the Christian religion.\"[5] Judge Thompson added, \"Both the method of sale and the amount of land sold underneath the Mount Soledad cross do not cure the constitutional infirmities outlined in this Court's previous Order.\"[1] (referring to the December 3, 1991 order stating \"a permanent injunction forbidding the permanent presence\" of the Mount Soledad cross on public property.[5] Judge Thompson again gave the City of San Diego another 30 days to remove the cross).[5]\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Soledad\n Why is the government trying to sell the land?\n SOLELY to KEEP a religious symbol standing where it is.\n \n It would be better to sell the religious symbol, and put it up on somebody's private land. But then again, private people typically don't want these religious symbols on their land.\n It's all about Christians wanting to mark governmental territory with things they wouldn't put up in their own front yard...\n \n \n \n It violates the constitution, as you admit.\n It should come down. Saying it is \"technically\" doesn't make it right. It's an attempt to ignore what is right.\n It should come down. Get over that...\n\n \n You realize of course that this is the very trial that resulted in the supreme court issuing its stay in order to allow the sale?",

But this isn't personal expression, it's government expression.\n \n Um, once again, you can't have it both ways.\n \n But, precisely as I pointed out, both scenarios would require being \"carried to their most extreme\" in order to be non-sectarian. This is not a fallacy; it follows from your proposal to represent each religion. So, once again, I favor separation.\n \n If that proved your point, there wouldn't be rulings like Co. of Allegheny v. ACLU and Staley v. Harris Co.\n \n Actually, I think I explained my point quite well, but I'll try again. If a poor tree dies, and two branches happen to break off and land in such a way that their orientation resembles a cross, do we immediately identify this as a symbol of the Christian religion? Of course not.\n \n Wait, I have a better one. As the leaves of the Quercus stellata strongly resemble a fancy cross, do we identify this species in its entirety and/or any single member of this species and/or every one of its leaves as a symbol of Christianity? No.\n\n \n I'd merely be playing devil's advocate to continue at this point.\n \n I'm all for the very least amount of regulation and censorship possible in any situation. Like I said, live and let live. I could really care less what others are doing, as long as it doesn't directly affect me in a negative way.\n \n We're on the same page for the most part, I'm just not as militant about it as you some others are. \n \n \nIs there a membership fee, or can anyone just join? ;)\n\n \n Free to join, but memberships is by invitation only.

Argued March 2, 2005-Decided June 27, 2005\n Among the 21 historical markers and 17 monuments surrounding the Texas State Capitol is a 6-foot-high monolith inscribed with the Ten Commandments. The legislative record illustrates that, after accepting\n the monument from the Fraternal Order of Eagles-a national social, civic, and patriotic organization-the State selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state organization that maintains\n the capitol grounds. Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters\n the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 suit seeking a declaration that the monument's placement violates the First Amendment's Establishment\n Clause and an injunction requiring its removal. Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a reasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context,\n would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message\n that the State endorsed religion. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n Held: The judgment is affirmed.\n\n \n \nBaloney. How does the absence of any symbols promote atheism? When you go out into a national forest, are you disgusted by the lack of symbols? (Sorry Waxy, it was the first thing that popped into my head.) When you see an open field, do you think the farmer is promoting non-belief? Get real.;)\n\n \n This is not the absence of the symbol but rather the removal of one.

Common sense is largely about reason, an opinion WITH basis. \n\n The word \"common sense\" is often used as an excuse to AVOID GIVING the supposedly existing \"basis\".\n Can you give the basis, completely with \"reason\"?\n \n Or is claiming \"common sense\" about all you got?\n \n \n \nWaxy implied that it's plausible for someone without a family to have more time to attack Christianity. Christianity has organizations for family support. I don't notice organizations that attack Christianity making efforts to support families. So I wasn't making \"blind claims as to cause and effect\" I was using reason, not blindness. \n\n \"Waxy implied\"?\n Where did this supposedly happen?\n \n You blindly believe that an \"attack\" on \"Christianity\" somehow provides a detriment to organizations that provide family support.\n Can you show ANY \"attack\" on \"Christianity\" which has damaged Christians attempt to provide \"family support\"?\n \n \n \nBut it makes a pretty reasonable point, which you didn't attempt to refute with reason.\n\n Why should I \"refute with reason\" a claim that was never proven with reason?\n \n \n \nHere's what you said: The lower stability of the family unit would be a good reason for Christians to FOCUS ON the family unit. As in THEIR family unit. \n Was this not an implication that the best thing for those concerned with family stability to worry about their own family only, and not anywhere else? It really did have plenty to do with what you said. \n\n I'm underwhelmed by your limited powers of comprehension.\n If a person wants to prevent violence, the best starting place would be to start within his own home and work outward. If a man who beats his wife tried to preach a message of non-violence, nobody would listen.\n \n You presumed, because it was convenient for you to do so, that my statements meant \"not anywhere else\". I never said that.\n I just pointed out that people who claim to want to help X, yet they have MORE PROBLEMS with X, should probably start at home first.\n \n Hopefully this helped you understand more thoroughly what I was and was not saying.\n \n \n \nYes, I'll agree that they are. But if the Christian religion devalues women, why are so many women Christians? I believe Christian women outnumber Christian men.\n\n Why do people in the heartland vote republican when the republican economic philosophy clearly puts them at the disadvantage?\n People don't always act in their best interest, and the Christian religion has a lot of examples of denying simple pleasures and common sense applications just because of \"say so\".\n \n \n \nI don't see Christian money & politics being involved in \"how other people live\" as much as I do secular (scientific / civil liberties) money & politics involving itself in how other people live.\n\n Uh...\n That's how it SHOULD be.\n \n Do you disagree?\n \n \n \nBecause you're trying hard not to see it. There is little difference between \"there is no God\", and \"God is irrellevent\". \"God is irrellevent\" is all through that article. \n\n Nope. Still not there.\n I'm seeing reading comprehension isn't big on your list...\n You read what you WANT to read instead of what is ACTUALLY there.\n Something bad happened? Somebody must be against God.\n Something good happened? Let's give God credit.\n \n And since it can neither be proven nor disproven, such blind allegations provides a perfect basis for faith...\n \n \n \nAs do you, when you claim Christianity to be anti women. \n\n I didn't realize you wouldn't be able to read what I was implying in those \"theories\".\n I was comparing YOUR \"theories\" to the \"theories\" that I just offered.\n \"Theories\" which had varying levels of bullsh!t and validity to them.\n \n I think the Bible is clearly anti-woman, but the modern religion (which is often a far cry from the biblical statements) often is not anti-female.\n \n Although there are cases that prove that wrong...\n http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-men22.html\n \n \n \nAtheists don't get married as much, but it doesn't mean they don't get involved in relationships as much. Unmarried relationships can break up, leaving just as much trauma as a divorce. There's no way to poll it or analyze it, since no records are required to be kept on spur-of-the-moment relationships.\n \n And of course, what you just claimed has absolutely NO PROOF by what you just admitted.\n \n How convenient for you...\n \n I guess maybe I'll just claim something similar about Christians instead????\n \n \n \nIt's not necessary for me to personally \"know\" them, to see how they get along, how their children behave, etc. They sometimes make the news. The entertainment and political spectrum is loaded with them also - we can observe them.\n\n In other words, you don't know any.\n And as for \"entertainment and political spectrum\", should I then take the recent rash of Catholic priest child molestations to be an example of how Christians behave?\n \n You're indulging in the tools of stereo-typing.

The fact that bona fide divorce rates are higher for Christian couples than for atheist couples is still a giant thorn in Christianity's side. \n\n \n And I agree with that too.

Not religion.\n Religion gets the existence of God. And they're welcome to it.\n \n As for \"civil liberties\" and \"atheism\", I guess atheists can take that as a compliment, and I can be seriously disturbed by the thought that you have something against \"civil liberties\"...\n \n \n \nAtheism has a comparable faith.

Quite the contrary; you are implying that Christians don't \"speed,\" therefore we only need to look at \"speeding\" atheists. I call you on your XXXX and ask you to provide some statistics for \"speeding\" atheists and Christians, but -- lo and behold -- you've brought forth nothing. Ho hum.\n \n \nIt does, because as the old saying goes; statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics.\n\n First, you were the one excusing yourself from supporting your rubbish because you insist (wrongly) that such statistics cannot be gathered. Now you're saying that only liars use statistics. Isn't it more accurate just to say that liars lie, especially when they don't understand statistics?\n \n \nAnd I agree with that too. Christians aren't perfect, and any failure they have is being used against them more and more by newly organized atheism.\n\n There you go, take a problem with Christianity and blame those \"evil\" atheists for telling the truth about it. I bet it's those evil atheists who cause the divorces in the first place! Yeah!\n \n \nNo, organized atheism makes it up, by suddenly objecting to public displays of the ten commandments etc. - U.S. tradition that has been unopposed for decades.\n\n Right; you've had your religion endorsed for long enough, and it's past time it stopped. Yet you're complaining... Do we need to review case law?\n \n \n \nSo this is proof enough for you that the ACLU is balanced?? I wonder what the ratio is - one pro Christian representation to 100 pro athiest representations?\n\n Who said the ACLU is \"balanced\"? The religious nutjobs are guilty of breaking the law far more often than \"separationists,\" so there are more cases of such taken up by the ACLU. No, once again you've pulled the shifting goalposts maneuver: first you called the ACLU \"organized atheism,\" and now that I've shown they're clearly not \"organized atheism,\" you're mad that they're not \"balanced.\" As soon as the civil rights violations are \"balanced,\" the ACLU will be \"balanced.\"\n \n \nThis is an ACLU strategy that was developed by it's founder, and is still used today. Occasionally defend something it doesn't agree with, to cause confusion and appeasment. Since since the ACLU once went to court in Florida to defend a Muslim woman's \"right\" to be photographed for her drivers licence while wearing a veil, it knows that compromises must be made. Allowing one child to occasionally sing a religious song in school is an acceptable trade off for supporting terrorism.\n\n Support your assertion. Go ahead. Of course, you won't provide any evidence and will probably claim that it's all a big atheist conspiracy. Nevermind that your scenario will be nothing but ad hoc modifications and completely unfalsifiable, but such are wacko conspiracy theories.\n So instead of being evil atheists, the ACLU is now a bunch of evil, unbalanced promotors of terrorism. How long before the goalposts reach orbit, marc?",
