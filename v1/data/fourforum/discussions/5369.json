   "A senior al Qaeda leader Haitham al-Yemeni was killed in a missile attack by an unmanned U.S. intelligence Predator aircraft on Pakistani territory near the Afghan border\n\n \n I recon it was pretty easy to hound him - the only thing the CIA had to bother about was to slave his movements in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan via a satellite and watch it on a monitor of a computer. Know how? As far back as the moment of establishing al Qaeda, microchips were implanted under the skin of all its leaders. So, CIA knows where bin Laden is within the accuracy of a few meters, but gives no sign of it to keep drawing on the money of taxpayers to \"catch 'im\". True, same thing with other terrorist groups' leaders Washington make use of in various hot spots of the world.",
