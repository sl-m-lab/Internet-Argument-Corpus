   "US real wages fall at fastest rate in 14 years\n By Christopher Swann in Washington\n Published: May 10 2005 17:59 | Last updated: May 11 2005 15:20\n \n Real wages in the US are falling at their fastest rate in 14 years, according to data surveyed by the Financial Times.\n \n Inflation rose 3.1 per cent in the year to March but salaries climbed just 2.4 per cent, according to the Employment Cost Index. In the final three months of 2004, real wages fell by 0.9 per cent.\n \n The last time salaries fell this steeply was at the start of 1991, when real wages declined by 1.1 per cent.\n \n Stingy pay rises mean many Americans will have to work longer hours to keep up with the cost of living, and they could ultimately undermine consumer spending and economic growth.\n \n Many economists believe that in spite of the unexpectedly large rise in job creation of 274,000 in April, the uneven revival in the labour market since the 2001 recession has made it hard for workers to negotiate real improvements in living standards.\n \n Even after last month's bumper gain in employment, there are 22,000 fewer private sector jobs than when the recession began in March 2001, a 0.02 per cent fall. At the same point in the recovery from the recession of the early 1990s, private sector employment was up 4.7 per cent.\n \n http://news.ft.com/cms/s/f269a8f4-c173-11d9-943f-00000e2511c8.html\n \n \n Maybe things aren't as rosey as we think?",
