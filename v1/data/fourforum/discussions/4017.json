Haven't seen you here before. Welcome (unless I just missed you).\n \n This seems to be just the latest in Egypts schizophrenic pro-anti-western policy.\n \n Egypt has made a short, but spectacular, career of giving lip service to the west and then digging in it heels when it comes time to make any real western motivated moves. \n \n Is this good policy? I don't know. It keeps the west off their back, but also keeps the west from really accepting them. IT also alienates them among other middle eastern nations. considering this, in the end I think it is likely a loosing policy, but hey, its egypt......",

   "Given the amount of military aid that Egypt recieves from the US, they have to play nice to policies that are pushed by the US. Another example is the trade agreement that Egypt signed with Israel and the US recently. Where exports (textile I believe) from Egypt are tariff free if they contain enough Israel content.",

In addition, the US has made non-budget reparations payments in the billions to Egypt as a result of Egyptian war damage and land acquisition by Israel. Little, if any of the US aid to Egypt has been directed toward economic development, as Egypt maintains unemployment rates exceeding 25%, one of the highest in the ME. \n \n The primary effort to rename the Persian Gulf to Arab Gulf was initiated in the 1930s when Britain was making an effort to control major Islands in that gulf, including Bahrain, which were properties of Iran. That coincided with US/Britain joint efforts to develop ME oil resources, and the US has never been shy about using money and/or force to obtain natural resources. \n \n At this point in time, my observation of Egypt's US affiliation has been and is the preservation of a lack of threat to Israel and a financial/military windfall for Egypt. The cotton deal, benefiting Israel's almost non-existent export capability, is just another example of our 'free trade' policies. When it comes to freeloading on US taxpayer money and military resources, Israel has no peers and Egypt became a beneficiary of our maintaining our ME gunslinger by geographical default.",
