Only then would it have a chance at being better then Brokeback.\n\n \n Oh I see--you mean from your personal standpoint. I guess in some ways we all rate films based on what is important to us. In the same vein, a lot of religious people think of Passion as the best ever. (though not me. It was very well done, but certainly not the best ever.)\n \n On the other hand, only considering films with a gay theme as good enough to possibly be the best sure does limit you.

I think that is amazing. I think it shows progress in people's thinking. This would have never happen ten years ago.\n\n \n My opinion is that it's a lot more complicated than that. I think there has been an increasing desire and success in Hollywood in the last few years to use the film industry as a political vehicle--an instrument of getting an ideological message out, rather than just entertainment. Now, there have long been examples of that throughout film history, but in the last few years it just seems that sort of thing is becoming more predominant. And more importantly, it seems to be used as a standard of what makes a film successful or award-worthy. Both Crash AND Brokeback were such films, and Hollywood put a LOT of marketing and buzz muscle behind Brokeback. Then there's the more overt example a few years ago of Michael Moore films (which were independent films, but heavily supported by Holywood. Indie films get a lot better exposure if Hollywook likes them). Spielberg, in a recent interview I read the other day, said straight up that he thinks this movement of Hollywood'a acceptance of ideological films is their reaction to the Bush administration and conservatism in general. I think there may be some truth to that. I hadn't turned on the Academy Awards more than 5 minutes when someone winning an award was making a typical liberal comment about peace and tolerance.\n \n The entertainment industry is defintely sometimes political liberalism's version of the church pulpit--a place to preach and not look TOO much like it's a sermon.",

How well a film does at the box office isn't really any estimate of quality. Titanic and Jurassic Park were hardly masterpieces.\n\n Not really. The Oscars have gotten a lot of XXXX in recent years for nominating so many mediocre films and ignoring independent films. This was the year the just decided to say \"Ok, ok, see, we nominated five \"independent\" films. We really do care about quality.\" The funny thing is, they still didn't really take any risks in nominating these movies. Despite the fact they were relatively small budget films, every single one of them had well known, established, big-time people working in them. They were safe to nominate. It's not like they got adventurous and nominated something outside their box from someone they hadn't heard of. Next year or in a couple they'll go back to nominating the same mediocre blockbusters they always have.

It is definately cheaper than going to see a play on broadway or going to some other live event (ballet, rock concert, opera, ect.) Going to see a movie is cheaper than buying a book. One ticket cost between $3 and $7.50 depending what time you go (or maybe where you go.) One good music CD cost at least $10-$15 and that's at Wal*mart. Go to Best Buy or most other places it's more. Probibly the only form of entertainment that is cheaper is if you purchase a ticket for a live performance of a show that a high school drama department is putting on or some kind of community show. Not that those are bad shows, they're amatures performing.",

Ultimately the viewer has the final decision of whether or not they want to see the film or at least approve of it, and that's the way it should be. I think this is more about personal preference. I just prefer movies that don't have a political agenda--that's my personal preference. But I'd never say \"movies shouldn't have messages.\" Indeed, the message is often the most moving part of a film. I tend to like films that move people from a human standpoint and inspire. But if a film has a blatant or veiled message of politics, it tends to turn me off because I know it's just a soapbox. An example is the movie adaptation of John Grisham's novel Runaway Jury. I've read the book AND seen the movie. The movie ended up being a soapbox anti-gun political message--whereas the book was NOTHING like that. The movie was basically a political soapbox masquarading as a basic courtroom-drama movie. Now, if that's the film the writers and producers want to make--so be it. It's their movie to make. But it doesn't fall within my preferences and as a result I think of it and refer to it as a political soapbox movie.",

   "My wife and I finally rented Brokeback Mountain last weekend.\n \n It was one of the best movies I've seen in my life.\n \n Very rarely have I been emotionally moved to the level that I was after watching it. The story and the way it's told are second to none. The scenery and backdrop to the movie are extraordinary (filmed in my backyard basically), the lead actors are all excellent, subtle and yet very powerful performances, and the directing of the picture is truely superb. Kudos to Ang Lee for letting the story tell itself, and setting the mood and atmospere of the picture so beautifully.\n \n This really is an amazing story of love and the human condition. If anyone can watch this movie and not be moved by the experiences of the characters, I'd question their humanity.\n \n I know that this film has been highly politicized, but at no time does it bludgeon or even lecture the audience on \"gay rights\". The sexual tension is touched on, and there are two brief homosexual scenes, but the viewer is certainly not pouned on the head by it, it's PG13 type stuff. It merely tells a story that is so well written and so real, that you can't help feel for the characters and their plight. There's no question that it left me deeply saddened, and angry/embarassed about the way our society has, and continues to treat, homosexuals. I was also saddened at the effects this had on the other victims in the story - the wives and children of the two men.\n \n Anyhoo, I just had to post something after actually watching the movie. Two thumbs up. It really is a movie that everyone should see IMHO, regardless of your position on homosexuality. The movie is far more than that.\n \n Waxy",
