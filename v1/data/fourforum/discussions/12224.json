   "Don't ask, don't tell. And, whatever you do, don't ask Elaine Donnelly to tell you what she thinks about gays in the military.\n \n The House Armed Services personnel subcommittee made just such a miscalculation yesterday. Holding the first hearing in 15 years on the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, lawmakers invited a quartet of veterans to testify on the subject and also extended an invitation to Donnelly, who has been working for years to protect our fighting forces from the malign influence of women.\n \n Donnelly treated the panel to an extraordinary exhibition of rage. She warned of \"transgenders in the military.\" She warned that lesbians would take pictures of people in the shower. She spoke ominously of gays spreading \"HIV positivity\" through the ranks.\n \n \"We're talking about real consequences for real people,\" Donnelly proclaimed. Her written statement added warnings about \"inappropriate passive/aggressive actions common in the homosexual community,\" the prospects of \"forcible sodomy\" and \"exotic forms of sexual expression,\" and the case of \"a group of black lesbians who decided to gang-assault\" a fellow soldier.\n \n At the witness table with Donnelly, retired Navy Capt. Joan Darrah, a lesbian, rolled her eyes in disbelief. Retired Marine Staff Sgt. Eric Alva, a gay man who was wounded in Iraq, looked as if he would explode. \n \n Inadvertently, Donnelly achieved the opposite of her intended effect. Though there's no expectation that Congress will repeal \"don't ask, don't tell\" and allow gays to serve openly in the military, the display had the effect of increasing bipartisan sympathy for the cause.\n \n Rep. Vic Snyder (D-Ark.) labeled her statement \"just bonkers\" and \"dumb,\" and he called her claims about an HIV menace \"inappropriate.\" Said Snyder: \"By this analysis . . . we ought to recruit only lesbians for the military, because they have the lowest incidence of HIV in the country.\"\n \n Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Pa.), a veteran of the war in Iraq, called Donnelly's words \"an insult to me and many of the soldiers\" by saying they \"aren't professional enough to serve openly with gay troops while successfully completing their military mission.\" \n \n ....\n Donnelly said something about her respect for the service of gay veterans. \"How do you respect their service?\" Shays demanded. \"You want them out.\"\n \n Donnelly seemed to have unified the lawmakers -- against her. The next questioner was Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.), a retired Navy vice admiral. \"I couldn't ask it better than you did,\" he told Shays. Dana Milbank - Sorry We Asked, Sorry You Told - washingtonpost.com\n This news article is older, but I just came across it and thought it noteworthy.\n \n I find it a little bit amusing cause I've across this mentality before. It's amazing in its reliance on fear of the gay unknown and lack of reflection on reality.\n If only we could get an honest reflection of other, similar anti-gay fears. Like gay marriage damaging straight marriage. Or like gay adoption somehow having a negative impact upon the child.\n \n Anti-gay fear hides in the shadows of ignorance, and it's refreshing to see it be brought to the light of day and exposed for the absurdity that it is...",
