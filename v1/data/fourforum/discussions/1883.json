   "i wanted to start a thread about how good the passion of the christ movie really was. and how i was really touched by it and it made me look my life over and try to live differently.\n \n im sick of all the people dissing on the movie because my whole entire family saw it and all my relatives the day it came out and not a single person had something negative to say about it.\n \n Mel Gibson is truly a great great person and i only applaud him for coming out with a movie like this. god worked through him which makes the movie even better.\n \n if you go to see the movie thinking about how this all really did happen to jesus and he died on the cross for our sins. can you imagine having to go through all that to forgive all the people of the world for there sins. i mean Jesus is incredible. you are all alive today because of him. of course it is your own choice what you do in life but you will pay for your wrongdoings in the end. kind of like karma what goes around comes around. \n \n the passion of the christ was AMAZING. all you christians should go see it and thank God that you are alive today and that he has given you a second home in heaven to where we are all looking forward to going.",

   "Have to agree. The portrayl was excellent, very realistic and moving. I'm sorry that they cut a couple of lines (\"Do you not know that I can ask my Father and he will send down 20 legions of angels . . . \" \"Surely this man was the Son of God\"). Other than that, it was great.",
