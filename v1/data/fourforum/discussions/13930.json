   "A BUZZFLASH COMMENTARY\n By Arthur Plum\n If someone flew an airplane into a building full of people to protest the Afghan war, it would be called a terrorist incident. However, when Mr. Joe Stack flew his plane into an IRS building and killed people, the news media calls it. \"the accident,\" and \"the incident.\" The local Texas prosecutor and even the White House claimed specifically that Mr. Stack was not a terrorist.\n \n But what should you call it when a man pens a manifesto proclaiming, \"violence is the only answer,\" then kills people because they work for the government? Mr. Stack's wife apologized on the news to \"everyone affected by the incident,\" but was careful not to use the term \"victim,\" when referring to the people her husband murdered.\n \n Regardless of the media's politically correct posturing, the simple fact is this: Joe Stack was a suicide bomber, a domestic terrorist. Even though his name was Joe, and not Mohammed, and even though he was protesting taxes, not Israeli foreign policy, Mr. Stack was, a murderer of the innocent.\n\n When is a \"Terrorist\" Not a \"Terrorist\"? When He&#039;s a White Texan and Not an Arab. Joe Stack. | BuzzFlash.org\n \n I think the TeaBaggers need to cool down the violent rhetoric.",

   "Burden of proof fallacy.\n\n \n You're confused. Read what Dr. Ron Smothermon says about Truth in his book, \"Winning through Enlightenment\". \n \n \n Argumentum ad ignorantiam (argument to ignorance). This is the fallacy of assuming something is true simply because it hasn't been proven false. For example, someone might argue that global warming is certainly occurring because nobody has demonstrated conclusively that it is not. But failing to prove the global warming theory false is not the same as proving it true. \n \n \n According to Dr. Ron Smothermon, author of \"Winning through Enlightenment\", \" ....there is this thing called truth (what is) , and then there are the judgements of your mind (what's not). Judgements are never truth. If you're in the process of dealing with truth, judgements are not necessary. Judgements, you see, are substitutes for what is when you do not care to deal with what is..\n If something is true it just is, and it doesn't even care if you notice it or not. The universal laws that run the universe and life within it have not been placed into being by judgements of the mind. They just are, and when you are awake and attentive they present themselves to you and you notice them. You don't have to figure them out. In fact, you can't figure them out.\n To get what I'm telling you here, you must begin to appreciate the fact that you are not your mind. You contain a mind which is available for observation when you are willing to be conscious. You are infinitely more than your mind. If you don't get this point you can become stuck in the pride which is attached to your judgements; you will develop a belief that you are your judgements and you will not have observership of your mind and the judgements that it contains. \"\n \n \"A polarity of definition (or debate) is an invention of the mind for the purpose of being right. To be right about something, the mind needs a subject to be right about and someone to be in the role of being wrong.\n Therefore the mind picks a convenient person and a convenient issue and defines a polarity. This is accomplished by defining the sides of an issue, then determining one side to be right and the other side to be wrong. Of course the mind decides to advocate the \"right\" side.\n \n Polarities are the stuff out of which prejudice, opinion, position, and judgement are made, and the process of polarization is the foundation of all evil. Polarization closes all avenues through which human beings can communicate. It closes all avenues through which we can have compassion with and nurture each other (flying in the face of the objections to charity and taxation to help those in need, btw). You, ultimately wind up as the source of your own persecution.\"\n \n All that to say that debate doesn't discover or expose truth....debate is about justifying one's position as \"right\", at the expense of making others \"wrong\".",

However the question at the beginning appears to be when someone can be considered a true terrorist for carrying out these actions. Somewhere along the line it appears to have been suggested that someone can't be a terrorist unless they're a conservative. This is a highly flawed and incorrect position to be taking and irrelevant to the beginning topic.",
