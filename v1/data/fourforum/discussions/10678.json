   "There seems to be a new tactic amongst Creationists, which is getting themselves employed as scientists, being fired for being unable to do a good job, then suing the employer for infringing their freedom of religious belief:\n \n Biologist fired for beliefs, suit says\n \n \nThe battle between science and creationism has reached the prestigious Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where a former researcher is claiming he was fired because he doesn't believe in evolution.\n more stories like this\n \n Nathaniel Abraham filed a lawsuit earlier this week in US District Court in Boston saying that the Cape Cod research center dismissed him in 2004 because of his Christian belief that the Bible presents a true account of human creation.\n \n Abraham, who is seeking $500,000 in compensation for a violation of his civil rights, says in the suit that he lost his job as a postdoctoral researcher in a biology lab shortly after he told his superior that he did not accept evolution as scientific fact.\n\n \n Now, as the article goes on to explain, this post-doc applied for a research position that explicitly involved applying evolutionary theory to a biological question. There is no way he could not have known what the research involved. He basically refused to do the research appropriately.\n \n And this is not the first such case, where Creationists attempt to justify their participation in a scientific field whose basic tenets they cannot accept, and who cannot work within the rules of science.\n \n If you do not accept evolution as a fact and theory, then it's hard to imagine why you would think you have any scientific contribution to make to the subject. I think this is a new wedge in the making.",

You don't necessarily have to believe that any particular mechanistic theory of how evolution happened is pertinent to your system, but you have to accept the principle that gene pools change with time, often in response to environmental pressures through natural selection, and they change the properties of species.\n \n If you believe that species are fixed entities with immutable essences (e.g. biblical kinds or baramin), then you can't study evolutionary biology, or explain why that species came to look as it does, with the relatives it has.
