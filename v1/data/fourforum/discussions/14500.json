   "Why no Libertopia?\n \n I guess you know how I feel about the baffling (il)logic of the Libertaryan word salads? With the Scientologist-like circular reasoning & the Grand Old Ideologies? The fact that they have no plan & no solutions that are, in any way connected to present day reality? How it's all just mental masturbation only leading to further inertia? \n \n Oddly enough the Libertaryian rhetoric & soundbites often remind me a little of the Hippyspeak slogans. I'm not old enough to give first hand accounts from that time however I've read about & spoken to people from that era. Personally, I prefer the Beat generation, but that's just me. \n \n The hippies formed communes which gave them the opportunity to 'put your money where your mouth is' so to speak. They chose to demonstrate their ideology. Another slogan from the time was, 'Never trust anyone over 30.' Many of them demonstrated this too by becoming more & more untrustworthy as they got older. \n \n I continue to see the Libertaryian ideology & movement as re-packaged conservatism. I continue to see no plan. \n \n Why no \"Libertopian\" communes or collectives or whatever you would choose to call'em?\n \n Now I know you may want to point out groups like the Freemen & others from the Militia Movement, but how did those scenarios play out (in reality)? \n \n \nAll forms of organized government are illegitimate and have no right to collect taxes or even require auto tags; they could defy foreclosure actions; issue arrest warrants and hold trials of government officials; they could act as their own central bank and defraud the government, financial institutions and merchants.\n Strange saga of 'freemen'\n\n \n Another view on Libertaryanism:\n Libertarianism Makes You Stupid\n \n Again, Why no Libertopias?",

   "bitheway Floger - I thought of you today while I was reading this book, re-framing the question about being a 'legitimate' Conservative:\n \n \n\"... These are the facts. But even though as facts they are widely recognized & acted on in practice, our political discourse has its own rituals & does not yet admit them. Indeed few politicians in either party have yet publicly divorced themselves for the Reagan revolution, in particular from the idea of the free market. Politicians notoriously say what is convenient & act along different lines entirely, causing problems for those who write about their views in a careful & serious way. But perhaps on no other issue is this tendency more pronounced in matters relating to the markets - a word one apparently cannot use in public in the United States without bending a knee & making the sign of the cross.\n \n & here the political world is divided into two groups. There are those who praise the free market because to do so gives cover to themselves & their friends in raiding the public trough. These people call themselves \"conservatives,\" & one of the truly galling things for real conservatives is that they have both usurped the label & spoiled the reputation of the real thing. & there are those who praise the \"free market\" simply because they fear that, otherwise, they will be exposed as heretics, accused of being socialists, perhaps even driven from public life. This is the case of many liberals. Reflexive invocations of the power of markets, the \"magic\" of markets, & the virtues of a \"free enterprise system\" therefore remain staples of political speech on both sides of the political aisle. However, they have been emptied of practical content, & the speakers know it.\n \n Yet this is not another book about the insincerity of the group of conservative impostors in power; that case has been sufficiently made, & I have already delivered my own views on George Bush, Dick Cheney, & Alan Greenspan in another book.* This book is mainly about the rise & fall of authentically conservative ideas, about the inadequacy of their central metaphor, the free market. My purpose is not to denigrate those who took up the conservative cause a generation ago; many have become my friends & I respect them. My plan here is to take the conservative project seriously, on the premise that it was offered in good faith. The principled conservatives were, in my view, na\u00efve; I obviously believe they were wrong, & they have been abandoned by history, but none of this proves they were dishonest. & if some were really were cranks & charlatans, they had plenty of company among the most respectable & prestigious academic economists of the land.\"\n \n *Unbearable Cost: Bush, Greenspan & the Economics of Empire\n \n -James K.

Being an island Great Britain had to be a commercial power while at the same time being as self-sufficient as possible in foodstuffs. Britain had to have foreign trade to get the natural resources that are not found in the British Isles while at the same time having to produce enough food to survive times when foreign trade was not available (mainly times of war).\n \n The U.S. has always had more natural resources than the British Isles, but this country began as the only major republic in a world filled with kings- all of whom were or were potentially hostile toward the U.S. The U.S. was willing to engage in foreign trade when possible, but Hamilton realized that the U.S. was had to become a major industrial power in order to survive.

   "Originally Posted by mata \n Aiming for a stable, functional & self-sustaining society is a good place to start. \n \n A few clarifications? Just to make sure we're on the same page? \n \n Stable is somewhat of an illusion. Nothing remains the same. Aiming for stability makes sense. Being able & willing to adapt to changing conditions is how. \n\n \n \nThe instability that has most bothered me within my lifetime has not been the result of organic change, but rather intentional change brought about because certain people chose to disrupt society: the sexual revolution; no-fault divorce; women's liberation; the drug culture; the Great Society welfare programs and the massive continuation of urban sprawl (which began at the end of World War II).\n\n \n & that is why I use this definition for conservative: \n \nFor example, people with something to lose tend toward conservative choices politically as well as economically. Nothing wrong with that necessarily. Just an observation about the influence of Loss Aversion heuristic on actual decision making. We are more apt to endure the status quo, even as it slowly deteriorates, than we are to call for \"radical\" change. Regrettably, however, when the call for change comes, it often requires a far greater upheaval to make the necessary transformations, or, on occasion, the situation has deteriorated beyond the point of no return. In those situations we find ourselves wondering why we waited so long before doing something.\n \n \n I've been called a pragmatic anarchist (as well as a few less desirable names as you are well aware). The human condition requires us to live from moment to moment. The past becomes the present, the present becomes the future. We live in the present. Sadly or not, we remain unable to turn back the clock to the past & live there. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by mata\n Functional can be in the eye of the beholder. There are some who apparently still think the financial sector & other parts of society are functioning just fine. This brings up the question - who shall benefit from society? Can we clarify that one a bit more?\n \n \n \nIt is wrong to assume that everyone will always benefit from society or that society's benefits will always be evenly distributed among society's members. So it is wrong to make changes just on the grounds of trying to make society equitable. A functional society does not exist when its members are not willing to sacrifice for the common good.\n\n \n & it's just as mistaken to assume we have the choice between a perfect  solution to a particular problem & one that is, however imperfect, based in reality. Also known as the Nirvana fallacy:\n \n \nThe Nirvana fallacy is the logical error of comparing actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. It can also refer to the tendency to assume that there is a perfect solution to a particular problem.\n \n Example: \"If we go on the Highway 95 at four in the morning we will get to our destination exactly on time because there will be NO traffic whatsoever.\"\n \n By creating a false dichotomy that presents one choice which is obviously advantageous-while at the same time being completely implausible-a person using the nirvana fallacy can attack any opposing idea because it is imperfect. The choice is not between real world solutions and utopia; it is, rather, a choice between one realistic possibility and another which is merely better.\n\n \n \nThen what would you take self-sustaining as being? To me it means that each generation leaves a society that was at least as good as the society it inherited. No generation has a right to create problems that the next generation will have to deal with.\n\n \n I agree people living in the present are called upon to solve problems. It would be really really nice not to create new problems or perpetuate existing problems for the next or seventh generation. \n \n What do you want?",

   "& that is why I use this definition for conservative:\n\n \n Your view of conservatism, where there is no change for the sake of loss prevention, only works when you have something still left to lose. No-change conservatism works only when you have a society that can be salvaged and is worth being salvaged. American society is already past the point where the status quo is worth keeping.

How do you know that ending welfare for people with illegitimate children won't reduce the illegitimacy rate? How do you know that eliminating no-fault divorce won't reduce the divorce rate?

No solution is worthwhile if it just creates yet another problem. We know what has worked in the past, so the past is where we should look for solutions for the present. We know that the family unit consisting of one man, his wife and their children with a full-time mother is the best possible setting for producing and rearing children. We know that hard work and thrift are the best way to gain wealth. We know that respecting the past and hoping for the future is the best way to live in the present.\n \n The changes I support as a conservative will create situations that history tells us work.

We didn't have as many people on welfare back when we didn't have sex outside of marriage or no-fault divorce. Neither did we have as many school truants or juvenile delinquents.\n \n \nThe belief there ARE nirvanic solutions to a particular problem IS the problem. & the need for immediate gratification to problems that have been growing for years & years is one of the reasons people continue to offer these types of imaginary solutions. Is it a con job or simply more of the same o lame o mental masturbation? \n\n \n And the people who are always out for immediate gratification are liberals and libertarians. Conservatives always look to the future when deciding what to do in the present. A conservative won't take action in the present if it will disrupt the future no matter how good that action may feel.",

   "Saying that I don't trust the American People to make their own laws is a bit of a stretch. Like the Founding Fathers, who created a republic rather than a democracy, I don't trust all of the people to make their own laws. There are certain demographic groups in the U.S. population that shouldn't have any say in making laws: criminals; welfare recipients; teenagers; lunatics and anyone who cannot read and write.\n \n Taken as a whole the people cannot be trusted to govern themselves or govern the nation in the nation's best long-term interest- thus we have the moral decay and debt that we are now beset with. But this does not mean that everyone in society is unfit to govern society.\nSo only some people should run the government? Basically we should run the lives of other people because you think some people are elite and know what is best for the others? Hmmm, that's not really a republic or a democracy.\n \n \nHow so? If the government had done a better job at regulating the crooks, who were running Enron, how could those crooks have flourished? \nOr if we just had the companies be non-profit you'd never have that either. We could make everyones salary the same set by the government.\n \n Truth is, you can't regulate it and the government will never do a \"better job\" are regulating anything. After 200+ years of failure you'd think we would get the hint. \n \n \nThen what have you ever done for a living? Why do you insist on being insufferably insulting just because you can?\nI'm not insulting anyone, just asking if the tutoring is what you are referring to. Perhaps you ran a lemonade stand as well...i dunno!\n \n \nThe bank is less likely to put depositors' money at risk by making bad loans- as was demonstrated for 70 years following Glass-Steagall.\nYeah, we had no banking problems during those 70 years...Not to mention Glass-Steagall wouldn't have prevented any of this. \n \n \nOn the other hand a lack of government regulation and oversight, like we had under Regan, allowed one merger after another which reduced consumer choice in the banking industry during the 1990s. \nSo are response is to create regulation and oversight so we have one merger after another which reduces consumer choice in the banking industry? \n \n \nI don't how or why it has happened, but over the past half-dozen years or so my part of Florida has actually reversed the banking trend and several new banking companies have entered the market; we have more banks (and credit unions) to choose from now than we did 15-30 years ago. So whatever barriers to entry you think exist are not at work here anymore.\nWell the law passed only last week so perhaps you should give it some time. Nevertheless, the number of banks has gone down since 1985 because it wasn't just this bill. It has dropped 29% from 1994-2003. \n \n \nI want you to document that this new regulation is responsible for loss of companies in the accounting industry.\nok...\n \n Number of big CPA firms prior to Enron = 5\n Number of big CPA firms after Enron = 4\n Number of big CPA firms created since = 0\n \n Google search CPA firms Big 4\n \n \nYou are the one making the claim. I am not going to do the research needed to support your claim. If there is something specific you want me to look at, post it here.\nSure thing boss:\n \n Google",

   "I would prefer conscious decisions to ones made without any forethought. But I am complaining about the conscious decisions, that I keep bringing up, because they were either made without any regard to their long-term effects on society or made with the express intention of disrupting society.\n\n \n Please provide examples of the decisions made with the express intention of disrupting society & more importantly provide solutions (hopefully not involving fantasy or time travel).\n \n Your Conservative Deity, Ronald Reagan, orchestrated the Savings & Loan scandal & crisis. What did he say after signing the legislation? We hit the jackpot! (or something like that). Is this an example of considering long-term effects? Fool the American people once, continue to fool them with MORE deregulation sprees, culminating in the complete dismantling of common sense regulations like Glass Steagell in 1999. Ensuring moral hazards galore! This created the casino like atmosphere on Wall Street. Playing the casino with other people's money? (Is that what Ronald Reagan meant?) If they win, they run, if they lose, the government bails them out. \n \n Remind me again who hit the jackpot?\n \n \n\"Moral Hazard\" \n The deregulation of S&Ls gave them many of the capabilities of banks, without the same regulations as banks. Savings and loan associations could choose to be under either a state or a federal charter. Immediately after deregulation of the federally chartered thrifts, state-chartered thrifts rushed to become federally chartered, because of the advantages associated with a federal charter. In response, states such as California and Texas changed their regulations so to be similar to federal regulations. \n \n More important, however, was the \"moral hazard\" of insuring already troubled institutions with public dollars. In the view of a Savings and Loan president or manager, the trend line was fatal over the long haul, thus to get liquid, the institution had to take on riskier assets, particularly land. When the real estate market crashed, the S&Ls went with it. The concept of \"moral hazard\" involves creating the very behavior one seeks to prevent: by insuring the risk, the government guaranteed that desperate S&L owners and managers would engage in ever more risky investments, knowing that if they were successful, the institution would be saved, and if unsuccessful, their depositors would still be bailed out by Uncle Sam.\n Savings and loan crisis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia t_of_1986\n",

   "If these hippy communes were so great, how many of them are still around?\n \n All these communes managed to do is demonstrate that liberalism/libertarianism does not work in the real world because of human nature- that conservatives since time immemorial have been warning you about. Human nature is always stronger than liberal/libertarian idealism. Without the regulatory breaks of religion/society/government human nature will insure that humans will always destroy each other.\n\n \n I agree when you say that human nature is always stronger than ... (replace with whatever ism, osm, ology, etc.). \n \n Although I don't agree with your reasoning re: human nature. Human nature continues to evolve. You have focused on the one element of human nature you describe being \"humans will always destroy each other\". We have survived at least a few million years, have we not? Perhaps there is more at play here? \n \n Compared to many other species, human beings are weak & physically fragile. We haven't developed fangs to fight predators or the combination of fangs & speed required to chase down prey. We haven't developed fur or thick protective skins to shield us from extremes in the environment. \n \n What we have developed are cultures, communities & societies which rely on critical thinking, communication skills, the sciences, medicine, technology, the arts, etc. to adapt to the ever-changing environment. All of these skills, traits, etc. are reflected by an evolving human nature. The art of medicine grows with knowledge. The art of science advances with discovery. Improved technologies replace the old. Products become better with improved design. Empires, countries, entire civilizations go through periods of renaissance & decay & sometimes even vanish completely. All of these things combined have resulted in our continued existence here. \n \n All of these 'adaptations' have assisted us in our ability to protect ourselves, adapt to an ever-changing environment, & increased our ability to pass on these survival strategies to the next generation & the next & the next & so on.\n \n How would you define human nature? Or Humanity?\n \n I like Desmond Tutu's definition. I've included the whole introduction, however I've highlighted the part that especially speaks to the point I'm trying to make (apparently falling on dead or banned ears): \n \n \n\"If I diminish you, I diminish myself.\"\n \n In my country & tradition the highest praise that can be given to someone is, \"Yu, u nobunto,\" an acknowledgement that he or she has this wonderful quality: ubunto. It is a reference to their actions toward their fellow human beings, it has to do with how they regard people & how they see themselves within their intimate relationships, their familial relationships, & within the broader community. Ubunto addresses a central tenet of African philosophy, the essence of what it is to be human. \n \n The definition of this concept has two parts. The first is that the person is friendly, hospitable, generous, gentle, caring & compassionate. In other words, someone who will use their strengths on behalf of others - the weak & the poor & the ill - & not take advantage of anyone. This person treats others as he or she would be treated. & because of this they express the second part of the concept, which concerns openness, large-heartedness. They share their worth. In doing so my humanity is recognized & becomes inextricably bound to theirs. \n \n People with ubunto are approachable & welcoming: their attitude is kindly & well-disposed: they are not threatened by the goodness in others because their own esteem & self-worth is generated by knowing they belong to a greater whole. To recast the Cartesian proposition \"I think therefore I am,\" ubunto would phrase it, \"I am human because I belong.\" Put another way, \"a person is a person through other people,\" a concept perfectly captured by the phrase \"me we.\" No one comes into the world fully formed. We would not know how to think or walk or speak or behave unless we learned it from our fellow human beings. We need other human beings in order to be human. The solitary, isolated human being is a contradiction in terms. \n \n Because we need one another, our natural tendency is to be cooperative & helpful. If this were not true we would have died out as a species long ago, consumed by our violence & hate. But we haven't. We have kept on despite the evil & the wars that have brought so much suffering & misery down the centuries. We have kept on because we strive for harmony & community, a community not only of the living but also one that honors our forbears. This link to the past gives us a sense of continuity, a sense that we have created & create societies that are meant to be for the greater good & try to overcome anything that subverts our purpose. Our wars end; we seek to heal. \n \n But anger, resentment, a lust for revenge, greed, even the aggressive competitiveness that rules so much of our contemporary world, corrodes & jeopardizes our harmony. Ubunto points out that those who seek to destroy & dehumanize are also victims - victims, usually, of a pervading ethos, be it a political ideology, an economic system, or a distorted religious conviction. Consequently, they are as much dehumanized as those on whom they trample. \n \n Never was this more obvious than during the apartheid years in South Africa. All humanity is interlinked. Thus, the humanity of the perpetrators of apartheid was inexorably bound to that of their victims. When they dehumanized another by inflicting suffering & harm, they dehumanized themselves. In fact I said at the time that the oppressor was dehumanized as much as, if not more than, those oppressed. How else could you interpret the words of the minister of police, Jimmy Kruger, on hearing of the death of Black Consciousness leader, Steve Biko, in prison. Of his tortured & painful killing, Kruger said, \"it leaves me cold.\" You have to ask what happened to the humanity - the ubunto - of someone who could speak so callously about the suffering & death of a fellow human being. \n \n It was equally clear that recovering from this situation would require a magnanimousness on the part of the victims if there was to be a future. The end of apartheid, I know, would put ubunto to the test. Yet I never doubted its power of reconciliation. In fact I often recalled the words of a man called Malusi Mpumlwana, an associate of Biko's, who, even while he was being tortured by the security police, looked at his torturers & realized that these were human beings too & that they needed him \"to help them recover the humanity they [were] losing.\" \n \n This is the essence of ubunto, or \"me we,\" & in this are reflected vividly the life & actions of Mother Teresa. Her entire being was focused on bringing some dignity & compassion into the lives of the destitute & afflicted. In a world that is hard & cynical, she showed that great things can be achieved wherever there is great love, not only among the desperate of Calcutta but throughout the world. \n \n The ubunto of Mother Teresa showed that the only way we can ever be human is together. The only way we can be free is together. \n \n -The Most Reverend Desmond M. Tutu, OMSG DD FKC \n Anglican Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town \n Introduction to The Words & Inspiration of Mother Teresa - LOVE \n\n \n My dear Floger? I see your premature cynicism as being nothing more than demonstrating a lazy pessimism. Probably the worst thing is its impotence. \n \n That, & it's no longer even particularly funny.\n \n (Thanks for reading - I just had to get this off my chest.)",

   "I believe the OP was asking the question if a group of people believe they can engineer a better society than the one they are in why do they not try it.\n \n The point is made that neo-marxist in America did try it for a time.\n \n There are four important differences between neo-marxist and libertarians that are responsible for this difference in outcome.\n \n 1. Libertarians in general view technology and wealth as positives, while the neo-marxist were seeking an agrarian society based around 'community' as opposed to progress and productivity.\n \n This means that where adopting an economy only large enough to survive via farming and light craftsmanship is a positive for a neo-marxist it is a big negative for a libertarian.\n \n 2. The neo-marxist were living in a society of capitalist tradition and practice, to them they were the outcasts living in a society of capitalist, however; for a libertarian the tradition of individual rights means they likely view the current societies de facto as correct and their enemies as insurgent radicals.\n \n The actual situation is far closer to the opposite, marxist principles underlie most of government action and have for a while. The only thing libertarian about American society is it's tradition and history.\n \n Yet that is the perception and it means that the ultimate libertarian goal would be to 'take back' society as opposed to forming a new one because the current one is so rotten it cannot be saved.\n \n This can be observed in the constitution worship, and conservative cross ties.\n \n 3. Ties in with #2 but it a distinct point. Libertarians tend (at least more than American neo-marxist) to reject the 'you go your way I go mine' on the societal level. The concept of individual rights already integrates the freedom proper to a person that such an attitude refers to in an individual.\n \n Neo-marxist on the other hand treat societies as the units of mankind, to them 'you go your way I go mine' means 'your society goes your way my society goes mine', to a libertarian it means 'you as an individual go your way I as an individual go mine'.\n \n The same act of defiance that is expressed when a hippie forms a commune is carried out when a libertarian moves to a state with lower taxes or engages in debate.\n \n In other words they support the concept of society but do not see how more separate societies are necessarily better.\n \n 4. ties in with #1 but is distinct. A libertarians favorite objection to living in normal society would be the violations of individual rights that occur, mainly through the medium of taxation and regulation.\n \n A neo-marxist primary objection to living in normal society would be the capitalist temptations to greed and materialism.\n \n This is important because moving to the boonies with your pals will remove you from capitalist temptations but not from taxes and regulations. (de jure if not de facto).\n \n All that being said though I believe if someone somewhere was able to establish a viable capitalist society distinct from the oppression that characterizes most of the worlds governments it would attract a great amount of immigration pressure from libertarians.",

   "I believe the OP was asking the question if a group of people believe they can engineer a better society than the one they are in why do they not try it.\n\n \n The OP was an attempt, albeit a feeble one, to express my frustration & impatience at the fantasy &/or faith based ideology of present day Libertaryans, who, imho, are little more than Conservatives in drag. They offer no pragmatic solutions to real problems, the ideology seeks to legitimize or justify the status quo - & voila same o lame o conservatism! How unusual! How creative! How original! & wo ho ho all those practical solutions! (I'm feeling nauseous right about now.) \n \n \nThe point is made that neo-marxist in America did try it for a time.\n\n \n You are making this point? How about not playing devil's advocate for a change? How about having the courage to challenge your own bloody clich\u00e9s? \n \n \nThere are four important differences between neo-marxist and libertarians that are responsible for this difference in outcome.\n \n 1. Libertarians in general view technology and wealth as positives, while the neo-marxist were seeking an agrarian society based around 'community' as opposed to progress and productivity.\n \n This means that where adopting an economy only large enough to survive via farming and light craftsmanship is a positive for a neo-marxist it is a big negative for a libertarian.\n \n 2. The neo-marxist were living in a society of capitalist tradition and practice, to them they were the outcasts living in a society of capitalist, however; for a libertarian the tradition of individual rights means they likely view the current societies de facto as correct and their enemies as insurgent radicals.\n \n The actual situation is far closer to the opposite, marxist principles underlie most of government action and have for a while. The only thing libertarian about American society is it's tradition and history.\n \n Yet that is the perception and it means that the ultimate libertarian goal would be to 'take back' society as opposed to forming a new one because the current one is so rotten it cannot be saved.\n \n This can be observed in the constitution worship, and conservative cross ties.\n \n 3. Ties in with #2 but it a distinct point. Libertarians tend (at least more than American neo-marxist) to reject the 'you go your way I go mine' on the societal level. The concept of individual rights already integrates the freedom proper to a person that such an attitude refers to in an individual.\n \n Neo-marxist on the other hand treat societies as the units of mankind, to them 'you go your way I go mine' means 'your society goes your way my society goes mine', to a libertarian it means 'you as an individual go your way I as an individual go mine'.\n \n The same act of defiance that is expressed when a hippie forms a commune is carried out when a libertarian moves to a state with lower taxes or engages in debate.\n \n In other words they support the concept of society but do not see how more separate societies are necessarily better.\n \n 4. ties in with #1 but is distinct. A libertarians favorite objection to living in normal society would be the violations of individual rights that occur, mainly through the medium of taxation and regulation.\n \n A neo-marxist primary objection to living in normal society would be the capitalist temptations to greed and materialism.\n \n This is important because moving to the boonies with your pals will remove you from capitalist temptations but not from taxes and regulations. (de jure if not de facto).\n \n All that being said though I believe if someone somewhere was able to establish a viable capitalist society distinct from the oppression that characterizes most of the worlds governments it would attract a great amount of immigration pressure from libertarians.\n\n \n These are the same o lame o robotic sophistries aimed at armies of ideological automatons & how bloody surprising? These kinds of robotic responses are one of the reasons why stubbornness is often mistaken for stupidity.\n \n There are some who remain unmoved by your religion. Political Scientology for automatons is quite pathetic. Its 'sin' is its uselessness.",

   "These are 2 pieces which are probably better suited for another thread although I think they're useful here too:\n \n \nThe Arbitrary Ape\n 22 August 1998, From New Scientist Print Edition, Dylan Evans, London \n \n We all have something of the Greek god in us. Proteus to be precise, who outwitted his enemies by constantly changing his shape. Humans may not go as far as transmogrification but when it comes to confusing a rival, our talent for erratic behaviour is second to none.\n \n A rabbit pursued by a fox will bob and weave in a chaotic zigzag, rather than make a beeline for cover. Other animals use different forms of random behaviour to evade predators or catch their prey. But humans are the only ones who rely on unpredictability as a weapon in competition against each other, whether it be in a game of football or in international diplomacy\n \n ... According to the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis, creativity is a spin-off from social intelligence alone. The idea is that our ancestors first evolved to cope with savannah life, then learnt to exploit their environment using tools, and finally perfected the art of social living. It was only then that creativity really took off. But until now, nobody has come up with a plausible explanation of how this might have happened. Miller's theory could have the answer by showing how proteanism evolved in the social setting, and then making the link between randomness and creativity.\n \n Evolutionary theorists have tended to see evolutionary adaptation as a process that increases order and complexity. Natural selection was thought to build improbable regularities from random disorder. Protean behaviour defies this simple view-it is at once random and adaptive, chaotic and yet the result of selection. No wonder it took biologists so long to see it.\n \n Sign in to read: The arbitrary ape - 22 August 1998 - New Scientist\n\n \n \nThe Blessings of Chaos\n \n How does our DNA inspire such indeterminacy? After all, Middlemarch had an author; she deliberately crafted an ambiguous ending. But real life doesn't have an intelligent designer. In order to create the wiggle room necessary for individual freedom, natural selection came up with an ingenious, if unnerving, solution. Although we like to imagine life as a perfectly engineered creation (our cells like little Swiss clocks), the truth is that our parts aren't predictable. Bob Dylan once said, \"I accept chaos, I'm not sure whether it accepts me.\" Molecular biology, confronted with the unruliness of life, is also forced to accept chaos. Just as physics discovered the indeterminate quantum world - a discovery that erased classical notions about the fixed reality of time & space - so biology is uncovering the unknowable mess at its core. Life is built on an edifice of randomness.\n \n One of the first insights into the natural disorder of life arrived in 1968, when Motoo Kimura, the great Japanese geneticist, introduced evolutionary biology to his \"neutral theory of molecular evolution.\" This is a staid name for what many scientists consider the most interesting revision of evolutionary theory since Darwin. Kimura's discovery began with a paradox. Starting in the early 1960's, biologists could finally measure the rate of genetic change in species undergoing natural selection. As expected, the engine of evolution was random mutation: double helices suffered from a constant barrage of editing errors. Buried in this data, however, was an uncomfortable new fact: DNA changes way too much. According to Kimura's calculations, the average genome was changing at a hundred times the rate predicted by the equation of evolution. In fact, DNA was changing so much that there was no possible way natural selection could account for all of these so-called adaptations.\n \n But if natural selection wasn't driving the evolution of our genes, then what was? Kimura's answer was simple: chaos. Pure chance. The dice of mutation & the poker of genetic drift. At the level of our DNA, evolution works mostly by accident. Your genome is a record of random mistakes.\n \n But perhaps that randomness is confined to our DNA. The clock-like cell must restore some sense of order, right? Certainly the translation of our genome - the expression of our actual genes - is a perfectly regulated process, with no hint of disarray. How else could we function? Although molecular biology used to assume that was the case, it isn't. Life is slipshod. Inside our cells, shards & scraps of nucleic acid & protein float around aimlessly, waiting to interact. There is no guiding hand, no guarantee of exactness.\n \n In a 2002 Science paper entitled, Stochastic Gene Expression is a Single Cell, Michael Elowitz of Caltech demonstrated that biological \"noise\" (a scientific synonym for chaos) is inherent in gene expression. ...\" \n - Jonah Lehrer, Proust was a Neuroscientist \n\n \n For lack of a better way to describe: there are some who seem to discount, or fail to demonstrate the level of respect deserved for creativite, original & critical thought, even chaos. Apparently they would prefer people becoming machines, robots or automatons. It makes me sick & tired, impatient & frustrated. & laughter is every bit as honorable as tears.\n \n \nProgress is nothing but the victory of laughter over dogma.\n -Benjamin DeCasseres \n",

They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness. \n\n It sounds like some form of beautified poem to subjectivism to me :p\n \n The only actual postulate I was able to glean from this section was: \"Ideology is a function of people's lives\".",

How it's all just mental masturbation only leading to further inertia? \n \n Oddly enough the Libertaryian rhetoric & soundbites often remind me a little of the Hippyspeak slogans. I'm not old enough to give first hand accounts from that time however I've read about & spoken to people from that era. Personally, I prefer the Beat generation, but that's just me. \n \n The hippies formed communes which gave them the opportunity to 'put your money where your mouth is' so to speak. They chose to demonstrate their ideology. Another slogan from the time was, 'Never trust anyone over 30.' Many of them demonstrated this too by becoming more & more untrustworthy as they got older. \n \n I continue to see the Libertaryian ideology & movement as re-packaged conservatism. I continue to see no plan. \n \n Why no \"Libertopian\" communes or collectives or whatever you would choose to call'em?\n \n Now I know you may want to point out groups like the Freemen & others from the Militia Movement, but how did those scenarios play out (in reality)? \n \n \n \n Another view on Libertaryanism:\n Libertarianism Makes You Stupid\n \n Again, Why no Libertopias?\n\n \n I like how Benjamin Franklin said: \"Vision without implementation is hallucination\" & I think the shoe fits with the present day Libertaryian movement.

It's use was intended as a metaphor for the peaceful cooperation that trade encourages, not as a claim that there was an actual hand directing affairs.\n\n \n Sigh. & yup I do realize the invisible hand is being used as a metaphor. Maybe this is a bit quirky on my part but I think the interpretation of this metaphor has much to do with how we got to changing our de facto motto in the United States from E pluribus unum to adopting In God We Trust as the official motto in 1956. \n \n Cementing the faith based economics ploy used in the present day. \n \n How's that working out? \n \n \nIn economics, the invisible hand, also known as the invisible hand of the market, is the term economists use to describe the self-regulating nature of the marketplace.[1] This is a metaphor first coined by the economist Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and used a total of three times in his writings. For Smith, the invisible hand was created by the conjunction of the forces of self-interest, competition, and supply and demand, which he noted as being capable of allocating resources in society.[2] This is the founding justification for the laissez-faire economic philosophy.[2]\n \n ...Since Smith's time, the principle of the invisible hand has been further incorporated into economic theory. Leon Walras developed a four-equation general equilibrium model that concludes that individual self-interest operating in a competitive market place produces the unique conditions under which a society's total utility is maximized. Vilfredo Pareto used an edgeworth box contact line to illustrate a similar social optimality.\n \n Ludwig von Mises, in Human Action (see note 3 at the bottom), claims that Smith believed that the invisible hand was that of God. He did not mean this as a criticism, since he held that secular reasoning leads to similar conclusions. (Hi Freedom emoticon_xbye)\n \n The invisible hand is traditionally understood as a concept in economics, but Robert Nozick argues in Anarchy, State and Utopia that substantively the same concept exists in a number of other areas of academic discourse under different names, notably Darwinian natural selection. In turn, Daniel Dennett argues in Darwin's Dangerous Idea that this represents a \"universal acid\" that may be applied to a number of seemingly disparate areas of philosophical inquiry (consciousness and free will in particular). See also Social Darwinism.\n \n Christian socialist R. H. Tawney saw Smith as putting a name on an older idea:\n If preachers have not yet overtly identified themselves with the view of the natural man, expressed by an eighteenth-century writer in the words, trade is one thing and religion is another, they imply a not very different conclusion by their silence as to the possibility of collisions between them. The characteristic doctrine was one, in fact, which left little room for religious teaching as to economic morality, because it anticipated the theory, later epitomized by Adam Smith in his famous reference to the invisible hand, which saw in economic self-interest the operation of a providential plan... The existing order, except insofar as the short-sighted enactments of Governments interfered with it, was the natural order, and the order established by nature was the order established by God. Most educated men, in the middle of the [eighteenth] century, would have found their philosophy expressed in the lines of Pope:\n \n Thus God and Nature formed the general frame,\n And bade self-love and social be the same.\n \n Naturally, again, such an attitude precluded a critical examination of institutions, and left as the sphere of Christian charity only those parts of life that could be reserved for philanthropy, precisely because they fell outside that larger area of normal human relations, in which the promptings of self-interest provided an all-sufficient motive and rule of conduct. (Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, page 195.)\n Invisible hand - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n \n Of course, my favorite interpretation is that of Joseph E. Stiglitz. Reality based on present day observation/analysis of events:\n \n \nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, says: \"the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"[9][10] Stiglitz explains his position:\n \n Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, is often cited as arguing for the \"invisible hand\" and free markets: firms, in the pursuit of profits, are led, as if by an invisible hand, to do what is best for the world. But unlike his followers, Adam Smith was aware of some of the limitations of free markets, and research since then has further clarified why free markets, by themselves, often do not lead to what is best. As I put it in my new book, Making Globalization Work, the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\n \n Whenever there are \"externalities\"-where the actions of an individual have impacts on others for which they do not pay, or for which they are not compensated-markets will not work well. Some of the important instances have long understood environmental externalities. Markets, by themselves, produce too much pollution. Markets, by themselves, also produce too little basic research. (The government was responsible for financing most of the important scientific breakthroughs, including the internet and the first telegraph line, and many bio-tech advances.)\n \n But recent research has shown that these externalities are pervasive, whenever there is imperfect information or imperfect risk markets-that is always.\n \n Government plays an important role in banking and securities regulation, and a host of other areas: some regulation is required to make markets work. Government is needed, almost all would agree, at a minimum to enforce contracts and property rights.\n \n The real debate today is about finding the right balance between the market and government (and the third \"sector\"-non-governmental non-profit organizations.) Both are needed. They can each complement each other. This balance differs from time to time and place to place.[10]\n Invisible hand - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n \n \nThe closest analogue you might be more familiar with is the closed fist symbol of socialist enterprises - it too does not represent an actual fist directing affairs, but is a reminder that governments achieve their goals through violence or the threat of it.\n\n \n I'm not quite sure why you seem to assume the 'closed fist' is always represented by socialist agendas?

   "'mata' drunk? Nahhh! too much over mental-masturbation\n \n Over-mental masturbation, or more accurately said over-mental ejaculation stimulates parasympathetic nervous functions, which results in the over production of hormones: acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin. Abnormally high levels of these hormones cause brain and adrenal glands to perform excessive dopamine-norepinephrine-epinephrine conversion. In other words: there is a big change of body chemistry when man or woman practices over-mental masturbation. \n Hmm... is something wrong with body chemistry? Well, actually not- if there is balance. But if there is no balance, some other symptoms might occur. We are still talking about over- mental masturbation, not just simplle mental masturbation! \n Another source points out that people who mentally over-masturbate could experience problems with concentration and memory, which is supposedly a clear sign of \"being over drained of acetylcholine\". According to several studies over-mental masturbating can also drain the motor nerves, neuro-muscular endings, and tissues of acetylcholine and replace it with too much stress adrenalin which is where absentmindedness, memory loss, lack of concentration, eye floaters and 'mata's posts come from. \n They also point that mental over-masturbation may be linked to madness. Simply ask yourself- do you feel more stupid or more insane before/ after mental masturbation?!\n\n \n As I cruise the forum I see this post and must ask the administrator if one exists, Is this what's accepted as a rational and valid response to another members post around here? Are personal attacks of this level the standard operating procedure which are accepted as normal on this forum? If so, I wont be spending a lot of time here since the above post reveals the quality of debate is obviously allowed to exist at a gutter level.",

   "Why no Libertopia?\n \n I guess you know how I feel about the baffling (il)logic of the Libertaryan word salads? With the Scientologist-like circular reasoning & the Grand Old Ideologies? The fact that they have no plan & no solutions that are, in any way connected to present day reality? How it's all just mental masturbation only leading to further inertia? \n \n Oddly enough the Libertaryian rhetoric & soundbites often remind me a little of the Hippyspeak slogans. I'm not old enough to give first hand accounts from that time however I've read about & spoken to people from that era. Personally, I prefer the Beat generation, but that's just me. \n \n The hippies formed communes which gave them the opportunity to 'put your money where your mouth is' so to speak. They chose to demonstrate their ideology. Another slogan from the time was, 'Never trust anyone over 30.' Many of them demonstrated this too by becoming more & more untrustworthy as they got older. \n \n I continue to see the Libertaryian ideology & movement as re-packaged conservatism. I continue to see no plan. \n \n Why no \"Libertopian\" communes or collectives or whatever you would choose to call'em?\n \n Now I know you may want to point out groups like the Freemen & others from the Militia Movement, but how did those scenarios play out (in reality)? \n \n \n \n Another view on Libertaryanism:\n Libertarianism Makes You Stupid\n \n Again, Why no Libertopias?\n\n \n First your \"Libertaryan\" is quite insulting and bigoted. I am a libertarian and I am most certainly not associated with the \"aryan\" concept.\n \n Second, look up New Hampshire and the Free State Initiative.\n \n It's not a commune, but it is a movement that is slowly changing New Hampshire for the better (a more libertarian tilt), as more and more of us Free Staters move up there.",

   ":)'liberals' would happily let you think or do whatever you want in the 'social' sphere they just want to take all your money.\n\n \n I would disagree with you here, the so called liberals don't just want to take your money they want your individual rights in their hip pocket also. They're the greatest advocate of gun laws and some would even confiscate your means of self defense if they could. They're also known for their agreement with the right's Drug War and BIG players in smoking bans, food policing, hate crime laws and political correctness. As a matter of fact, I find almost nothing  \"liberal\"  about them aside from the fact that they  liberally  aspire to take people's money and spend it to  liberally  bribe the vote.\n \n \n Conservatives want to let you keep your money (except in cases where you are required to be a nationalist), but would rather see the culture mandated by controlled immigration and the highest degree of Christianity possible before theocracy is established.\n\n I don't see so called conservatives as really wanting folks to keep their money. The historical track record of so called conservatives in government shows about the same level of spending and debt as the so called liberals. They've expanded spending on every government program especially the military and even invented new government social programs. They might sound like they want you to keep your money, but somebody has to eventually pay the bills so if it's not you and me, it's our offspring and their offspring. Aside from all of that, so called conservatives seem to love wars. I guess they need to try out their newest weapons that they spent so much of our money on. \n \n \n That being said there are many as you who are classical liberals in actual beliefs but end up calling themselves conservative either because they think they need the strength of the 'party' or because they buy into the fallacious political axis which states in this country 'you really are a conservative you just disagree with some things'.\n\n \n It always amuses me when I ask the so called conservatives to define conservatism for me and they spew the false premise that conservatives advocate smaller more limited government but when they're forced to face the reality that policing the world, conducting a humongous expensive Drug War and wanting federal control over female bodies has nothing to do with smaller more limited government but quite the opposite, they either call me names or attempt rants about how logical, effective and necessary a  BIG conservative  government actually is.\n \n \n Likewise I have met and posted with many professed 'liberals' who were unwilling to try to justify the violation of rights when the choice was made clear to them by my arguments; it appears they weren't aware that morality had anything to do with taxes or government and were surprised that the same laws could be applied to a citizen's relationship with government as their relationship with their neighbor.\n\n \n So called liberals and conservatives are actually the same folks with slightly different twist on how to operate a BIG massive intrusive government. A Libertarian candidate once nailed them to their respective crosses when he said \"The only difference between a Democrat and a Republican is who they allow to feed at the government trough first.\"",
