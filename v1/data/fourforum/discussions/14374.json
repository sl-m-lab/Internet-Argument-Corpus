   "England, which it is said, has the strictest gun control in the Western World, enough to make an American Gun Controller giddy with excitement, finally recognizes the REAL problem! Gun control is NOT Crime Control. They are two distinctly separate problems. \n \n My theory is that, if you cannot, or more likely, will not, stop drugs from coming into your country, you cannot stop drug dealers from supplying criminals with the guns they want! \n \n   Go after the gunrunners \n The government was right to tighten up the law governing the ownership of firearms after the 1996 Dunblane massacre. But Derrick Bird met the new criteria in the 1997 legislation and duly held licensed weapons. Comments by those who knew him centre around a common theme: it was totally unexpected. That nice, agreeable man simply flipped. But if the post-Dunblane legislation failed to prevent someone like Bird from holding firearms legally, then it is equally clear that it has had no effect on the supply and availability of illegal guns, including automatic rifles and other repeat-action weapons that are used routinely in gang activity in urban areas.\n \n Even if, as a result of Cumbria, the government were to make it virtually impossible for farmers and other rural folk to own guns, it would have no impact whatsoever on our efforts to tackle gun crime in urban areas. We would succeed in widening the divide between the two societies, but we would fail in keeping more of our young people alive. And we would only lend credence to those who suggest that the gang members who make guns their weapon of choice are simply congenitally prone to commit violent crime.\n \n The real killers in our society are those dealers in death who put illegal firearms in the hands of our young people.\n\n So those who will allow more gun control, shouldn't you first have to justify the need, then prove that what you want and propose, will work as advertised before we allow you to burden our Inalienable Right as protected by the various Constitutions?",

   "  Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n Oh man. That is what the article first article says too! \n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n Well, these studies and facts are no Epinios dot com, but I suspect some will think them credible. No? emoticon_smile \n \n The answer is Drug Dealers!",

   "I've never seen a bankrobber period, that I know of.\n \n So why would those studies be devastating if they refer only to gun laws and you were referring to laws in general?\n\n The thread has been successfully hijacked, so let me jump int this new thread! emoticon_smile\n \n We fight crime with police, and even more police. We fight crime with good crime fighting techniques and criminal justice science, then train our Finest. We fight crime with good equipment while continually upgrading it!\n \n That is why Gun control is NOT crime Control! A law, without all of the above cannot stop anyone from doing anything! As it has been said, a Lock, Only keeps honest people honest! \n \n Both England and Australia have the Strictest gun control laws in the Western World. They have had to steal crime fighters in an effort to administer these gun control laws. Registration, administering home inspections of approved storage systems etc. \n \n Canada's Gun Registration law cost 2 Billion Dollars so far while is was only projected to cost 2 million dollars. They have had to have Amnesty after Amnesty because the registry is so incomplete. Same with Australia. \n \n What we have done in the U.S. is concentrate our efforts on the Criminals instead of the law abiding who are not the problem, and our violent crime rate has dropped precipitously! \n \n   Serious violent crime levels declined since 1993. see chart.  And in fact are at historic lows since records have been kept. The 70's I think. \n \n The above chart stops in 2006 and the news has continued to be good. \n   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008 \n 2006 = 473.6\n 2007 = 466.9\n 2008 = 454.5\n\n   For Release May 24, 2010 \n Preliminary figures indicate that, as a whole, law enforcement agencies throughout the Nation reported a decrease of 5.5 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for 2009 when compared with figures reported for 2008.\n\n All of your Sophistry aside, our Nation's police have been doing an astounding job! I commend all of you! \n \n A law without common sense policing is useless. \n \n And as far as the study Only being devastating the gun laws! At least the last time I checked, this IS the gun board! No? Or did I take a wrong turn? emoticon_smile",

Those who engage in criminal acts don't seem able to get permits to legally carry firearms. I think that is the intent of the permit system in the first place.\n\n Is that the intent of a Business permit? Fairview Park Building permits? \n \n How about these permits? Are they not a part of the Permit system? \n   Over here we can find a few more permits too. \n City of Cleveland: Water Permits\n United States Government Food: Food Stamps Permits for Retailers\n County of Cuyahoga: Inspections-Permits\n City of Cleveland: Special Events and Permits\n City of Cleveland: Sidewalk Vendor Permits\n City of Cleveland: Building Permits\n\n Or can we dispense with the nonsense now?",

If this is untrue, meaning if laws in general can deter criminals, then we would examine what the difference is between laws in general and gun laws that change that fact. Since you have not asserted a difference your position appears to be that laws cannot, by their nature, deter criminals. \n \n That position runs counter to the established justice system.\n \n \n\n Is that the intent of a Business permit? Fairview Park Building permits? \n\n \n I was referring to gun permits, but all the permits mentioned share some similarities, I think. They are to limit who is able to do whatever action the permit is for and so they can track who is doing it. It is not nonsense, it is a good question in terms of the intent of the permit system. In the case of gun permits, it is to stop unauthorized individuals from acquiring guns legally.",
