   "seems to me to have become a race. Both parties are racing to deliver programs or benefits to the people. Republicans want credit for giving medicare benefits. Democrats want credit for providing Affirmitive Action and so on and so forth. \n \n How do we stop this cycle? How do we get back to small government with minimal taxing? Am I in the minority by thinking this way? Does anyone here see a trainwreck ahead?",

   "I'd think a train wreck is a mild definition of what we're facing as an economic future. The Medicare prescription bill you mention, approved legislation, has yet to be funded. Cost estimates escalate so fast no one can get a real handle on it. As real growth in our country continues to decline, our electoral process becomes more and more of a popularity contest between candidates in the sense of who can promise the most to voters in the form of social programs. Vote buying using our own money has become the norm. Add explosive growth in military spending, record government expansion, failed tax cuts and a plan to continue unilateral aggression through economic sanctions (we're running out of troops and money or military aggression would be included) and sooner or later we'll have to pay the piper.\n \n In response to your question, no, IMO I don't think you'll see any reversal of current trends to more government and higher taxes. Increased taxes are still being forced down to state and muni levels where they don't attract the media attention of federal policies. Our current and future deficits will soon require increased federal taxes to placate the 45% of foreign purchases of our treasury issues, our national credit card. As long as we can service interest on the national debt, no politician is going to call for cutbacks and dilute his/her power base or the ability to satisfy special interests that put them in place. Like other, past bloated empires, it'll take a national or world disaster to change anything.",

   "The only thing that can cause our downfall at this point is the end of our ability to increase our national debt to fund our social programs. I have no idea at what point we will finally be forced to prevent anymore increased in our national debt. It seems that no one is thinking that this will occur in the near future either. As long as we can keep increasing our national debt we will continue doing so and will continue to be successful.\n \n So my question is, does anyone know at what point we will not be able to depend on our ability to increase our debt? Who exactly do we owe this money to anyways and will it even be possible to pay it off at this point considering the amount of interest we will have to pay and the programs we will have to cut to pay it off?",

   "Increases in national debt aren't the limiting factor; servicing interest on that debt will become the big issue. If you take the defense portion of the budget, fully half of the budget is to service interest on past defense debt. Deficit interest is allocated to those particular portions of the budget where the expenditures of borrowed money were made. That's why it's so easy for administrations to spend contingency money, such as in Iraq, because it never shows up on the official budget until the next year, as interest. \n \n The government likes to use percentages of GNP, budget, etc. for polished public numbers. That's all well and good if it happens to be an apple-to-apple comparison. Percentage of GDP in say 1975 has a far different composition than in 2004. Trade deficits, public and personal debt all serve to dilute GDP numbers, which are basically a compilation of monetary transactions without regard to contribution or detraction from the real economy. We're shown well-cooked books and 'economic indicators' as most of the general public wouldn't recognize a debit from a credit. \n \n A large portion of our treasury issues go to replace revenue raided from trust funds such as SS and the Highway Fuel Tax Trust. About 45% are purchased by foreign entities that still consider our debt the safest investment in the world. That's where the danger lies. If our deficits, combined with normal interest rates of 7-8%, reach a point where our cash flow, tax revenue and debt, forces us to curtail social programs such as SS, Medicare or something equally volatile on a national basis to meet interest payments, those foreign entities will begin looking for safer investments. And we aren't that far away from such a scenario, as touched on by the Fed chairman in his recent address at a banking convention where he made the unprecedented remarks of cautioning an administration about deficits during an election year. \n \n That's an abbreviated description of some of the economic danger we face with regard to national debt. There are many other factors that contribute to our dilemma, but fiscal irresponsibility for political purposes is a primary condition that aggravates our financial condition. You can't blame the government for the problem, it's our government and we've allowed it to happen through apathy in our quest for more is better.",

   "Here's my little two cents on government. It's corrupt; always has been, always will be. From the days of Rome to modern day democracy, nothing can be right forever, and nothing will be right, because as we change, so too must the government. This is obvious with the rebellions of the past, and those that are surely to come. So do not question why, because man is the answer to that in being what we are, but ask when. In my opinion, the corruption is spreading faster because of our society. This is my theory (please tell me if it's insane, more than likely it is); with the speed of information comes the ever increasing speed of corrupt diffusion in the system. That is, the faster we live our lives, the faster we communicate, the quicker the cancer we inflict upon ourselves spread. So then, what do we do? Do we sit back and merely accept this fate that is destined? Or do we change it, be it by reform or rebellion? It's a question man has always asked himself about the rule he lives under.",

   "Or do we change it, be it by reform or rebellion?\n\n \n I doubt there will be any rebellions forming any time soon. Our freedoms are intact for the most part and out society is going well. Yes the government is corrupt but that just means nothing has changed. So really all that we have to focus on is how to reform the situation. I think if there was just one good person who got put into office as president for four years that they could clean up a lot of these problems. Sad to say I don't think we have had a really good president in a long time. I think Lincoln and Kennedy are the only two that really come to mind. Out of 300 million people if we could just pick one good person they could make a major difference.",

Do we sit back and merely accept this fate that is destined? Or do we change it, be it by reform or rebellion? It's a question man has always asked himself about the rule he lives under.\n\n \n I don't think your observation is insane, if anything you understate the ability of general apathy in allowing corruption to dominate our governing system. IMO, that's not going to change. Social engineering by the federal government will continue serving it well to placate ever-increasing numbers of tax (or deficit) funded social program recipients and the speed of information and data exchanges are facilitating almost instant qualification for those participants. I offer two examples of our governing wisdom:\n \n 1. The deadbeat dad program. Federal funds were granted to states for hardware/software implementation controlled by the employment/unemployment departments of each state for purposes of reporting statistics on new unemployment benefit claims and new jobs (newly hired employees) for federal economic statistical reports. Benefit claims are indexed by type of industry, while new jobs are not. There's the first hint. The new jobs report compiled by states result from each employer being required by legislation to report any new hires within 20-days includes the type of industry, pay rate and SS number(s). That database is shared with the state agency responsible for child support payments (many states now have child support payments directed to that state agency which disburses funds to the recipients) and public welfare. If a child support order is in place, that agency directs the employer to withhold up to 50% of the new employee's net wages and forward it to the agency. Should the father become delinquent in child support payments, a hearing is held. If the father is unable to bring payments current, his driver license is suspended to eliminate flight risk. That also means he can't use private transportation for purposes of employment commutes. A second offense with still outstanding payments is rewarded with jail time. So now we have an individual with no driver license and a jail record, a prime candidate for job interviews, and child support payments being paid by the state. We're so clever in instilling social responsibility.\n \n 2. Medicare enrollments are one of the most sophisticated examples of government social engineering. Due to the US habit of kicking older family members into retirement homes because they tend to cramp active (?) lifestyles, once a person has been qualified for Medicare benefits and is disabled, seriously ill or otherwise unable to care for him/herself, the public money taps are permanently set at full open because that person is 'in the system' with special interests ready and able to service those needs at public expense. No questions, limitations or payment delays. Throw in the new prescription benefits and I find it difficult to understand how we continually critique other countries for their higher rates of taxation and condemn them for being 'socialist' countries. Our SS and Medicare programs were designed to be self-supporting and would be except for our politicians raiding those trust funds for general fund money to avoid raising taxes and perhaps being denied world-class benefits, unlimited power and profitable associations with special interests by losing elections due to unpopularity. We prefer putting everything on the national credit card. \n \n There are uncountable other examples of how our government is self-serving without public conscience and how communication technology has hastened that always present condition in a logarithmic manner, but to answer your question, IMO our house will eventually slide into a state of financial disrepair that requires draconian measures to remain an ongoing entity. Public apathy would have it no other way.",
