   "Science and Religion...\n \n It seems in our world today that these two 'systems' are diametrically opposed. I would like to suggest a different perspective that I do not see considered very often.\n \n Science, by its very nature, discovers possible truths about the physical world.\n \n Believers/practicers of religion or spirituality in their purest form -- which, although distinctions can be made between these two concepts, I am considering synonomous here -- also seek the truth.\n \n Assume for a moment that there is an objective 'truth' in existence. For example the idea that evolution actually -- in truth and reality -- occurs in our world. Either it does or it doesn't. Science cannot prove with 100% certainty, but there is a lot of evidence to suggest that evolution does occur. Even if you believe otherwise, consider for a moment, that evolution does occur as science suggests. True seekers of God/Truth/Light may someday (in heaven?) discover that evolution is an objective truth in our physical world. If evolution does not actually occur, then there is another objective truth behind our coming into existence. Science may someday find it. In other words, IF evolution is not the answer, then there is another answer. Science will continue to seek until it finds that answer.\n \n \n In a forest, there may be two completely different trails that both lead to the same final destination (if such a 'final destination' exists). The roads may look completely different, but they may end up in the same place. I would suggest that quite possibly, this is the case with science and religion.\n \n In simple terms, regarding evolution... is it not possible that God, the Great Author of Existence, created everything? And the mysteries of the methods by which God created everything are slowly being unraveled by science? Perhaps an all-powerful God 'created' all life that has ever existed through an amazing phenomena that scientists call 'evolution'? Perhaps God 'created' all laws that govern nature and the physical world, and although God is certainly capable of 'breaking' those laws, God chose to allow those laws to work of their own accord? This perspective takes nothing away from the uniqueness of our existence nor our spirituality (for God knew from the Beginning that these laws would eventually create the unique YOU). This also takes nothing away from science, for in its purest form, it is completely objective. It doesn't matter to science whether or not there is a God.\n \n One final note: Scienctists can operate in this world successfully, independent of belief in any deity or spirituality. Religious or spiritual individuals, regardless of what they believe, are still subject to the physical laws that are discovered and explored by science. IF God is truth, and assuming that science seeks objective truth, then in reality, science is seeking to discover God, whether or not the scientists 'believe' in God.",

By your standards, you may believe that I am not, but that's your opinion and you are entitled to it.\n \n It is conceivable that the authors of Genesis did not have the understanding of the natural world that is available to us today. Without this knowledge, they did not grasp the concepts to be able to put the actual events of creation into words. And so, they wrote words that could be understood by the people of their time, which turned into the story of Genesis. Perhaps each of those 'seven days' occurred over a period of millions of years? Afterall, what is time to God? A minute is like infinity to God. Infinity is like a nanosecond. \n \n Even consider that the Bible was inspired by God. No individual human beings were present for the much of the story of Genesis. Only when Adam and Eve were created were there humans involved. So no human eyes witnessed all the other creation that occurred. Where did the idea of 'seven days' come from? It was inspired by God. And what is a day in the eyes of God? Who knows???\n \n My point is that the Bible is not necessarily written to be a science textbook or a literal history book.",

Quite frankly, I don't really care whether the world was created in a literal seven 24-hour periods, or whether it happened over millions of years (I do find this interesting, and I think it's worth studying to know... but it has no bearing on me living a Christian life). The fact is -- I am here. Doesn't matter how I got here. I am here.\n \n And perhaps Man did disobey God, and as a result fall from grace.

   "this is interesting. but forgiveness for the \"sin\" of totalitarian agricultural practices? thats what man needed redemption from?\n\n Quite possibly. The practice of totalitarian agriculture not only destroys the earth that God created, but it also allows for a separation of classes of people. It allows some people leisure time and time to ponder the meaning of life while others are toiling in the fields to feed them. God did call the apple tree the 'Tree of Knowledge and Life,' did He not? The human population of the earth had remained relatively stable over tens of thousands of years prior to this revolution. Since the agricultural revolution, our population has grown exponentially. It seems that something significant happened. Kinda sounds like a lot of 'life.'\n \n \n...and if this is the case, then what of the 10 comandments? nowhere does it say anything that remotely touches destructive agriculture.\n\n Nor do they say anything about eating an apple from a particular tree. :-) That's because the 'sin' isn't eating the apple or practicing totalitarian agriculture, but rather disobeying God. I believe the commandments do have this one covered.\n \n \nyou see, the thing is, in order for man's \"fallen state\" to come about, man first would have had to be aware of God's existence, and His communication of his commandments to man. the Story of B seems to imply that man was always in a sinless state up until 10000 years ago. but this means that either man at that time had always known of God's existence and laws, but never disobeyed, or they didnt know of his existence up until that time.\n \n how do you account for man 10000 years ago suddenly becoming aware of the existence of God, as well as his communicated commandments to them?\n\n I would suggest that Man was aware of God prior to 10,000 years ago. God is present in everything that He created. Especially to humans without a scientific understanding of the world around them, it had to be evident that some force greater than Man was at work. Man could see the stars... the animals in the forests, he could feel the earth beneath him. Man lived in harmony with the earth by not taking from it anymore than Man returned to the earth. As soon as Man fell into totalitarian agriculture, and realized how much 'easier' his life could be, Man's life has been full of sin. Prior to this fall, Man lived in harmony with God and all of God's creations. Man did know of God's existence, and God's laws were self-evident. Man had no reason to disobey God... perhaps there was no sin. If the totalitarian agricultural revolution really is the 'Fall,' then it makes biblical sense that there was no sin previously. Man still had free will, but had not disobeyed God by eating of the forbidden fruit of totalitarian agriculture.\n \n Another big piece of this theory is that the Bible wasn't written until, what? 3,000-4,000 years ago or something? At that point in time, there wasn't anyone alive who had any first-hand experience of what life was like prior to the agricultural revolution. Since history wasn't recorded on 'paper' until, what? 5,000 years ago? So, there was a period of about 5,000 years that history could only be passed down by word of mouth. If you've ever played the kids game of 'Operator' or 'Telephone' (where you sit in a circle and one person whispers into another person's ear, and the message is passed around the circle), then you know how inaccurate this can be in a short period of time. Imagine this game over 5,000 years. By 5,000 years ago, people had simply forgotten that life had ever been any different for Man. Life had always been like it was at that time in their minds. Quinn calls this 'The Great Forgetting.' He suggests that only relatively recent advances in technology and understanding have allowed us to see that there may have even been a 'Great Forgetting.' \n \n Now remember, that the Bible was written in history after this 'Great Forgetting' occurred. And even if it was inspired by God, it was still written by humans who had to communicate these inspirations from God with concepts and language that could be understood by other humans.\n \n Please note, I am not suggesting that this is definitely, 100% TRUE, or that it's the only way to look at things. I am merely suggesting that it is a theory that deserves some exploration. It fits quite nicely into the existing framework of the story of creation and the subsequent 'Fall,' assuming it is not limited to a specific timeframe that includes a rigid 24-hour day.",

   "no problem, I like where this is going...\n \n ok, according to evolution, man and chimps came from a common ancestor. if man was always aware of God, then can we say that chimps, and by extension all animals are aware of God's existense? of course you cannot answer that question, but you might agree that in order to assume that man always was aware of existence throughout evolution, then even before he evolved into a human he was aware of God's existence. how far back does this go? all mammals are aware of God's existence? all animals? all life?\n \n also, the \"sin\" of totalitarian agriculture must have in some way been communicated to man as forbidden. however, man didnt suddenly start to commit large-scale destructive farming suddenly upon being forbidden. this agricultural technique must have been developed by experimentation and trial and error. \n \n thirdly, if man's original and truly righteous state was that of \"being one with nature\" rather than embarking on \"sinful and earth destroying technological advancement\", then why didnt Jesus, the redeemer of man, teach on going back to being one with nature as a major part of his doctrine. \n \n the story of B leaves gaps about the significance of disobedience to God (well, I cant say, I havent read the story). however, the genesis story is very explicit about the disobedience element, including the goodwill of God to man, the implicit enmity of Satan towards man, the temptation and deception, and the immediate repercussions of the disobedience.\n \n then the beginning of the new testament gets straight to the business of redemption by means of repentance from mans disobedience to God and hatred/indifference to one another (love God, love your neighboor). nowhere did the gospel mention repent of modern technological advancement.\n \n can you elaborate on how the commandment of God against totalitarian agriculture was issued, according to the story of B? and can you also give a summary of how the collective population of humans at that time disobeyed? remember, if their were any humans that did not participate in this forbidden form of development, then they and their offspring could not be considered as \"fallen\"",

   " \"...all mammals are aware of God's existence? all animals? all life?\"\n\n Awareness of God. On what level? Perhaps all animals are 'aware' of God and obey God's natural laws and therefore are without sin. Perhaps without a higher level of 'awareness' they do not have what we consider free will, and therefore cannot sin, but they are still subject to God's laws and are 'aware' of them (i.e. If a cat jumps from a tree, the cat knows it will fall to the ground, and usually do so on all four paws). Yes, all life is subject to God's laws. Is all life 'aware' of God's existence, assuming God exists? I think that would depend on the agreed-upon definition of 'awareness.'\n \n I'm not certain if I follow your second paragraph. I am suggesting that Man was aware of God's laws because they were all around him. God didn't have to specifically forbid man by bellowing His voice from the clouds that 'agriculture is wrong -- don't do it!' Quinn suggests that totalitarian agriculture began in a relatively limited region of Mesopotamia and spread out from there. Cultures who practiced this lifestyle could move out and conquer other tribes. This lifestyle didn't just 'appear,' but rather started somewhere and grew. (Who knows, maybe the first farmer was Adam!)\n \n \n \"then why didnt Jesus... teach... being one with nature... ?\"\n\n Regarding your third paragraph, maybe, just maybe, God knew that man would 'fall' into a totalitarian agricultural lifestyle. Maybe this is the original sin that we are all born with, and we still are 'practicing' this sin today. This seems to make more sense than inheriting the sin of one person eating an apple a long, long time ago. Afterall, WE aren't eating that apple today!!! But if original sin was disobeying God by eating from a forbidden source, and we are still eating from that source today, it makes sense that we still are born into this sin. Perhaps, just perhaps, God knew all this would happen, and that's why he sent us his Son... to show us that even in the midst of sin, we could still be saved! Going back to a 'natural' lifestyle wouldn't change anything. The eyes of humanity have already been opened by Adam eating that apple (or by some cultures starting a particular lifestyle) a long, long time ago. God banished humanity from the earthly Eden forever -- we cannot go back. Trying to go back would be futile, and Jesus knew this. But, through the sacrifice of Jesus, God offers us something even 'better' than Eden. He opens the doors of Heaven. We have fallen, but by grace we can be saved.\n \n \n \"...the story of B leaves gaps about the significance of disobedience to God\"\n\n Quinn doesn't place any significance on obedience to God, because as I understand him, he suggests that the God we know and worship is completely made up by man. He suggests that God's laws and commandments that we supposedly live by were made up by humans after the 'Fall.'\n \n \n \"...nowhere did the gospel mention repent of modern technological advancement.\"\n\n The point is not to repent of modern technological advancement. There is nothing 'wrong' with this in the eyes of God. The concept of disobeying God is what is important, whether it was through eating an apple from a tree or practicing a lifestyle that is counter to the balance of life that God intended. Consider that your insistence that there has to be a specific commandment against totalitarian agriculture suggests that there should now be some sort of commandment against eating an apple. That's silly, because it has nothing to do with eating an apple. It has everything to do with obedience to God.\n \n \n \"...remember, if their were any humans that did not participate in this forbidden form of development, then they and their offspring could not be considered as 'fallen'\"\n\n Yes, this is a very interesting line of thought all on its own! Have you ever read the book Mutant Message Down Under, by Marlo Morgan? According to a particular culture of aboriginal peoples that she allegedly lived with for several months, their culture and lifestyle has remained relatively unchanged for 50,000+ years (long before the supposed 'Fall' according to Quinn). Morgan suggests exactly what you are deducing... that these people live in harmony with God and with the earth and have never suffered the 'Fall.' That, in fact, they do not 'sin.' Wow! Then did Jesus really come for ALL people? Hmmm... here's where things get a little fuzzy. Morgan discusses this with the aborigines to some extent in her book. I'm not certain I agree with all of her conclusions, but the concept is very intriguing. This is another quick read that I would encourage you to consider reading.",

That's silly, because it has nothing to do with eating an apple. It has everything to do with obedience to God.\n\n but the Bible states that there was a definite and specific commandment against eating that particular fruit (it wasnt an apple). this was the first expressive commandment of God. and it was clearly communicated to Adam, apparently on his first day on Earth. you cannot have disobedience without a command. no matter what the command is. if you tell your child dont whistle in the house, if they whistle in the house, they disobeyed you. that doesnt make it wrong for me to whistle in my house , but the disobedience can only apply to the specific command and the person it is given to.\n \n \nYes, this is a very interesting line of thought all on its own!

   "I don't think the ideas that I am putting forth can be reconciled with the idea of 'Bible-as-always-literal.' I am discussing this from the perspective that the story of Genesis is a story, written by humans around 3-4,000 years ago, allegedly inspired by God, in words that humans of the time could understand, about how the earth and everything in it was created. The story makes a point that God is all-powerful and that man is in need of redemption. I think we both see this idea clearly. Where I see a difference is that you are discussing from the perspective that Genesis must be taken literally or Christianity has no foundation upon which to stand. I disagree with this perspective, because Genesis perceived as a story makes the same basic points as Genesis perceived literally. The only difference is in the specifics of what actually, in reality, happened... whether the earth was created in seven 24-hour periods or over millions of years... and whether an actual, physical man we call Adam ate fruit from a specific tree or somehow or other 'fell' from God's grace. I am not suggesting that Quinn's theory is necessarily how the 'fall' actually happened, but it does fit well into the puzzle if we assume that Genesis is a story that may summarize what actually, in physical reality, happened during the creation and the 'fall.'\n \n \n FREEWILLY\n As I understand the Bible, it suggests that of all creatures on earth only humans have eternal souls. So, perhaps there was a time (which 'day' was it that God created Man?) that God decided he wanted to give eternal souls to Man. Poof! There it is! Perhaps with a soul, humans also aquired a 'higher awareness' and a concept we call 'free will.' I haven't really thought this one through, but it's and idea.\n \n \n \n \n\"and on the suggestion of Adam being the first farmer (gardener) the Bible said Adam was placed in a garden and God instructed him to tend to it. so there is a remote correlation. furthermore, when Adam was booted, God told him that he will have to till the soil for food. coming to think about it, it seems like the God of the Bible actually sanctioned organised agriculture, not prohibit it\"\n\n \n Assuming that God told Adam he would have to till the soil for food, this still fits into Quinn's idea. Adam's eyes were opened. He saw what was possible with this lifestyle, and he couldn't go back even if he wanted to because he was forbidden from Eden by God. Perhaps God wasn't 'commanding' Adam to till the soil, but rather God was stating that this is what Adam will have to do (or even simply 'what Adam will do' or better yet, since Genesis was written long after Adam was around, 'what Adam DID') now that his eyes were opened.\n \n \n \n\"yes, but wouldnt moving to a remote woodland location and eating fruits of the forest trees bring about the same results? what if I move to a third world country where a lot of unspoilt natural forest still remain. my child is born and he eats nothing but naturally ripened fruits and roots all his life. wouldnt that exempt him from the \"sin\" of eating modernized foods? why would he need to be redeemed if he never ate of the forbidden food, and therefore is sinless?\"\n\n Not necessarily. I think I still haven't communicated this clearly (and I probably confused things by suggesting we are still 'practicing' this sin today) so I'll make another attempt: The 'sin' isn't eating modernized or processed foods. The 'sin' isn't practicing totalitarian agriculture. The 'sin' is disobeying God's commandment (whether implied or directly ordered). In other words, humanity disobeyed God's commandment. Humanity cannot return to life prior to the act of disobeyment. (Is 'disobeyment' even a word???) We are forbidden by God from returning to 'Eden.' Taking Quinn's idea, eating food produced by totalitarian agriculture isn't the only way our eyes were opened. We also started overtaking other cultures and declaring dominion over other peoples... we no longer respected the earth and all of God's creation, but we attempted to 'rule' it and 'control' it.\n \n Now in the example of the aborigines, their culture is virtually unchanged. Their culture suffered no 'fall.' Their eyes were not opened in the way Adam's were. They cannot understand why any human being would ever want to have 'power' over another human being or have 'power' over the earth, or even attempt to have 'power' over God. The concept is absurd to them (as suggested by Morgan).\n \n \n \n\"hey! wait a minute! didnt you just say God sent Jesus? thats the God of the Bible, right? but if thats all made up, then why are we still striving to live up to Bible standards? how can christianity exist without the Bible, seeing that it is only in the Bible \"Christ\" is described?\"\n\n As I understand Quinn, he takes his suggestion of the 'Fall' in a completely different direction than the one we're pursuing. He suggests that x happened and that after humanity could write, humanity wrote a story y. Then humanity developed many ideas that supported that original story, including salvationist religions as we know them. I believe Quinn would suggest that Christians today are still striving to live up to Bible standards because Christians today still believe the stories that humans made up thousands of years ago and continue to make up more stories to fit into the previous stories. But all of these stories ignore what life was like prior to 10,000 years ago.\n \n I'd also like to point out that the Bible is not the only place Christ is written about. There are other written documents from the early Church, and even probably outside of the Church that mention Jesus. If Christianity relied solely upon the Bible, then how did Christianity survive before the Bible as we know it was in existence?\n \n \n\"but the Bible states that there was a definite and specific commandment against eating that particular fruit\"\n\n And this, I am suggesting, may be a story that summarizes what happened in reality.\n \n \n\"you cannot have disobedience without a command. no matter what the command is. if you tell your child dont whistle in the house, if they whistle in the house, they disobeyed you. that doesnt make it wrong for me to whistle in my house , but the disobedience can only apply to the specific command and the person it is given to.\"\n\n This could turn into a long tangental topic, but I'll try to keep the idea simple. A command doesn't have to be explicit. If I give my son everything that he needs to be happy, healthy and alive -- not necessarily material goods, but definitely including love -- and my son turns around and spits on me and hates me and intentionally kills me, I would suggest that my son has gone against my implicit commands that I have imparted to him. I never told my son, \"Thou shalt not kill me.\" But I suggest that this is not necessary in order for it to be understood. (Suggesting that every command needs to be explicit does fall in line with a 'literal' interpretation, so to understand this point, I think you need to be able to see from a 'non-literal' interpretation point-of-view.)\n \n \n\"hmmm.. well, according to that, I guess its really the aborigines (and maybe the Congo headhunters) that worship the real God. the rest of the world at large are in need of repentance.\"\n\n It isn't that the aborigines discussed by Morgan worship the 'real' God, and Christians in our world culture worship a different God. The God is the same. We just have a different perspective of him... a different understanding... in fact, an entirely different relationship. Our 'world culture' has fallen (however you wish to define that -- Quinn suggests it was the advent of totalitarian agriculture), and we are in need of redemption. The culture of the aborigines has not fallen. They have a different relationship with God -- not any 'better' or 'worse' relationship, just different. Because they have not 'fallen,' they have no need of redemption through Jesus. They are already redeemed, because they are living in accord with God's commandments.\n \n \n\"the problem is, if a christian says he repents and accepts Jesus (of the Bible, like the Bible says), but continue eating their Mac Donald Burgers and Tropicana orange juice, have they really repented? how will they be saved?\"\n\n This isn't really a problem in the paradigm I am painting. Eating McDonald burgers isn't the sin. These people are saved from the disobedience of humanity by accepting Jesus. Because humanity has fallen from grace, Jesus is God's answer.\n \n \n\"(Just as a Note: I have looked at a lot of these hybrid evolution-christian doctrines, and somehow they are all much less logical than either pure atheism/evolutionism or pure radical christianity. this is why Im very curious about how you sort out the rationale of this particualr doctrine, particular since you seem to be a rather rational person)\"\n\n I don't know that you necessarily 'believe' this, but you seem to be implying by this statement...\n \n \"If the story in Genesis didnt happen the way it did, then either God isnt infinitely and supernaturally powerful, or Man never disobeyed God by eating of a tree that never existed, or both. and if either is the case, then what is the value of Christianity?\"\n \n ...that if the Bible isn't always literal, then Christianity has no value. If this is what you are suggesting, please note that this is a logical fallacy known as a 'false dilemma.' The Bible may include non-literal stories that were written to convey an idea. This doesn't preclude God from being infinitely and supernaturally powerful. Nor does it preclude the idea that man disobeyed God. So it logically follows that a non-literal interpretation of the Bible does not necessarily preclude Christianity from having value.\n \n Again, I do not know whether you are, in fact, implying that if x then Christianity has no value, leaving open the very real possibility of x, with hope or confidence that you can back up x against any criticism... or if you are asking a legitimate question: \"If the Bible cannot be interpreted literally, then what IS the value of Christianity?\" \n \n I would answer this by saying that from my perspective, the value of Christianity does not rely upon a literal translation of the specific words written in a book allegedly inspired by God, but rather it relies upon the ideas and principles communicated in the book and passed down through the ages and implicit in our consciences through a personal relationship with God. As such, there is nothing 'hybrid' about an 'evolution-christian doctrine.' They are not mutually exclusive, so there is no need to hybridize. Rather, they both co-exist in the same paradigm without conflict.",

   "problems with a non-literal Genesis\n if the creation story according Genesis is not really how the world began, then the only plausible alternative explanation to the origin of the world around us is evolution. according to evolution, God's role is very minimal if at all present. no supernatural phenomenon exists, expect those that started the process eons ago.\n \n this is a dilema for religion. how do you explain the development of a soul and spirit in man as he progressed down this evolutionary path? these concepts are abstract to begin with, and now their origin is just as nebulous. first of all, it would mean that God set the universe into existence, allow it to naturally and spontaneously develop for billions of years, then step back in to intervene when humans attained a certain evolutionary level. did God know his primordal soup of chemicals would one day in the very distatnt future produce a creature that happens to be in His image and likeness? and were the other extinct \"runners up\" only failed experiments/candidates for a species to grant a soul to? not only that, but what really happened that put them in the predicament of \"fallen from grace\"? \n \n in the literal genesis, all this is instantaneous, meaning there really was no reason for God to sit around for 4.5 billion years waiting for his universe to bloom into the shape He wanted. this demonstrates the supernatural and infinite power that we usually attribute to God. Also, since he did not also have to wait hundreds of millions of years for man himself to get on the scene, but created him instantly as well, tested him in free will, and dealt with him accordingly, hence the question of man's \"fallen state\" is answered\n \n the problem with a non-literal Bible\n if the stories, events and feats that the Bible says were done actually never took place, then why would anybody want to live according to the way the Bible says they should? throughout the old testament and the Gospels of the New testament, many demonstrations of supernatural power were done. we all agree that such events as the flood, the demise of Sodom and Gomorah, the parting of the red sea, the 12 plagues of egypt, and many other great events in the Bible are absolutely not naturally possible, no matter how you try to \"logify\" them (I just made that word up :D)\n \n but the deeds allegedly performed in the old testament are miniscule compared to the significance of those in the new testament. the deeds done by Jesus -- healing, raising the dead, feeding those in need, walking on water, commanding the storms, casting out demons -- not only serves to demonstrate more of the power of God, but also to demonstrate that such power is also available to man, Jesus himself said that greater things than he did his disciples (christians) would be able to do.\n \n ok, if we start to strip away the events that the Bible claims happened which require supernatural phenomenon, we effectively are saying that the writers of the Bible are not reliable/did not hear from God/did not express God's thoughts properly. in any event, the Bible will have to be considered as partially true, rather than entirely true. So we remove the non-truths from the Bible, since they cause more harm than good, particularly since being a christian ideally should be based in 100% truth. we remove the creation myth. we remove the flood tale. remove the exodus out of egypt, the mysterious tablets that \"God carved commandments into\", the earth swallowing half the israelites, the inexplicble collapse of the jericho walls, and the one-in-a-million chance slaying of Goliath by David. since these stories couldnt possibly happen except via some paranormal/divine intervention, they must have been largely exagerrated hand-me-down tales.\n \n you might notice we'd be left with a very thin old testament\n \n but why would the old testament stories be non-literal if those in the new testament are? what makes you think that miraculous stupifying events would suddenly start happening 2000 years ago, if they never happen before (in the old testament). so therefore events such as virgin birth, voices out of the sky, people walking out of tombs or stretching out of deformed arms, and all these other fanciful feats cant be true either. and what about Jesus' resurrection and heavenly ascension? could supernatural events such as these possibly really have happened?\n \n \n the christian belief is rooted in the literal interpretation of genesis more than you seem to realize. in fact, the very existence of God or a supernatural realm of any kind falls into dire doubt if genesis is not true as stated",

   "Unkerpaulie &#8211; I suggest that God is so infinite and powerful that God is not dependent upon anything. God&#8217;s power is not confined to the story of Genesis, or even to the stories of the NT. God&#8217;s power is limitless. It seems from the perspective for which you are arguing that if we don&#8217;t accept a literal translation of the Bible, then God has no value. From the perspective that God&#8217;s power is limitless, it makes no difference what the authors of the Bible wrote or didn&#8217;t write, nor does it matter how we interpret it. God&#8217;s power is still limitless. Nothing about God would change even if the Bible had never been written. God is not limited to the Bible. The Bible is not the only way we can know God. \n \n Four and a half billion years is instantaneous to God&#8217;s infinite presence (or like &#8216;seven 24-hour periods,&#8217; if you prefer)&#8230; God didn&#8217;t have to &#8216;wait around&#8217; for anything. It all could have happened just as God intended in an instant, which we measure as 4.5 billion years. This demonstrates God&#8217;s supernatural and infinite power as much as a literal interpretation does.\n \n I&#8217;m not suggesting that any part of the Bible is &#8216;un-true.&#8217; Genesis can be considered to be true and still not be interpreted literally. The truth is that God is infinite and all-powerful, and that somehow or other, Man fell from grace. I&#8217;m also not suggesting that accounts of God&#8217;s super-natural powers in the OT or NT are &#8216;un-true.&#8217;\n \n The problem that I can see with a Bible-as-always-literal perspective is that there is much evidence in the world around us that doesn&#8217;t coincide with a literal interpretation. (Doesn&#8217;t a literal interpretation suggest that the earth is only around 4,000 years old?) Clinging to the belief that a literal interpretation is the only way to remain faithful to God&#8217;s word may cause us to ignore empirical scientific evidence of God&#8217;s truth in the world around us. If we ignore empirical evidence, we no longer are truthful with ourselves or with God. There is a break from reality. Recognizing that stories like the creation in Genesis may be true &#8211; not literally spelled out exactly as they happened, but rather true in the sense that God created the world out of nothing and created everything in it and that Man fell from God&#8217;s grace and is in need of redemption, etc. &#8211; allows us to accept objective empirical evidence gathered from our natural world that God gave us to discover and explore without there being any conflict with the truth of the Bible. From the perspective I am supporting, the &#8216;problems&#8217; that you pose below are not problems at all.\n \n I&#8217;m not trying to convince you that you should change your beliefs regarding the literal interpretation of the Bible. I&#8217;m only trying to convince you that there is another perspective that is well-reasoned that doesn&#8217;t depend on a literal interpretation. No matter what, you won&#8217;t be able to convince me that there isn&#8217;t another perspective because I already know that another perspective exists. You may question the validity of this other perspective while still respecting those who hold it, and I may question the validity of the perspective for which you are arguing, but I still respect any individual who views from that perspective.",

   "I agree with mizmaxx too. in fact, thats the point Im making. christianity is totally dependant on the Bible, since the Bible is the only source where Christ is identified. If \"christ\" is not a factor, or if the story of christ is based on untruths, then christianity is worthless. by extension, there is no redeemer, no redemption and no promise of eternal life in heaven (also exclusively Biblical). therefore, as mizmaxx said, without the literal interpration of the Bible as true, then christianity is left without a foundation and falls flat.\n \n I also agree with your perspective that God as a supernatural being and creator of the universe is totally independant on the Bible or anything else. In fact, even without ever reading or believing the bible, its still possible and relatively easy to believe tha a supreme God exists and created the order and unversal systems we see around us\n \n but the problem that still remains is the basis of the christian religion. the christian religion in its most fundamental and foundational form believes that 1) man was once in communion with God, 2) man fell out of this communion by his own choice, 3) God loves man and has made a way for man to be restored to Him, and 4) that way is through Jesus Christ alone. Outside of these precepts you have something that is not christianity. the thing is, this package of precepts is derived exclusively from the Bible.\n \n how can the Bible be credible if it contains untruths? for instance, why would I believe that God answers prayer supernaturally, when all the instances of God answering prayer supernaturally in the past were untrue? why would I believe that God speaks to people? why would I believe that Jesus really came to earth, died and resurrected himself? how would you decide what parts of the Bible are true and which parts are not?\n \n now bear in mind that none of the supernatural phenomenon (walking on water, virgin birth, self-resurrection, etc) coincides with any scientific discoveries or theories. so if we decide that the parts of the Bible that can be backed by science are true, and everything else is false, then you are basically removing the entire Gospels, and most of the Old testament. How can you believe that christianity is at all valid if you dont believe in science-defying supernatural phenomenon?",

   "Unkerpaulie -- I suspected that this may be where you were heading, which is why I often referred to 'the perspective from which you are arguing' instead of 'you believe.' I read some of your comments elsewhere that led me to believe this wasn't necessarily a personal belief you hold yourself.\n \n I'll make a distinction, though, that Christianity is not totally dependent on the Bible. Prior to a written NT in existence, Christianity existed. To say that Christianity is totally dependent on the Bible or that it does not have a foundation without the Bible is not a logical argument because you could burn all the Bibles of the world so that there is no written record of anything in existence, and Christianity would still be in existence. Christianity is based upon the four precepts that you mention above, yes. But this package of precepts is not derived exclusively from the Bible. Rather the Bible is written by individuals, allegedly inspired by God, to communicate these precepts that were already in existence prior to the Bible being written.\n \n Look at it this way... Jesus actually existed or Jesus did not exist -- physically, walking around on this earth. If we could go back in time and follow Jesus around, we could prove that either he did or he didn't exist... We could witness his entire life and attest to whether or not the 'supernatural' phenomena he performed actually happened or not. So Jesus' existence is a fact that is not dependent upon what is written in the Bible. Even if the Bible were not written, all the things that Jesus allegedly did according to the Bible either really happened or they didn't really happen. In a sociology class one time, I recall reading about a Harvard professor (agnostic, I believe) who set out to find evidence independent of the Bible on the existence of Jesus, or on his death and resurrection. I don't remember the details, but the conclusion was that this Harvard professor found sufficient evidence outside of the Bible and religious writings to suggest that Jesus really did walk the earth and that he did die and that he did 'rise' from the dead. That's neither here nor there, just evidence to support the idea that there is evidence outside of the Bible for Jesus' physical existence on this earth.\n \n \nhow can the Bible be credible if it contains untruths?\n\n It probably cannot be credible to any reasonable and logical person if it does, in fact, contain untruths. But what 'untruths' does it contain? I have never seen an 'untruth' in the Bible. (Granted, I'm not a biblical scholar or anything... so the fact that I have never seen one doesn't mean that there necessarily ARE none.) But I'd be willing to address on a rational (not 'supernatural') level any 'untruths' that you perceive in the Bible.\n \n Regarding Jesus' miracles, say... walking on water... True, there are no scientific discoveries or theories in existence that can explain this seemingly supernatural phenomena, but that doesn't mean something won't be discovered in the future to explain it. Just because science can't explain something at this point in time does not suggest that it can never be explained. Science still doesn't really understand quantum physics, but that doesn't mean that they can't be understood. Or take the example of a 'miraculous recovery' from cancer... it's miraculous because science can't explain it based on our current understanding of the world. What I'm trying to say is that based upon our current understanding of the world we live in and our most recent scientific discoveries, we still cannot explain some things that allegedly happened according to the Bible. That doesn't negate the fact that they occurred. (This IS a fact... it may be an untrue fact, but because it either happened or didn't happen, it is a fact.)\n \n To say that something needs to be backed by science in order for it to be true makes some observable phenomena in our world today 'untrue.' Such as a 'miraculous and unexplainable' remission from cancer. Science cannot explain some of these things, but we are still witnesses to them, so in the physical world they are very real.\n \n P.S.

If they do not stick to these four precepts, I do not believe they can be considered Christian.\n \n \n \nAccording to the science that you subscribe to, this is not at all how man, woman or animals were created, neither the process nor the order. if evolution is true, then these 5 verses (for starters) are untrue. note that this was not written to be just a story as you seem to elude to. this was written as if it were so, as if these events actually happened and in this way.\n\n If evolution is what actually happened to bring life on earth to the point it's at today... And if you subscribe to a literal interpretation of Genesis, then I agree that what is written in Genesis is 'untrue.' But you seem to be missing the point that I am attempting to communicate that nothing about Christianity relies on a literal interpretation of Genesis. You say, \"note that this was not written to be just a story as you seem to elude to.\" What evidence have you to suggest that it was not written as the author's best understanding (but limited understanding) of the events that took place to bring life to the point that it is at today.\n \n You seem to insist that the Bible MUST be interpreted literally in order for it to be credible, and that the literal interpretation automatically makes it incredible and invalid. This is a false dilemma. There is another valid perspective: The Bible NEED NOT be interpreted literally. Being Christian does not necessarily equate to being illogical and unreasonable. :-)\n \n We seem to be going in circles now. I believe where we are at is this:\n \n a) You are suggesting that in order for Christianity to have any validity, a literal interpretation of the Bible must be adhered to without exceptions.\n 2) Science is a system that allows us to investigate and discover objective truths about the world around us.\n d) Since the best scientific evidence we have today makes a literal interpretation of Genesis false, the conclusion you are making is that the Bible must be false.\n \n If you agree that this is where we are, then please allow me to point out that your initial premise is merely your opinion, and is not rooted in fact. Therefore, your entire argument and conclusion are based on a fallacy.\n \n P.S. Perhaps the point of including this and other passages is to make a point, not act as an actual recording of history.",

I disagree. I believe we can find value even in myths or legends or stories. What value (if any) you place upon them depends on your perspective. But that doesn't mean they have no value.\n \n \n \nI take it you are implying that there is really no such thing as \"supernatural\" and everything that actually happened must have a logical scientifically sound scientific explanation.\n\n I am merely suggesting that it is fact that there are some things that can't be explained even by our best science and most advanced understanding of the world today. Perhaps this will always be the case. Perhaps there is a realm that actually exists metaphysically in our world that science as it exists today may never be able to explain. To this realm, or to things science does not yet understand, we may assign a label of 'supernatural.' Maybe someday, science will be able to explain these things and we will realize they were not 'supernatural' at all, but they make complete logical sense.\n \n \n \nand furthermore you seem to imply that anything that is contrary or impossible with regards to the laws of science we can conclude that they never happened at all.\n\n No, I will state it this way: If x happened, then I can say that x happened. My understanding of x and my observations of x may not be able to explain how or why x happened, but that doesn't change the fact that x happened. Regardless of whether or not science has an explanation, science cannot ignore that x happened. (This would be counter to the nature of pure science.) Rather science would attempt to explain x.\n \n In the case of Jesus walking on water, we only have a story written in the Bible that this actually happened. It was allegedly witnessed by multiple witnesses, but we do not know with certainty that it happened. So from a scientific standpoint, it makes no sense to attempt to explain this, because we don't even know whether or not it actually happened. And the best science we have today suggests that this cannot physically happen, so it is pointless to pursue it from a scientific standpoint. (As an aside... I live in Minnesota, and I walk on water all the time!) However, if a person alive today started 'walking on water,' and it was witnessed by many people and shown to be a reproducible phenomenon, you better believe that scientists would try to unravel the mystery of this 'supernatural' behavior. \n \n Furthermore, if you went back in time and found the subject named Jesus, and followed him around, you would know for yourself whether or not he actually 'walked on water' and if there was some sort of other explanation (a shallow sandbar... an unexplained change in water temperature that caused a portion of the water to freeze -- incidentally, there's another good example of something unexplained... have you heard of the lake in Northern Minnesota on which a portion of the water never freezes? No explanation. -- or maybe Jesus suspended a cable the night before and was holding himself up with that... maybe... you get the idea.)

   " \"I think the main obstacle I am having trouble to get past is the idea that these Biblical stories were actually intended by the authors as simply fables.\"\n\n Even if the authors *intended* them to be interpreted literally (because that was THEIR understanding), that doesn't mean that they *must* be interpreted literally to have value. Did the authors intend for the stories to be interpreted literally? I don't know. It doesn't much matter, because as a logical and reasonable person (relatively speaking), I can see that it's very, very, very unlikely or impossible that the literal description included in Genesis is actually how the earth was formed. So, therefore, I reject a literal interpretation of Genesis, because, quite frankly, it doesn't coincide with reality.\n \n Consider this paradigm as I am painting it here (although impossible, try not to interject your own interpretations):\n \n Take for granted that an all-powerful God exists. This God may be perceived differently by different people, but the objective all-powerful God remains unchanged. This God created the earth and everything in it. The process is unimportant. What's important is that God did it.\n \n Now accepting this paradigm for a few moments, accept that somehow or other, one of God's creations that we know as 'man' was made 'special' somehow -- eternal, with no end -- in God's image. Maybe it happened with one man and one woman, maybe it was with a whole tribe or nation of people, maybe it was with all the members of the homo sapiens sapiens alive on earth at that time. The specific timeframe and the exact process is unimportant. What's important is that in God's eyes, this creature called 'man' was 'special.' Somehow or other (specifically how is unimportant), man 'fell' from God's grace. Let's just say that man did something that God asked man (explicitly or otherwise) not to do, which allowed man to 'see' things that man could not see before.\n \n Now consider that at some point in time, God asked man to write down a few things so that men could have a reminder of who this God is. Perhaps men were becoming distracted from God because of all the things they could now see in the world (like possibly... power over others, the concept of accumulating wealth, claiming things for themselves... these are just ideas, not necessarily what those things were). Men could reason and think logically such that they could fool themselves into believing that this God they had heard about was just a story, not a reality. Afterall, where's the proof? (Remember in this paradigm, we are accepting that God IS real.) So God wanted to have something in writing so that any man who wanted to stay in touch with God could use as a guide.\n \n The people that God asked to transcribe God's thoughts were essentially no different than anyone else living at the time. They had a similar worldview as everyone else around them. The complex nature of the way God created the earth isn't fully understood by us today (and the more we learn, we realize we know less of what is really 'out there'), so you can imagine the level of understanding some 3 or 4 thousand years ago. So, either God simplified the story of how God created the universe in order for these men to understand. Or perhaps God told the full story, but the men had no concepts or words to be able to communicate the exact processes verbatim, so they made up the story as written in Genesis. The explanation is not important. What is important is that God created the world in some way, and man wrote down the story that we can read in Genesis. \n \n Perhaps God knew that once man became 'intelligent' enough to begin to unravel the mysteries of how the formation of the universe actually took place, then man would also be 'intelligent' enough to know that the story in Genesis was only a summary of the actual events, explained in a manner that made sense to people at the time. And for any man (today or before the knowledge was available) who hadn't yet discovered what specific processes had taken place in order to bring the universe to the point it is at today, the story in Genesis would be a sufficient reminder to them that God was all-powerful and God created the universe and somehow or other man fell from God's grace and therefore man needs to remember man's connection to God in order to stay connected with God for eternity.\n \n Okay... you can step back into whatever paradigm you normally operate from now.\n \n \n\"I was always of the opinion that faith is believing to the point of accepting as fact something that you know is not naturally possible or scientifically explainable. it takes no faith to believe that the world is 4.5 billion years if there is abundance evidence and logical support. however, being convinced without a doubt that Jesus simply was able to walk on liquid water, with no props or sleights, is an exercise of faith.\"\n\n If that's what faith means to you, then that's what faith means to you. But that doesn't mean that there are not other ideas of what faith means to someone.\n \n What I am going to offer now is merely one idea of how 'faith' may be perceived. The concept of faith may be the acceptance of this paradigm I painted above, without being able to prove one way or another whether God really does exist. Without stepping into this paradigm and accepting that God exists, then everything I suggested above is merely a story made up by man in order to believe in something. But if God does exist, and we accept God's existence by faith, then we view the world from a completely different perspective. We don't need faith to believe that the world is 4.5 billion years old if there is abundant evidence for it. But we do need faith to believe that there is a God that set this process of creation in motion 4.5 billion years ago.",

   "however, it leaves a lot of room for the question \"does God exist at all?\"\n\n Very true! That is a fundamental question in the matter. That's a question that may be asked by anybody, though, Christian or not. A Christian believes that God exists (through faith), but a Christian cannot objectively KNOW that God exists. Even if they say they KNOW... they only *believe* really, really, really strongly that they know -- for whatever reason, personal experience, revelation, fear, whatever... They don't know whether God exists anymore than you or I know.\n \n Consider this: It is a fact that God exists! In the sense that it must either be true or false. (But not in the sense of any one particular perspective of God exists exactly the same as that perspective -- Does that make sense?) We may someday 'know' whether or not God exists. If we die and go to 'heaven' and see God... well, there's our answer! If we die and... [nothingness]... By default, we have an answer.\n \n \n \nnow the questions that are obviously opened, such as: why would God not allow man to relay a more accurate story than the one in genesis? how can we know that any of these events really ever happened if the stories alleging they happened were made-up?

It would still come down to the same question of faith. Even now, without understanding all the universe -- with many things still unexplained, there is no NEED to believe in God. It will be the same when (if) everything someday IS explained. There will be no need to believe in God, but there still is the choice to believe in God if you want to. It is simply a matter of faith. Either God exists or God doesn't exist in some way, shape, or form. I choose to believe that God exists.\n \n Personally, I don't believe in God because I need to believe in something. I don't believe in God because I have a need to explain things that are unexplained. I don't believe in God out of fear that if I don't believe in God, I may spend eternity in hell. I don't believe in God BECAUSE of anything. I just believe that there is an objective God in existence. This God may 'look' or 'be' very different than what I perceive this God to be, and I'm willing to accept that. I also accept the possibility that this God doesn't really exist, and I'm okay with that. But I still believe in God. Why? Because I believe in God. :-)",

Some people offer God as the reason 'Why' evolution occurs. Christianity and evolution really have nothing to do with each other. Evolution is a theory for which there is much evidence as to how life changes over time. Christianity is the belief that each individual human being is in need of redemption through a savior -- alleged to have actually walked the earth, died on earth, and rose from the dead in atonement for the sins of humanity.

   "What do you define as the truth? Since you haven't I will, the truth being an explaination for everything.\n\n Okay... this fits. Pure science, by it's very nature, seeks an objective explanation for everything. Pure religion/spirituality I believe also seeks an objective explanation for everything. Neither pursuit has all the answers, and neither pursuit claims they have all the answers (though you may find individuals in either pursuit that claim they do). Individuals pursuing an explanation on either course may go about it in different ways... but if an objective explanation for anything exists, then both individuals may find the same answer one way or another.\n \n Consider, for a moment, an individual who holds to a strictly literal interpretation of the Bible. Consider, for a moment, that there is some sort of an all-powerful God, the essence of which this individual believes in. If this individual ever meets this God face-to-face, do you think this all-powerful God who created everything and can do anything God wants will allow the person to continue to believe the lie they've been believing all their life -- if, in fact, evolution is actually a process that occurs on earth? (And you and I both obviously believe that it does occur.) No! If this objective God that this individual was seeking all their life is real and is all-Truth, then this objective God cannot allow a mis-guided individual to continue to be mis-led (otherwise, this God would no longer be 'truth').\n \n Now, consider this same individual... seeking what they believe is an objective all-powerful God. They die and nothing happens or whatever... by default they 'know' that the objective God they believed in does not exist. They 'found' the truth... or the truth found them, as it were.\n \n \n \nHow is this seeking the truth in any form? Are you suggesting that Christianity is not a religion?\n\n A true Christian will desire to live with God for eternity. A true Christian believes that God equates to truth. A true Christian may believe that some of God's truth is revealed in the Bible, but a true Christian cannot reasonably claim that the Bible is the only truth that exists. God is the ultimate truth (in the faith system of Christians). Therefore, from the perspective I am putting forth, a true Christian is seeking the truth... seeking to live with God as Truth for eternity.\n \n \n \nOnly if you accept a figurative interpretation of the Bible. If you accept a literal interpretation, the lack of inclusion has implicit meaning.\n\n Okay... and nowhere does the Bible say that it must be interpreted literally. This is something that some individuals believe, but it is not an intrinsic part of Christianity itself.\n \n \nMoving away from dinosaurs, how about God creating the Earth before the Sun? Even in the figurative and literal interpretations this does not co-incide with what science tells us.\n\n You are still using a partially literal interpretation here. If the story in Genesis is simply a story to convey the message that God is all-powerful and created the earth out of nothingness, then it makes no difference what the details of the story are. The message is what is important. And the message doesn't contradict anything in science.\n \n Perhaps the 'truth' is that this 'God' that Christianity worships is nothing more than whatever natural 'force' scientists may one day discover 'created' the universe.\n \n \nAnother problem with your suggestion is that some religions (again using Christianity as an example) have a body of knowledge that they interpret as God's Word. It is forbidden to add to God's Word or change it if it becomes incorrect. You go by the assumption that everything that was written down was true for the people at the time of the writing (ie lack of knowledge) however, it is still accepted as fundamentally true in modern times when it has since been proven wrong and because of the limitations of these bodies of knowledge (ie the inability to modify them) what was once true is held as absolute, when proven that it isnt, examples being the 7 day creation story, the flood, etc.\n \n this is another instance where religion yields a seperate truth from science.\n\n This argument ignores the fact that not ALL truth can be contained in any book. The Bible cannot be 'incorrect' if it is intended to convey messages. It CAN be 'incorrect' if viewed as a history book or a science book. Christianity (using the term loosely) itself does not view it as a history book or a science book, even if some people who call themselves Christians claim that it is both.\n \n You seem to be getting caught up in making the Bible wrong. Or finding evidence to prove that anyone who 'believes' in the Bible is wrong. You are entitled to do so. I'm only here saying that there exists a point-of-view in which the Bible may be historically inaccurate, but the deeper message is still intact. And even very well-educated, very intelligent and scholarly people with far greater knowledge, experience and wisdom than you or I have recognize that this point-of-view is valid. Anyone can choose to believe in God. It need not take anything away from their rationality, logic or sound judgement. In fact, some people believe that all the scientific discoveries that are made every day make even more sense with a belief in an objective God.\n \n My entire point is that the two systems (science and religion) are NOT diametrically opposed, as many people on both 'sides' of the debate suggest. Though unless these people are able to shift their own perspective, at least momentarily, they may not ever be able to see how closely related the two concepts can be perceived to be. And that in reality, there is nothing inherent in the nature of either one that precludes 'belief' in the other one.",

I now believe that you are discussing the journey as opposed to the destination. Is this correct?\n\n This is on the same track as what I am saying, but I am taking one step farther back than even this.\n \n I am suggesting that IF there is such thing as an objective truth in the universe that is not dependent on anyone's perspective or belief system, then anyone seeking that objective truth, regardless of the path they take to get them there, will eventually end up with the same objective truth. The same destination.\n \n Assuming we are discussing the observable physical realm, it is a fact that certain events happened in the history of the universe to get us at the point we are at today. Those events have a cause. Whether the cause of those events is an entity that some people label as 'God' or whether it is simply the natural forces of the universe acting according to natural laws is unimportant from the perspective I am offering. The objective truth is that certain events have happened. Like, say, a one-celled organism that reproduced and created another one-celled organism that had an advantage in a particular environment, and so the offspring survived to reproduce, but the parent didn't (not sure if that's scientifically accurate, but you should get the idea). Either that event happened or it didn't. Whether or not a 'God' set everything in motion doesn't change the fact that it happened.\n \n Ultimately, we will all suffer the same physical fate. Our physical bodies will die. What happens beyond that to our 'mind' or our 'soul' (if such concepts are real), we have no way of knowing with certainty. Regardless of what any individual believes, it is still just that -- the belief of an individual. \n \n If such a God exists, it doesn't really matter whether you believe in this God or not. God still exists in some way, shape or form. If such a God does NOT exist, it doesn't really matter whether or not you believe in this God. God still doesn't exist, no matter how much you believe. Belief or non-belief in a God doesn't have anything to do (in my opinion) with science. There is no conflict. \n \n What I suspect you have a problem with (and you could say that I have a 'problem' with it as well) is that some individuals do not think for themselves and/or use 'God' as justification or a reason for a particular action or behavior or beliefs that do not fit observed truth. This is a broad and general statement, but it applies in the perceived dichotomy between science and religion. For someone who is truly seeking the truth, there can really be no conflict between observed phenomena and the truth that they are seeking. There can, however, be mis-understanding of said phenomena, which 'should' foster a desire to understand instead of promoting a mis-understanding. In terms of the topic of this particular forum, for anyone who is seeking the truth as a believer in God, there should be no true conflict with observed findings in the scientific community. If there is a true conflict that cannot be resolved through greater understanding, then one 'side' or the other clearly is not seeking an objective truth. One 'side' or the other is clearly fabricating supposed 'truths' that are really just 'beliefs.' And these 'beliefs' are evidently strong enough to cause the individual to ignore the truth that the other 'side' is seeking.\n \n Does this make any more sense now? Or perhaps I just confused matters more???",

   "I see what your suggesting, but I am confused by some of your statement still.\n \n 1. This seems to only deal with the creationist-evolutionist hybrid theory, many religions do not necessarily conform to this idea.\n \n 2. You seem to be suggesting that our belief of what is or is not true has no bearing specifically on the objective truth. This I agree with. However, I believe the discussion was not about what is THE TRUTH, but whether both religion and science are in the PURSUIT of TRUTH. To me, belief has a very large bearing on how we pursue the TRUTH. If we are confined to what we believe, how can we be objective? Religion at its heart is a system of beliefs about the universe. People who are truly religious hold their beliefs to be THE TRUTH (each person has individual beliefs to those of every other person). If we cannot be objective in our pursuit of truth how will we reach objective truth?\n \n \nWhether or not a 'God' set everything in motion doesn't change the fact that it happened\n \n \n We can state that \"something\" happened, but where does that get us in our quest for objective truth?
