Haer. 3.1.1, Irenaeus says: \"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church.\" We know that Irenaeus had read Papias, and it is most likely that Irenaeus was guided by the statement he found there.

   "When debating over the internet, specifically on issues like this, specific countries laws often prove more of a hindrance than a help. On a global level, the definition of marriage has changed. Gay people can now get married. You might not like it, but there it is. They might not be allowed in the US, but that doesn't mean the definition has not changed.\n \n\n I believe that I've been quite clear that I'm speaking about the US. emoticon_confused We have a law that defines marriage. It's usually referred to as DOMA (defense of marriage act). It states that marriage is legally defined as 1 man/1 woman ONLY.\n \n\n But why do you have a problem with it being called marriage? All it would be doing is changing your definition of the word, and I've seen no supporting arguments that would indicate that your definition is any better than anyone elses. Other places have already accepted the change, what reasons do you have for opposing it?\n\n \n No, you would be changing more than the meaning. You'd be changing the value of the term as well. And just because others do it makes for a lousy position in an argument. Didn't your parents ever tell you \"I don't care what others do, you aren't going to do it\"? :)",

What they often forget is that those traditional values included such things as slavery, the subjugation of women, the near-extermination of native peoples, racial and sexual discrimination, imperialism, and an almost complete disregard as to the protection of natural environment. Blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese were viewed as somewhat less than human, and Jews (in many cases) were prohibited from joining country clubs.

I can understand prohibiting train surfing or base diving. That gets people killed. I can understand prohibiting underground 'fight clubs'. People get injured, or worse. But gay marriage? Nope.\n \n \nSome states would recognize it, but not many.\n\n \n So if they got a civil union, then married by a religious ceremony in their own church, some states would accept that? By the by, how similar are the legal workings of a marriage and a civil union?\n \n \nAs I said before, marriage is a sacrament to many people.\n\n \n Sure. A sacrament being a formal religious act which confers grace on those who recieve or go through it.

A marriage is a formalised relationship between two people, recieving a medal is acknowledgment of actions above and beyond the call of duty. They are in all respects, completely different. The principle is completely different. Your analogy proposes that if everyone shares the same type of relationship, that relationship is meaningless.\n \n So, if everyone had a mother, the relationship between mother and child would be meaningless.\n \n Having a gay couple get married no more devalues your own marriage, or anyone elses, than having a hetro couple get married.
