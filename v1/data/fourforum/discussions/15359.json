   "The GOP's wrongheaded fixation on taxes - How the World Works - Salon.com\n \n \nThe GOP's wrongheaded fixation on taxes\n \n Republican presidential candidates are pushing radical tax agendas. But that's not what America wants, or needs \n \n The remaining survivors in the \"the incredible shrinking GOP presidential race\" are pushing a provocative array of \"unorthodox\" and radical economic platforms, Politico tells us today.\n \n Ron Paul wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve, Tim Pawlenty has signaled support for a return to the gold standard, and Herman Cain has advocated abolishing the IRS. And just about everybody -- excluding Mitt Romney -- has an exciting new tax plan. Cain is pushing a \"Fair Tax\" -- a hefty national sales tax that would replace both personal and corporate income taxes. Gingrich is pushing an \"optional\" 15 percent flat tax and Pawlenty is not far behind. Ron Paul wants to get rid of sales and income taxes, and fund a much smaller government solely via tariffs excise fees and property taxes.\n\n \n Cain is a nitwit. All the numbers on the \"fair tax\" line up wrong. It will not work the way we need it to, it is revenue negative, and it would not provide the steady revenue stream needed to fund out government OR keep our AAA credit rating. \n \n Pawlenty is also a nitwit. From what I can find, he intends to balance the budget by cutting \"entitlement spending\". If you dont own a calculator, you should not be allowed to run for president.\n \n Newt....not going to bother going over that bit of mental retardation. \n \n Pauls plan actually appeals to me. The problem with income taxes is the MASSIVE amount of wealth held by the top 10% of Americans. A property tax could hit those wealth reserves as well, not just the current year income. Think of it as payback for years of DRASTIC under taxation. \n \n It would be fairly simple, and is 100% constitutional. The founding fathers pretty much invented the modern idea of property taxes here in the US...it was remarkably different from anything the world had ever seen before. \n \n \nQuoting Grover Norquist high up in a story about taxes should be an automatic foul in the game of journalism. He is the very opposite of an impartial commentator. Not only is he always going to say the exact same thing: taxes are bad and everybody hates them, but the evidence we actually have suggests that he is simply not telling the truth.\n \n A poll conducted by the Associated Press in March found that a \"a small majority of Americans believe the taxes they pay are fair.\" A Reuters poll in early May indicated \"more than half of Americans say higher taxes should be part of a fix to tame the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt.\" A Washington Post poll in April found that a whopping 72 percent supported higher taxes on Americans making more than $250,000 a year.\n \n Every new Republican tax proposal, by the way, would end up lowering the tax burden on the richest Americans.\n \n And to top it off, a Pew poll on American priorities conducted in January did not list taxes in the top ten of American concerns: (in order: Economy, Jobs, Terrorism, Education, Social Security, Budget Deficit, Medicare, Health Care Costs, Health Care Legislation, Poor and Needy.)\n\n \n This is where reality and politics butt heads. The most vocal folks on the tax issue tend to be the \"STOP TAXES\" crowd. The folks with the most political pull are the wealthy. The LARGE silent majority get ignored.",

   "The title is a little misleading. Everyone should be fixated on taxes as that is the revenue part of a balanced budget. Clearly our fiscal house is a big problem currently facing the US which effects everything from national security to health care to retirement. \n \n One question in my mind is how we measure these things. What I mean is that if you look at tax revenue as a % of GDP it really has remained at around 17-18% for a long time and only recently been very low (since 2009). Spending as a % of GDP is around 22% and has remained above 20% for some time. A good question is does \"% of GDP\" really give us a good story on what tax levels should be. On a per capita basis tax revenue per capita has doubled since 1960 while spending per capita has tripled. Is that a good measure? \n \n Perhaps the measure doesn't matter at all. Perhaps we just need to figure out what we want our federal government to do and then tax accordingly. \n \n Either way, a 'fixation' on taxes IS proper and so should a fixation on spending.",

   "That Article also goes on to say.. and I quote..\n \n \"Every new Republican tax proposal, by the way, would end up lowering the tax burden on the richest Americans.\"\n \n Which only shows me that once again the GOP/Teabaggers are concerned only with taking care of the richest 10% of the Country.\n \n At one time I might have supported Ron Paul , almost voted for him in 2008, but as of late he seems to have gone off the deep end and is quickly becoming more radical than the most radical Teabagger. I could no longer trust any plan he has to offer .\n \n The way I see it there is a very simple solution to the Problem we are faced with, Go back to the Tax rates we were under in the late 90's up until Bush was elected. The GOP/Teabaggers have convinced Americans that Entitlements are the cause of much of our problems when in reality that isn't the case. When Bush took office we had an annual surplus of 230 billion dollars and spending was under control. Social Security had a huge surplus and was solvent for the next 70 years . We didn't have the need to run up the Deficits because we were taking in enough revenue to continue paying the bills and eventually our national debt would have been paid off. \n \n The Problem started because of failed policies put into place by Bush The biggest being his massive tax cuts across the board which in turn cut the revenues . I'm sure his initial policies might not have been so bad had we not suffered the devastating 9/11 attacks. When Bush and Congress decided to enter us into 2 wars they should have seen the shortfall in revenues coming head on, but instead they continued as if it wasn't a concern. Then the increased spending spree started and for the next 6 years Bush drove us into a ditch. Then Obama comes in and although we all know he inherited a train wrecked economy, his early policies only made things worse. Instead of keeping to his Promise of change he continued the spending spree falsely thinking he could spend his way out of the mess. \n \n Now here we are.. The Social Security Surplus has been Borrowed down to nothing, and the GOP is now claiming this is our problem. Social Security and Medicare are only a Problem because the failed Policies over the past 11 years has made Entitlements a problem. The GOP flat refuses to consider ANY increase in taxes.. Even on the heals of a current poll that shows more than half of Americans agree Taxes should be raised.\n \n Americans back tax increases in debt fix: Reuters poll | Reuters\n \n Personally I believe the solution is more simple than our Government is willing to do. Return us to the 2000 tax rates and try to agree on some reduced spending. Cutting Entitlements is not going to solve this problem. Our problem is that we are not taking in enough revenue to pay the current bills so we are forced to keep borrowing, thus increasing our debt. \n \n All the republican Ideas mentioned in this article are like you said, ignorant. But to be honest Unless The Left Grows a pair and does something to increase revenues we're going to continue on a downward spiral into Bankruptcy.",

Paul has been the most consistent congressman in a long time. \n \n \nThe GOP/Teabaggers have convinced Americans that Entitlements are the cause of much of our problems when in reality that isn't the case. \nReally? Unfunded entitlements aren't the problem? They may not be all of it but certainly half or more.\n \n \nWhen Bush took office we had an annual surplus of 230 billion dollars and spending was under control. Social Security had a huge surplus and was solvent for the next 70 years .\n Depends on how you look at it. The deficit went up each and every year under Clinton. You get away with a balanced budget by doing 2 things...working on a cash basis \"on budget\" budget and using the social security balance to pay for non-social security related programs. \n \n \nWe didn't have the need to run up the Deficits because we were taking in enough revenue to continue paying the bills and eventually our national debt would have been paid off. \nNo, this isn't true. Not only that, the goal shouldn't necessarily be to pay off the debt. A certain amount of debt is fine depending on the nature of the debt.\n \n \nThe Problem started because of failed policies put into place by Bush The biggest being his massive tax cuts across the board which in turn cut the revenues.\nI'd argue this was the second worse problem. Medicare Part D was the first and much more expensive one. \n \n \nWhen Bush and Congress decided to enter us into 2 wars they should have seen the shortfall in revenues coming head on, but instead they continued as if it wasn't a concern.\ntwo wars would have been somewhat fine (in comparison) if not for the 2 mentioned policies above...hard to believe. \n \n \nInstead of keeping to his Promise of change he continued the spending spree falsely thinking he could spend his way out of the mess. \nHe basically thought he could one up Bush. Apparently we need to start reading the fine print when someone says \"change\". \n \n \nNow here we are.. The Social Security Surplus has been Borrowed down to nothing, and the GOP is now claiming this is our problem. Social Security and Medicare are only a Problem because the failed Policies over the past 11 years has made Entitlements a problem.\nNo, this was since 1965...not just 11 years. Yes, bush made it worse with Part D and Clinton, somewhat, with Part C. \n \n \nThe GOP flat refuses to consider ANY increase in taxes.. Even on the heals of a current poll that shows more than half of Americans agree Taxes should be raised.\nAnd the Democrats refuse any cuts to entitlements. I'll explain more below.\n \n \nPersonally I believe the solution is more simple than our Government is willing to do. Return us to the 2000 tax rates and try to agree on some reduced spending. Cutting Entitlements is not going to solve this problem. Our problem is that we are not taking in enough revenue to pay the current bills so we are forced to keep borrowing, thus increasing our debt. \nIf you return to 2000 tax rates you will raise maybe an extra 150-200 billion a year. Now what trillion would you like to cut to balance the budget? I'm not opposed to raising the rates but it is not realistic to think cutting entitlement and dramatically reducing other spending is not needed. \n \n You seem to think this is just a revenue problem. Our country has historically raised 17-18% of GDP in tax revenue and aside from the last 2 years it has been at 17%. Our spending is upwards of 23% of GDP these days up from the historical 18-19% and has been over 20% for much of the last decade. \n \n At some point you just have to decide what you want government to do and fund that. Frankly, taxing people to fund unrealistic entitlement programs is a poor way to run a country but it can be done if the people choose that.",

Spending cuts do need to coincide with raising taxes, but even that may not be enough. They also need to restructure the corporate taxes and close a lot of the loopholes that allow Billion dollar corporations to go basically tax free. They need to eliminate subsidies to Billion dollar oil companies and corporate subsidies for tax purposes. There are many areas they can Cut without even bothering to cut Social Security. Medicare Part D and C are both huge failures and should be eliminated. I also believe they should invest a little more into regulating Medicare , they could save billions if they were more strict on Medicare Fraud.

Military and defense spending is discretionary . The Government needs to cut Discretionary spending and increase revenues, that's the simply solution. The mandatory spending is only a problem because the government has made it a problem by over spending in other areas. I don't agree that cutting entitlement programs is the answer, although they do need to restructure the programs to make some cuts. They won't solve this at the current level of incoming revenues. \n \n Note: As part of the Bush Tax cut extension this past 2010 the Employee part of Social Security taxes was reduced by 2% through 2011. So of course when you reduce the amount of Money coming into Social security it makes it easier to claim social security is the problem.",

They need to eliminate subsidies to Billion dollar oil companies and corporate subsidies for tax purposes. \nWe need to ask the question of whether or not raising the corporate tax rate or fixing \"loopholes\" (a misnomer) is realistic. Back in the 60s corporate tax revenue was 6% of GDP and now is 2%. This shows you are right. BUT, back in the 60s it was much harder to use overseas accounts and move money between countries due to lack of electronic communications and data storage. We need to be pretty positive that jacking up corporate taxes will even raise revenue or just make GE higher more accountants to direct revenue into countries overseas such as Ireland and Bahamas. \n \n Personally, I don't know the answer to this question. \n \n \nThere are many areas they can Cut without even bothering to cut Social Security. Medicare Part D and C are both huge failures and should be eliminated.\nYeah, but we should cut it anyway. It is just an unrealistic program. We've talked about it before. It needs to go back to what it originally was, a welfare program. \n \n \nI also believe they should invest a little more into regulating Medicare , they could save billions if they were more strict on Medicare Fraud.

Some leave defense out which is wrong. \n \n \nAnd as far as Ron Paul.. He might have been the most consistent at one time but when he ran in 2008 I didn't hear him talk about things like eliminating FEMA,\nThan you weren't listening. In fact, this proves how consistent he is. He is right that there is no where in the constitution that would allow for FEMA.

America has grown up and many of these programs and policies are reflective of the advancement of us as a Nation. Apparently Ron Paul needs to change his Political party and run as a Teabagger.. since he seems to want to go backwards in time.\n The argument that the USA has \"grown up\" is a red herring in the argument of whether or not something is constitutional. The language of the law doesn't morph as something ages. For example your rental contract doesn't morph the longer you stay in the building. The reason for this is 1) who decides how it changes and 2)There is no consideration for the change. The powers of congress listed in the constitution were decided and voted on by a group of people. They understood what they were getting. Basically if you have someone else come along and change that without using the prescribed methods of change you are breaking the law.\n \n The constitution is flexible in that it allows for new methods of something to come up. For example the 2nd amendment doesn't say \"muskets\" it says \"arms\"; the first amendment doesn't say \"hand written speech\" it just says \"speech\". This allows for new arms and new forms of speech to be covered. Furthermore, should someone want to change the constitution we have an Article specifically for doing that. \n \n So Ron Paul basically wants to go back to the constitution before we messed things up which, indeed, would be a huge departure from where we are now. Personally, that is a scary approach in my book. I like the idea of the end result but that \"one motion\" concept instead of taking a few years to undue the damage is harsh.",
