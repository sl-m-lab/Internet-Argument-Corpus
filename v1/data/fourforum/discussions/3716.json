This implies that dinosaurs are not as old as the evolutionists suggest and thus provides evidence for the Bible's account that man was created with the dinosaurs on day six of the creation week only 6,000 years ago (literal 24 hr days).\n\n In another message you told me to take off my old age glasses and look at the evidence from a creationist point of view. It seems that the creationist point of view is to reach the conclusion first, motivated by a belief that mythology is fact, and then selectively distort the facts in order to reach the previously determined conclusion.\n \n We could go down your list of debunked claims one by one and debunk them one more time, but creationists tend to ignore any evidence that shows that they are wrong and don't seem inclined to correct, replace or remove such debunked assertions. Take for example the part of your post that I quote above. You furnish a link to a page by Carl Wieland that is demonstrably wrong, and yet, hasn't been corrected or replaced. It still makes the false claim of the discovery of red blood cells in unfossilized dinosaur bone. Of the three (yes, only three) sources cited in the AiG article, only one of them is from a non-creationist source. One of those creationist sources claims two \"secular\" sources according to Wieland's note, but one wonders why Wieland didn't actually consult the \"secular\" sources rather than the distorted creationist version. Why does he report what a creationist magazine said about the sources rather than what the sources said?\n \n And the one non-creationist source that Wieland does use is not a scientific paper from peer reviewed literature, but an article by two of the researchers recounting their personal feelings and experiences. Why didn't Wieland cite the actual scientific papers (3 of them)?\n \n Here's why. No one found red blood cells or hemoglobin as you and Wieland claim. That is certainly not what the scientists themselves claimed. The scientists claimed to have found evidence of degraded hemoglobin fragments and structures which might represent altered blood remnants. Isn't it funny how creationists object to evolution being presented as fact when in this case the scientists themselves were quite tentative about what their observations mean while the creationists are claiming facts that aren't in evidence.\n \n Further error by Wieland is his claim that the dinosaur bone was not fossilized. It was. It was the interior parts of the bone that were not permineralized. In other words, the structure of the bone had been mineralized but the spaces that exist in living tissue had not been filled with minerals. While it may be correct to say that the bone was not completely fossilized, it is by no means correct to state that it is \"unfossilized.\"\n \n Moreover, the age of the bone has been supported by the amino racemization dating technique.\n \n I reccommend that interested parties read Dino-blood and the Young Earth by Gary S. Hurd, Ph.D. Dr. Hurd has the advantage of having read the scientific literature, having a doctorate in an appropriate field (archaeology), and having worked as Curator of Anthtopology at a large Natural History Museum. Carl Wieland is a medical doctor who has not practiced medicine in over 18 years and has no experience in anthropology, paleontology, geology, or theoretical biology.\n \n As has been pointed out by joebrummer, most of the \"evidence\" that you present in support of creationism isn't. It is rather arguments against the science that you cannot fit into your dogma. You claim that there are no undisputed transitional fossils and give a link to a page with frauds that were never accepted by science and some fossils that are most certainly transitional. The page merely defines them out of existance by claiming that a transitional is half one type animal and half another. A transitional between a dinosaur and a bird would, according to a creationist, have half a wing that would be useless for walking and useless for flying. But the page doesn't explain how an animal without a beak, with many sharp teeth, with unfused trunk vertebrae, with a long tail composed of free vertebrae, with no uncinate processes, with no carina, with free metacarpals, with free metatarsals, with a preorbital fenestra, with claws on the digits of the forelimbs, with a fully developed fibula, with gastralia, and with only a small, underdeveloped furcula can be a bird. No bird living today (let me repeat that, NO BIRD) has any of the above characteristics, and yet the page that you link claims that the fossil of such an animal is a bird. Of course, the fact that of the 7 skeletal fossils discovered, 2 were classified as dinosaurs and a third as a pterosaur. The animal looked like a dinosaur with feathers - and of course, we now know that many theropod dinosaurs did have feathers.",

ROTFLOL! That is the most stupidest thing I have ever heard. As I have explained in the simplest way possible, the evidence does not speak for itself! It must be interpreted by people with starting beliefs, such as naturalism or Christianity. If you already believe that everything was made by natural processes, then you will - after looking at the evidence - come to that conclusion. Similarly, Christian Creationists will also come to the conclusion that the Bible is true and that the universe was created by God as is described in Genesis.

Everyone has their bias, for example, when evolutionists bring up \"Talk Origins\", as pandion did in the previous post, he/she is looking at an evolutionarly biased site. Talk Origins is reknown for concealing the truth in order to save their BELIEF in evolutionism, e.g. the fact that there is no observed 3rd stage SNR in the universe.\n \n The evidence that AiG has brought up in their articles, an evolutionist could say the opposite not because AiG are wrong, but because they have different interpretations of the evidence to the evolutionist.",

Then, if they were both rocky planets they would melt together and throw chunks everywhere, then yeah, probably all life would die no matter what because things would be so hot.

   "Oh, sure, the planets would all go careening off on straight trajectories, but the earth, merely due to its size and composition produces heat from the inside, and would keep most vulcanism going, so the things living around the thermal vents (and bacteria living in the rocks and soil themselves) might still keep ticking somehow.\n \n The planets are so far away from each other that once they started off on their straight lines would have little chance of hitting one another, BUT they would have a gravitational pull on each other and may eventually end up orbiting one another until, one day, BANG. Then, if they were both rocky planets they would melt together and throw chunks everywhere, then yeah, probably all life would die no matter what because things would be so hot. But once everything settled down you'd have an even LARGER rocky planet with even MORE heat at the middle (and a few moons perhaps from the chunks).\nDream on, brother! The earth doesn't produce heat. It is a cooling mass whose heat energy came from whatever source the original materials came from. There is no self sustaining nuclear reaction taking place inside the earth \"producing\" heat. The earth would eventually cool to absolute zero.

   "Hello everyone, I read this forum from time to time but do not post (I used to post on the old forums)\n \n Anyway, I have something to add here. The heat flow system within the earth is complex and not well understood, but some basic concepts are known.\n \n Most of the earth's radioactive elements are concentrated within the continental crust. These are thought to have been differentiated from the rest of the earth at a time early after its formation when the earth as a whole was much hotter and most of the material was molten. These radioactive elements are often found within minerals in felsic rocks that tend to be less dense than the mafic and ultra mafic rocks that make up the majority of the mantle. They are concentrated into granites and other felsic rocks forming much of the Precambrian basement you can see today. The crust of the earth is relatively thin, anywhere from 15 - 80 km thick (I think the average is 40). So, the heat produced by radioactive elements is really only substantial in the crustal regions of the earth, in areas underlain with a Precambrian basement of granites are other igneous rocks. The contribution to heat from radioactive decay in oceanic crust is minor (mafic and ultramafic material). In the oceans the heat flow escaping the surface is almost entirely from deep within the earth. However, on Continents the contribution of heat from radioactive decay in the crust is about 50 %, the other 50% comes from heat transferred from deeper within the earth.\n \n The heat from within the earth is not as well understood. One idea (most commonly used on heat flow calculations) is that much of the heat within the earth is latent from earths formation. Heat is also produced from compression and friction from the enormous convective processes that occur within the mantle, and by the stretching of squeezing caused as the earth travels through an elliptical orbit around the sun (by gravity). Heat flow is a VERY slow process, and if it wasn't for a convective mantle heat flow escaping from the surface of the earth would be much less. That being said, the heat released from the surface of our planet is still painstakingly slow. It is a wrong assumption that I often come across to believe that the earth would have entirely cooled if not for radioactive elements. There is an enormous amount of heat within the earth, which can only escape as fast as heat can be transferred from the mantle to the surface. \n \n So, yes the earth is cooling down (very slowly), yes radioactive elements contribute much to our heat flow but only on continents, and no the earth would not be cool if not for heat generated from radioactive decay.\n \n Another intriguing idea that has come about is that the core of the earth is not a nickel- iron alloy as is commonly believed, but that it is a uranium core generating heat for our plant through radioactive decay. This idea is relatively new, and it fits with our current heat flow models, however, there is little to no evidence that an enormous concentration of Uranium could exist there. Another hurdle to jump before accepting this idea as theory is to come up with a reason why so much Uranium should exist within our planet. This would suggest that Uranium is much more common in our part of the galaxy, which has not been observed even indirectly yet.",

   "Hello everyone,\n \n Yes, pnac has it correct, it is a process called \"differentiation\" where elements or minerals are separated from a magma because of their different densities. It should be noted that the Uranium Core theory is still just a hypothesis and not a widely accepted theory... I just brought it up for interest, and yes there are many problems with it (hence the reason why it has as not replaced the Iron Nickel core idea).\n \n To summarize: some of the heat in the Earth comes from physical sources like the Earth's accretion, collisions with large bodies after accretion (moon), and friction from the formation of the core, as well as from radio active decay. However, the concentration of radioactive elements in the mantle is not as high as you seem to be implying. We can directly (sort of) sample rocks from the crust and the mantle and compare the relative abundance of radioactive elements. What is noted is that the crust contains much a much higher density of these radioactive elements than the mantle. That is why so much more heat is found escaping an area on the continents vs, the ocean floor. This has been measured to great accuracy. Differentiation of the felsic minerals (that tend to like to bond with U,K and Th) is a process that is believed to created our felisic ratioactive element rich crust that we see today.\n \n Also, because we know the chemical characteristics of the radioactive elements we can calculate how much heat is produced by radioactivity in the mantle, and crust. Once we know this we can work back and calculate how much heat should be produced by the other physical processes mentioned above, and how much heat should be escaping the earth at any given time today. And these calculations match our measurements well.\n \n As for P-waves, it should be understood that to keep our models matching the reality that the earth's mean density is about 5.5 g/cm^3 a hypothetical Uranium core does not replace the entire core, only the very center of it since Uranium is so dense. Therefore, whole earth topographic studies (P-waves, S-waves and stuff you may recognize) would be a poor tool to evaluate whether or not a small region in the center of the earth is very dense, because of limits in:\n \n 1) P-wave-S-wave conversion at the core mantle boundary, \n 2) High index of refraction at the core mantle boundary causing muted regions in the center of the earth\n 3) The large size of model blocks in topographic studies, limited by the geometry and data in these surveys.\n \n To get back on track, yes the earth is slowly cooling. But it won't cool for a very long time (you don't have to worry about it).",

   "Interesting question, I quess I would have to say that for creationism to lay claim to proof then it would have to be defined as a theory of science. There are two major aspects of creationist thought; natural history and natural science. \n \n Natural History\n \n The originally created 'kinds' in the Genesis account of creation describe living creatures as being fully formed between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. Even more recently there was a global flood that killed all but a small group of selected creatures that in turn went on the repopulate the earth and produce the great diversity and continuing development of living systems in our world. Creationism relies on a rapid rise of biodiversity in ecosytems and could rightfully called a more radical phylogeny of living systems. It is a rejection of the modern synthesis due allmost exclusivly to its incompatability with Darwinian gradualism over millions of years. \n \n Natural Science\n \n Creationism is a worldview that sees the creation of the original living creatures as being a divine fiat and the original genotypes being a closed system of self perpetuating systems. It places strick limits on the role of mutations in adaptation, speciation and the continued progession toward the perfection of the original creation. Major changes in the gene pool are either random variations of the original genetic makeup of living systems or degenerative effects upon it.\n \n Creationism is inextricably linked to the historicity of related and unrelated events described in the pages of Scripture. Creationism is a uniquely American movement that considers the single common ancestor model to be a violation of the first amendment prohibition against the establishment of one religious view over another. Creationism is the only alternative to the naturalistic explanations of evolutionary biology with regards to our origins. \n \n For an examination of the evidence for creationism it must be determined where the line is drawn between creation science and main stream evolutionary biology. The fact is that the evidence is the same for both of them but what the evidence actually proves is a major epistomological quandry that must be clarified in no uncertain terms",
