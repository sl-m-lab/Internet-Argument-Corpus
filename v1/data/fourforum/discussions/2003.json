   "(How long has it been since 'American Values' meant to you what they still mean to me, if ever... ?) emoticon_idea \n \n President Bush,\n First, I wish I could thank you for your dedicated public service and faithful representation of your affected constituents, but your actions have afforded your own dishonorable reputation... The operations of yourself and your staff do not go unobserved... As I'm sure you are (all) very busy addressing a number of issues and responsibilities, I will explain my concerns as clearly as possible with brevity in mind.\n It is my belief, along with others and our nation's forefathers, that a clear line must be drawn between government and religion for the sake of equanimity among American citizens. --I'm sure you're familiar with the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights. Despite the obvious difficulties in drawing that line, we cannot fail to persevere. I am aware that the majority of our nation is comprised of a myriad of Christian denominations whom are, for the most part, adamant against the allowance of same-sex marriage based on their religious beliefs. We also have populations of Buddhists, Muslims, Jews and many more religious sects that contribute to our social make-up. To allow the influence of any one religion in our legislation without basis or merit for improving the state of society as a whole, is perilous and unjust and evidence of a desire (prevalent in many religions) to force dissenting individuals to congregate unto its own tenets; clearly in discord with traditional American ideals. To allow this would herald the assumption that the government practices favoritism which is in direct conflict with our desire to be nondiscriminatory. Religion should not dictate the laws of our governance. I hasten to add that a good number of lawful allowances and legal practices are in direct disharmony with popular religious faith and have not crippled the functions of society. Our laws, as well as our people, acknowledge that as time passes, our understanding and tolerance of new ideas expand, and the subsequent changes are enfolded into the fabric of our daily lives as necessary. In keeping with our predecessor's convictions, I have no outward conflict with peaceful persons wishing to pursue their own paths to happiness even if the doctrines of our beliefs require different means to the same end. The United States of America has always prided itself for its disinterest in unifying the many convictions of its people based on its effective tolerance of inevitable differences.\n There is no proof that same-sex marriage is dangerous or detrimental to society. Homosexuality, the usual premise for the desire to marry a member of the same sex, has been in existence since humanity itself and has never interfered with the pursuit of happiness by heterosexuals. (If it did, the argument would work in reverse.) Same-sex marriage should fall into the same parameters as opposite-sex marriage with regards to age, consent, and regulation. Same-sex marriage is the officiating of homosexual relationships --relationships long since in existence. The assumption that the officiating of same-sex relationships will suddenly undermine the foundation of marriage is preposterous and unfounded. I myself am not homosexual, nor do I desire to marry a member of the same sex; however, I do not feel I am accorded the right to deny homosexuals their right to marry or their right to legal protections. The U.S. Constitution does not disallow the matrimonial union of man and man or woman and woman. We must not forget, it is the responsibility of our elected officials to serve their communities comprised of individuals protected by the Constitution. And it is the responsibility of the citizen to ensure that our elected officials continue to serve us, and our Constitution continues to protect us... all. \n The U.S. Constitution should only require amending if its edicts have proven ineffectual and unequitable... and that is not the case. Rights witheld are meant for the employment of justice against civil wrongdoers for the protection of fellow citizens. Love between two consenting adults is no crime and merits no punishment. I will continue to impart my convictions until you act in accordance with the will of the people and their protections. For whether my neighbor is a child, a criminal, a Christian, a racist, a veteran, or a homosexual; he or she above all else, should remain in the eyes of our government --an American-- deserving of that which we are all promised, the inalienable right to \"Liberty, Life, & the Pursuit of Happiness\".\n I remain...\n \n An American Forever,\n R.K.W.

   "Behavior, Discrimination, and Marriage\n \n Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. Myself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior. Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don't pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. We pass laws that we feel will protect society or advance a public interest. When there were laws in place banning interracial marriages, the laws were based on race. Jim Crow laws and every other law that based application on race are considered unconstitutional because they regulated race.\n Now every law we have now regulates behavior we feel is in the public interest. All laws are morally based. We say it's illegal to sell drugs. It is unlawful to be publicly lewd. It is permissible to sell pornography. Our laws are based upon our morals however we feel is right. Many times it doesn't make sense to everyone but it's what our legislatures believes is right and moral and therefore passes laws. We pass laws on the thought \"what is right for one is right for all.\" If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that. The legislature defines what is moral not the courts. They define it by the laws. When a court makes new laws they exceed their power. They should only interpret the law not create it. \n Many argue that it is not behavior but genetic. There is no definitive evidence that suggest homosexuality is genetic. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is to suggest that other behavior disorders are genetic. There are however thousands of \"gays\" who have changed. Many say that those that have changed were really not gays. If that is the case then drug addicts that quit were really never addicts.\n The fact is that we decide what should be moral by what we consider legal. Many make the argument that passing a marriage amendment would be discriminatory. If that is true everything in the constitution would be discriminatory. The constitution discriminates against naturalized citizens and citizens born outside the US from becoming President. It discriminates against citizens under 18 from voting. It discriminates against everyone from making Presidential appointments. It's full of discrimination. A constitutional amendment would guarantee that all men and women have the right to marry. It would give a gay woman as much a right to marry a man, as a straightl man to marry a woman. It is not discriminatory. It limits our behavior. We cannot marry multiple times, relatives, or same sex. It applies to everyone equally. Everyone has the same rights.\n Many do not believe that the institution of marriage is worth saving. They point out to the 50% divorce rate and the short lived marriages of celebrities. They point to the infidelity of spouses and various other problems with marriage. The fact is that most marriages do succeed. People that divorce, generally divorce multiple times skewing the 50% ratio. The fact that people fail at marriage does not necessitate lowering the standard of marriage. People that point to failing marriages and asking we lower our standards is like pointing to failing grades and asking schools to lower their standards. We should tighten up the requisites of marriage to ensure it isn't trivialized.\n Marriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too. Today we see many relatives and friends living together because financially or for health reasons cannot afford to live alone. They share the bills and grow to love each other. The love is not a passionate love of attraction. Shouldn't they have the same rights as gay couples? If we are to give gay couples \"rights\", give it to everyone. There are more that need it then gays. What makes them deserve it anymore than anyone else? Marriage is a commitment that men make to women and women to men to love them and provide for them and their children regardless of what happens. Marriage protects that commitment couples make to their wives and children. It is something that spans all cultures, races, and genders. We need to protect that not trivialize it.

And I am not offended by the concept that the fight for gay's equality is any different from the fight for non-white's equality. Different characters, same-old story. \n \n #1b I think you tried to make the assumption (hard to tell since your P.O.V.s were all over the place) that being gay is a \"behavior\" and not a biological predisposition. Current scientific studies, particularly in the Anthropology field, do not support that assumption. [If you don't believe me, I can have a fellow anthropology student from our university pull up the collected scientific data she's been compiling (with the help of a well-respected professor at our school with a Phd in the field) for her gay studies project in the works for over 2 semesters now. Or you could always bother to research it yourself.] As for your claims that thousands of homosexuals returned to heterosexuality because they simply decided to, I seriously doubt there's a shred of fact in that statement. I haven't come across any data or reports of that \"phenomenon\" and I'm a Sociology/Anthropology major and make it a point to remain informed. In addition, they have not found a \"gay gene\" (meaning, not genetic), only biological correlations and chemical environments present in the womb contributing to later-emerging homosexuality. (For your own sake, know what you're talking about before you talk about it.) \n \n #2 Marriage is not a commitment to your children. It is a commitment to a consenting, adult PARTNER. If it was a commitment to your children, then divorcing your partner would involve divorcing your children --and it doesn't. My parents divorced and I don't feel as though a commitment to me has been abandoned by either parent.\n \n As for your comments about disallowing gays the right to marry because there are friends and family that live with other friends and family for support (non-sexual relationships)... that simply lacks explanation or a correlation to the topic at hand. I'm not sure what you're trying to validate. However, I think I understand where you might be heading with that. I used to live with two roommates, and we all had to struggle together to make ends meet, and never did we feel we were owed some sort of \"cohabitational acknowledgement\" by the government in the form of tax breaks and medical care. Even if we did, what's that got to do with marriage? \n \n You also seem to assume the only reason that gays want the right to marry is for legal validation regarding medical & social benefits. Nay. It's often about love, which is pretty much the same reason your average American marries. \n \n And what is this new practice of the 'executive branch doing the job of the legislative branch' you purport? Did I miss something on C-Span?! Since when did the courts determine our laws? What on earth are you talking about?\n \n You have a poor argument (if that's what you want to call it). Your use of the word discrimination has been severely misapplied and your metaphors refute your own positioning. The lack of factual basis for most of your generalizations argue against you far better than I could.\n \n No dice, but better luck next time. emoticon_xbye",

   "I have finals these next two weeks so I'm not going to respond but you really irritated me with your under thought assertions and specualtion that you think means anything wiht your study of an undergraduate degree. For your information I'm working on my fourth degree, graduate degree. I don't want to use it to bolster my argument because when I say something its \"Res Ipsa Loquitur\" (The thing speak for itself). Using your credentials holds no grounds because whatever field you're in there is no consensus on anything unless it's a fact.\n \n \nThroughout all of your rambling, two of your assumptions stand out to me and they have been 'bolded' for quick reference.\n \n #1a (which is actually subdivided) I am biracial. And I am not offended by the concept that the fight for gay's equality is any different from the fight for non-white's equality. Different characters, same-old story. \n \n\n \n Yeah under what about polygamist or consensual incestial behavior. Race and behavior are not the same. Homosexuality- that is behavior. Race- physical and cannot be changed\n \n \n \n\n #1b I think you tried to make the assumption (hard to tell since your P.O.V.s were all over the place) that being gay is a \"behavior\" and not a biological predisposition. Current scientific studies, particularly in the Anthropology field, do not support that assumption.

In addition, they have not found a \"gay gene\" (meaning, not genetic), only biological correlations and chemical environments present in the womb contributing to later-emerging homosexuality. (For your own sake, know what you're talking about before you talk about it.) \n \n\n \n Dang you're little statement cost you all credibility. You didn't do any research and you spoke without any facts.\n First things first you told me \"For your own sake, know what you're talking about before you talk about it\". \n Let's see what you said that shows you have no idea what you're talking about.\n \n Anthropology-1 : the science of human beings; especially : the study of human beings in relation to distribution, origin, classification, and relationship of races, physical character, environmental and social relations, and culture\n 2 : theology dealing with the origin, nature, and destiny of human beings\n according to Webster dictionary\n \n Anthropology is the study of humans ( as in mankind) not the human body. They are not experts about biological, physiological, or anatomical elements of the human bodies. Those are MDs and psychiatrist MDs and similiar fields. That';s alright becasue you know everything becasue you're in college. Look up the difference in courses that anthropolgist take compared to pre-med. I doubt they take one chemistry class. That's alright becaue you're studying sociology and anthropolgy. Yeah the two majors that are consdered one of the easiest.\n \n Like I said again there is no definitive evidence that homosexuality is a genetic or biological. There could be correlation for a study to prove that homsexuality is genetic. Just like the tobacco industries studies taht smoking isn't harmful. The studie you refer to are to speculative and if they were definitive then ti would be accepted as fact but guess what... it's not. Now for my evidence.\n \n \"The most recent study was reported by Nicolosi, Byrd and Potts in 1998. The study was conducted in 1996. The authors received survey responses from 882 people either during conversion therapy or having completed therapy. About half of the respondents had taken counseling from a professional with the other half from either a ministry source or they had tried to change on their own. Nearly half of those individuals who viewed themselves as exclusively homosexual made some shift in sexual orientation toward heterosexuality. Eighteen percent viewed themselves as exclusively heterosexual after therapy. The remainder viewed themselves as more heterosexual than homosexual. While this is an impressive result given that the professional associations say change can't happen, some might lament that the numbers aren't higher. I need to point out that not all of the clients in the study had completed their work and remember about 15% of the group had never taken any therapy. Also, a statistically significant number of respondents indicated that the therapy had been helpful them in a variety of ways. There was no indication of widespread harm caused by reorientation therapy per se.\" \n \n http://www.oneby1.org/resources/reorientation_possible.html\n What can we conclude about the biology of homosexuality? Consider a comprehensive review article, \"Human Sexual Orientation: The Biological Theories Reappraised,\" written by William Byne and Bruce Parsons from Columbia University in 1993. \n \n The article reviews 135 research studies, prior reviews, academic summaries, books, and chapters of books-in essence the entire literature on homosexuality, of which only a small portion is actual research. The abstract summarized in its findings that there is no evidence at present to substantiate that biological factors are the primary basis for sexual orientation. \n \n Whatever genetic contribution to homosexuality exists, it probably contributes not to homosexuality per se, but rather to some other trait that makes the homosexual \"option\" more readily available to some than others. \n \n http://www.family.org/fofmag/pp/a0024032.cfm\n \n Research on sexual orientation does not support such a view. There is no evidence that sexual orientation is in-born or obligatory. \n \n http://www.gcc.edu/news/faculty/editorials/throckmorton_milking_7_28_03.htm\n \n These are all education or non-profit cites. All by several doctors, not PHD's but doctors that actually study the body.As you can see there is mroe proof than you thought. Thanks for doing your research. Also here at my school almost all the teachers have their PHD and they all disagree with your professors. There are various ones that are considered the leaders of their fields even the anthropology field. \n \n \n \"I seriously doubt there's a shred of fact in that statement.\"\n \n So here's some links to help you! \n \n http://www.exodus-international.org/default.asp\n \n http://www.newdirection.ca/stories.htm\n \n \n \n \n \n #2 Marriage is not a commitment to your children. It is a commitment to a consenting, adult PARTNER. If it was a commitment to your children, then divorcing your partner would involve divorcing your children --and it doesn't. My parents divorced and I don't feel as though a commitment to me has been abandoned by either parent.\n \n\n \n Marriage is also a committment to the children. When a single mother marries the husband is obligated to care for the child regardless of who the father is and regardless if the father pays child support. It does not relieve the father from paying sometimes but sometimes it does.\n \n \n \n As for your comments about disallowing gays the right to marry because there are friends and family that live with other friends and family for support (non-sexual relationships)... that simply lacks explanation or a correlation to the topic at hand. I'm not sure what you're trying to validate. However, I think I understand where you might be heading with that. I used to live with two roommates, and we all had to struggle together to make ends meet, and never did we feel we were owed some sort of \"cohabitational acknowledgement\" by the government in the form of tax breaks and medical care. Even if we did, what's that got to do with marriage? \n \n\n \n Oh we are so not on the sme level. Your'e thinking at a highschool level. Think bigger. THink of how many elderly live to support each other. NOw if one goes to the emergency room they woldn't be able to see the person if it was restricted to only immediate family or spouse. They would liek that right as well. I won't even talk to you about the rest becasue you obviously don't understand what the rights are that go with marriage. Gays want marriage to ahve the same benefits that married people do. That' what it's go to do with marriage.\n \n \n \n \n You also seem to assume the only reason that gays want the right to marry is for legal validation regarding medical & social benefits. Nay. It's often about love, which is pretty much the same reason your average American marries. \n\n No it's they feel their behavior should be recognized. They don't want civil unions which would mean they are in love.\n \n \n \n \n And what is this new practice of the 'executive branch doing the job of the legislative branch' you purport? Did I miss something on C-Span?! Since when did the courts determine our laws? What on earth are you talking about?\n \n\n \n The question is what are you talking about?\n \n \n\n You have a poor argument (if that's what you want to call it).

The lack of factual basis for most of your generalizations argue against you far better than I could.\n \n No dice, but better luck next time. emoticon_xbye\n\n You don't even know what discrimination is so don't even talk to me about what it means. Obviously you didn't understand anything about the post because it is very persuasive. Thanks though for not understanding and \" talking about something you know nothing about\"",

   "I have finals these next two weeks so I'm not going to respond but you really irritated me with your under thought assertions and specualtion that you think means anything wiht your study of an undergraduate degree. For your information I'm working on my fourth degree, graduate degree. I don't want to use it to bolster my argument because when I say something its \"Res Ipsa Loquitur\" (The thing speak for itself). Using your credentials holds no grounds because whatever field you're in there is no consensus on anything unless it's a fact.\n \n \n \n Yeah under what about polygamist or consensual incestial behavior. Race and behavior are not the same. Homosexuality- that is behavior. Race- physical and cannot be changed\n \n \n \n \n Dang you're little statement cost you all credibility. You didn't do any research and you spoke without any facts.\n First things first you told me \"For your own sake, know what you're talking about before you talk about it\". \n Let's see what you said that shows you have no idea what you're talking about.\n \n Anthropology-1 : the science of human beings; especially : the study of human beings in relation to distribution, origin, classification, and relationship of races, physical character, environmental and social relations, and culture\n 2 : theology dealing with the origin, nature, and destiny of human beings\n according to Webster dictionary\n \n Anthropology is the study of humans ( as in mankind) not the human body. They are not experts about biological, physiological, or anatomical elements of the human bodies. Those are MDs and psychiatrist MDs and similiar fields. That';s alright becasue you know everything becasue you're in college. Look up the difference in courses that anthropolgist take compared to pre-med. I doubt they take one chemistry class. That's alright becaue you're studying sociology and anthropolgy. Yeah the two majors that are consdered one of the easiest.\n \n Like I said again there is no definitive evidence that homosexuality is a genetic or biological. There could be correlation for a study to prove that homsexuality is genetic. Just like the tobacco industries studies taht smoking isn't harmful. The studie you refer to are to speculative and if they were definitive then ti would be accepted as fact but guess what... it's not. Now for my evidence.\n \n \"The most recent study was reported by Nicolosi, Byrd and Potts in 1998. The study was conducted in 1996. The authors received survey responses from 882 people either during conversion therapy or having completed therapy. About half of the respondents had taken counseling from a professional with the other half from either a ministry source or they had tried to change on their own. Nearly half of those individuals who viewed themselves as exclusively homosexual made some shift in sexual orientation toward heterosexuality. Eighteen percent viewed themselves as exclusively heterosexual after therapy. The remainder viewed themselves as more heterosexual than homosexual. While this is an impressive result given that the professional associations say change can't happen, some might lament that the numbers aren't higher. I need to point out that not all of the clients in the study had completed their work and remember about 15% of the group had never taken any therapy. Also, a statistically significant number of respondents indicated that the therapy had been helpful them in a variety of ways. There was no indication of widespread harm caused by reorientation therapy per se.\" \n \n http://www.oneby1.org/resources/reorientation_possible.html\n What can we conclude about the biology of homosexuality? Consider a comprehensive review article, \"Human Sexual Orientation: The Biological Theories Reappraised,\" written by William Byne and Bruce Parsons from Columbia University in 1993. \n \n The article reviews 135 research studies, prior reviews, academic summaries, books, and chapters of books-in essence the entire literature on homosexuality, of which only a small portion is actual research. The abstract summarized in its findings that there is no evidence at present to substantiate that biological factors are the primary basis for sexual orientation. \n \n Whatever genetic contribution to homosexuality exists, it probably contributes not to homosexuality per se, but rather to some other trait that makes the homosexual \"option\" more readily available to some than others. \n \n http://www.family.org/fofmag/pp/a0024032.cfm\n \n Research on sexual orientation does not support such a view. There is no evidence that sexual orientation is in-born or obligatory. \n \n http://www.gcc.edu/news/faculty/editorials/throckmorton_milking_7_28_03.htm\n \n These are all education or non-profit cites. All by several doctors, not PHD's but doctors that actually study the body.As you can see there is mroe proof than you thought. Thanks for doing your research. Also here at my school almost all the teachers have their PHD and they all disagree with your professors. There are various ones that are considered the leaders of their fields even the anthropology field. \n \n \n \"I seriously doubt there's a shred of fact in that statement.\"\n \n So here's some links to help you! \n \n http://www.exodus-international.org/default.asp\n \n http://www.newdirection.ca/stories.htm\n \n \n \n \n \n Marriage is also a committment to the children. When a single mother marries the husband is obligated to care for the child regardless of who the father is and regardless if the father pays child support. It does not relieve the father from paying sometimes but sometimes it does.\n \n \n \n Oh we are so not on the sme level. Your'e thinking at a highschool level. Think bigger. THink of how many elderly live to support each other. NOw if one goes to the emergency room they woldn't be able to see the person if it was restricted to only immediate family or spouse. They would liek that right as well. I won't even talk to you about the rest becasue you obviously don't understand what the rights are that go with marriage. Gays want marriage to ahve the same benefits that married people do. That' what it's go to do with marriage.\n \n \n \n No it's they feel their behavior should be recognized. They don't want civil unions which would mean they are in love.\n \n \n \n \n The question is what are you talking about?\n \n \n You don't even know what discrimination is so don't even talk to me about what it means. Obviously you didn't understand anything about the post because it is very persuasive. Thanks though for not understanding and \" talking about something you know nothing about\"\n\n \n Who said I had credentials... and used them? emoticon_confused",

One member here tried to sell it for five bucks to help narth out I believe, on another thread. Therapists are biased, and are likely to report on the successes of their own clients, less likely to report the failures. Here is an excellent discussion on such biases, and on reparative therapy...\n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_changing.html\n \n Here is a good review of the research done to determine whether or not homosexuality is genetic...\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_caus4.htm",
