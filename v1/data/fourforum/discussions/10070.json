   "I'm happy I don't know God, who would want to know a person like that! I don't speak from ignorance, I take my information and opinions straight from the good book, the bible itself.\n \n Samuel 2-3:\n \"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt. Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'\"\n \n A call for murder of children (in revenge what Babylonians did to Israelites) - Psalm 137:8-9:\n \"O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one,\n How blessed will be the one who repays you\n With the recompense with which you have repaid us.\n How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones\n Against the rock.\"\n \n Killing of the first-born = act of mercy/love - Psalm 136:10\n \"To Him who smote the Egyptians in their firstborn,\n For His lovingkindness is everlasting\"\n \n Ezekiel 21:3-4\n \"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am against you; and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go forth from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.'\"\n \n Isaiah 14:21\n \"Prepare for his sons a place of slaughter\n Because of the iniquity of their fathers.\n They must not arise and take possession of the earth\n And fill the face of the world with cities\"\n \n \"Take your son, your only son - yes, Isaac, whom you love so much - and go to the land of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will point out to you.\" Genesis 22:1-18\n \n Malachi 2:3\n \"Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces.\" ###!?!?\n \n Leviticus 20:9 \"For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death!\" Harsh huh?\n \n 2 Kings 18:27 \"Hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own #### with you?\" MORE DUNG!\n \n \"When you go to war against your enemies and you see a beautiful woman and find her desirable, you may take her. If she ceases to please you send her away.\" Deut. 21:10 \n \n Numbers 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.\n \n 31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.\n \n Another terrible sin from the Bible ... Eating Pork : punishment, the death penalty \n Isaiah 66:15 For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the stormwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire will the LORD execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many. Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig's flesh shall come to an end together, says the LORD.\" \n \n Dueteronomy 14:21 You shall not eat anything that you find that is dead; you may give it to the stranger who is within your towns, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner.\n \n Aren't we all gods people, who are these foreigners and why doesn't God care about them?\n \n So yeah Archangel, not only does god kill those who eat pork but he allows women to be raped and stoned to death for having sex, calls fathers to kill their sons, etc......nice guy",

I have experienced the Gift of Healing, Tongues and Prophecy, all through my own body and being.\n \n So you can deny that I can Know the living God for the rest of your life, but the only thing you will learn at the end of your life is that you were sorely and eternally mistaken. If I was just sitting here hoping I'm right but not knowing for certain that I am, you atheists could break me down. But the reason I laugh at your ignorance and blindness is because I know that I know what I know. And nothing you can say will change the reality that I know to be absolutely as true as the bible I defend as Gods Word.\n\n \n Archy, Archy, Archy....\n \n By tongues, I'm sure you mean babbling as that is THE ONLY version that has been used in the Church (all instances of the real definition of tongues = foreign language instances are urban legends and lies) of recent years.\n A horrible practice to confuse the foolish and biblically ignorant started in it's current incarnation by the Azusa apostates forming more divisions in the Church (and amongst themselves) when they thought they were actually speaking a foreign language (whish IS what the bible is talking about and what they themselves believed in) as a gift from the H.S. Later, when they realized they were uttering drivel and infantile nonsense, rather than wisen up and drop the practice as wrong, they decided to base their beliefs not on scripture but on personal experience that defied scripture. See a problem here? They went the route of all others who had ears to be tickled and a desire to be special and to be able to show it off. So, what did the Pentecostal movements do? They reinterpreted scripture until they made their practice FIT to it...conforming scripture to their desires rather than the other way around, and being personally conformed to the Word.\n \n A worse travesty (which you haven't admitted to believing in) is stating that babbling...erm tongues speaking is a requirement for PROOF that you were baptised by in the H.S. There is NO wiggle room in this as scripture even states that tongues is not for all, nor is prophesy, nor interpretations or tongues.\n \n Now, this is a very good subject to go into a side discussion on...actually, it's been extensively discussed on Pulpit Pimps, specifically here just over the past few days. I'm sure you'd be enlightened some by these fellows and the discussion. \n \n While I can admire your devotion and faith as well as your basic understanding of scripture compared to some others I've met, I'd hazard a guess that you've fallen in with what 'Christians' would know as false prophets and servents of the anti-Christ.\n It's a shame that your blind and obedient faith has been devoted to charlatans and counterfieters.\n \n As to healing. Even as a non-believer, I believe miraculous things can happen. A miricle simply being something we can't explain (yet or even ever). But, all faiths and differing peoples have experienced healing. So, it's not a 'Christian only' thing. My weirdo mother believes in Reiki and, whilst knowing it to be utter nonsense myself, she professes to have used it to heal others. Including my sister of kidney stones.\n \n As to prophesy.\n I'm fairly certain that when you compare contemporary practices of this you'll find glaring loopholes.\n Most Christian prophets I've encountered (literally scores as I consider this type of thing fun to watch) have several differing ways of shoe-horning a prophesy into the 'it happened' category.\n Either they keep it vague so they can fit details later as they please. They make so many predictions that over time, some are bound to come to fruition. These are the ones they focus on. Convienently 'forgetting' or down playing the ones that don't happen. This is where I will remind you of Deut chapter 18 (around verse 20ish) where they explain how to deal with false prophets and the penalties for being one...STONE THEM! Yep, you can have 99 out of 100 correct prophesies and one single wrong one means you need to be put to death. Oh, and let's not forget that an accurate prophesy HAS to be said to come from God. Making a prophesy that comes true and you forgot to say it's from God and you could run the risk of a stoning too.\n Heck, I engage in this all the time. I throw so much **** against the wall to see what sticks and then focus on that. Voila! I is a psychic! Actually, most psychics I've ever known do this. \n There's also the self fulfilling prophesies. The ones that come true not because God predicted through a prophet that they'd come true but because someone actively worked to make them come true. That's not really from God though.\n \n In my own review of the bible on the Charismatic gifts, I don't think there's an abundance of evidence to say that cesationism is true but, in review of the evidence for their continued existance, there is more evidence of counterfeitism that of legitimacy in what you see today.\n \n Most healings are unsupported by any documentation that would pass review. Some of those claiming healings are merely hyped up and believe they exist even though the ailment persist and some few were psycosomatic to begin with. The field is open to frauds like Benny Hinn. Ever notice a large healing phenomina where those to be healed are in rented wheel chairs (because they could walk to begin with) where as those with real needs for healing are kept in the back of the Church, away from the healer...so as to not embarrase him/her when their anointing doesn't work.\n Let me tell you, it's quite a sight. but, then you have to actually use discernment and watch for this rather than be caught up in the event emotionally. \n \n The only tounges heard is gibberish. The same as uttered by proven false prophets of the past who tried to pass this counterfeit off. Like the founder of the Shakers...a woman whom later claimed to be Jesus reincarnate.\n Linguistically, there is no rhyme or reason to the sounds uttered. It is quite literally gibberish like an infant would mutter. \n Passing it off as a private prayer language is rediculous also. The Christ himself gave you the Our Father to say when asked how to pray. Speak in your own language if you want to be heard. Only Satan would want you to substitute ernest prayer with useless nonsense.\n As for the 'groans'. I doubt gibberish is a substitute for pain of torture, suffering and grief. Anguish that the H.S. would know about regardless of whether or not you're physically capable of speaking. The same pain the Christ himself went through during the cruxifition and the same loss as experienced by the blessed Mary when she lost her 1st born.\n An angelic toungue. Come on. Multiple languages are a PUNISHMENT for the tower of Babel you believe in. What did the angels do to be cursed with multiple languages? Pauls comments were a metaphore and he did state IF before the comments for a lesson on love.\n \n Interpretations of tongues. In the studies done, no 2 interperetors got the same meaning out of any given tongues speaker. Further proving fraud and deception.\n \n In the end, I'd caution you to study the numerous passages dealing with false teachers.\n Matthew 24:24 and Mark 13:22 shoud be heeded.\n After all, you're the one who believes these are the end times. What greater deception than to masquerade as a teacher of light who uses counterfeit miracles and signs of wonder to lead the elect astray? While you may think you're siding with God and His ever living Word, the converse is true. You're being slowly manipulated to err and waiver from the straight and narrow.\n Satan doesn't have to have you do a 180 to get to hell, all he has to do is make you're path to the Gates stray by 1 degree and you'll miss the mark. And anyone who doesn't make it to heaven is sent to hell by default.\n For narrow is the path to rightiousness and few are those who find it and not all those who cry out 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' get to heaven as Matthew 7:21-23 states.\n \n \n He who has ears, let him hear.",

As if a palmful of rice and beets a day isn't enough. You'd think they'd be happy with the celebratory meat pies everytime one of their siblings passes on. But now, they think to literally eat me out of house and home.\n I recently got 2 dozen semi-retarded Iraqi orphans. Don't know what to do with them yet. I've been thinking of opening an autobody repair shop. Think they'll do okay there until the permits for the asbestos removal company I have on the side pass. \n Yeah, yeah. I know, sounds like a lot of hard work raising all these children but, I tell ya, it's very rewarding and I just have sooo much love to share.\n \n \n As to taking up the adoration of adoring fans again...not too into it.\n I couldn't be arsed for anything less than tithes and offerings totalling 18.5% of your gross income which is close to what Word of Faithers can get from their stooges.\n And, like them, I'd only offer kick backs to those followers who truely honored their lord...like by polishing my knobs. \n As for those closest to me in the ever after.\n All loyal followers are close to me for a day or so when they pass on when they eventually truely pass on...\n \n I like meat pies too.",

Historic revisionism.\n As I said, this is the most common event. Whether you be a self-proclaimed prophet of God or a faux psychic, you'll note that if you objectively watch and actually listen and remember what was said, over time, you'll see that this is what happens.\n Not all the time but enough to cast serious doubt on the phenomina.

They call out the false teachers who exploit their followers for 'filthy lucre' by name and quote those very same false prophets words to damn them by. \n They don't engage in rumor mongering or gossip.\n They typically use scripture for ALL stances. Something you should admire.\n \n If you think of me as one of the false phophets, then you really are in big trouble. \n Who do you believe?\n The teachers you follow who manifestly twist scripture to suit their own desires and acquire their living by (they are professionals right...collecting tithes and offerings...probably living in a decent, middle to upper class life style.\n Or, me. Someone who's simply pointed out the truth, used scripture as warning (I'm sure you've heard many of your own teachers use the same scriptures) and extolled you to \"In the end, I'd caution you to study the numerous passages dealing with false teachers.\"\n \n Oh, that's right, I asked you to do independent bible study and put forth a warning for you as well as illustrate why such practices can't logically be the real deal.\n \n Do such practices make you feel better about your beliefs? Obviously. You have repeatedly stated your own experiences validate your belief. Here and elsewhere.\n \nIf I was just sitting here hoping I'm right but not knowing for certain that I am, you atheists could break me down. But the reason I laugh at your ignorance and blindness is because I know that I know what I know. And nothing you can say will change the reality that I know to be absolutely as true as the bible I defend as Gods Word.\n\n \n You believe your experiences allows you to know and without 'knowing' you believe you'd be torn down.\n That is not true to someone with faith.\n \n To which I will quote your Chirst as his response to the doubting Thomas.\n John 20:29\n \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"\n \n You DO NOT need counterfeit miracles and signs of wonder to believe in your God. Relying on such excessively and later finding out that they are false and common parlour tricks leads many to ruination. I've seen it happen personally.\n What you're saying is that you are more in common with Thomas the doubter and need experience as proof. \n \n And if there are continued miracles being done in the name of the Christ...why don't we see more of them on a continued basis? The bible implies that we should. \n Instead, we have little old ladies told they no longer need their diabetes medication as they are healed...yet they die instead.\n We have prophasies of the end times that constantly change. (I like apocalyptic fiction and literature of all kinds, in having personally watched predictions made for the past 25 years, they have never come to pass, events have happened to make the odds of them ever coming to pass be 0 and still these types of 'prophets' profit. This is a common phenomina in Christianity over the centuries) Other prophasies are as I described them; Vague, self fulfilling or tainted with a host of false ones.\n We have the only example of 'tongues' being gibberish (and while having some benefit at times...it reduces stress) that doesn't pass any review of any sort.\n We have interpretation that can't repeatedly interpret and get the same message out of a toungue.\n We have evidence of past and over the top false teachers engaging in these same practices. We have evidence of non-Christians doing the exact same thing you see going on now through out time.\n \n I recently read a biography by Marjor Gortner, a self confessed false teacher and road evangelist from the 70's who made an award winning documentary about his 'work'. He confesses on how he worked the crowds, how he learnt to manipulate to get people to babble and be slain in the spirit. Derren Brown of the UK has some youtube videos where he does a similar thing. One of the intresting things Marjoe mentioned once was actually trying to preach the christ love message to people. They didn't want to hear it. They wanted the razzle dazzle. The fire and the demonstration of these miracles and wonder. \n Even to the point where they didn't care that he faked them.\n Marjoe even outted his less honest evangelical compatriots. \n \n You really think the 'industry' has cleaned up it's act in the past 30 years?\n It's gotten worse. Slicker, more advanced and mainstream.\n Now, people claiming to be Jesus Freaks are no longer the 'hippies' they were 30 years ago, they're now suburbanite middle class stepford clones.\n \n Next time you're in a charismatic service, try this.\n Pray the Lords prayer in your native language, shut out all surrounding noise and think only of God and His perfect desire.\n From what I've heard and witnessed, those who do so seldom are taken in by the emotionalism frauds. \n Sit back in a corner where you can observe the goings on and observe the congregation. Question whether the Spirit is actually moving or if people are insted working themselves up into a state and being led by their pastor as if her were a conductor at the symphony.",

Someone who's simply pointed out the truth, used scripture as warning (I'm sure you've heard many of your own teachers use the same scriptures) and extolled you to \"In the end, I'd caution you to study the numerous passages dealing with false teachers.\"\n\n \n What I marvel at is your belief that after 33 years as a believer that I have no sense of discernment to test false teachers or false truths. That you must rescue me when you scoff at the personal relationship I have with God through Jesus. What prepares you for discerning false spirits when you don't even believe Gods word is infallible ? Why do you use the Word to make a point when you don't accept the Word as truth ?\n \n \nOh, that's right, I asked you to do independent bible study and put forth a warning for you as well as illustrate why such practices can't logically be the real deal.\n\n \n I do independent bible studies every day of my life Zardoz. In spite of the picture you choose to paint, I don't get daily e-mails from the head christian every morning telling me what I must think. That is your delusion, not mine.\n \n \nDo such practices make you feel better about your beliefs? Obviously. You have repeatedly stated your own experiences validate your belief. Here and elsewhere.\n \n You believe your experiences allows you to know and without 'knowing' you believe you'd be torn down.\n That is not true to someone with faith.\n \n To which I will quote your Chirst as his response to the doubting Thomas.\n John 20:29\n \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"\n\n \n Again with ripping verses out of context and misapplying it. Jesus was talking about all of you here who refuse to believe that He is our savior because I can't physically produce Him as evidence. Not me who He spoke to and has dealt with in very deep and personal ways AFTER I received Him as my Savior by faith and not by sight like every other believer does. \n \n \nYou DO NOT need counterfeit miracles and signs of wonder to believe in your God. Relying on such excessively and later finding out that they are false and common parlour tricks leads many to ruination. I've seen it happen personally.\n What you're saying is that you are more in common with Thomas the doubter and need experience as proof.\n \n \n I don't attend tent meeting and traveling evangelists Zardoz, and I don't get my spiritual feeding from sunday morning weekend christians on TV. So where do you get off attributing my personal experiences to parlor tricks when they were between me and my God and couldn't have been counterfeited by any human being set on deceiving me ? \n \n \nAnd if there are continued miracles being done in the name of the Christ...why don't we see more of them on a continued basis? The bible implies that we should. \n Instead, we have little old ladies told they no longer need their diabetes medication as they are healed...yet they die instead.\n We have prophasies of the end times that constantly change. (I like apocalyptic fiction and literature of all kinds, in having personally watched predictions made for the past 25 years, they have never come to pass, events have happened to make the odds of them ever coming to pass be 0 and still these types of 'prophets' profit. This is a common phenomina in Christianity over the centuries) Other prophasies are as I described them; Vague, self fulfilling or tainted with a host of false ones.\n We have the only example of 'tongues' being gibberish (and while having some benefit at times...it reduces stress) that doesn't pass any review of any sort.\n We have interpretation that can't repeatedly interpret and get the same message out of a toungue.\n We have evidence of past and over the top false teachers engaging in these same practices. We have evidence of non-Christians doing the exact same thing you see going on now through out time.\n\n \n And we do. At least I do, and believers I know do. Unbelievers don't because they have no eyes to see or ears to hear what God is doing in the lives of His children just as you can't see the truth. So you accuse the whole church of being false because of the few who are charlatans and false prophets who lay in wait seeing who they can deceive just as you are doing now.\n \n \nI recently read a biography by Marjor Gortner, a self confessed false teacher and road evangelist from the 70's who made an award winning documentary about his 'work'. He confesses on how he worked the crowds, how he learnt to manipulate to get people to babble and be slain in the spirit. Derren Brown of the UK has some youtube videos where he does a similar thing. One of the intresting things Marjoe mentioned once was actually trying to preach the christ love message to people. They didn't want to hear it. They wanted the razzle dazzle. The fire and the demonstration of these miracles and wonder. \n Even to the point where they didn't care that he faked them.\n Marjoe even outted his less honest evangelical compatriots. \n \n You really think the 'industry' has cleaned up it's act in the past 30 years?\n It's gotten worse. Slicker, more advanced and mainstream.\n Now, people claiming to be Jesus Freaks are no longer the 'hippies' they were 30 years ago, they're now suburbanite middle class stepford clones.\n \n Next time you're in a charismatic service, try this.\n Pray the Lords prayer in your native language, shut out all surrounding noise and think only of God and His perfect desire.\n From what I've heard and witnessed, those who do so seldom are taken in by the emotionalism frauds. \n Sit back in a corner where you can observe the goings on and observe the congregation. Question whether the Spirit is actually moving or if people are insted working themselves up into a state and being led by their pastor as if her were a conductor at the symphony.\n\n \n I am very familiar with Marjoe Gortner. I have known of him since he was an actor in the 70s. His claim to fame was that he was a child evangelist who was seen as very charismatic. So what. What do the frauds have to do with the truth in Christ ? Are you so easily swayed by lies that you will reject the whole truth in order to avoid being deceived ? Oh, and by the way, this too was foretold in prophecy.\n \n 1Ti 4:1 \n NOW the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some wil depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits an doctrines of demons\n 1Ti 4:2 \n speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron,\n 1Ti 4:3 \n forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.\n 1Ti 4:4 \n For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;\n 1Ti 4:5 \n for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.\n 1Ti 4:6 \n If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed.\n 1Ti 4:7 \n But reject profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness.\n 1Ti 4:8 \n For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.\n 1Ti 4:9 \n This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.\n 1Ti 4:10 \n For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach,[fn1] because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.\n 1Ti 4:11 \n These things command and teach.\n 1Ti 4:12 \n Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit,[fn2] in faith, in purity.\n 1Ti 4:13 \n Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.\n 1Ti 4:14 \n Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.\n 1Ti 4:15 \n Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all.\n 1Ti 4:16 \n Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.\n ",

   "Zardoz", 
   "Simply put Zardoz, your unique ministry here is as a spoiler. One who takes the Christian Church which has within it many false prophets and counterfeits today, and paint it ALL as a group of heretics without considering that their is a majority of bible believing followers of the Lord who have real discernment due to the power and influence of His Holy Spirit which indwells them.\n\n I really think you're fighting a losing battle here.\n I have not sought to convert you nor to have you loose your faith. Regardless of my own beliefs.\n When either you or INRI for example have cited scripture properly, I have backed you up in the past. Even if I disagree with it.\n You also make the mistake, as many do, in believing I am against ALL Christians. My main beef are with the meddlesome ones who wish to prosetylize others and force their rules onto non-believers. I am also opposed to ANY charlatain or huckster who seeks to exploit others. I know full well of my own ability to do so and have had many others attempt to cajole me into joing them to exploit others in cons.\n It's very lucrative. \n \n As to you're continued pleas to profess that the indwelling of the H.S. gives you discernment. You ALWAYS need to have that compare accuratly to what scripture states.\n Somewhere along the lines, you LISTENED to a false teacher who weaseled false practices into your heart, blinding and binding you to follow their word and emotional driven experiences rather than follow what they bible actually says. I'm sorry, but it's doubtful that you were born into a Charismatic faith given what information you've shared of yourself on these threads. You didn't learn of this counterfeit tongues from reading the bible alone and coming to that conclusion on your own. You heard it taught this way from the mouth of a man.\n \n As it stands, your practices and stated beliefs in this thread place you in the same categfory as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons. Believing your own personal beliefs superceed scripture.\n I can live with that...can you?\n \n \nThe bible say's that we are to test the spirits according to the truths in Gods Word regarding the supernatural. Which I did with every supernatural experience I have had in my christian walk. \n\n Then you'd realize that many would have been shown to be false, useless and pointless.\n They actually can detract from Godliness rather than draw you closer to it.\n \n Think seriously on how many on these threads view you.\n I have given you the benefit of a doubt as faceless postings and lacking communications modifiers (tone of voice, body expressions for example) can give a misleading impression. But, the truth could be as others here state and I'm being too lenient. You could actually be a blowhard who does lack true Christian love as well as discernment and knowledge about your own faith. Following someone elses private interpretation of what the bible says rather than proper exegesis on what it meant in context of history.\n \n \nHere, you show first how you distort the truth, then how you twist what I say to fit your misinterpretation of the truth. Show me the verse that say's that a personal prophecy received from God in private must edify the whole body. Oh wait, that is referring to publicly speaking in tongues that must be publicly interpreted in order to benefit the whole body. And are you actually implying that by God giving me a personal private Word of knowledge that He is breaking His own rules for bealing with His children ?\n\n How so?\n I said 'initially'. Meaning further information can permanently place your prophesy into the 'junk' category OR, even place it into the legitimate category.\n For one, there was NO personal prophesy in the bible that has NOT been used for the teaching to the body of Christians.\n Any prophesy in the book of God IS taught and used as examples.\n Are you comparing your personal revelation to holy scriptures?\n Have you shared exact details, had them written down and used as illustration for others? Sounds doubtful. \n If so...are you worried a bit about 'adding to the books' of God's word. Do you REALLY believe that the bible just isn't enough?\n Maybe so...and maybe you should pick up the book of Mormon and read the all important information about Latter Day Saints.\n \n Show me a place in the bible that says prophesy is for personal use.\n \n \nLike the deceiver always does, you have distorted the truth and attempted to make it look like the lie. But your truth is the lie Zardoz. It is corrupted and the enemy of what is right. \n\n LOL. My truth is a lie?\n You're believe system is new to the Christian faith. Uttering nonsense/gibberish was only introduced by the (now fractured) Pentecostal movement of Azusa and grown progressively stronger as most followers of that apostacy are simply ignorant hicks, desperate people, entertain-me-NOW westerners who can't tell spiritualism from emotionalism and the biblically ignorant masses. Babbling being speaking in foreign langues. What a load Archy. Try and convince your fellow Christians here of that one.\n Charismatics are cotton candy Christians. Wanting snazzy counterfit baubles to make them feel better, to boost their lax confidence in their own God. It's no wonder that the pimps who market them are on the rise. They are the bird who eat the seed and leave only droppings in return. And try as you might, those droppings can't be mistaken for mana. \n Sorry, but this isn't my 'truth'. But the truth of your fellow Christ following believers possess. Those who've centuries of learning and believing correctly to back them up.\n If your practices were the 'real deal' and God given, they wouldn't be easily shot down as frauds by skeptics. It's doubtul they could even be counterfeited by charlatans.\n \n Have you ever wondered why, prior to ~1900, the time of the Pentecostal movement started, ALL those who denonstrated the gifts as you believe have been PROVEN to be false prophets and errant teachers.\n Or, do you think Mother Ann Lee of the Shakers was engaging in a Holy Spirit granted gift of tongues when she babbled like a loon?\n \n \nWhat I marvel at is your belief that after 33 years as a believer that I have no sense of discernment to test false teachers or false truths. That you must rescue me when you scoff at the personal relationship I have with God through Jesus. What prepares you for discerning false spirits when you don't even believe Gods word is infallible ? Why do you use the Word to make a point when you don't accept the Word as truth ?\n\n 33 years of getting it wrong? G.I.G.O., follow a false teacher and you get false teachings. \n I'm not attempting to rescue you. Nor have I scoffed at any 'personal relationship' you think you have.\n Simply pointed out that charismatic practices as used in the evangelical movement are counterfeits that are more often than not pushed by those who profit off of you. \n You have berated yourself in the past as a sinner who struggles like the rest of us. Fighting temptations daily. From what I've been taught and come to learn of the Christian faith as well as most faiths is that you should focus on the doctrins of salvation and acceptance of the gift of forgiveness. Not be concerned over how you feel or what you think exists as proof. But operate in faith...you know, the thing pleasing to your God.\n What I marvel at is how you can literally believe in parts of the bible that are figurative and alegorical at simple face value when they weren't written as such. That you can substitute speaking in a foreign language for uttering gibberish. That's the main problem with some branches of Protestantism, they lack knowledge of biblican history, context and meaning and seek to believe everything as factual and historical rather than as an object lesson.\n \n Why do I use the Word when I don't believe.\n To illustrate points of dublicity and gullibility. To point out to others how one can twist their own stated and documented beliefs to justify to themselves the acts they engage in. \n Tongues is foreign languages in proper division of the Word. Up until now, I really haven't found contradictions with your stated beliefs as expressed in the bible and your practices.\n You could be nicer in your approach but as said, this medium isn't that conducive. \n \n \nI do independent bible studies every day of my life Zardoz. In spite of the picture you choose to paint, I don't get daily e-mails from the head christian every morning telling me what I must think. That is your delusion, not mine.\n\n Quite possible. However I have known such as you who when called to be a 'Berean' have actually been lead to read only certain bible passages that support the pastors current beliefs...guided away from looking at anything else, and more specifically any thing that would contradict their message.\n And while 'steal sharpens steal' I wonder if you've ever even doubted what's been taught to you from the pulpit. If the ONLY explanation given to you was that tongues was babbling or similar.\n Think of me as a whet stone. ;)\n \n \nAgain with ripping verses out of context and misapplying it. Jesus was talking about all of you here who refuse to believe that He is our savior because I can't physically produce Him as evidence. Not me who He spoke to and has dealt with in very deep and personal ways AFTER I received Him as my Savior by faith and not by sight like every other believer does.\n\n Actually, Jesus was speaking to Thomas who HAD to see him to believe.\n You stated that if you had no 'personal relationship'* with Jesus, you'd easily be pulled down.\n \n * Personal relationship with Jesus is a relatively new concept in Christianity. Would you still believe if after accpeting Jesus, you got absolutly NOTHING?\n The way you phrased yourself, you lead me to believe you wouldn't. \n So, you'd have been converted, then had no personal proofs and subject to backsliding. Right? \n As I understand you, you use your personal experiences to justify your continued beliefs.\n \n \nI don't attend tent meeting and traveling evangelists Zardoz, and I don't get my spiritual feeding from sunday morning weekend christians on TV. So where do you get off attributing my personal experiences to parlor tricks when they were between me and my God and couldn't have been counterfeited by any human being set on deceiving me ?\n\n Because in the past 30+ years, the parlor trick pushing tent evangelist has moved more forcefully into the church buildings. Replacing the 'droning' pastors with razzle dazzle and carny tricks. \n What you see in the Church IS what was pushed on the road. As time goes on, it gains more acceptance.\n Are you familiar with the documentary Jesus Camp?\n What most people don't know is that it's about Word of Faithers...many simply think of them as evangelist or fundamentalist. \n Their roots are the tent and the radio. Now, they on the TV and in the pulpit. Or, hadn't you noticed that gay man Haggards Church in Colorado was the largest in the state...and was also WofF.\n That, as I pointed out in a thread a few weeks back, that Catholicism is taking on traits of these charlatians too. Mostly with Hispanics now but it could spread. Even Catholics (king of droning sermons) have followers who've been swayed by the pimps preaching.\n Nope, you don't need to visit tents any more.\n \n Nope, I never claimed you visited tents...your church IS one. (well, most likely, I don't know that for a fact. If we lived in close states, I'd ask to come visit...and YES, I have visited some (few) evangelical churchs that weren't run by pimps and self agandizing con men who actually cared about the Message and didn't push junk. They ARE a dying breed.\n \n Do you have 'visiting pastors' come to your church for special events that could last up to a week? Evangelist who come to help you get into \"revival\"? Yep, these new ones don't need to lug about a tent anymore. They have ready made church venues with plenty of seating room.\n Have you ever visited another church to hear a particular speaker?\n \n I know the answer to most of these questions could be no. \n They are getting to know you questions. \n In the past, while I may disagree with your inate belief system and have been sceptical, I'd have thought you to be a zealous follower but not one given to following counterfeit beliefs. \n I'm just pointing out how they no longer conform to 30+ year old standards that you stated. Tents gone, mega churches in. \n \n \nAnd we do. At least I do, and believers I know do. Unbelievers don't because they have no eyes to see or ears to hear what God is doing in the lives of His children just as you can't see the truth. So you accuse the whole church of being false because of the few who are charlatans and false prophets who lay in wait seeing who they can deceive just as you are doing now.\n\n Archy, that's bunk. You see only what you wish to see and not reality.\n If miraculous healings were common place, you wouldn't have people dying because of them. No one EVER died from a healing from Christ or an apostle in the bible did they?\n The medical profession would be able to repeatedly verify these healings...they may even replace medicine altogether. Christ had many converts because of his bonafide miracles as did the apostles. Did not the Christ tell one healed patient to present himself to the Church authorities for verification that would slap them in the face with the PROOF of his magesty?\n Sure they tried to deny it but were unsuccessful.\n Ever see the youtube video where a Christian healer tried to heal a man's shoulder but the man winced in pain when he moved it after wards.\n Ever see the man hard of seeing have his glasses ripped off his face and told his sight was restored...stumble around looking for them afterwards?\n Ever wonder why out of the thousands ot miricales you state you've seen, there is no provable evidence for them?\n You DO NOT Need to believe in God to see a REAL miracle.\n \n No Archy, I don't accuse the WHOLE church of being false over charlatanism. I do wonder where all these miracles are though.\n If, it's as your kind believes, that signs will follow including tongues, healing, casting out of demons, immunity ot poisons and serpents bites...where are they?\n The Appalachian churches handle rattlers and drink Strychnine (charlatans tricks) but wouldn't touch an adder or injest cyanide. And even with their soft approach to these, some do die...eventually. Some miracle. Some sign.\n To me, there would be ample evidence for cesationism of the 'gifts'.\n There really is no purpose for them with the completion of the bible that supposedly contains all you need...right Archy?\n \n \nI am very familiar with Marjoe Gortner. I have known of him since he was an actor in the 70s. His claim to fame was that he was a child evangelist who was seen as very charismatic. So what. What do the frauds have to do with the truth in Christ ? Are you so easily swayed by lies that you will reject the whole truth in order to avoid being deceived ? Oh, and by the way, this too was foretold in prophecy.\n\n Marjoe was coached by his own mother, a former evangelist herself who couldn't renew her own mission. He was a skilled parrot as a child by his own admissions. But, as wonderful as he was, he was following a sham, he didn't believe anything he did was God granted or H.S. inspired.\n A truely tragic story, his family tale. His father left is previous family and his ministry to run off with his mother. Later his father ran off with the money they collected and shut out and abandoned his family. \n But, that didn't end there, when he did his documentary he outted all his fellow frauds showing them for what they really were. Scam artists who worked the crowd. Who weren't following any particular higher calling but had entered a field ripe with suckers. They discussed points of manipulation and how to best milk the crowd for money. Bragging on how many calls for an offering they could get from any one sermon and how to best trick people out of their needed money.\n \n As said above, they have moved from the tent to the pulpit now.\n Marjoe's self admitted scam was old school.\n Today, the frauds have slick marketing advice, well researched understandings on how to manipulate people. How to get Archy into an Alpha state where he's far more succeptable to suggestion. If you can be manipulated to believe that tongues is babbling and believe in undocumented cases of healing simply because of the show you saw, you can be manipulated to do and believe in other things.\n Ever hear of psychic healing. Many will swear to this being true even though it's been repeatedly demonsgtrated to be false.\n Same thing with cold readers. Countless testimonies to the truthfulness of psychics. A demonstratable scam. I've done it myself. I even had a couple of close friends confess to being frauds too wven though their livelihoods depended on others believing they had psychic powers.\n Sad.\n \n \n I once asked you about tithing and whether you'd push for it.\n I'm curious do you support it? Do you also heap any offerings on top?\n Are you exploited for filthy lucre in your very own church?\n Do your servents...erm, pastors live more luxurously than you do?\n \n No Archy, I'm not questioning your belief in a God. All I see is someone who follows one particular dogmatic belief that could cause them problems.\n \n Your belief in the tribulation and rapture are also dogmatic beliefs that I think 'silly' but, I haven't 'attacked' you on them simply because belief in them doesn't have any impact on your faith and isn't an easy way to milk you for something...unless your pastor says the H.S. told him the end is in 6 months and you should sell everything and give it all to him.\n If you recall, whilst being a cultural Catholic myself, I have brought up the hazards of veneration of the blessed Mary and associated 'saints' in that faith when in threads with INRI.\n \n In and of itself, Charismatic gifts aren't automatically harmful, but, like a Marijuana smoker, they can be seen as a gateway or sign of deeper problems.\n \n I'm firmly aware that there are differing levels of apostacy and heresy.\n Subtle alterations.\n But, if someone can convince you of one falsehood, they would have a better chance of convincing you of others.\n That is psychology.",

I know full well of my own ability to do so and have had many others attempt to cajole me into joing them to exploit others in cons.\n \n\n \n I'm losing nothing here Zardoz. Nor am I convinced of anything you say beyond the fact that there are false and deceptive factions within the Church today, There have always been charlatans though, and there always will be. It isn't my ministry or responsibility to be an apologist for the church anyway. It is Christ I defende here and promise will save souls. Tell me this Zardoz, can you post even ONE quote from me where I have promoted or pushed a particular church, denomination or man who will lead anyone to Gods truth ? Have I spoken of any man beside the Man Christ Jesus who one must follow in order to be confidently saved ? \n \n Have I referred to any Gifts of the Spirit that must be practiced or even sought for one to know they are saved ? Have I laid any burdens upon anyone beyond the need to humble oneself before Jesus and His sacrifice on the Cross as they \"freely\" receive the gift of salvation through His death for our sins ? And if anyone does that and receives the Holy Spirit, do you really think God will abandon them to charlatans ? Doesn't He promise to never lose or forsake His children ?\n \n So you are a spoiler Zardoz, and a liar. You like to act as some authority of Christians, Christianity and the salvation of the New Testament when you are too much of an intellectual Coward to even face the God of the Bible and seek His truth personally before judging and condemning those of us who have. \n \n You have implied here that the whole church is corrupted when it's a sign of the times we live in and fulfills prophecies regarding the last days. But remember this Zardoz, that even when Israel, Gods people fell away as a Nation and a people, God always preserved a remnant of faithful Jews to represent His faith. God never loses or forsakes His own. Those whom you are speaking of were never His to begin with yet you are trying to paint all Christians as charlatans rather than clearly state that legitimate christian churches are being invaded and corrupted by charlatans. Here's a chapter that deals directly with this issue in regard to the Last Days zardoz. And note the underlined, as it applies directly to you.\n \n 2Pe 2:1 BUT there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. \n 2Pe 2:2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. \n 2Pe 2:3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does[fn1] not slumber. \n 2Pe 2:4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; \n 2Pe 2:5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; \n 2Pe 2:6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; \n 2Pe 2:7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked \n 2Pe 2:8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)-- \n 2Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, \n 2Pe 2:10 and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, \n 2Pe 2:11 whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord. \n 2Pe 2:12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, \n 2Pe 2:13 and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you, \n 2Pe 2:14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children. \n 2Pe 2:15 They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; \n 2Pe 2:16 but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet. \n 2Pe 2:17 These are wells without water, clouds[fn2] carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.[fn3] \n 2Pe 2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped[fn4] from those who live in error. \n 2Pe 2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. \n 2Pe 2:20 For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. \n 2Pe 2:21 For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. \n 2Pe 2:22 But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: \"A dog returns to his own vomit,\"[fn5] and, \"a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.\" \n ",

But remember this Zardoz, that even when Israel, Gods people fell away as a Nation and a people, God always preserved a remnant of faithful Jews to represent His faith. God never loses or forsakes His own. Those whom you are speaking of were never His to begin with yet you are trying to paint all Christians as charlatans rather than clearly state that legitimate christian churches are being invaded and corrupted by charlatans. Here's a chapter that deals directly with this issue in regard to the Last Days zardoz. And note the underlined, as it applies directly to you.\n\n Silly Arch. Babbling is NOT a sign of the times nor of prophesy being fulfilled. Scripture actually mentions the OPPOSITE with Matthew 24:24 and other passages that state the opposite...that you, and your believers will be deceived from those AMONGST yourselves.\n \n Oh, never mind, you quoted such in the VERY passages you qoute.\n \n 2Pe 2:1 BUT there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. \n \n These false teachers will come from amongst YOUR kind, not from without.\n \n 2Pe 2:2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. \n 2Pe 2:3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.\n 2Pe 2:4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; \n 2Pe 2:5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; \n 2Pe 2:6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; \n 2Pe 2:7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked \n 2Pe 2:8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)-- \n 2Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, \n 2Pe 2:10 and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. \n They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries,\n \n This speeks of those who elevate themselves from within the church. The well dressed and wealthy pastor who racvenously devowers what his flock has to offer. They don't listen to others who state that what they are doing is wrong, they break away and form new churches, new sects, with alternative beliefs.\n I'm not speaking evil of 'dignitaries' but of those who presumptiously appoint themselves as such.\n \n How about Acts 20:30\n Even from your [b]own number[b/] men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.\n \n 1 Tim 6:5\n and constant friction between men of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.\n \n This deals with the financial gain such men seek after. The pulpits are full of them as are the airwaves. Deceiving all those who think their intentions are noble.\n Tell me Arch, how wealthy is your pastor?\n Is he humble as you or is his bold and boisterous and well appointed?\n If the 1st, you probably have little to fear, if the 2nd, I wouldn't be questioning me, I'd be interested in his motives.\n \n 2 Corinthians 11.\n Paul warns about false apostles, those who claim greatness (because of their 'gifts') but lead followers astray. 11:5 super apostles.\n Does your pastor claim a 'special anointing' for anything particular? If so, he could be one of these. if not, you have a little less to worry about.\n 11:14, Satan masquerading as an angel of light.\n None of that from me Arch. You know me for who I am. An unbeliever who simply repeats what scripture and experts state. I wear no vestuments, preach no sermon and collect no tithes or offerings. \n Whilst many protestants point to Catholicism or visa versa as satan in this regard, you must wonder who is who.\n I'm not saying your pastor is a pimp, I'm saying there are warning signes according to scripture on how to spot one.\n The ravenous beasts come from WITHIN, not without the Church.\n If you understood scripture, you'd know this to be the truth.\n \n \n \n As for the use of gifts for the common good as I mentioned and you asked about...here's your bible statements.\n 1 Corinthians 12:7\n Now to each one the manifstion of the Spirit is given for the common good.\n \n 1 Cor. 14:4\n he who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the Church.\n \n So, tell me how exactly did your personal prophesy edify the Church for the common good?\n \n 1 Cor 14:12 \n \n So, yes Arch...keep attacking the messenger who merely presents your own scriptures as evidence.\n Keep dodging the questions asked, I really don't need the answers.\n Keep overlooking every aspect of scripture that disagrees with your practices, that support the wolf in your fold whilst trying to say the wolf comes from without...it doesn't.\n I am who I am...are your church leaders who they say they are?\n \n As to Chemists' comments, there is validity in them.\n \n Arch, stating that when one presents the TRUTH or a matter opens way for further attack is REALLY BAD DEBATE STRATEGY.\n \n It's akin to burying your head in the sand and saying \"IF you are true about the comet coming to destroy the world, then really bad things will happen, thus, I WON'T believe it in.\"\n \n \nDO YOU SEE HOW YOU ARE SERVING ANTICHRISTIAN FORCES RATHER THAN PROTECTING OR FURTHERING GODS TRUTH IN ANY WAY ?\n\n DO YOU SEE HOW YOU ARE SERVING THE ANTICHRIST FORCES RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE TRUTH THAT FALSE TEACHERS EXIST IN DROVES AMONGST YOUR OWN KIND, PRECHING HERESY AND PREPARING THE WAY FOR THE END?",

The heresies he's referring to are of churches accepting homosexuality as normal and right. exercising gifts such as tongues against the bibles directions. But no where is it said it's improper to privately worship God with tongues or to receive a prophetic word of knowledge from God directly in private. I know this because it has happened to me and satan can't tell the future so I know it came from God.\n \n \nThis speeks of those who elevate themselves from within the church.

Only it isn't the whole church. Balance is the key. Some churches follow men rather than God and lose all balance. But you're trying to imply that the gift of tongues is false and that is a lie. Plain and simple.\n \n \nHow about Acts 20:30\n Even from your [b]own number[b/] men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.\n\n \n Christian cults such as Mormons and JWs, the Davidians and others exist. The snake handlers, and yes some even who stress that unless one speaks in tongues they aren't really saved. That too would be a false doctrine.\n \n \n1 Tim 6:5\n and constant friction between men of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.\n\n I have no reason to believe that men like this ever knew the truth. They are charlatans and they do exist today for sure.\n \n \nTell me Arch, how wealthy is your pastor?\n Is he humble as you or is his bold and boisterous and well appointed?\n If the 1st, you probably have little to fear, if the 2nd, I wouldn't be questioning me, I'd be interested in his motives.\n\n \n My pastor is a carpenter all week and started our church to serve God. He owns his own contractor business though and takes nothing from the church for himself at all. Not all pastors are grifters Zardoz.\n \n \n2 Corinthians 11.\n Paul warns about false apostles, those who claim greatness (because of their 'gifts') but lead followers astray. 11:5 super apostles.\n Does your pastor claim a 'special anointing' for anything particular? If so, he could be one of these. if not, you have a little less to worry about.\n 11:14, Satan masquerading as an angel of light.\n None of that from me Arch. You know me for who I am.

But they don't mean that the whole church is corrupted or that the gifts of the spirit are fraudulent. It only means that for every good gift God gives us, there are false prophets who will falsify and abuse them for their own greedy ends.\n \n \nAs for the use of gifts for the common good as I mentioned and you asked about...here's your bible statements.\n 1 Corinthians 12:7\n Now to each one the manifstion of the Spirit is given for the common good.\n \n 1 Cor. 14:4\n he who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the Church.\n \n So, tell me how exactly did your personal prophesy edify the Church for the common good?\n\n \n It didn't Zardoz, because it wasn't given to me in the church or in public at all. I told you, it was a personal Word of Knowledge given directly to me while I was in private Worship with my Heavenly Father. Are you saying God isn't free to speak directly to one of His children while they worship Him privately in their prayer room ? This is just more evidence that you don't know anything more than you read Zardoz. \n \n \nSo, yes Arch...keep attacking the messenger who merely presents your own scriptures as evidence.\n Keep dodging the questions asked, I really don't need the answers.\n Keep overlooking every aspect of scripture that disagrees with your practices, that support the wolf in your fold whilst trying to say the wolf comes from without...it doesn't.\n I am who I am...are your church leaders who they say they are?\n\n \n I didn't dodge any questions, nor do I deny that church's exist that practice false and corrupted doctrines. But you deceive yourself if you condemn all the gifts or the whole church as fraudulent. Here are all references to the gift of tongues in the New Testament.\n \n Mar 16:17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;\n \n Act 2:3 Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.\n \n Act 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\n \n Act 2:11 Cretans and Arabs--we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.\"\n \n Act 10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,\n \n Act 19:6 And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\n \n 1Cr 12:10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another [different] kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.\n \n 1Cr 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.\n \n 1Cr 12:30 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?\n \n 1Cr 13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.\n \n 1Cr 13:8 Love never fails. But whether [there are] prophecies, they will fail; whether [there are] tongues, they will cease; whether [there is] knowledge, it will vanish away.\n \n 1Cr 14:5 I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; *for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.\n \n 1Cr 14:6 But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?\n \n 1Cr 14:18 I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;\n \n 1Cr 14:21 In the law it is written: \"With other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,\" says the Lord.\n \n Note the bolded verse above, 1 Cor 14:21, even though the lord speaks to some in other tongues, they will not hear him. I could easily add for you Zardoz, that instead they will mock the gift and deny it because some among them abuse it. Discernment Zardoz, possibly the most important gift there is and you need it badly my friend.",

   "Actually you're wrong, God is not perfect and he admits it.\n \n Not only does he admit that he is a jealous god and jealousy is sinful but he also admits his mistakes...\n \n Genesis \n 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n \n 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n God has to repent for the fact that he created man...that arguably could be his greatest mistake\n \n 8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n Wow, it looks like God has realized his mistake and that man is evil anyways! Too bad he goes on to kill many more people because they don't worship him.\n \n Oops, did I take those verses out of context archangel??\n\n \n Actually, yes you are taking them out of context. God in no way has admitted imperfection in these verses. You take themout of context of the definition of God. God is perfect (according to the same texts). God is also just and merciful etc. Given that God is the only self existent (and when speaking about the christian God one must assume that point as that is how God is described) then God is the definer of all things. For one to assume definitions one must be able to cite authority. Eventually you get to the final authority. Much like the US constitution gives the supreme court the final authority on what the constitution means. What is the final authority. It is not the supreme court but rather the document (and the people in general) that give the supreme court the authority. It comes back to the people (government of and by and for the people). The constitution merely documents what the people think. The people decide how the court, legislature, and executive branch function.\n \n When discussing the christian God one must consider that the final authority is God. Whatever God causes or allows must be Good. God is the one who gets to say what is good and what is not.\n \n Just because you, a finite being (at best), thinks you know what is good and what is not, that does not mean that you actually do. Given the charactersitics of the christian God as he has described himself, then HE and HE alone gets to determine what is good and what is evil.\n \n I have heard the whole God of the old testament killing indiscriminately argument far too often. It is just illogical in context of the characteristics of God as defined in christian texts. You are assuming far too much and taking a very simplistic view of things given that humans cannot even accurately predict tomorrow's weather let alone what is good for all of humanity throughout all of time.\n \n Huck",

   "You can't have it both ways Zardoz, you can't call the gift of tongues counterfeit here and then post the scriptures below that speak to it being properly exercised by the Church.\n\n Hello, are you listening?\n \n Tongues = Speaking in a foreign language = Legit miracle and gift of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Tongues = Speaking in meaningless GIBBERISH = fraudulent counterfeit gift designed by charlatains for the conniong of believing but naieve Christians.\n From what I gather, 99.999999999% of all who engage in 'speaking in tongues' in todays 'Church' are babblers. The fraction of the other percentage are cases of urban legend or out right fabricated lies of the event.\n \n This IS NOT having it both ways. This entire tangent in tbhis thread has been ME informing YOU that tongues/ babblers are deceived.\n \n The problem seems to be so far, that you can't follow this line of reasoning.\n \n Glossia is tongues, it refers to speaking in a foreign languages (often not known to the speaker).\n For example. If, all of a sudden, I was gifted with the ability to speak Pharsie to an Iranian to convey Christianity to them, that's a gift. If I were to speak Pharsie in services and no one was present who knew this, I need to shut up OR have one who can 'interpret this tongue' so that the body of Christians there are edified.\n \n If all of a sudden I go 'Shebotati, Shebotaboti Shebotahiundi Jesus!' I would be speaking nonsense.\n Gibberish is just that. A non-language. Linguistics experts have confirmed it countless times over. \n It is NOT an angelic language. Logic (as I pointed out) would deny there is even such a one. Paul said IF he spoke in one...meaning he didn't. This was an anlogy for needing Love. \n \n All who have spoken in gibberish in the past have been proven heretics and false prophets.\n \n \nBecause you lack the spiritual discernment given through the holy Spirit you can only see what is written. You don't understand that the gift of tongues is exercised in personal private prayer time when ones spirit is yearning to reach God in deeper ways that our mind is capable of expressing. There is no denying what it feels like to have the Holy Spirit fill you to overflowing Zardoz, but of course there's also no way to demonstrate it for you over the net.\n\n This is B.S. and you know it.\n All you're doing is saying you won't listen to the messenger regardless of whether he's bringing the message of proven true bleivers for the past 2,000 years.\n I thoroughly understand the gift. I understand what scripture is pushing. I understand ALL of your bible Arch. I've been there, done that. \n There is NO SUCH thing as a 'private prayer tongue'. That's a MADE up belief not supported by the bible done by Pentecostals WHO INITIALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE. Since they were EASILY proven wrong, rather than give up the practice, they chose to eisigesis and FORCE bible to support their beliefs and practices. In early 1900's they thought they were speaking a foreign language as that is what the bible said would happen. Later, they MADE UP this prayer language B.S.\n \n I don't have to personally know how it feels, I have family members who used to do what you think you're doing, I have the testimony many former gibberish speakers who have later matured in their belief and in Christ confess to the falseness of gibberish speaking and what it actually did for them. Most say it handicapped their growth. Some few had it interfer with their faith. Why speak made up nonsense to praise and worship God of ask him for something? Use your own language.\n Jesus NEVER babbled...yet he was able to speak to some who may not have spoken his own tongue. The Centurian and Samaritan woman come to mind (but it is possible that they did know Aramaic).\n When Jeuss was stated to have prayed, his words in the bible are clear.\n \n In historical context of the times, those who are believed to have babbled then were the pagans common in Greek worship IN CORINTHIA (which Paul warned members there about) the Gnostics (who followed the apostate teachings of Thomas. Some of their works are written in 'gibberish') and other heathens. As to the Christian Gnostics. They've been considered heretics for ages. The current version of Gnosticism is the evangelical movement headed by the Word of Faith movement. They, like you, value 'personal revelation' over scripture.\n \n \nI would never deny that some apostate traditions have been interjected into the church in these last day. It is promised to happen after all. And some churches do abuse the gifts of the spirit. The snake handling churches for one obvious example. But I'm saying that the whole church hasn't been corrupted and your implication that it has is just plain wrong and a blatant lie.\n\n I haven't said the WHOLE church (in context of Christianity) is a lie. Babbling, laying on of hands when nothing happens, prophesising inaccuratly or wrongly, interpreting babbling, seeking personal revelations that contradict scriptures. Those are lies.\n YOU are the one who can't have it both ways.\n Unless you believe Mark 16:9-20 is false, you should have no problems with the snake handlers and poison drinkers. \n \n \nUntil you've experienced the gift and until you have experienced the filling of gods Holy Spirit, you are in no position to say what gifts are fraudulent or aren't needed. You realize you are calling God a liar don't you ? Because He gave us these gifts for a reason and He obviously felt we needed them.\n\n The indwelling of the H.S. (an emotional experience for most and deception to boot) does NOT override what scripture means!\n If tongues means and has always meant foreign languages, then a new movement saying it now means babbling dos not cut it. No matter what you 'feel' or think.\n An example would be, in scripture, Jesus is a male. If you had a personal experience and were later taught he was a female (or sexually neuter) then what is wrong?\n You were influenced and taught by others that babbling was the real deal. In your faith and acceptance, you open yourself. Babbling is a worm that can corrupt.\n We all (according to scripture) are vulnerable to something. Only the Christ was perfect. We can delude ourselves and be deluded by others. In your zealous quest to be a good servent and loyal son of Christ and desiring to accept EVERYTHING He has to offer, you can also find yourself blindly accepting a falsehood. \n Tongues/ gibberish would be one of the minor falsehoods to be honest. There IS occasionally some benefit to speaking gibberish but there can be damage too.\n A major false hood would be being led to deny the Triune nature of God or to believe that the atonement of the Christ at the cross was not sufficint for your salvation.\n \n \nSee 2nd Peter 2:1, Note the highlited. heresies and denying the Lordship of Jesus. The heresies he's referring to are of churches accepting homosexuality as normal and right. exercising gifts such as tongues against the bibles directions. But no where is it said it's improper to privately worship God with tongues or to receive a prophetic word of knowledge from God directly in private. I know this because it has happened to me and satan can't tell the future so I know it came from God.\n\n It isn't an all or nothing issue on how false prophets deal with the sheep. Otherwise all other passages dealing with them would have the same wording. You don't need to deny the Christ to introduce heresy.\n Paul warned of those who simply TAUGHT A DIFFERENT GOSPLE of Jesus. A little perversion, is the yeast that slowly rises to contaminate the whole.\n \n You can see this in most churches. Some are far off the mark of what Scripture states, some less so. Some sects even going so far as to reinventing the bible (such as Mormons and J.W.'s). \n \n You are right in a belief that no sect is perfect, no Pastor infallable. But you should be constantly questioning, ever vigilant and willing to step out of the box for inspection from time to time. \n \n I did point out 2 scriptures dealing with prophesy being for the edification of the Church, do you have any that says it can be used for private purposes?\n \n \nWe don't disagree on this. Only it isn't the whole church. Balance is the key. Some churches follow men rather than God and lose all balance. But you're trying to imply that the gift of tongues is false and that is a lie. Plain and simple.\n\n \n I know I may have gone off sounding harshly in criticism of gibberish. \n It's more than balance. It must always be in accordance to God's perfect will. If the bible is all you're said to need in life and 'scripture is good for the education and edification' of all (forgot which passage this is) then you should use it 1st and foremost. If a spirit is instructing you to babble, test it as you said to what scripture really means and really says.\n \n \nChristian cults such as Mormons and JWs, the Davidians and others exist. The snake handlers, and yes some even who stress that unless one speaks in tongues they aren't really saved. That too would be a false doctrine.\n\n Then you have slightly less to worry about when concerning babbling. Too many (Pentecostals) state you must have it to prove you have H.S. baptismal. A belief not supported by scripture at all.\n \n \nI have no reason to believe that men like this ever knew the truth. They are charlatans and they do exist today for sure.\n\n In agreement. \n \n \nMy pastor is a carpenter all week and started our church to serve God. He owns his own contractor business though and takes nothing from the church for himself at all. Not all pastors are grifters Zardoz.\n\n ;) Sounds like a swell guy walking is Pauls footsteps so as not to be a burden. \n If he has little problem discharging his pastorly duties to his flock or delegating them to trusted elders and such, then more than perfect for the times.\n You're probably not too surprised to know that he'd be in a minority except for new church leaders in store front ministries. And if he were, so long as he has no desire to grow his ministry off the backs of his followers, then he is serving God in accordance to scripture.\n \n \nAll of these warnings are true and good to heed. But they don't mean that the whole church is corrupted or that the gifts of the spirit are fraudulent. It only means that for every good gift God gives us, there are false prophets who will falsify and abuse them for their own greedy ends.\n\n I'm of the belief from what I know, learnt and have echoed by other 'beleivers' that practicing certain gifts in certain ways is fraudulent.\n \n \nIt didn't Zardoz, because it wasn't given to me in the church or in public at all. I told you, it was a personal Word of Knowledge given directly to me while I was in private Worship with my Heavenly Father. Are you saying God isn't free to speak directly to one of His children while they worship Him privately in their prayer room ? This is just more evidence that you don't know anything more than you read Zardoz.\n\n Then I'd describe the event as something other than prophesy as Paul speaks about. \"Predictions born of God\" or something similar. I know this isn't biblical but from scripture that I see, the GIFT of prophesy is for the Church, not personal use.\n You have any scripture to back your beliefs up?\n \n \nI didn't dodge any questions, nor do I deny that church's exist that practice false and corrupted doctrines. But you deceive yourself if you condemn all the gifts or the whole church as fraudulent. Here are all references to the gift of tongues in the New Testament.\n\n \n In this last post, you cleared up some issues.\n \n \nMar 16:17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;\n\n As said above, you can't deny the rest of the 'signs' which are taking up snakes and drinking poison.\n Furthermore, some state that Mark 16:9-20 were later added as they didn't exist in early manuscripts. If you believe this, then you need to disregard Mark here. If you beleive these passages are legitimate, you need to accept snakes and poisons.\n \n \nAct 2:3 Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.\n Act 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\n\n Read further, those listening heard them in their own languages WITHOUT need for interpretations. That's right, they didn't hear gibberish. Acts 2:4-11\n \n \nAct 2:11 Cretans and Arabs--we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.\"\n\n See above. No interpretations, listeners hear LANGUAGE...not sensless babbling.\n \n \nAct 10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,\n\n Wow, gentiles get the H.S. baptismal and a gift to speak in tongues (foreign languages) too.\n \n \nAct 19:6 And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\n\n As above but with the better gift of prophesy for all present to be edified.\n \n \n1Cr 12:10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another [different] kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.\n\n Yep, the miraculous power to speak in another foreign language to help SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS to the rest of the masses or to interpret these languages for the edification of the Church.\n \n An awsome miracle that helped spread the faith in it's infancy into the all persuasive religion you see today.\n \n \n1Cr 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.\n\n Varieties of languages. \n \n \n1Cr 12:30 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?\n\n Yep, only ONE type of tongues. Not 3 as Pentecostalsd state, not a special 'prayer language' as you're led to believe. And this passage furthers then notions you and I are aware of...that the H.S. gives as needed and not all get the same gift. Later were see it repeated with the 'Not all are mouths or hands' passages.\n \n \n1Cr 13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.\n\n NIV / NAS / New Living Translation / English Standard Version all have \"IF I speak in the...\" Amplefied has \"If I [can] speak...\" \n \n Only the weak KJV has 'Though' \n KJV is very poor translation Archy. You should know that.\n \n There is a world of difference between Though (meaning he does) and IF, meaning he doens't necessarily do so.\n It would have to be an analogy (unless you're a nonbeliver) because as I pointed out...multiple earthly languages are a PUNISHMENT for the tower of Babel. An event you believe in right?\n If before the babel event, all of mankind spoke with one language, it would be the one God gave us. It would also be the ONE language used in heaven. So, tell me Arch, logically speaking, what did the angels do wrong to be punished with TongueS? \n Even the Nephilim who come to earth did so prior to babel. How did they communicate unless they all spoke the same single language that Humas spoke? Gen 6:4\n Also why need to speak an angelic language? Did one speak to Joseph and Mary in 'gibberish' or use a languagfe they knew? There are other incidents here. There are NO incidents of needing to speak in an angelic language AT ALL in the bible other that in Pauls allegory on the IMPORTANCE of LOVE.\n \n \n1Cr 13:8 Love never fails. But whether [there are] prophecies, they will fail; whether [there are] tongues, they will cease; whether [there is] knowledge, it will vanish away.\n\n And when perfection comes, the need for all this will fall away. Some who support cesationism state the that perfection is the bible. They point out that 'perfection' mentioned here is gender neuter and when ever perfection refers to God or Jesus, it's gender mascaline. To be honest, up until this point, I really haven't cared to investigate on my own to check if this is true of the original Greek. You may want too though. But, still, tongues here is foreign languages too. 'In part' could refer to it's limited use in spreading the gospel. Now, when someone wants to go on a mission to foreign lands, they learn to speak the language or take an interpreter and can use the language for anything and not 'just' speaking about God.\n \n \n1Cr 14:5 I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; *for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.\n\n Yep. Speaking a foreign language to spread the Good News is great. But, how much better to prophesy so that the Church may gain MORE spiritual knowledge and grow more fuller.\n The issue with cesationism is, do we need MORE than just the bible in todays age? If you do, how do you deal with anything that contradicts scripture? More yet, if it confirms scripure, why even need it at all and not simply rely on what scripture already offers?\n \n \n1Cr 14:6 But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?\n\n Yep, people need to know what you say AND they need something worth listening to. But, in todays age...see above.\n \n \n1Cr 14:18 I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;\n\n You mean PAUL...speaking more tongues.\n Hmmm, why would he need to do that?\n \n DOH! Check out where he traveled in his life! Can you imagine the DIVERSE peoples he encounted and the many different nations of Gentiles he visited in his Christ mandated quest?\n He probably met every type of Roman (a multitude of different peoples who wer conquored by the empire out of Rome) who didn't speak latin. All sorts of peoples who flock around the mediteranian, Asia minor...\n MAN, just puill out your bible and look at his map routes! \n I see at least 4 LONG trips in my bible here. He crossed over a dozen nations and came into contact with several more through intertrading visitors in ports of call he stopped in. Add in the diversity of Rome and you have coutless differing earthly tongues.\n You want to spread the intimate teachings of Christ the Savior, what better way than to speak intimitly with the convert in his native tongue...ignoring trade languages.\n Yeah, I'd say the Corinitians (a metropolitan city like London or NYC today) had a lot of differnt languages going on and the church there spoke many languages to get new converts but Paul had them beat hands down with his need!\n \n \n1Cr 14:21 In the law it is written: \"With other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,\" says the Lord.\n\n \"21In the Law it is written, \"BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME,\" says the Lord.\" NAS version. By MEN...\n Earthly languages from the Gentiles and jews. Yet, the unbeliever won't listen.\n Just as some didn't lisgten on the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2. What's that, oh year, though they heard them in their own languages, they said they were drunkards.\n I need remind you, every instance of a tongue mentioned in the OT was a known earthly foreign language.\n \n Note the bolded verse above, 1 Cor 14:21, even though the lord speaks to some in other tongues, they will not hear him. I could easily add for you Zardoz, that instead they will mock the gift and deny it because some among them abuse it. Discernment Zardoz, possibly the most important gift there is and you need it badly my friend.[/QUOTE]\n \n I'm not mocking the gift. Just the counterfeit.\n I have openly admitted that miracles can happen. Which is either something we can't yet explain or something we never may be able to.\n Babbling can be explained away. Speaking a foreign language when you never studied it...less so. Yes, there will be always some who deny even that but, I can spout nonsense on demand and I'm furthest from 'grace'...and there will be someone there who sincerely believes they have the power of interpretations deciphering my made up gibberish.\n So far, with all these claims to miracles though, I and others can find few...fewer still attached to Christianity only.\n \n As for discernment.\n I've illustrated the above given scriptures in context of what they mean and were used for in the Church. That's discernment.\n Can you do the same with gibberish?\n \n An ideal on why gibberish was introduced by Satan. To prevent you from actually speaking to God. From giving him praise, worship and asking for intercession. \n What's the difference in me praying \n \"Oh, God, most high and mighty, I give thanks for you blessings and ask that you watch over my daughter who's ill with fever. I beg for a swift healing for her and continued blessings on my household. All things according to your perfect will and in your name alone I pray. Amen\"\n \n and \n \"Shanitzah bokarrah nasita rosita his'sa kam Ishi kam no rosita. Jesus hajjil Jesus borak kromata nasita ill rosita!\"\n \n And whilst you may say the H.S. can interceed and decipher for my 'groanings' I could also say if that's the case here, then the H.S. can decipher for everything else too. Why even bother opening my mouth? The H.S. knows my heart!\n Heck, I'll just think my prayers for God is omniscent.\n \n I've also heard some say that a prayer language is to hide your request from the devil so he can't seek to use it to hurt you. You really think to decieve the great deceiver?\n \n In the end, I think that in most cases, you'd find a private prayer language to be less useful than praying in your own tongue. If you don't know what to pray about (something I've also heard gibberish used for) why not just shout out praise and adorations?",

   "Actually, yes you are taking them out of context. God in no way has admitted imperfection in these verses. You take themout of context of the definition of God. God is perfect (according to the same texts). God is also just and merciful etc. Given that God is the only self existent (and when speaking about the christian God one must assume that point as that is how God is described) then God is the definer of all things. For one to assume definitions one must be able to cite authority. Eventually you get to the final authority. Much like the US constitution gives the supreme court the final authority on what the constitution means. What is the final authority. It is not the supreme court but rather the document (and the people in general) that give the supreme court the authority. It comes back to the people (government of and by and for the people). The constitution merely documents what the people think. The people decide how the court, legislature, and executive branch function.\n\n \n Well it seems to me (and a lot of other people I've talked to) that God seems to realize that he made a mistake. If god is supposed to be all-knowing, wouldn't he know that man is evil before he had to wipe out the entire population except for Noah etc...????? How do Christians account for this contradiction? It seems if God was perfect, this never would have taken place.\n \n \nWhen discussing the christian God one must consider that the final authority is God. Whatever God causes or allows must be Good. God is the one who gets to say what is good and what is not.\n \n\n \n Well that might work for you but I still can discuss the Christian God without considering him to be the final authority. See, that is how free will works emoticon_smile For some reason it seems to be that God has said that killing is a sin and therefore making it bad. So I guess what I'm having trouble understanding is this whole idea that God never does anything bad. I think to a lot of people, who like me, can look at god without Christian blinders on see God as a spiteful and unjust diety who kills. I just cannot accept the fact that just because God says he is perfect that people should be expected to believe his killing is a good thing emoticon_mad \n \n \nJust because you, a finite being (at best), thinks you know what is good and what is not, that does not mean that you actually do. Given the charactersitics of the christian God as he has described himself, then HE and HE alone gets to determine what is good and what is evil.\n \n\n Again, I believe God has already clearly lined out for us what is good and evil. I'm not claiming that puppies running through fields of daises is evil, I'm claiming that the genocides committed by your so called God is evil. You're so blind that you can't even admit this. It is the biggest joke in history that people who aren't clinically insane actually believe that these mass murders are a good thing. It is pathetic that your only reasoning is because God says it's okay\n \n \nI have heard the whole God of the old testament killing indiscriminately argument far too often. It is just illogical in context of the characteristics of God as defined in christian texts. You are assuming far too much and taking a very simplistic view of things given that humans cannot even accurately predict tomorrow's weather let alone what is good for all of humanity throughout all of time.\n \n\n \n I'm sorry but I will not distinguish between the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is your bible and I don't care if the god of the old testament doesn't exactly fall in line with what Christians believe today. It is the same God. Just because you have a new testament does not take away all the things that happened in the old testament. \n \n I don't think my view is simplistic, I think that my view is one of someone who is angry that the people around her believe such drivel. It's like I'm sharing the planet with a bunch of lunatics. \n \n Is this why so many Christians are pro-war...because you believe that your God is smiling down on you for killing all those nasty muslims? You do know that the cradle of civilization was the middle east right? So according to the bible we're all really middle eastern...ironic huh?\n \n I don't care how many times you tell me that I'm taking it out of context or my view is too simplistic or I don't understand God enough. Killing is killing is killing. I cannot live with myself and at the same time excuse some mythical being for murder just because he told me it was okay. I guess if god came down and killed your whole family because they did something bad you'd be okay with it...",

I do not believe in God necesarily. I am more of an agnostic. Read through other posts of mine, I make this fairly clear. \n \n Secondly, you have not at all argued the logic. I am not saying that you do not have permission to say the things you do, merely that it is illogical in its assumptions. You argue about the christian god. You state various things that you claim are true about the christian god and then claim that that god cannot exist because of those things. This is circular logic. Worse, you assume your claims to be correct which they are not. You do not take into context all of the information. The time of NOAH for instance was a time when the Law did not exist. It had not been written yet as Noah predates moses. There was no law against genocide or killing or anything of the sort.\n \n Secondly you do not address the illogic of the pot saying to the potter that it was created poorly or that the potter made a mistake.\n \n Huck",

It seems if God was perfect, this never would have taken place.\n\n \n I have to agree with Huck, just because God was sorry He made Man, it doesn't mean He made a mistake. It simply means He was frustrated at the way this creation was using the free will He gave them. Here are the passages that explain Gods reason for destroying all life on Earth and starting over with Noah and His immediate family along with his sons in law. If you'll note, the sons of God, or fallen Angels, mixed with women and had offspring creating a sub race that God couldn't allow to exist and polute the seed of humanity. Cleansing the human bloodline was the only option short of destroying all of humanity.\n \n Gen 6:1 \n NOW it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them\n Gen 6:2 \n that the sons of God (Angels) saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.\n Gen 6:4 \n There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\n Gen 6:5 \n Then the LORD[fn2] saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n Gen 6:6 \n And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.\n Gen 6:7 \n So the LORD said, \"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.\"\n Gen 6:8 \n But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n \n \nWell that might work for you but I still can discuss the Christian God without considering him to be the final authority.\n \n \n Do you believe there is only one God, or more than one ? And if you believe there is only one god then how can He not be the final authority ? This is where you lose me and confuse me.\n \n \nFor some reason it seems to be that God has said that killing is a sin and therefore making it bad. So I guess what I'm having trouble understanding is this whole idea that God never does anything bad. I think to a lot of people, who like me, can look at god without Christian blinders on see God as a spiteful and unjust diety who kills. I just cannot accept the fact that just because God says he is perfect that people should be expected to believe his killing is a good thing emoticon_mad\n\n \n Look at it from a perfect and holy Gods perspective. He is perfect and we, as human beings fall short of his Glory and perfection. He also say's not to murder the innocent, but no where does God say killing is wrong. Killing in War, killing murderers and rapists and other grievous law breakers is justified by Him. Well from Gods perspective, no one is perfect compared to Him. He could wipe out all life and because He created it He is free to destroy it. It is His to do with what He pleases.\n \n \nAgain, I believe God has already clearly lined out for us what is good and evil. I'm not claiming that puppies running through fields of daises is evil, I'm claiming that the genocides committed by your so called God is evil. You're so blind that you can't even admit this. It is the biggest joke in history that people who aren't clinically insane actually believe that these mass murders are a good thing. It is pathetic that your only reasoning is because God says it's okay\n\n \n If you actually studied the bible and learned in real historical context why God destroyed those Cities, Armies, Peoples etc. etc. and based on what I said above about His right to do with His Creation what He pleases, I think you'll see that although it can be referred to as mass killing, in no way was it mass murder because those pagans and heathens had broken every law of god you can imagine. Just as the World in this generation is also mocking the living God with our lifestyles. So don't be surprised when the hammer falls on us also. \n \n \nIs this why so many Christians are pro-war...because you believe that your God is smiling down on you for killing all those nasty muslims? You do know that the cradle of civilization was the middle east right? So according to the bible we're all really middle eastern...ironic huh?\n\n \n Christians are pro, a Just and Righteous War that protects Civilization from evil and satanic attacks by a Godless Cult that worships death and murder. That is precisely what Radical Islam represents to the World today. Christians also understand that we are in a Spiritual Battle in this life. A battle between Good and Evil. The Natural Man isn't even aware of this War over their very souls, so the arrive in eternity DOA having lost without ever putting up a fight at all.\n \n \nI don't care how many times you tell me that I'm taking it out of context or my view is too simplistic or I don't understand God enough. Killing is killing is killing. I cannot live with myself and at the same time excuse some mythical being for murder just because he told me it was okay. I guess if god came down and killed your whole family because they did something bad you'd be okay with it...\n\n \n If God is mythical then why are you so upset over the stories of His actions ? The fact is your very soul screams out of his existence and the unexplained questions bother you but if God wasn't real you wouldn't get angry. Just as you don't get angry about the Greek Gods unjust acts as the stories tell how they unfairly used and played with humans from Mt. Olympus. think about that before judging Him without personally satisfying yourself that He's really the ogre you seem to wrongly see Him as. Because I can personally attest that He is a God of Love and compassion for each and every one of us, and He loves us in a very personal way.",

   "First off I was to make this clear. I do not believe in God however I like to debate theology so for the sake of this discussion I will suspend my disbelief and argue using the bible and personal experience. Please do not think that just because someone does not believe in God that it means they cannot discuss the happenings of the Bible.\n \n \nLook at it from a perfect and holy Gods perspective. He is perfect and we, as human beings fall short of his Glory and perfection. He also say's not to murder the innocent, but no where does God say killing is wrong. Killing in War, killing murderers and rapists and other grievous law breakers is justified by Him. Well from Gods perspective, no one is perfect compared to Him. He could wipe out all life and because He created it He is free to destroy it. It is His to do with what He pleases.\n \n\n \n So using your logic I could kill my own child and I would be right because I created it, according to me I would be the creator not God because I don't believe in him. Which according to some people I've already done because I've had an abortion.\n \n So I guess that settles the abortion debate : ) !!! thanks arch!\n \n I do not really see how killing all the first born sons of Egypt is not murdering the innocent. Or allowing all the children of the earth to die during the flood is justified. I'm sure you could understand why I would not love or worship someone who at any moment could just kill me and my family.\n \n \nIf you actually studied the bible and learned in real historical context why God destroyed those Cities, Armies, Peoples etc. etc. and based on what I said above about His right to do with His Creation what He pleases, I think you'll see that although it can be referred to as mass killing, in no way was it mass murder because those pagans and heathens had broken every law of god you can imagine. Just as the World in this generation is also mocking the living God with our lifestyles. So don't be surprised when the hammer falls on us also. \n \n\n \n Actually I have studied the Bible. A few terms ago I took a \"Bible as Lit Class\" in school and it was fascinating. I have an awesome bible that shows in highlights the different authors of the bible, books on who and when the Bible was written etc...I have a lot of information. I also think that my class probably studied the bible in an entirely different way than you would in church or bible study. We looked at it as purely literature, in order to not only keep the peace but to allow others to look at this text away from a religious perspective. \n \n It really irks me that this God gave us free will but is punishing us for it supposedly. I'm assuming you believe in the death penalty because from your logic it is okay to kill in mass amounts those who break the law. Or does that only apply to biblical times that has nothing to do with the present? Man now decides judgment, not God. Of course we can never really be sure until we're dead but you can't prove to me that God exists when you're six feet under...or in an urn atop a mantle (which ever you prefer).\n \n You keep telling me that I need to understand the context, the logic behind etc God's decision in killing \"his people\" and I just don't accept that it is just. I can't just deny parts of the bible like some Christians do and say, \"well in this part god is kind and loving so that discounts his killings or makes his killings kind and loving\"....I'm sure all those people really thought god killing them was just spectacular!",

   "I have to agree with Huck, just because God was sorry He made Man, it doesn't mean He made a mistake. It simply means He was frustrated at the way this creation was using the free will He gave them. Here are the passages that explain Gods reason for destroying all life on Earth and starting over with Noah and His immediate family along with his sons in law. If you'll note, the sons of God, or fallen Angels, mixed with women and had offspring creating a sub race that God couldn't allow to exist and polute the seed of humanity.

I mean something very different in what I say. I would not say that God is \"frustrated\"\n \n In fact the word \"sorry\" in this passage that Aivlis refers to does not actually mean regret. The word is Nacham (transliterated since I do not have hebrew characters). It means to be grieved and to console ones self. God was not frustrated nor did he think he made a mistake. The passage, as I understand from the hebrew, confers a compassion upon man for what man has done. God felt for mankind. God did not feel \"sorry\" for himself but for mankind. That is why he was grieved. It bothered him how man was hurting himself.\n \n The rest of the passage where he wipes out mankind shows that God did this to provide man with the best chances possible. Looking at it from an eternal perspective instead of a temporal one, shows that it was the most compassionate thing he could have done.\n \n Huck",
