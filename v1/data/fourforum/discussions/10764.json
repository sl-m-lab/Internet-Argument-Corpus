   "Obscure title perhaps, but i refer of course to those bohemian speed demons, bicycle couriers. \n \n Last summer i graduated in geology, worked in the mines over the summer for experience, an then landed this job in November. I currently work in an office job entering data, I have my own office, flexible working hours, nice conditions and easy atmosphere. Its not what i graduated in, but at least its easy money till I go to Australia or Canada later in the year. \n \n The problem is, I hate it. Sure, by the numbers it seems handy, but I feel I am learning nothing, and wasting my youth sitting on chair watching my XXX grow. The lure of being an unfettered bicycle courier is stronger than ever. \n \n I am an experienced cyclist, and quite capable. The conundrum is that i will give up this warm, indoors job, for a minimum wage, all weathers job, which I hold in high regard, but may end up hating the reality of. \n \n I need advice?! Anyone have any experience as a courier, is it as bohemian and fun as i think? should i stay where I am and watch my soul decay? or should i stop dreaming and grow up?",

They don't get to sit around surfin' the net looking for another job either.\n \n \n What is waiting for you in Australia and Canada?",

   "Youth is really wasted on the young...\n\n \n Youth is the safety net for wisdom to be gained through mistakes. Wisdom is the safety net of the older whom should know better than to make such mistakes. (sorry that's a tad redundant for emphasis)\n \n Unfortunately, it is rare that the two intertwine.\n \n On topic, I recently decided to go to school for aeronautical/astronautical engineering over my existing career as a computer repairman/musician/part-time hair stylist because I felt that I had been given the gifts of logic, reasoning, and ability to understand higher-level math for a reason. I feel that if I do not advance the human race's knowledge of air and spacecraft then my life will have been wasted and my gifts squandered.\n \n Basically, if you feel the call for something, go do it. Never feel that you are living below yourself or are wasting your time. If you think you should do something then do it; really the question is not why should you, but why not?",
