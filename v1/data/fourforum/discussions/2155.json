   "I've heard for years that milk (calcium) is good for you. I've heard also for years that milk (fat) is bad for you. Is this an argument for low-fat (or no-fat) milk? Or maybe Caltrate?\n \n Incidently, there was not too long ago a study that concluded bacon (the burnt part) was bad for you. Of course they used rats in the study and concluded that you'd have to eat 70 pounds of burnt bacon a week to have the same dose of bad stuff...and everybody knows that if you drink 200 gallons of water in one hour, you will die.\n \n Additionally, a chemist friend of mine says that oxygen is actually what causes us to deteriorate and age. Can't live without it, can't live with it.\n \n I drink no-fat and 1% milk when I don't really want to taste the unmistakable goodness of whole milk.\n \n Which is worse for you...an 8oz glass of whole milk or a 16oz New York Strip?",

   "my mother in law who is a nurse of 30 years experience says that milk is very healthy for you, though you should propably drink low fat, or decrease your consumption some when you get older.\n\n \n Everything I've read on the subject basically says the same thing. Switch to low or no-fat milk (Saturated fat is still believed to be linked to heart disease), and if your body can tolerate it (many are lactose intolerant, or just don't seem to do well drinking a lot of milk later in life), it's not something you need to avoid.\n \n You can do without milk, there are plenty of other ways to get vitD and calcium. But low-fat/no fat is not inherently considered bad for your health. Seriously, I dont' know what I'd do without a bowl of skim milk+cereal in the morning. Well, OK, two bowls of that.\n \n -Mach",
