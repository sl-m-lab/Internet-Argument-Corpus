Bill Richardson declared a state of emergency Friday in four counties along the Mexican border that he said have been \"devastated\" by crimes such as the smuggling of drugs and illegal immigrants.\n \n The declaration said the region \"has been devastated by the ravages and terror of human smuggling, drug smuggling, kidnapping, murder, destruction of property and the death of livestock. ...\n \n \"[It] is in an extreme state of disrepair and is inadequately funded or safeguarded to protect the lives and property of New Mexican citizens.\"\n \n \n",

   "Nothing other than the main 'emergency' that the border counties face is economic. Most are near bankruptcy as a result of the burden of the healthcare costs of treating Mexican citizens who walk through the doors of ERs across the South West. Pretty much the entire social welfare net is stressed far in excess in the border counties, with little to no help from the federal government. Although the biger culprit IMO is the Mexican government. It would be helpful, if as the article suggests, they demolish these havens on the border that aren't even occupied by Mexican citizens. A paved highway that paralells the border isn't particualry helpful either. I think it is time for us to hand them a bill.\n \n The whole notion of a confrontation between individual states and the Mexican government raises interestign issues as well I think.",

Federal medicare funding to states (emergency services and aid to dependent children) has been and is being reduced as revenue sharing in general is diverted to the military budget and those services, complete with federal legislative compliance, become state burdens. Those who support our very expensive occupation of Iraq, where medical care is free, we're building hospitals and training medical personnel, are probably the same ones who volunteer for vigilante duty and complain about increased state and municipal expenditures. You can't have it both ways with a declining federal tax base in an economy driven by public and personal debt while pursuing nation building.

But then, you have also failed to provide any actual data on the number of amnesties...\n \n I do however wonder why you keep saying that our deportations are so strange. You yourself keep on claming that \"once the immigrants get past the border guard, they are free\". What about those that are caught BY the border guard? Are those not deported as well?\n \n However, I'm glad you finally dropped silent on the subject of EU immigrant beatings and US not deporting anyone...\n\n \n \n It is laughable to compare the illegals who are turned away at the border to deportations.....There are millions who get past the border guards in the US (anybody who lives in LA can attest to it) and the few who get caught by the border guards try again and again....till they get through...no comparison at all....I am not silent at EU immigrant beatings, I wrote about anecdotal evidence that was told to me...I have nothing more to add....but the reaction to it told me a lot...some people went crazy !",

   "Mae, get some numbers or stop making allegation. I posted deportation numbers for both the US and Europe, and they only list deportations, not \"turned back at border\", as these were not listed in either case. Same statistic, similar numbers. \n \n (PS, the US number:, Between October 1, 2003, and April 30, 2004, 660,390 people were detained by the United States Border Patrol as they tried to cross the border illegally.)\n \n If you really want to talk about problems and make comparisons, here you have some really interesting points:\n -estimated illegal immigration: US 1.1 - 1.3 million per year, EU 0.5 million per year.\n -estimated number of illegal immigrants present in US: 15-20 million (statistic taken from anti-immigration sites, so a grain of salt is to be applied) , EU: 3-4 million (neutral statistic).\n \n While not as severe as the US situation, it is obvious that the EU is also facing a similar situation as the US. And EU does not have such efficient natural barriers to hide behind. In reference to the topic, the EU already is facing the same thing as the US, and the cries for border closure are no louder in the EU than they are in the US. And social security services available in the EU are an order of magnitude above the US levels.\n \n Abuse of illegal immigrants by the police does happen. An immigrant in Austria suffocated because his mouth was taped shut. However, these are isolated cases and I am sure such excesses could be found in the US. The problem is that you tried to silence everyone by making the crazy claim of \"Wez, do you know how european countries treat ILLEGAL immigrants ?\" and following with the single incident. Thus, both Wez and myself responded and I think I have shown that the treatment of illegal immigrants in the EU is far from what you insinuated.\n \n P.S., out illegal immigrants try and try again too. Go to an Italian tourist resort and observe the (predominantly black and thus easily spotted) people selling tourists cheap handbags and plastic statues of the local tourist attractions. Watch how they pack up and leave when they are warned of police sweeps. And also watch the police mostly ignore them when they aren't on a sweep against them...\n \n We are both facing the same thing. We are too rich, and we grew rich at the expense of foreigners, by either exploiting their economies or just by being too tough competition to them. To them, we are heaven on earth, and it is only natural that they want to come here. Walls are not the solution. making it worthwhile to stay might be.",
