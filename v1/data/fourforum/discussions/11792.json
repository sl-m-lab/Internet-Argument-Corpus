   "As a result of falling oil prices, from a peak of $147/brl to $70/brl, Russia, Iran and Venezuela now face major financial crises. These three countries, who have been hostile recently to the Western World, will now have to deal with a new reality. Russia has been saving over $100 billion to deal with any financial issues, but still needs $75/brl to keep a balanced budget. Iran and Venezuela however have not saved sufficient resources and require $95/brl prices to maintain a balanced budget. Source: TrulyNewsworthy.com. \n \n All this spells disaster for these three countries. Although oil will not stay at $70/brl for long, because of reductions in production and eventual global growth, there should be enough time to watch these countries squirm as they try to deal with the crisis.",

   "This sounds like wishful thinking from WND. Oil was $60 a barrel two years ago, and first rose to $80 last year. The idea that their economies are destabilised by the return to \"normal\" levels after a few crazy months is ludicrous on its face.",
