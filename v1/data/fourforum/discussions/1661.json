Equally at what point does being human stop?\n\n I'm not certain what you are suggesting here, as I do not know how to interpret your semantics of certain terms and ideas. However, it appears that your arguments are not biologically sound.\n \n A sperm is an individual physical entity that will die as a sperm unless it fertilizes an ovum. An ovum is an individual physical entity that will die as an ovum unless it is fertilized by a sperm. On their own, they are cells from a parent organism. It is necessary that they join in order to create a new and unique member of the species (defined here simply by a unique entity that has everything that it needs save nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment to grow into an adult member of the species). Once they join, this new and unique entity is created. Nothing need be added to that entity during it's entire biological life except nourishment and oxygen in order that it may continue to grow and develop.\n \n OR... try this on... (I already posted this elsewhere in these forums, but figured it applied here, too.)\n \n Try a different approach for a moment... And please take this for what it is: a simple example. I do not care to discuss philosophy in this thread, so while you are certainly welcome to go there, I likely will not respond.\n \n The physical 'you' exists today. Your body can be seen, touched (scandalous!), smelled (eewww!), etc. Can you accept that?\n \n If there is a physical mass that is uniquely 'you' today, then either the 'physical' you has always existed, or it had a definite starting point. Unless you get metaphysical, it would be difficult to argue rationally that you always existed. Can you accept that?\n \n If you accept these statements, then the physical 'you' had a definite starting point. (If you see another option, please fill me in.)\n \n When was the starting point of the physical you?\n \n When you first had sex? (Let's get physical!) When you learned to drive? When you recognized your first thought as your own thought? When you were born? No, your physical body existed before all of these things happened. So, when did the physical 'you' begin developing? (Note that I am not discussing 'your personality' or any such thing -- only your physical body.) The answer goes back through your development to the time of conception/fertilization. Prior to conception, the physical 'you' did not exist. Only a sperm and an egg existed that joined to become the physical 'you.' Post-conception, there was not any point at which the developing 'blob of cells' transformed into the physical 'you.' Rather the blob of cells was the physical 'you' in the earliest stages of biological development.",

   "Kind of the point I was getting to, my original statement seemed to be misleading (and I have a sneaky suspicion that in my post-essay traumatised state, the clarification might not be better, if not tell me and I will try again).\n \n All cells exist as seperate entites and will die unless they complete their funciton, and in mnay cases will die after completing their function. I don't see the ova or sperm being special in this regard, if they are then we will get wierdness considering that they only survive by dividing into different cells and incorperating new material- in which case we are all the first reproducing molecule still suriving. Nothing needed to be added to anything other than compounds needed for survival, the embryo is nothing special in this regard other than the information it carries builds a very complex way of obtaining these things which has more specialised needs because of the complexitity.\n \n Your definition can not include speices as this has no real definition (or at least it does but doesn't make any sense as it disregards all the people who would be thought as the same species but are now dead), common sense can apply but this just modifies it to things we would think of as being in the same species which is no use to us.\n \n Now you've stopped poking and sniffing me I think this last bit is the important bit for abortion, when does a person, a 'you' form. trying to avoid philosophy but I would but it at the stage where 'you' become aware of 'yourself'. We are slowly closing in on what does this so hopefully we have a good solution to the abortion problem, in the meantime I see no real problem with going for the broader option of being able to see when the area where bit that does this is starts working. Although this does leave out some people I would rather class as people (despite them having no sense of self), but we are back onto having some specific defintion and then adding randomness to it. \n \n Guess it is best to stick with 'what most people would want to class as a person' as our definition and just face it that there will always be a minority going against this version whatever and that it will differ from place to place.",

Define \"life\". A fetus is not \"viable\" until it can be removed from the womb and survive.\"\n \n But it can't survive without someone looking after it. I think the law (funny how I'll use the law when it suits me) says that children should be supervised at home till they are 14. I have defined what I believe to be human life.\n \n \"Should in vitro fertilization be illegal? The success rate for in vitro fertilization is significantly less than 100%. That means that any number of the diploid cells that have already been \"conceived\" will DIE. They are definitely human by your definition and you \"do not see one stage (of human life) more deserving of life than another\".\"\n \n Yes it should be illegal by my definition.\n \n \"Do you agree with abortion as a result of rape or medical complication? (just curious)\"\n \n Only if the mothers life is in medical danger. \n \n I know that rape is an awful situation but I don't see the \"child\" responsible for its fathers crimes. But lets remember that the majority of abortions are usually due to lifestyle choices (I think, correct me if I'm wrong).",

The life does not exist untill conception. The mother has the right to get or not get pregnant. Once pregnant the life exists and so also has a right to do to its body as it wishes (As it is not then self aware that is the wrong language to use, but I think it is fair to say that the lifes purpose is to grow and live).

Therefore I consider many lives to have been created only to be destroyed.\n\n \n Actually, a number of eggs are fertilized and all are implanted, but only a few survive past the implantation phase to continue to grow into fetii, in otherwords, the few that don't survive effectively are miscarried. But doctors implant with knowledge that not all the fertilized eggs will survive.\n \n Why are you against in vitro fertilization?\n \n \nPregnacy is interwined so that a decision affects two different peoples choices.
