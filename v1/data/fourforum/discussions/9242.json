CIA orchestrated this.\n \n *Syria, 1956- CIA coercion used to keep filthy commies from real power. Used to justify plan for the CIA overthrow the Syrian government.\n \n *Middle East, 1957 - Eisenhower Doctrine gives the \"go ahead\" to American armed forces to protect American Interests in the middle east.\n \n Between 1957 and 1979, the United states government was too busy carrying out terrorism in dozens of other countries (Guatemala, Vietnam, and Italy, to name only a few), to terrorize the Middle east. They did spend some time in Iraq in the early 1970's as well.\n \n *Afghanistan, 1979 - Mujahideen insurgents aided and trained by the United States to overthrow soviet rule in Afghanistan.

Firepower demonstrated again to world.\n \n *Iraq, 2003- \"Operation Iraqi Liberation (O.I.L).....I mean Operation Iraqi Freedom\n \n *Iran, Present day - CIA operations underway to switch public opinion against president Ahmadinejad.

   "I guess you've been living in a cave somewhere for the past 30 years.\n\n \n Nice pun.\n \n \nIt's a well established fact that the CIA trained and equipped the Mujahadeen to fight against the Soviets.\n\n \n Well no. It's a well known fact to people who prefer sensationalism to fact. The boring truth is that the CIA didn't fancy getting too involved in case the USSR saw it as direct hostility, so they camped out in the Hindu Kush and trained Pakistanis and sold them weapons and somehow these found their way into Afghanistan...\n \n \nThe Mujahadeen would in later years turn into the Taliban and Al Qaeda who would then turn against the US. In CIA terms this is called \"blowback\".\n It was the CIA that taught the Mujahadeen to use a cell structure for their organisation. And now Al Qaeda is using all the things that the CIA has taught them. Ain't that a b!tch?\n\n \n What puzzles me is why people think this is America's just desserts. Even by your claims, they were helping the Afghans to fight a vastly better-equipped, larger and utterly ruthless occupying force. Perhaps you can explain?",

   "It's true that America has quite a lot of blood on its hands, but that doesn't excuse padding out your list with this nonsense.\n \n Afghanistan?! Aiding Pakistani Secret Services who were aiding the Mujahideen AGAINST the Soviet invasion force?!\n \n Iraq '91?! Iraq invades the Arab kingdom of Kuwait (and Saudi for that matter) - entirely supported by the UN (to the extent that Afghanistan sent a contingent of military medics). \n \n It beggars belief!\n\n \n Kuwait was engaged in stealing $2.4 billion of oil\n from the Rumaila oil field that ran beneath the vaguely-defined\n Iraq-Kuwait border and was claimed in its entirety by Iraq\n \n The reaction to all this by the world's only remaining superpower and self-appointed global policeman became the subject of intense analysis and controversy after Iraq actually invaded. Had Washington given Iraq a green light to invade? Was there, at a minimum, the absence of a flashing red light? The controversy was fueled by incidents such as the following:\n 19 July: Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stated that the American commitment made during the Iran-Iraq war to come to Kuwait's defense if it were attacked was still valid. The same point was made by Paul Wolfowitz, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, at a private luncheon with Arab ambassadors. (Ironically, Kuwait had been allied with Iraq and feared an attack from Iran.) Later, Cheney's remark was downplayed by his own spokesman, Pete Williams, who explained that the secretary had spoken with \"some degree of liberty\". Cheney was then told by the White House: \"You're committing us to war we might not want to fight\", and advised pointedly that from then on, statements on Iraq would be made by the White House and State Department.\n 24 July: State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler, in response to a question, responded: \"We do not have any defense treaties with Kuwait, and there are no special defense or security commitments to Kuwait.\" Asked whether the United States would help Kuwait if it were attacked, she said: \"We also remain strongly committed to supporting the individual and collective self-defense of our friends in the gulf with whom we have deep and longstanding ties\" -- a statement that some Kuwaiti officials said privately was too weak.\n 24 July: The US staged an unscheduled and rare military exercise with the United Arab Emirates, and the same Pete Williams then announced: \"We remain strongly committed to supporting the individual and collective self-defense of our friends in the gulf with whom we have deep and longstanding ties.\" And the White House declared: \"We're concerned about the troop buildup by the Iraqis. We ask that all parties strive to avoid violence.\"\n 25 July: Saddam Hussein was personally told by the US ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, in a now-famous remark, that \"We have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.\" But she then went on to tell the Iraqi leader that she was concerned about his massive troop deployment on the Kuwaiti border in the context of his government's having branded Kuwait's actions as \"parallel to military aggression\".\n 25 July: John Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, killed a planned Voice of America broadcast that would have warned Iraq with the identical party-line words used by Tutweiler and Williams. Hussein may not have known of this incident, although in April he had been personally assured by visiting Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, speaking in behalf of the president, that the Bush administration dissociated itself from a Voice of America broadcast critical of Iraq's human-rights abuses and also opposed a congressional move for economic sanctions against Iraq.\n 27 July: The House and Senate each voted to impose economic sanctions against Iraq because of its human-rights violations. However, the Bush administration immediately reiterated its opposition to the measure.\n 28 July: Bush sent a personal message to Hussein (apparently after receiving Glaspie's report of her meeting with the Iraqi leader) cautioning him against the use of force, without referring directly to Kuwait.\n 31 July: Kelly told Congress: \"We have no defense treaty relationship with any Gulf country. That is clear. ... We have historically avoided taking a position on border disputes or on internal OPEC deliberations.\"\n Rep. Lee Hamilton asked if it would be correct to say that if Iraq \"charged across the border into Kuwait\" the United States did \"not have a treaty commitment which would obligate us to engage U.S. forces\" there.\n \"That is correct,\" Kelly responded.\n The next day (Washington time), Iraqi troops led by tanks charged across the Kuwaiti border, and the United States instantly threw itself into unmitigated opposition.",

They kill a few civilians and no one sheds a tear. We happen to kill innocents even for the greater good and not on purpose and the press, the ploiticans all exploit this for personal and or political gain. The muslims feed off of this.
