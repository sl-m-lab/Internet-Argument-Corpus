   "I heard a thing recently on the news about some states requiring criminals to have DNA samples, so that on future crime scenes, the DNA can be tested against all the previously recorded DNA. My question is, should we keep DNA samples? When should we take them? Some people say only for repeat offenders, while others say all felons. I've even heard proposals of just getting a sample from the entire population. Now something about it makes me not like requiring DNA samples to be given, but at the same time why not? The only problem would be the possibility of a corrupt police force framing someone, and the ability to solve crimes would increase by a lot. Your thoughts?",
