Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam. It's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter.\n Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?\n By Noel Sheppard (Bio | Archive)\n April 25, 2007 - 21:54 ET \n It's conceivable that years from now, America's media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase \"carbon credits\" to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote \"carbon neutral.\"\n \n Given the media's love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.\n \n However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):http://www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html",

   "I also find it most interesting how little the defenders of global warming have to say now that these e-mails have been hacked and released for public consumption. All of a sudden, the personal opinions of these so called scientists shouldn't be considered evidence of their flawed science. They don't realize that true science receives universal consensus within the community like gravity does, for example. But global warming science HAS NEVER enjoyed universal support by equally qualified scientists. Yet, just as is exposed in these numerous e-mails, the pro GW scam participants used their positions to label any scientists who honestly reported the facts, as deniers and ignorant, even attempting to destroy their reputations.\n \n Science has lost all credibility since it has been shown that a political agenda has been allowed to corrupt pure scientific discoveries and repeatable observations. MUCH LIKE THE FRAUDULENT SO CALLED SCIENCE OF EVOLUTION WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED, REPEATED OR CONFIRMED AS REAL SCIENCE IS EXPECTED TO BE, AND IS RIFE WITH FRAUDS AND FALSE ASSUMPTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS, so has global warming now been exposed for what it is.

   "MORE than 70 Australian marine scientists have called for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the release of the first report card on the impact of climate change on the marine environment.\n \n Oceans around the continent have warmed and become more acidic and the East Australian Current has strengthened, bringing hotter, saltier water 350 kilometres further south than 60 years ago.\n \n This has caused coral bleaching and is the likely cause of a 10 per cent reduction in growth rates of corals on the Great Barrier Reef, according to the report, Marine Climate Change in Australia, 2009 Report Card.\n \n Other effects include a spread of destructive sea urchins in Tasmania, the death of sea turtles in Queensland and the spread of mangroves into freshwater wetlands in northern Australia.\n \n The report, by scientists from universities, state and territory environmental agencies, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, warns that two degrees of further warming is already unavoidable. ''A delay in reducing human-related emissions will result in even greater levels of climate change and subsequent impacts on marine species and habitats,'' it concludes.\n \n Elvira Poloczanska, of the CSIRO Climate Change Adaptation Flagship, said ocean warming also meant some subtropical plants and animals were moving south into temperate waters. This had already severely affected giant kelp forests in Tasmania.\n \n The report card, which is to be updated every two years, identifies where impacts have occurred, the predicted effects of climate change by 2030 and 2100, and scientific confidence levels in those predictions. It also outlines strategies for adapting to climate change, such as removing sea walls, increased surveillance for harmful algal blooms and managing the breeding habitats for sea birds better. A University of Wollongong researcher, Helen McGregor, said it was a ''call to arms'' for scientists, policymakers and the public to do everything possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n \n Marine scientists issue call to arms after devastating report",

Does it create a false impression, as an illusionist does on stage, right out in the open, in front of an audience? The trick, according to RealClimate.org, is to splice onto the end of a temperature reconstruction, built on proxy data going back several centuries, the data from instrumental records starting in 1960 and 1981. Now this is quite a trick, because it involves comparing apples (proxy data) to oranges (instrumental data) and pretending that the composite forms a continuous record...Grafting instrumental data onto proxy data to produce a seemingly continuous record is trickery, because instrumental data, unlike proxy data, are massively influenced by land-use changes and site-specific quality control issues.\"\n Suing NASA, Swine Flu Declines and Climategate Tricks - iContact Community\n \n",

As wrong as you are regarding every geo-political issue we discuss, and your extremely liberal interpretation of the bible, at least in one area of your beliefs I can agree with you, and that is that Jesus is Lord. Apart from that spiritual detail, there is little else we can agree on. So even the most wrong person on most issues is right sometimes. As is obviously the case with you and our friend Mr Griffin. To then attempt to paint me with the same brush as you paint him just because I posted an article announcing him as the EUs representative @ Copenhagen shows your blind hatred and bigotry for me. It surely isn't a testament of my agreement with Griffins geo-political belief system or overall philosophy in any way. As I said above, your attempt at any comparison is far more telling about your prejudices than any imagined prejudices of mine.\n \n I mean, am I not Israel's staunchest defender here @ 4forums IN REALITY? And can you quote any posts of me calling for the arrest or murder of moslems or homosexuals which would surely reflect an active hatred for them rather than the philosophical opposition I represent regarding the wrongness of their respective positions? So why do you attempt to paint me as a fascist when it is in fact your socialist leanings which have proven again, IN REALITY to grow into a true fascist state as evidenced by Hitlers Nationalist Socialist Party in the late 30s?\n \n Also, isn't it you who is standing against Israel right now on another thread as you attempt to paint them as a criminal regime while ignoring that her existence was the result of the first official act of the U N?

His department's databases on global temperature changes and its measurements have been crucial in building the case for global warming. \n \n \n What those emails suggested, however, was that Jones and some colleagues may have become so convinced of their case that they crossed the line from objective research into active campaigning. \n \n In one, Jones boasted of using statistical \"tricks\" to obliterate apparent declines in global temperature. In another he advocated deleting data rather than handing them to climate sceptics. And in a third he proposed organised boycotts of journals that had the temerity to publish papers that undermined the message. \n \n It was a powerful and controversial mix - far too powerful for some.

   "What do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us?\n\n \n I think that's an excellent question. Since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, I can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings. \n There have been several instances in which members of the IPCC have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did NOT reflect their research. Since the final IPCC reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, I'm not surprised with the claims made.\n Here's a relevent story.\n \n\n .........\n Scientists Fear Politicians\n \n A paper scheduled to be published this fall in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, \"Hurricanes and Global Warming,\" by six noted tropical cyclone experts, makes three main points regarding hurricanes and human activity:\n \n \n No connection has been established between greenhouse gas emissions and the observed behavior of hurricanes.\n \n \n The scientific consensus is that any future changes in hurricane intensities will likely be small, in the context of observed natural variability.\n \n \n The zeal by some for political reasons to link future hurricanes to global warming threatens both to undermine support for legitimate climate research and to lead to the implementation of policies that will be ineffective in mitigating hurricane impacts.\n \n \"It is interesting that a scientific consensus is ignored when it is convenient to the alarmist case,\" said Iain Murray, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"There is a strong consensus among hurricane scientists that global warming is not driving the current stronger hurricane seasons, yet alarmists who do not specialize in hurricane science repeatedly suggest a link and are repeatedly told by hurricane scientists how wrong they are.\n \n \"It will be an interesting test of the alarmists' claims that they are concerned with scientific integrity to see if they continue to make such baseless accusations,\" Murray added.\n \n \n Climatologists Face Bias\n \n Problems stemming from the politicization of global warming have already arisen. In a publicly released \"Dear Colleague\" letter in January 2005, Chris Landsea, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, resigned as an IPCC researcher.\n \n Landsea's resignation letter stated he felt that in his area of expertise--climate and hurricanes--the IPCC had become too politicized. In particular, he cited the Harvard news conference at which Trenberth linked the severity of the 2004 hurricane season to global warming.\n \n Landsea noted none of the speakers at the Harvard conference cited any new research in the field to support their claims. He went on to point out, \"The evidence is quite strong and supported by the most recent credible studies that any impact in the future from global warming upon hurricanes will likely be quite small.\"\n \n Similarly, Colorado State University climatologist Roger Pielke resigned his position from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program in August 2005, explaining that science was taking a back seat to alarmist propaganda and political posturing.\n Recent Hurricanes Not Caused by Warming, Scientists Conclude - by Sterling Burnett - Environment & Climate News\n \n",

   "Second, in a paper by Overpeck et al., they examine the implications for past and future sea level rise. The results show that the Greenland and other Arctic ice sheets probably did not contribute more than 3.4 m to the LIG sea level rise. However, data from coral reefs exposed above sea level today, and other evidence, point to an LIG sea level at least 4 m and possibly as much as 6 m greater than today. This suggests that the balance came from the Antarctic ice sheet. This is turn implies a strong sensitivity of the Antarctic ice sheet to sea level rise and climate warming - an idea that goes back to John Mercer (1976) but that had until recently fallen out of favor in much of the glaciology community. \n \n Projecting forward in time, the implication is that our future will also see 4-6 m of sea level rise, and that - given the recent evidence for accelerated flow of both Greenland and Antarctic glaciers - this may occur much faster than we expect. In the model simulations, Greenland may already be warmer in 2100 than it was at the height of the LIG. The rate of sea level rise associated with the warming into the last interglacial was probably greater than 10 mm/yr* while current sea level rise is roughly 3 mm/yr. To the extent that the LIG is a good analog for our future, sea level rise is therefore rather likely to accelerate.\n \n Also in this week's Science are two articles that further strengthen the case that ice sheets are quite sensitive to warming climate. A paper by G\u00f6ran Ekstr\u00f6m et al. shows that the increased speed of Greenland glaciers occurs in distinct lurches (observed as micro \"ice-quakes\") that are strongly seasonal, with the greatest number occuring in late summer. This provides evidence that meltwater plays an important role in the acceleration of Greenland's glaciers. Essentially, the idea is that surface melting that occurs in the summer can make its way quickly down to the glacier bed, lubricating the bed and allowing the glaciers to slide more rapidly. The \"ice quakes\" occur because the rough bedrock surface causes the glaciers to stick; they only accelerate when enough hydraulic pressure has built up to help float the glacier over the bumps. This is strong evidence that climate, not merely \"internal ice sheet dynamics\", has contributed to the recent increases in Greenland's glaciers. Indeed, a doubling of the rate of quakes has occurred over the past five years, just as the aerial extent of surface melting has increased.\n \n Finally, in a very nice bit of work Velicogna and Wahr use data from the \"Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment\" (GRACE) satellites to show that the Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass at a rate of 150 +/- 80 km3 each year since 2002. That's equivalent to about 0.4 mm of sea level rise each year. This is about twice other recent estimates, while IPCC 2001 actually gives negative 0.1 mm/yr. What is especially nice about Velicogna and Wahr's study is that by using gravity measurements they have measured mass changes directly, avoiding the problem of virtually all previous measurements of ice sheet mass change, which usually measure either input (snowfall) or loss (calving, melting, or thinning of the ice), but not both at once.\n \n What does all this news mean in practice? Reading the editorials in Science, and quotations from various researchers in newspaper articles, one might be under the impression that we should now expect \"catastrophic sea-level rise\" (as Science's Richard Kerr writes). Of course, what is catastrophic to the eye of a geologist may be an event taking thousands of years. In the Otto-Bliesner et al. simulations, it takes 2000-3000 years for Greenland to melt back to its LIG minimum size. And while we don't advocate sticking with the typical politician's time frame of 4 or 5 years, the new results do not require us to revise projections of sea level rise over the next century or so. This is because even with Arctic temperature continuing to rise rapidly, there will still be significant delay before the process of ice sheet melting and thinning is complete. There is uncertainty in this delay time, but this is already taken into account in IPCC uncertainty estimates. It is also important to remember that the data showing accelerating mass loss in Antarctica and rapid glacier flow in Greenland only reflect a very few years of measurements - the GRACE satellite has only been in operation since 2002, so it provides only a snapshot of Antarctic mass changes. We don't really know whether these observations reflect the long term trend.\n \n On the other hand, none of the new evidence points in the direction of smaller rates of sea level rise in the future, and probably nudge us closer to the upper end of the IPCC predictions. Those who have already been ignoring or naysaying those predictions now have even less of a leg to stand on. Coastal managers, real estate developers, and insurance companies, at the least, would be wise to continue to take such predictions seriously.** As Don Kennedy and Brooks Hanson write in the lead Editorial, \"accelerated glacial melting and larger changes in sea level should be looked at as probable events, not as hypothetical possibilities.\"\n \n RealClimate: How much future sea level rise? More evidence from models and ice sheet observations.\n \n no, the sky is not falling, the sea level is rising. emoticon_xdonno",

   "A heated debate\n Nov 26th 2009\n From The Economist print edition\n \n Why political orthodoxy must not silence scientific argument\n \n &#8220;WHAT is truth?&#8221; That was Pontius Pilate&#8217;s answer to Jesus&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice.&#8221; It sounds suspiciously like the modern argument over climate change. \n \n A majority of the world&#8217;s climate scientists have convinced themselves, and also a lot of laymen, some of whom have political power, that the Earth&#8217;s climate is changing; that the change, from humanity&#8217;s point of view, is for the worse; and that the cause is human activity, in the form of excessive emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. A minority, though, are sceptical. Some think that recent, well-grounded data suggesting the Earth&#8217;s average temperature is rising are explained by natural variations in solar radiation, and that this trend may be coming to an end. Others argue that longer-term evidence that modern temperatures are higher than they have been for hundreds or thousands of years is actually too flaky to be meaningful.\n \n Such disagreements are commonplace in science. They are eventually settled by the collection of more data and the invention of more refined (or entirely new) theories. Arguments may persist for decades; academics may&#8212;and often do&#8212;sling insults at each other; but it does not matter a great deal because the stakes are normally rather low.\n \n The stakes in the global-warming debate, however, could scarcely be higher. Scientific evidence that climate change is under way, is man-made, and is likely to continue happening forms the foundation for an edifice of policy which is intended to transform the world&#8217;s carbon-intensive economy into one which no longer spews greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. A lot of money, and many reputations&#8212;both academic and political&#8212;are involved.\n \n Sceptics claim that this burden of responsibility is crushing the spirit of scientific inquiry. Scientists, they maintain, are under pressure to bolster the majority view. The recent publication of embarrassing e-mails from the University of East Anglia, an important centre of climate science (see article), revealing doubts about data and a determination not to air such concerns publicly, has strengthened these suspicions.\n \n There is no doubt that politics and science make uncomfortable bedfellows. Politicians sell certainty. Science lives off doubt. The creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to establish a consensus on the science was an excellent idea for policymakers, who needed a strong scientific foundation for their deliberations, but it sits uncomfortably with a discipline that advances by disproving accepted theories and overturning orthodoxies.\n \n The danger of dissent\n Some would argue that, in matters of great public import, scientific dissent should be silenced. It can, it is true, do harm. When AIDS first reared its ugly head, no one knew what caused it. Gradually, the virus responsible was isolated, identified and then attacked successfully with drugs designed specifically to inhibit its reproduction. A few scientists, though, refused to accept the evidence, and some politicians used their arguments to justify inaction. Since one of those politicians was Thabo Mbeki, then president of South Africa, hundreds of thousands who might have been saved by an anti-AIDS policy grounded in scientific reality died as a result of his policies.\n \n Yet the damage in that case was done by the politicians. A leader who is determined to pursue a wrong-headed course will always find some scientist to support him. A world in which that were not true would be one in which a dangerously narrow consensus had taken hold.\n \n This newspaper believes that global warming is a serious threat, and that the world needs to take steps to try to avert it. That is the job of the politicians. But we do not believe that climate change is a certainty. There are no certainties in science. Prevailing theories must be constantly tested against evidence, and refined, and more evidence collected, and the theories tested again. That is the job of the scientists. When they stop questioning orthodoxy, mankind will have given up the search for truth. The sceptics should not be silenced.",

   "IS GLOBAL warming a trick? That is what some saw in a huge batch of e-mails and documents taken from the servers of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, in England, and put up anonymously on the web. The result has been a field day for those sceptical of the idea of man-made climate change, who have combed through them, pouncing and pronouncing on snippets that seem to show scientific malfeasance. \n \n The CRU specialises in studies of climates past. For parts of the past where there were no thermometers to consult, such studies use proxy data, such as tree rings. Reconstructions based on these tend to show that the planet's temperature has risen over the 20th century to heights unprecedented for centuries and perhaps millennia. They are far from the only evidence for believing in climate change as a man-made problem, but they are important, and the sharp uptick they show has taken on iconic value. A tree-ring reconstruction known as the \"hockey stick\", which shows unprecedented 20th-century warming, has been a particular target of criticism by sceptics. It was published in 1998 by Michael Mann (then at Yale, now at Pennsylvania State University) and his colleagues, and featured prominently in the 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \n \n There is nothing in the e-mails so far to suggest that the authors do not believe in man-made global warming and are making the whole thing up, as some have been claiming. A more serious concern is that they believe in global warming too much, and that their commitment to the cause leads them to tolerate poor scientific practice, to close themselves off from criticism, and to deny reasonable requests for data. \n \n More heat than light\n Some e-mails suggest the criticisms made by sceptics outside academic climate science may have had more support within it than might be expected. Comments on the tree-ring section of the IPCC's latest report by John Mitchell, director of climate science at Britain's Met Office, raise issues very like those highlighted by perhaps the most prominent critic of the hockey stick, Steve McIntyre, who runs a blog called Climate Audit. An e-mail apparently from Dr Mann refers to an aspect of some statistical testing he did not want discussed widely as \"dirty laundry\". Those worried that undue weight is being put on data from the tree rings of a dozen larches on the Yamal peninsula in Siberia, a topic that exercises Mr McIntyre, will be interested to see that some climate scientists shared some of their worries. \n \n None of this is evidence of fraud. Looked at broadly, the e-mails seem to show a pretty workaday picture of scientists, with frustrations and sloppinesses, disagreements, opponents badmouthed, and cultural differences bridged (for example, explaining to an American colleague not just why a particular person is a prat, but what a prat is in the first place). Some of the e-mails may, looked at in a context not currently available (those posted were a selection), add weight to previous criticisms by Mr McIntyre and others. But that, in itself, is not dramatic. Many of these issues were aired in the most recent IPCC report, though not particularly thoroughly. And the idea of anthropogenic climate change rests on a great deal more than just tree-ring records, useful as they are for providing context to the current warming. \n \n A spate of recent claims of global cooling, for example, rely on comparing 1998, the second-hottest year in the modern record (going to 1880), with 2008, which was relatively cooler. Yet, according to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a part of NASA, America's space agency, 2008 was the ninth-hottest year on record. 2009 is shaping up to be the sixth-hottest. All of the ten hottest years recorded have come since 1997. And retreating Arctic sea ice provides even more visible data to support conclusions of warming. \n \n \n Climate change: Mail-strom | The Economist",

The scientific consensus is not based on blind faith in the truthfulness of one set of data.\n\n \n \n You're wrong.\n \n\n Cold-Fusion Graybeards Keep the Research Coming\n By Mark Anderson 08.22.07 \n CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts -- At an MIT lecture hall on Saturday, a convocation of 50 researchers and investors gathered to discuss a phenomenon that allegedly does not exist. \n \n Despite a backdrop of meager funding and career-killing derision from mainstream scientists and engineers, cold fusion is anything but a dead field of research. Presenters at the MIT event estimated that 3,000 published studies from scientists around the world have contributed to the growing canon of evidence suggesting that small but promising amounts of energy can be generated using the infamous tabletop apparatus. \n \n How reproducible the experiments might be, however, and how the mysterious phenomenon works are still very much open to interpretation. \n \n Demonstrating recent results of energetic radiation streaming from a running cold-fusion experiment, Lawrence Forsley of JWK Technologies in Annandale, Virginia, passed around samples of his group's experimental apparatus -- all of which could be packed into a shoebox with room to spare. The compact plastic and rubber tubing illustrate the intrinsic paradox of this field: Compared to the warehouses worth of billion-dollar gadgetry needed to run \"hot fusion,\" cold fusion research is cheap to fund. And yet cash is the primary limiting factor holding the research back. \n \n The scarcity of funding -- and of young blood -- may testify to the discredited nature of the field, but the \"greybeards\" (as one presenter jokingly referred to his colleagues) keep turning up new results.\n \n Scientists at the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, or SPAWAR, in San Diego performed the work Forsley presented, which was published in June in the German journal Die Naturwissenschaften. It joins a long list of cold-fusion research papers that many scientists now reflexively write off as junk.\n \n Even some of cold fusion's top proponents are cautious when talking about the science. \n \n \"Should people believe in cold fusion based on the SPAWAR experiments (alone)? Probably not,\" said MIT's Peter Hagelstein, a co-sponsor of the conference, in an interview. \"But ... that's not how science works. In the cold-fusion business, a very large number of experiments done by a large number of laboratories over a large number of years have contributed to a knowledge base. And (the SPAWAR) experiments potentially tell you something about what's going on inside, if we can get a confirmation that they're right.\" \n \n The cold-fusion story began in March 1989, when two scientists from the University of Utah reported they had integrated an isotope of hydrogen (.pdf) called \"deuterium\" into a palladium rod and, running electrical currents through it, produced nuclear fusion in a jar. Several leading researchers around the United States, however, failed to replicate the results and soon pronounced cold fusion debunked, kicking the entire field to the sidelines of mainstream research.\n \n Today's understanding of nuclear fusion, which involves the synthesis of two hydrogens to make one helium in an energy-creating reaction, doesn't allow for the type of reaction reported in 1989. The only proven recipe to make helium out of two deuteriums requires re-creating the conditions inside the nearest working fusion reactor: the sun. \n \n Creating stellar temperatures and pressures inside a fusion reactor today requires more energy than the fusion reactions give back. In striking contrast to the standard CF tabletop equipment, construction of the world's most promising conventional fusion reactor, the $12.1 billion ITER in Cadarache, France, is expected to begin next year. It will take eight years to complete, and with it scientists hope to see commercial fusion power by 2040. \n \n MIT's Peter Hagelstein, on the other hand, said \"cold fusion\" reactions have yielded surplus energy from as far back as the initial experiments in 1989. Verification of these controversial results is not the problem -- many labs around the world have reproduced parts of the results many times. \n \n Instead, the damning element has been caprice. \n \n \"Excess energy comes in bursts in these experiments,\" said Hagelstein. \"The effect has been observed in many other laboratories. It's also not been observed in other laboratories, especially in the early days.\"\n \n Hagelstein's co-host, physician and electrical engineer Mitchell Swartz, reported his continued refinement of his own cold-fusion experiments, which he publicly displayed in operation over seven days at MIT in 2003. \n \n \"We have been running these (experiments) for so long,\" Swartz told the audience, \"that the question now is not just can we (generate) excess heat, it's can we get a kilowatt? Can we get a small car moving on this stuff?\"\n \n Robert Weber, managing director of the Watertown, Massachusetts-based consulting firm Strategy Kinetics, has worked with startup technologies and says cold fusion is in a bind in the United States today. Researchers need at least $50 to $100 million in seed money, he said, to fully test its viability and commercial applications, if any.\n Cold-Fusion Graybeards Keep the Research Coming \n\n \n You see, cold fusion proponents are alive and kicking.

   "Global Warming Scandal Makes Scientific Progress More Difficult, Experts Say\n The trustworthiness of the scientific community's global warming data pool is being called into question as the scandal over climate data continues to unfold.\n \n \n The latest revelation came on Sunday with the publication of a report by The Sunday Times of London that scientists at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom confessed to throwing out most of the raw temperature data on which the theory of global warming is founded.\n \n \n The loss of the data prevents other scientists from checking it to determine whether, in fact, there has been a long-term rise in global temperatures during the past century and a half.\n \n \n \"They are making scientific progress more difficult now,\" says Willie Soon, a physicist, astronomer and climate researcher at the solar and stellar physics division of the Harvard University-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \"This is a shameful, dark day for science,\" he said in an interview with FoxNews.com.\n \n \n \n Soon also suggested that there has been systemic suppression of dissenting opinion among scientists in the climate change community, ranging from social snubs to e-mail stalking and even threats of harm.\n Many in the environmental policy community are outraged about the disclosure that the data has been lost. \"The scientific process has become so appallingly corrupted,\" James M. Taylor, senior fellow in environment policy at The Heartland Institute, told FoxNews.com.\n \n \n Heartland is a libertarian think tank in Chicago that recently produced a conference featuring scientists and policymakers, like Jose Maria Aznar, the former prime minister of Spain, and Vaclev Klaus, the president of the Czech Republic, who dispute the theory of global warming.\n \n \n The report in the Times quoted Roger Pielke, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, who requested the original records from CRU.\n \"The CRU is basically saying, 'Trust us.' So much for settling questions and resolving debates with science,\" Pielke told the Times. He did not return repeated phone calls seeking additional comment. The university's publicist also was unable to answer additional questions about the story.\n \n \n \"This closed-door conspiracy is harming everyone,\" says Soon. \"I thought I had seen it all. Now I have.\"\n \n \n A back story is also starting to emerge, depicting a rough world of suppression of dissenting opinion. Soon, who has been involved in climate change research for 15 years and has published in the field, said there was a general consensus that global warming was possible in the late 1990s. But at the time, the research community wanted to look back not just 150 years but 1,000 years, to see what the long-term trends had been.\n \n \n Soon says some scientists became staunch advocates for their position that global warming was occurring, and that they they dug in and started refusing to publish papers with contradictory viewpoints.\n \n \n \"I read a paper on increasing heat in the ocean and asked the scientist in France for the backup data,\" Soon says. \"She told me she did not distribute data to people who didn't agree with her conclusions.\"\n \n \n Soon says he has been victimized by other \"ugly\" personal attacks from leading scientists in the global warming world when he has simply raised questions, as any scientific colleague would, about the veracity of the data.\n \n \n \"Seeing all of this controversy in the news is no different than dealing with them in person,\" he said. \"There's a lot of personal ugliness.\"\n \n \n Taylor, who is also outspoken in his questioning of climate change theory, says he too has encountered ugliness from global warming enthusiasts, including \"e-mail stalking\" and \"people making thinly veiled threats to physically harm me and my family.\" He said his opponents at public forums have refused to shake his hand or even acknowledge his presence.\n \n \n Much scientific research corroborates what the CRU has been reporting, despite the missing data. \"It's true that GISS (NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) ground-based temperature reports show temperature increases similar to CRU,\" Taylor said.\n \n \n But then the CRU scandal erupted.\n \n \n Hackers uncovered e-mails between leading global warming advocates, which expressed concerns that the temperature figures from the last decade simply did not demonstrate that global warming was continuing, as theorized.\n \n \n Now, some critics are questioning even the seemingly reliable data from the U.S. government.\n \n \n \"The GISS and NOAA reports suffer from the same reliability concerns as the CRU ground-based temperature reports,\" Taylor says. \"And, more importantly, are similarly staffed by outspoken global warming activists who are likely engaging in the same data rigging and data hiding as CRU.\"\n \n \n But global warming backers aren't so sure.\n \n \n \"I don't think this is a big deal,\" Nick Berning, director of public advocacy and media relations for Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, based in Washington D.C., said. \"These are people who want to get their panties in a bunch, so they've gotten their panties in a bunch.\"\n Global Warming Scandal Makes Scientific Progress More Difficult, Experts Say - Science News | Science & Technology | Technology News - FOXNews.com",

I mean, the doubts about this theory as you say, isn't even questionable but is the direct result of 10,000 emails sent over many years that show a conspiracy to deceive the world via absolutely falsified and adulterated evidence. Beside, since when do the proponents of this scam call AGW a THEORY? NEVER IS WHEN! They have announced without question that this science is proven and irrefutable which of course has just been proven to be another absolute lie. And I'm not the only one making the correlation between this fraud of AGW and the Evolution Fraud which has been being perpetrated since Darwin asked the original questions back in the 19th century. http://www.progressiveu.org/blog/55136-piltdown-man-and-agw-global-warming-scientific-fraud-unravels\n \n So my question for you iangb, is where is your outrage that your trusted scientific methodology which you place your trust in so faithfully has been proven to be a total sham, a scam, a complete fraud where politics ruled the outcome of their so called independent scientific minds and agendas? And where is your outrage that legitimate scientists have been attacked, insulted and their careers threatened and even destroyed in some cases just for daring to speak against evidence they knew was false and adulterated? Why doesn't that outrage you iangb? So given that reality, why shouldn't we disregard the whole baseless theory and start over using only reliable objective science? What's wrong with doing that? You know, start over and reject any source of input which has a political axe to grind!!! Doesn't that sound reasonable given the evidence which has been exposed recently?",

In fact, I find it impossible to attribute the contributions to the US when much of the CO2 attributed to us comes here on the Jet Stream from the real contributors. To have INDIA so much lower than us is based on what numbers? India's? Do they submit these posted results? Can you prove that India is less polluted than us, and if not, then how can you claim that they are a lesser contributor as your posted link suggests? \n \n Here's an example of the fictional fudge factor I believe exists with the condemners of America as they make fallacious excuses for other third world countries. Our massive auto ownership is held up as the great contributor of the USs CO2 contributions as compared to other countries. But here is one comparable fact. With 300 million citizens, we have around 100 million cars on the road. And I admit that is a high per capita ownership of one car for every 3 citizens in the USA. But the vast majority of those cars have emission control systems on them by law to the tune of probable 98%. Your JP Sartre's who own classic cars are maybe 2% of the population.\n \n Now lets look at the 1.1 billion India(ns). I would bet they have at least 300 million vehicles on their roads and the vast minority of them will be manufactured without emissions control systems like ours are required to have since they have no legislation that even requires it. So the largest single category of claimed pollution in America is still a minor contributor compared to the other countries which are lower on the list you submit as evidence. Now look at Pakistan, China, Russia, all of Africa and most of Asia and then tell me that we should be number 2 on that list on a per capita basis. The fact is you can't. And if the US isn't a per capita polluter on the suggested scale, then no way are we the number 2 contributor of CO2 worldwide.",

   "World's leading climate change expert says summit talks so flawed that deal would be a disaster\n \n In an interview with the Guardian, James Hansen, the world's pre-eminent climate scientist, said any agreement likely to emerge from the negotiations would be so deeply flawed that it would be better to start again from scratch.\n \n \"I would rather it not happen if people accept that as being the right track because it's a disaster track,\" said Hansen, who heads the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.\n \n \"The whole approach is so fundamentally wrong that it is better to reassess the situation. If it is going to be the Kyoto-type thing then [people] will spend years trying to determine exactly what that means.\" He was speaking as progress towards a deal in Copenhagen received a boost today, with India revealing a target to curb its carbon emissions. All four of the major emitters - the US, China, EU and India - have now tabled offers on emissions, although the equally vexed issue of funding for developing nations to deal with global warming remains deadlocked.\n \n In Hansen's view, dealing with climate change allows no room for the compromises that rule the world of elected politics. \"This is analagous to the issue of slavery faced by Abraham Lincoln or the issue of Nazism faced by Winston Churchill,\" he said. \"On those kind of issues you cannot compromise. You can't say let's reduce slavery, let's find a compromise and reduce it 50% or reduce it 40%.\"\n He added: \"We don't have a leader who is able to grasp it and say what is really needed. Instead we are trying to continue business as usual.\"\n \n That enormous body of scientific evidence has been put under a microscope by climate sceptics after last month's release online of hacked emails sent by respected researchers at the climate research unit of the University of East Anglia. Hansen admitted the controversy could shake public's trust, and called for an investigation. \"All that stuff they are arguing about the data doesn't really change the analysis at all, but it does leave a very bad impression,\" he said.\n \n \n \n Hansen, a reluctant public speaker, says he was forced into the public realm by the increasingly clear looming spectre of droughts, floods, famines and drowned cities indicated by the science.\n He has irked some environmentalists by espousing a direct carbon tax on fuel use. Some see that as a distraction from rallying support in Congress for cap-and-trade legislation that is on the table.\n \n He is scathing of that approach. \"This is analagous to the indulgences that the Catholic church sold in the middle ages. The bishops collected lots of money and the sinners got redemption. Both parties liked that arrangement despite its absurdity. That is exactly what's happening,\" he said. \"We've got the developed countries who want to continue more or less business as usual and then these developing countries who want money and that is what they can get through offsets [sold through the carbon markets].\"\n \n For all Hansen's pessimism, he insists there is still hope. \"It may be that we have already committed to a future sea level rise of a metre or even more but that doesn't mean that you give up.\n \"Because if you give up you could be talking about tens of metres. So I find it screwy that people say you passed a tipping point so it's too late. In that case what are you thinking: that we are going to abandon the planet? You want to minimise the damage.\"\n \n \u0095 James Hansen's book Storms of My Grandchildren is published by Bloomsbury, \u00a318.99",

I can't imagine that the prospect of becoming a third world economy is attractive to anyone, no matter what their political bent.

Is it any wonder Americans ARE finally waking up? \n \n Obama, the disgrace that he is, has bowed to foreign leaders, pandered to the UN and traveled to how many countries bow sucking up all the while selling America down the river.

Many in his own party have noticed and are balking. \n \n The far left doesn't care about world dominance (yet) just as long as they get their welfare checks, nanny state perks and not lift a finger to help themselves. What they fail to realize is, Marxism, communism, socialism...call it what you want, is right around the corner if MORE people don't wake up. \n \n What I find currious, albeit funny, all the politicians don't grasp the fact that any of the aforementioned forms of governments all had short tenures in the scheme of time.

   "Introduction\n \n \n This paper grew out of my work at both Monash University and at World Vision, where I focus on the current impacts and future projections of climate change in developing countries. Some may be interested to know why an international development agency like World Vision would be taking the science of climate change so seriously. The reason is that climate change is already impacting poor communities around the world and the projections of future impacts if we do not act to rein in emissions are nothing short of horrific - a word I do not use lightly. \n \n \n \n For the poor and for today's children who will inherit our legacy, these are not abstract debates. They are not opportunities for political point scoring, or for fighting left-right culture wars. The science of climate change matters and it deserves to be taken seriously. \n \n \n \n When the British economist John Maynard Keynes was derided for changing his position on economic policy he replied: \"When the facts change, I change my position. What do you do, sir?\" Keynes' response reflects the open-minded attitude of a genuine inquirer, a true skeptic, willing to change his mind when new information emerges, or when the weight of evidence, the balance of probabilities and the risks and consequences of being wrong become overwhelming. \n \n \n \n Not everyone approaches the issue of climate change in this open-minded way. Some come to the science through the lenses of political ideologies or economic interests, maintaining positions dogmatically in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and endlessly recycling views that have been repeatedly debunked by scientists. We have seen this approach before with those who continue to deny the moon landings, the link between HIV and AIDS and the link between smoking and cancer.[1] Some continue to try to convince the public and governments that there is a raging debate among scientists about the main drivers of climate change. There isn't. As Nicholas Stern, author of The Stern Review on the climate change for the British Government[2], wrote recently: \n \n \n \n The argument for inaction, or for weak or delayed action, would make sense on the basis of reservations about the science only if one could assert that we know for certain that the risks are small. In the face of the evidence we now have, that is a complacent, ignorant and dangerous position to take. It is not healthy skepticism or an openness of mind; it is a denial of evidence and reason.[3]\n \n \n \n This document discusses some of that evidence and responds to some of the most common objections. It is not intended to be comprehensive and the interested reader is referred to the reference list and the 'Useful Resources' section at the end for more comprehensive websites and other materials. Please send any constructive comments or suggestions for improvements to: \n \n Brett [dot] Parris [at] buseco.monash.edu.au\n \n \n BP Climate FAQs",

   "PAOLA TOTARO \n December 5, 2009 \n LONDON: Australian weather records for an international database on climate change were a \"bloody mess\", riddled with entry errors, duplication and inaccuracies, leaked British computer files reveal. \n \n The Herald found the criticism in a 247-page specialist programmer's log, unearthed among the thousands of files hacked from East Anglia University, which is at the centre of a climate change email scandal. \n \n Labelled \"HARRY-READ-ME\", the log catalogues problems with the raw, historical climate data sent from hundreds of meteorological stations around the world. \n \n The Australian data comes in for particular criticism as the programmer discovers World Meteorological Organisation codes are missing, station names overlap and many co-ordinates are incorrect. \n \n At one point the programmer writes about his attempts to make sense of the data. \"What a bloody mess,\" he concludes. In another case, 30 years of data is attributed to a site at Cobar Airport but the frustrated programmer writes: \"Now looking at the dates. something bad has happened ... COBAR AIRPORT AWS [automatic weather station] cannot start in 1962, it didn't open until 1993!\" \n \n In another he says: \"Getting seriously fed up with the state of the Australian data ... so many false references ... so many changes ... bewildering.\" \n \n The log spans four years of work at the university's Climatic Research Unit, the British keeper of global temperature records. The programmer rails that the information has \"no uniform integrity\". \n \n His criticisms relate solely to the construction of the database and do not question the validity of historical temperature records or analyses that suggest the impact of human activity on global warming trends.\n \n \"I am very sorry to report that the rest of the databases seem to be in nearly as poor a state as Australia was. There are hundreds if not thousands of pairs of dummy stations, one with no WMO and one with, usually overlapping and with the same \n \n station name and very similar co-ordinates. I know it could be old and new stations, but why such large overlaps if that's the case? Aarrggghhh! There truly is no end in sight.\" \n \n Michael Coughlan, the head of the National Climate Centre at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, said it was difficult to comment without knowing the source of the raw data. It was unlikely to have come directly from the bureau's centre because unchecked, raw data was rarely requested for climate analysis. The bureau had a network of more than 100 specially selected weather stations to monitor climate change, and a century of records from them had been checked. \n \n \"We've put an enormous effort into developing a high-quality reliable climate record for Australia and all that data is freely available,\" Dr Coughlan said. \n \n But he said that if the British programmer had been using raw weather data, which is sent around the world in real time for weather forecasting, it would not be surprising that it contained errors. This raw data could have come from countries other than Australia, and would have been difficult to correct without access to information in Australia, such as the original field books. \n \n \"A computer programmer sitting in England won't have the resources to make those corrections. I can understand their frustrations,\" Dr Coughlan said.\n \n The programmer's log is one of the most read files worldwide since the email archives were leaked. The log has been treated particularly sympathetically as it reveals his blow-by-blow frustrations, which seemed to be unfolding as his scientist colleagues, including the head of the Climatic Research Unit, Phil Jones, appeared to discuss via email ways to avoid freedom-of-information requests for raw data and to denigrate their critics. \n \n Professor Jones, who has denied a conspiracy to manipulate global warming statistics as \"complete rubbish\", has stood down from his post while the university investigates the leaks. \n \n The Herald attempted to contact Professor Jones and spoke to the computer programmer we believe to be the author of the file. The programmer did not deny his name but referred queries to the university's media unit. Professor Jones has not responded. \n \n RealClimate, a website run by climate scientists, confirms the log as the work of a specialist charged with upgrading data. \n \n \"Anyone who has ever worked on constructing a database from dozens of individual, sometimes contradictory and inconsistently formatted datasets, will share his evident frustration with how tedious that can be,\" it says. \n \n Climate email mess hits Australia",

   "From your source, Winston.\n \n\n The three working groups of the Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, produced reports on The Physical Science Basis, Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change, as well as a Synthesis Report. Drafts of the chapters attracted more than 30,000 comments, which were taken into account in producing the final reports.[6] Each of the reports includes a Summary for Policymakers. Unlike the chapters making up the substance of the reports on which these summaries are based, the summaries are agreed line-by-line by government delegates, which includes all governments who are members of the WMO and UNEP. While tedious and sometimes controversial, this process has had the advantage of ensuring that all member governments sign off on the summaries of the reports, which, as Leemans notes, \"has been instrumental in the broad acceptance of IPCC's conclusions by UNFCCC and policy makers.\"[7] \n\n \n I'm not aware of ANY scientific journal in the world that has politicians as its peer review group. emoticon_rolleyes",

Now, first you say that scientific opinion is the opinion of scientists, therefore both science (what scientists do) and scientific opinion (the conclusions of scientists) are inextricably connected. No problem here. It is like &#8216;defining&#8217; Art as &#8216;what artists do&#8221;, not a definition really but sounds clever. But later you say that there is science and there is opinion (scientific I suppose), and the twain will never meet.

Sorry, but you can't have it both ways. To say that climatologists and all other scientists are not doing science is preposterous, what are they doing then ? \n \n Scientists do science, therefore their opinion on scientific matters has the authority of science, unlike your opinion which is just the opinion of a lay person, and therefore your opinion has no authority. \n As usual you are confusing the issue by making all opinions the same, the opinions of scientists and of laymen which is incorrect. \n The opinion of a doctor in a medical matter such as the diagnosis of an illness has authority; the opinion of a layperson has not. Otherwise why consult a doctor when you feel ill, why not just ask a person in the street?\n I don&#8217;t see any truth at all in what you are saying: denying climate change and the impact of mankind on it. The consensus of the scientific world is well known and that is why we have Copenhagen. Therefore when one comes across a person who denies at all costs what the majority perceives as a threat, one has to ask oneself why is this so, and therefore where if not in psychology must one look for an explanation for her behaviour ?\n It is funny to see an atheist arm in arm with fundamentalists such as chooselife and archie denying climate change. I can understand the Bible fundamentalists but an atheist? Weird.\n \n I have posted and pasted enough articles and scientific opinions of experts in the field. Based on what they have to say (based on their opinions, as you would say), I believe that yes, global warming is man made at the present and yes, it will be catastrophic if we do nothing about it. This is the consensus of all the government heads in Copenhagen.\n I don&#8217;t want to repeat what I have pasted previously for if you don&#8217;t listen to those experts then it is pointless for me to try to convince you. As I said before if nothing is done and what has been predicted happens you will say: &#8220;yes, now I am convinced but before there was no proof&#8221; what good will that do, except having the satisfaction of saying: &#8220;I told you so, you were wrong, the models were right&#8221;\n If we had to convince everyone, even the fringe, before we took action nothing would be done, ever. \n Bertrand Russell was of the opinion that when in doubt it is better to listen to the experts on the subject and abide by their advice. This is what we all do when we follow Doctor&#8217;s &#8216;orders&#8217; so, what is the problem in doing the same when the health of our planet and therefore mankind&#8217;s is at stake?",

If they are right then it is prudent to prevent rather than to cure.\n \n Yes, everything is subjective, in the sense that we have objects and subjects, but it doesn't mean as you are trying to imply that the cost benefit analysis is wrong (subjective)\n \n So because some scientists allegedly manipulated some data it means that all scientists all over the world have done the same? Does it mean that we have to abandon science? Do you really believe that climate change is a worldwide scientific and governmental conspiracy, to what purpose? You must be really desperate in your attempts to deny climate change to clutch at such straws\n \n I shouldn't have asked the above, for it is proven beyond doubt that there is always a conspiracy and there is always an evil purpose behind it. Right?\n IMHO scientists are humans beings just like anybody else, not secular saints, but truth always comes out the winner in the end. Science in the end corrects itself. \n \n \n \n \nThat's a very good question, and I suspect the answer is \"no, it isn't\", but I'll accept that it's at least debateable as long as you move away from Popperian definitions of science and into something a lot less rigorous. I think you'd struggle to define science in such a way that it \n \n a) included climate modelling\n b) excluded the economic modelling of Lehman Brothers, Freudian Psychoanalysis, Marxist Historicism, Soviet Central Planning and the occupation of Greyhound Gambling.\n \n Much of \"climate modelling\" resembles these pseudosciences.\n\n \n Since you are a scientist, not a psychologist, I am sure you are right about climate modelling. Those doing climate modelling are not scientists but pseudoscientists. You know better.\n Also the earth is not warming, that is a subjective theory, C02 levels in the atmosphere have not increased since the industrial age and besides it is just a theory that they contribute to an increase in temperature, and if they do is minimal and it hasn't been proven and scientific opinion is just an opinion and climate science is just pseudo science and it is subjective in any case and blah blah blah..\n \n By the way, isn't it funny that you didn't include psychology and economics in your list of pseudo sciences?\n \n I think climate modelling would be considered by Popper science, for no one has said that is not falsifiable. The whole point, that you miss again and again, is that if the theory, the modelling is correct and we wait until you and the deniers are convinced of it before we act, by then it will be too late to reverse the catastrophe.\n \n I believe that even now it is too late to do anything and, little will be done to reduce emisssion so nature will run its course.\n \n Past decade the warmest since records began in 1850\n \n You can have the last word.",

   "One of the few enlightening sentences uttered by former US President George W. Bush during his terms in office was that the West is \"addicted to oil.\"\n \n The extent of that addiction was apparent in many actors at Copenhagen, but especially in one. He only came for a few hours, but he was also decisively responsible for the chaos that marked the negotiations: James Inhofe, a Republican politician who does whatever he can in Washington to inhibit Obama's efforts to impose CO2 limits. He is not only ridiculous in describing climate change as made up by \"the Hollywood elite,\" but outright dangerous. He would rather sacrifice American natural beauty at home and American soldiers abroad than to push his country to the forefront of a green technology revolution.\n For men of his ilk, oil and coal are tantamount to power, not a curse. They believe that Americans have a God-given right to release twice the level of emissions as the Europeans and four times as much as the planet's average inhabitant. \"The Inhofe Supremacy\" could be the name of a film about the man, because the primacy in the world he is trying to secure for his country is enormous. But there are plenty of Chinese, Indians and Australians who think similarly. Working together in Copenhagen, they prevented humanity from starting to work together to solve a number of shared problems -- to the detriment of every start-up investment that has the prospect of a hundred years of green profits.\n Men like Inhofe, who in Copenhagen warned that nations shouldn't be \"deceived into thinking the US would pass cap-and-trade legislation,\" have the effect of poison when it comes to the urgently needed global trust-building.\n As in nuclear disarmament, the expectation is pivotal that the other side will take the same difficult steps. But as long as the danger persists that a party could again come into power in America that would wipe the findings of climate science from the table and would rather send soldiers abroad than solar power engineers, then there won't be much trust towards the US. And the Chinese may be talking the talk on climate issues, but as long as they are only spending a small part of their enormous cash reserves on green investments, their credibility will be compromised.\n \n For the time being, the oil movement remains stronger than the environmental movement, the egotists stronger than the people willing to share, the SUV movement greater than that of the train riders.\n \n The faction of people who are willing to risk damage to posterity is greater than that of those who would prefer caution. \n \n http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,668408,00.html",

This scientist chap worked it out using a different trick and proposed that the seas hadn't filled up yet. He didn't disprove any assumptions because there were no assumptions to disprove. \n My suggestion that you didn't understand is proven, though.\n\n \n I'm guessing that not many of these environmental scientists are trained chemists. If they were, they would know the laws that govern CO2 content in water. They would also know that there are equilibriums that exist between soluble and insoluble carbonates. Due to common ion effects, as more CO2 is absorbed, more carbonate is removed from the system via precipitation of carbonate-containing rocks, such as Trona.",

   "You people are beyond the pale in your denials of reality and the truth regarding this scam.\n CLIMATE CHANGE IS NATURAL: 100 REASONS WHY\n December 15, 2009 - budsimmons\n CLIMATE CHANGE IS NATURAL: 100 REASONS WHY\n \n Climate change campaigners: 100 reasons why climate change is natural and not man-made\n \n Tuesday December 15,2009\n \n HERE are the 100 reasons, released in a dossier issued by the European Foundation, why climate change is natural and not man-made:\n \n 1) There is \"no real scientific proof\" that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man's activity.\n \n \n 2) Man-made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history.\n \n 3) Warmer periods of the Earth's history came around 800 years before rises in CO2 levels.\n \n 4) After World War II, there was a huge surge in recorded CO2 emissions but global temperatures fell for four decades after 1940.\n \n 5) Throughout the Earth's history, temperatures have often been warmer than now and CO2 levels have often been higher - more than ten times as high.\n \n 6) Significant changes in climate have continually occurred throughout geologic time.\n \n 7) The 0.7C increase in the average global temperature over the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term, natural climate trend\n \n The IPCC theory is driven by just 60 scientists and favourable reviewers not the 4,000 usually cited.\n \n 9) Leaked e-mails from British climate scientists - in a scandal known as \"Climate-gate\" - suggest that that has been manipulated to exaggerate global warming\n \n 10) A large body of scientific research suggests that the sun is responsible for the greater share of climate change during the past hundred years.\n \n 11) Politicians and activiists claim rising sea levels are a direct cause of global warming but sea levels rates have been increasing steadily since the last ice age 10,000 ago\n \n 12) Philip Stott, Emeritus Professor of Biogeography at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London says climate change is too complicated to be caused by just one factor, whether CO2 or clouds\n \n 13) Peter Lilley MP said last month that \"fewer people in Britain than in any other country believe in the importance of global warming. That is despite the fact that our Government and our political class-predominantly-are more committed to it than their counterparts in any other country in the world\".\n \n 14) In pursuit of the global warming rhetoric, wind farms will do very little to nothing to reduce CO2 emissions\n \n 15) Professor Plimer, Professor of Geology and Earth Sciences at the University of Adelaide, stated that the idea of taking a single trace gas in the atmosphere, accusing it and finding it guilty of total responsibility for climate change, is an \"absurdity\"\n \n 16) A Harvard University astrophysicist and geophysicist, Willie Soon, said he is \"embarrassed and puzzled\" by the shallow science in papers that support the proposition that the earth faces a climate crisis caused by global warming.\n \n 17) The science of what determines the earth's temperature is in fact far from settled or understood.\n \n 18) Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, CO2 is a minor greenhouse gas, unlike water vapour which is tied to climate concerns, and which we can't even pretend to control\n \n 19) A petition by scientists trying to tell the world that the political and media portrayal of global warming is false was put forward in the Heidelberg Appeal in 1992. Today, more than 4,000 signatories, including 72 Nobel Prize winners, from 106 countries have signed it.\n \n 20) It is claimed the average global temperature increased at a dangerously fast rate in the 20th century but the recent rate of average global temperature rise has been between 1 and 2 degrees C per century - within natural rates\n \n 21) Professor Zbigniew Jaworowski, Chairman of the Scientific Council of the Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection in Warsaw, Poland says the earth's temperature has more to do with cloud cover and water vapor than CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.\n \n 22) There is strong evidence from solar studies which suggests that the Earth's current temperature stasis will be followed by climatic cooling over the next few decades\n \n 23) It is myth that receding glaciers are proof of global warming as glaciers have been receding and growing cyclically for many centuries\n \n 24) It is a falsehood that the earth's poles are warming because that is natural variation and while the western Arctic may be getting somewhat warmer we also see that the Eastern Arctic and Greenland are getting colder\n \n 25) The IPCC claims climate driven \"impacts on biodiversity are significant and of key relevance\" but those claims are simply not supported by scientific research\n \n 26) The IPCC threat of climate change to the world's species does not make sense as wild species are at least one million years old, which means they have all been through hundreds of climate cycles\n \n 27) Research goes strongly against claims that CO2-induced global warming would cause catastrophic disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.\n \n 28) Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, rising CO2 levels are our best hope of raising crop yields to feed an ever-growing population\n \n 29) The biggest climate change ever experienced on earth took place around 700 million years ago\n \n 30) The slight increase in temperature which has been observed since 1900 is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term natural climate cycles\n \n 31) Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, rising CO2 levels of some so-called \"greenhouse gases\" may be contributing to higher oxygen levels and global cooling, not warming\n \n 32) Accurate satellite, balloon and mountain top observations made over the last three decades have not shown any significant change in the long term rate of increase in global temperatures\n \n 33) Today's CO2 concentration of around 385 ppm is very low compared to most of the earth's history - we actually live in a carbon-deficient atmosphere\n \n 34) It is a myth that CO2 is the most common greenhouse gas because greenhouse gases form about 3% of the atmosphere by volume, and CO2 constitutes about 0.037% of the atmosphere\n \n 35) It is a myth that computer models verify that CO2 increases will cause significant global warming because computer models can be made to \"verify\" anything\n \n 36) There is no scientific or statistical evidence whatsoever that global warming will cause more storms and other weather extremes\n \n 37) One statement deleted from a UN report in 1996 stated that \"none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases\"\n \n 38) The world \"warmed\" by 0.07 +/- 0.07 degrees C from 1999 to 2008, not the 0.20 degrees C expected by the IPCC\n \n 39) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says \"it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense\" but there has been no increase in the intensity or frequency of tropical cyclones globally\n \n 40) Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere can be shown not only to have a negligible effect on the Earth's many ecosystems, but in some cases to be a positive help to many organisms\n \n 41) Researchers who compare and contrast climate change impact on civilizations found warm periods are beneficial to mankind and cold periods harmful\n \n 42) The Met Office asserts we are in the hottest decade since records began but this is precisely what the world should expect if the climate is cyclical\n \n 43) Rising CO2 levels increase plant growth and make plants more resistant to drought and pests\n \n 44) The historical increase in the air's CO2 content has improved human nutrition by raising crop yields during the past 150 years\n \n 45) The increase of the air's CO2 content has probably helped lengthen human lifespans since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution\n \n 46) The IPCC alleges that \"climate change currently contributes to the global burden of disease and premature deaths\" but the evidence shows that higher temperatures and rising CO2 levels has helped global populations\n \n 47) In May of 2004, the Russian Academy of Sciences published a report concluding that the Kyoto Protocol has no scientific grounding at all.\n \n 48) The \"Climate-gate\" scandal pointed to a expensive public campaign of disinformation and the denigration of scientists who opposed the belief that CO2 emissions were causing climate change\n \n 49) The head of Britain's climate change watchdog has predicted households will need to spend up to \u00a315,000 on a full energy efficiency makeover if the Government is to meet its ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions.\n \n 50) Wind power is unlikely to be the answer to our energy needs. The wind power industry argues that there are \"no direct subsidies\" but it involves a total subsidy of as much as \u00a360 per MWh which falls directly on electricity consumers. This burden will grow in line with attempts to achieve Wind power targets, according to a recent OFGEM report.\n \n 51) Wind farms are not an efficient way to produce energy. The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) accepts a figure of 75 per cent back-up power is required.\n \n 52) Global temperatures are below the low end of IPCC predictions not at \"at the top end of IPCC estimates\"\n \n 53) Climate alarmists have raised the concern over acidification of the oceans but Tom Segalstad from Oslo University in Norway , and others, have noted that the composition of ocean water - including CO2, calcium, and water - can act as a buffering agent in the acidification of the oceans.\n \n 54) The UN's IPCC computer models of human-caused global warming predict the emergence of a \"hotspot\" in the upper troposphere over the tropics. Former researcher in the Australian Department of Climate Change, David Evans, said there is no evidence of such a hotspot\n \n 55) The argument that climate change is a of result of global warming caused by human activity is the argument of flat Earthers. \n \n 56) The manner in which US President Barack Obama sidestepped Congress to order emission cuts shows how undemocratic and irrational the entire international decision-making process has become with regards to emission-target setting.\n \n 57) William Kininmonth, a former head of the National Climate Centre and a consultant to the World Meteorological Organisation, wrote \"the likely extent of global temperature rise from a doubling of CO2 is less than 1C. Such warming is well within the envelope of variation experienced during the past 10,000 years and insignificant in the context of glacial cycles during the past million years, when Earth has been predominantly very cold and covered by extensive ice sheets.\"\n \n 58) Canada has shown the world targets derived from the existing Kyoto commitments were always unrealistic and did not work for the country.\n \n 59) In the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, David Davis MP said of previous climate summits, at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and Kyoto in 1997 that many had promised greater cuts, but \"neither happened\", but we are continuing along the same lines.\n \n 60) The UK 's environmental policy has a long-term price tag of about \u00a355 billion, before taking into account the impact on its economic growth. \n \n 61) The UN's panel on climate change warned that Himalayan glaciers could melt to a fifth of current levels by 2035. J. Graham Cogley a professor at Ontario Trent University, claims this inaccurate stating the UN authors got the date from an earlier report wrong by more than 300 years.\n \n 62) Under existing Kyoto obligations the EU has attempted to claim success, while actually increasing emissions by 13 per cent, according to Lord Lawson. In addition the EU has pursued this scheme by purchasing \"offsets\" from countries such as China paying them billions of dollars to destroy atmospheric pollutants, such as CFC-23, which were manufactured purely in order to be destroyed.\n \n 63) It is claimed that the average global temperature was relatively unchanging in pre-industrial times but sky-rocketed since 1900, and will increase by several degrees more over the next 100 years according to Penn State University researcher Michael Mann. There is no convincing empirical evidence that past climate was unchanging, nor that 20th century changes in average global temperature were unusual or unnatural.\n \n 64) Michael Mann of Penn State University has actually shown that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age did in fact exist, which contrasts with his earlier work which produced the \"hockey stick graph\" which showed a constant temperature over the past thousand years or so followed by a recent dramatic upturn.\n \n 65) The globe's current approach to climate change in which major industrialised countries agree to nonsensical targets for their CO2 emissions by a given date, as it has been under the Kyoto system, is very expensive.\n \n 66) The \"Climate-gate\" scandal revealed that a scientific team had emailed one another about using a \"trick\" for the sake of concealing a \"decline\" in temperatures when looking at the history of the Earth's temperature. \n \n 67) Global temperatures have not risen in any statistically-significant sense for 15 years and have actually been falling for nine years. The \"Climate-gate\" scandal revealed a scientific team had expressed dismay at the fact global warming was contrary to their predictions and admitted their inability to explain it was \"a travesty\".\n \n 68) The IPCC predicts that a warmer planet will lead to more extreme weather, including drought, flooding, storms, snow, and wildfires. But over the last century, during which the IPCC claims the world experienced more rapid warming than any time in the past two millennia, the world did not experience significantly greater trends in any of these extreme weather events.\n \n 69) In explaining the average temperature standstill we are currently experiencing, the Met Office Hadley Centre ran a series of computer climate predictions and found in many of the computer runs there were decade-long standstills but none for 15 years - so it expects global warming to resume swiftly.\n \n 70) Richard Lindzen, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote: \"The notion of a static, unchanging climate is foreign to the history of the Earth or any other planet with a fluid envelope. Such hysteria (over global warming) simply represents the scientific illiteracy of much of the public, the susceptibility of the public to the substitution of repetition for truth.\"\n \n 71) Despite the 1997 Kyoto Protocol's status as the flagship of the fight against climate change it has been a failure.\n \n 72) The first phase of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which ran from 2005 to 2007 was a failure. Huge over-allocation of permits to pollute led to a collapse in the price of carbon from \u008033 to just \u00800.20 per tonne meaning the system did not reduce emissions at all. \n \n 73) The EU trading scheme, to manage carbon emissions has completely failed and actually allows European businesses to duck out of making their emissions reductions at home by offsetting, which means paying for cuts to be made overseas instead.\n \n 74) To date \"cap and trade\" carbon markets have done almost nothing to reduce emissions.\n \n 75) In the United States , the cap-and-trade is an approach designed to control carbon emissions and will impose huge costs upon American citizens via a carbon tax on all goods and services produced in the United States. The average family of four can expect to pay an additional $1700, or \u00a31,043, more each year. It is predicted that the United States will lose more than 2 million jobs as the result of cap-and-trade schemes. \n \n 76) Dr Roy Spencer, a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has indicated that out of the 21 climate models tracked by the IPCC the differences in warming exhibited by those models is mostly the result of different strengths of positive cloud feedback - and that increasing CO2 is insufficient to explain global-average warming in the last 50 to 100 years.\n \n 77) Why should politicians devote our scarce resources in a globally competitive world to a false and ill-defined problem, while ignoring the real problems the entire planet faces, such as: poverty, hunger, disease or terrorism.\n \n 78) A proper analysis of ice core records from the past 650,000 years demonstrates that temperature increases have come before, and not resulted from, increases in CO2 by hundreds of years.\n \n 79) Since the cause of global warming is mostly natural, then there is in actual fact very little we can do about it. (We are still not able to control the sun).\n \n 80) A substantial number of the panel of 2,500 climate scientists on the United Nation's International Panel on Climate Change, which created a statement on scientific unanimity on climate change and man-made global warming, were found to have serious concerns.\n \n 81) The UK's Met Office has been forced this year to re-examine 160 years of temperature data after admitting that public confidence in the science on man-made global warming has been shattered by revelations about the data.\n \n 82) Politicians and activists push for renewable energy sources such as wind turbines under the rhetoric of climate change, but it is essentially about money - under the system of Renewable Obligations. Much of the money is paid for by consumers in electricity bills. It amounts to \u00a31 billion a year.\n \n 83) The \"Climate-gate\" scandal revealed that a scientific team had tampered with their own data so as to conceal inconsistencies and errors. \n \n 84) The \"Climate-gate\" scandal revealed that a scientific team had campaigned for the removal of a learned journal's editor, solely because he did not share their willingness to debase science for political purposes.\n \n 85) Ice-core data clearly show that temperatures change centuries before concentrations of atmospheric CO2 change. Thus, there appears to be little evidence for insisting that changes in concentrations of CO2 are the cause of past temperature and climate change.\n \n 86) There are no experimentally verified processes explaining how CO2 concentrations can fall in a few centuries without falling temperatures - in fact it is changing temperatures which cause changes in CO2 concentrations, which is consistent with experiments that show CO2 is the atmospheric gas most readily absorbed by water.\n \n 87) The Government's Renewable Energy Strategy contains a massive increase in electricity generation by wind power costing around \u00a34 billion a year over the next twenty years. The benefits will be only \u00a34 to \u00a35 billion overall (not per annum). So costs will outnumber benefits by a range of between eleven and seventeen times.\n \n 88) Whilst CO2 levels have indeed changed for various reasons, human and otherwise, just as they have throughout history, the CO2 content of the atmosphere has increased since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and the growth rate has now been constant for the past 25 years.\n \n 89) It is a myth that CO2 is a pollutant, because nitrogen forms 80% of our atmosphere and human beings could not live in 100% nitrogen either: CO2 is no more a pollutant than nitrogen is and CO2 is essential to life.\n \n 90) Politicians and climate activists make claims to rising sea levels but certain members in the IPCC chose an area to measure in Hong Kong that is subsiding. They used the record reading of 2.3 mm per year rise of sea level.\n \n 91) The accepted global average temperature statistics used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that no ground-based warming has occurred since 1998.\n \n 92) If one factors in non-greenhouse influences such as El Nino events and large volcanic eruptions, lower atmosphere satellite-based temperature measurements show little, if any, global warming since 1979, a period over which atmospheric CO2 has increased by 55 ppm (17 per cent).\n \n 93) US President Barack Obama pledged to cut emissions by 2050 to equal those of 1910 when there were 92 million Americans. In 2050, there will be 420 million Americans, so Obama's promise means that emissions per head will be approximately what they were in 1875. It simply will not happen.\n \n 94) The European Union has already agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent to 2020, compared with 1990 levels, and is willing to increase the target to 30 percent. However, these are unachievable and the EU has already massively failed with its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), as EU emissions actually rose by 0.8 percent from 2005 to 2006 and are known to be well above the Kyoto goal.\n \n 95) Australia has stated it wants to slash greenhouse emissions by up to 25 percent below 2000 levels by 2020, but the pledges were so unpopular that the country's Senate has voted against the carbon trading Bill, and the Opposition's Party leader has now been ousted by a climate change sceptic.\n \n 96) Canada plans to reduce emissions by 20 percent compared with 2006 levels by 2020, representing approximately a 3 percent cut from 1990 levels but it simultaneously defends its Alberta tar sands emissions and its record as one of the world's highest per-capita emissions setters.\n \n 97) India plans to reduce the ratio of emissions to production by 20-25 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2020, but all Government officials insist that since India has to grow for its development and poverty alleviation, it has to emit, because the economy is driven by carbon.\n \n 98) The Leipzig Declaration in 1996, was signed by 110 scientists who said: \"We - along with many of our fellow citizens - are apprehensive about the climate treaty conference scheduled for Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997\" and \"based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions.\"\n \n 99) A US Oregon Petition Project stated \"We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of CO2, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\"\n \n 100) A report by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change concluded \"We find no support for the IPCC's claim that climate observations during the twentieth century are either unprecedented or provide evidence of an anthropogenic effect on climate.\"\n The Global Warming Hoax\n \n The most obvious and important clue that this whole thing is a scam is that the IPCC, a UN based agency is promoting this false and fraudulent so called science.",

   "HERE are the 100 reasons, released in a dossier issued by the European Foundation, why climate change is natural and not man-made:\n\n Okay, let's look at the first few.\n \n \n1) There is \"no real scientific proof\" that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man's activity.\n\n Only in the same sense that science doesn't \"prove\" anything. Science doesn't prove that, when Archie lets go of the pen he's holding, the pen will fall toward the center of the earth. What science does is show that it is unreasonable to accept otherwise. Same with global warming: It is unreasonable not to accept that the climate is warming and that we are largely responsible for it.\n \n \n2) Man-made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history.\n\n 100% irrelevant, 100% misleadingly dishonest. We have data extending back hundreds of thousands of years for the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Total amount ever released doesn't matter; concentration does.\n \n \n3) Warmer periods of the Earth's history came around 800 years before rises in CO2 levels.\n\n This doesn't contradict the evidence that increases in CO2 levels (note that NOW they refer to levels, not totals) influence the temperature. (Some people argue that this is evidence that a feedback system exists and could pose severe problems for us. Personally, I have seen the reasoning behind this idea and I consider it sound in theory but would like to see experimental data.)\n \n \n4) After World War II, there was a huge surge in recorded CO2 emissions but global temperatures fell for four decades after 1940.\n\n Not buying it. Atmospheric CO2 levels actually slightly decreased right after WWII (and the temp -- which was already abnormally high -- stopped increasing).\n \n \n5) Throughout the Earth's history, temperatures have often been warmer than now and CO2 levels have often been higher - more than ten times as high.\n\n Simply false. We have no data suggesting that CO2 levels were ever higher than they are now, and our data go back 800,000 years.\n \n So we look at your first five and they all fail. It's not even close. Why should we bother with the rest?\n \n Pathetic. Parchie.",

FFS, Archie, you don't suck at this, you blow at this.\n \n \nThe relevant point is though that Coleman isn't the authority here, he has surrounded himself with many climate scientists and PHDs who I'm sure he is relying on for his science.\n\n So then you admit that Coleman isn't an authority. So I was right the whole time. Kind of funny that you get all huffy and teary-eyed because we're so... right.\n The secondary point that you've completely missed is that you can't tell the difference. Someone like Coleman can make bogus arguments -- regardless of whether he knows they're bogus -- and you accept them. This is the irony of symbiote's comment below. You are not a critical thinker. You are not a scientist. You do not understand the issues at hand. Stop pretending that your brain functions almost properly.\n \n \nHis credibility as an expert has no bearing on the fraud which global warming has been proven to be.\n\n You're right! But you can't use someone with no credibilty as an expert as the source of information to rebut the claims. Well, you can, but you don't realize how idiotic that is.\n \n \nWow there we have it, someone made a slipup in the introduction to his speech, therefore all his criticisms are invalid, this is the intellectual standard of those that consider themselves enlightened.\n\n No, he made two mistakes in under a minute. Mistakes of simple science. Ones that rightfully raise questions regarding his understanding of the facts at hand.\n \n \nPersonally, I blame public education for this intellectual laziness, where instead of bothering to think for yourself, you simply rely on the opinions of \"experts\",\n\n I agree that this is a problem, but I'd like to point out a couple of things.\n 1. Archie is guilty of this here, not me. I didn't have to go look up information about gas solubility; I knew the claim was wrong immediately because I understand the chemistry.\n 2. In many cases, this should be done. Archie pretends that he has the scientific understanding to label Coleman as an authority. He doesn't. Archie doesn't understand the first damn thing about science. However, he pretends that he understands enough. I don't know the first thing about the evolution of Middle English, but I don't pretend that I do and therefore defer to experts. That's how it should be done. A broad education is great, but the reason that armchair quarterbacks aren't on the field is the same reason that even well-educated people will rightfully get their information from experts.",

   "You are correct: I am surely not saying that. One of the things I'm saying is that someone who doesn't have a good background in a subject should seek information from people who are educated in and study that topic and that the information from those people should carry more weight than what can be found in internet blogs and cable news.\n \n \n And physics isn't alone in this respect. But scientists invite appropriately-trained scientists to give science lectures at conventions. They don't invite investigative reporters and they don't invite metallurgists to explain the latest in quantum chromodynamics.\n \n \n This was the standard line several years ago. It was even true, those several years ago. Now the science is becoming more clear-cut, and the skeptical scientists are declining in number rapidly.\n It should be noted that \"universal consensus\" is a red herring. As I already pointed out, there are nutbars that will believe anything from a flat earth to an expanding earth. A lack of \"universal consensus\" doesn't support the idea of lacking evidence, it supports the idea that a few people simply won't be convinced regardless of overwhelming evidence. (See creationists.)\n \n \n I agree. And political machines always act appropriately based on science and not politics, right? (See Galileo.)\n \n \n That's strange. I had to go a bit more out of my way than usual to learn about the incredible world of quantum physics. Is that more likely because we have some unanswered questions, or because we know plenty and that plenty isn't easily assimilable by the general public?\n Before you answer: Did I mention that I'm a teacher and that I'm required to teach just the very, very basics of quantum mechanics in my classes, so that I know how (even the upper echelon of) students react to the information?\n\n \n You seem to be hung up on comparing global warming with quatum physics.\n Quatum physics is a core science whereas the study of AGW is more akin to long term weather forecasts.\n Yes we all know that you are a teacher..how clever of you to study quatum physics..but this has nothing to do with AGW but give yourself a pat on the back anyway.\n Please dont suggest that the mass of data that has been collated by the IPCC cannot be wrongly interepreted( because it has been) and please dont suggest that it cannot be manipulated ( because it has been).\n There may well be AGW and disaster may be imminent, but the scare tactics that the government and IPCC are using are not effective in proving this.\n The patronising sneers eco worriers aim at sceptics do not help either.\n The fact is that no matter how many semi quatum physics trained teachers congratulate themselves in knowing the Eco truth..you need to persuade the rest of us...",

No, the only reason you're making this grandstanding demand for this issue is because there are political implications. Period.\n \n \n Yes, that's exactly what I said. Note the lack of the word ALL, which you accused me of using to misrepresent you.\n Even in your accusations of misrepresentation you misrepresent.\n \n \n And it has. The scientific community has drawn a conclusion. You pretend that something is amiss because you don't like the conclusion.\n \n \n The point being that they are convinced that there is a real and imminent threat. You are actually using the tired, old creationist PRATT equivalent of arguing that disagreement about technical details effectively undercut the conclusion as a whole. This is like arguing that because I can't predict exactly what your face will look like after it has acid thrown on it, there is no reason to think that having acid thrown on your face will have any effect. It's just plain stupid.\n \n \n YES!, within the scientific community. Criticism within the general public that lacks access to relevant information and usually lacks the training to understand that information anyway is virtually pointless.\n \n \n There is a fundamental uncertainty about matter-energy behavior in the universe (including prediction of said behavior) that can't be changed. But you don't pretend that this -- or its consequences -- need to be debated in public or that models that take this into account are unreliable.\n \n You are engaging in special pleading. It is as plain as day.\n\n \n I am not your buddy.\n If you do not wish to be called dishonest then dont be dishonest.\n Read the example again and stop puffing your little chest out with indignation.\n \n \n \n Thje scientific process does not work the same way for climate change and quatum theory.nowhere near, and to insist it does is just..moronic.\n Reading quatum theory for dummies( even if you have completed the book ,as you probably have..being a teacher and all) has not given you that insight. I did mention that the study of climate change was nearer to volcanology..maybe the scientific process is similar to that but not quantum theory.\n \n By the way typing slowly does not affect the rate that the reader understands your drivel..or was this an attempt at barbed humour?\n If it was you failed again\n \n Science doesnt give a rip about what the public thinks but governments do.\n Public opinion has a great deal of sway with western governments even if it has very little with puffed up little elitist chalk face workers.\n \n Please read these two sentences.\n Teachers are anally retentive.\n \n All teachers are anally retentive.\n \n Think about the difference between the meaning of the two sentences.\n Admit you were wrong.\n \n The scientific community has by no means reached a conclusion on AGW.\n For you to say they have makes a mockery of comparing the study of AGW and quantum theory.\n There is no concensus on the severity and time scale of the effect of AGW.\n \n Put the dunces cap back on",

   "So if I punch you in the nose, and your nose bleeds, but your nose has ever bled before my punch, my punch couldn't have caused your nosebleed.\n Seriously, JP, I already friggin' explained this. Try to keep up.\n\n \n I wasn't aware that your explanation was the only possibility. It must be difficult being omnipotent amongst mere fallable mortals, emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n\n As far as I know, it might, from an absolute standpoint. But this is like saying that punching you in the nose is fine because you already had a bleeding owie on your leg. I'm in favor of finding any and all ways to stop trashing our planet, that means I'm in favor of finding any and all ways to stop trashing our planet. If our not being reliant upon fossil fuels is a productive solution -- even if not complete -- then we ought to do it.\n The question is not whether CO2 emissions is the biggest factor. The question is what we can do about climate change. Hell, even if catastrophic warming of the earth was entirely natural, the idea that we should sit idly by and let the world go to hell is despicable. The idea that we should help it get there faster because we can't stop it is reprehensible. (Let it be noted that I do not subscribe to these views of completely natural and unavoidable warming; I'm simply making a point.)\n \n\n \n Interesting. Your position is that if GW is natural, you'd want to unnaturally cool the planet? So' you'd be in favor of pumping coal soot into the atmosphere to cool it? ;)\n \n\n I'm not sure I agree, but I like the sentiment. I'd rather just see a real push toward plausible solar energy technology, which is virtually 100% clean.\n \n\n \n Solar energy is currently a joke. Until production costs, including power consumption needed to make the solar panels, can be reduced to a fraction of their current cost and efficiencies increased tremendously, it will never be a viable source for electricity. As a means for heating water, it's already cost effective in some areas, such as Hawaii. \n \n\n 1. I'm not convinced that clean coal is all that clean. I'm yet to be convinced that sequestering it deep at sea is plausible either in transportation or in successful long-term trapping. I know that there's another hot idea for how to be cleaner with coal, but it's escaping me at the moment.\n 2. This also has spelled the doom of wind and solar power when politicians aren't crying foul about gasoline/oil prices. For any of you who haven't noticed, the pushes for electric vehicles, implementation of wind turbines to produce power, and research into improving solar power are directly correlated with outrage over fuel prices. I have a friend who keeps getting closer and closer to convincing me that having fuel prices rise to ridiculously high levels would be the best thing that could happen to our energy situation.\n\n \n Coal can be converted into clean diesel using Fisher-Trophe techniques. The advantage for the US is the fact that we could be fossil fuel self-sufficient for 250 years (based on current consumption levels) doing so.",

Your position is that if GW is natural, you'd want to unnaturally cool the planet?\n\n My position is that if climate change -- either anthropogenic or natural -- poses a drastic, credible threat to the current ecology of the planet, we ought to do something about minimizing it.

   "I posted a link about this. It's much denier ado about nothing. And I mean nothing.\n Here it is again. Care to respond to any of the points therein?\n\n \n Ah it has a rather pathetic attempt to address the \"trick\" to \"hide the decline\", by asserting that the word \"trick\" can sometimes refer to simply a nifty process. \n \n I agree, sometimes it can. Obviously. But in this case it didn't. We have gone over this at length earlier in the thread.\n \n I'll repost here for your benefit,\n \n \n \n \n Yeah, scientists do sometimes use the word \"trick\" to mean \"shortcut\", except in this case the \"trick\" was a way to \"hide the decline\" in temperature data being generated by the tree ring series - the very same tree ring series used to generate the historical temperature record.\n \n So this explanation is really good for shallow trolls like yourself who won't actually bother to read the original information, and instead rely entirely on the dumbass propaganda sites you read. You've outdone yourself once again.\n \n As I already explained, there are 4 possible reasons for the divergence of tree rings from temperature;\n \n 1) Tree rings are an unreliable predictor of temperature.\n -Specific tree species used to predict temperature were used because their correlation was best over a short period of time. This is more than likely to be a statistical artefact, within any random sample some things will by chance correlate better and worse over the short term.\n -This is almost certainly true, see the email record of arguments between climate scientists and botanists and tree specialists over the use of tree rings in this way. The experts on trees say that this correlation is not logical if you understand how trees function.\n \n 2) The non-tree temperature record for the past 30 years is unreliable due to\n -bad manual adjustments, some fraudulent (see NZ, probably in the CRU itself), others careless or mistaken\n -loss of temperature sensors globally, especially in the former USSR\n -urban heat island effect\n \n 3) Both of the above (more than likely to at least some degree\n \n 4) A mysterious force no one has any good explanation for, descended on the trees of the entire world in 1960, and permanently and for the first time in history, destroyed the once perfect relationship between tree rings and temperature.\n \n Hiding a data set that shows part of your underlying theory is wrong isn't a shortcut to anything except fraud. And tree rings are hardly \"irrelevant\", the historical temperature record they have generated underlies the climate models. If the tree rings are wrong, the models are wrong, and AGW is wrong. Trying to conceal the fact tree rings are poor proxies for temperature isn't a theoretically irrelevant shortcut, and you would have to be nuts to come to the conclusion that it is.",

Hadley CRU was also the organisation which - in contravention of all acceptable behaviour in the international scientific community - spent years withholding data from researchers it deemed unhelpful to its cause.

   "I apologise Jo if my memory was incorrect.\n \n My understanding of tree rings, if you want to get into the details of it, is that there is in fact a relationship between tree ring density and temperature.\n \n However\n \n a) The relationship between tree ring density and temperature is not linear. Each tree has an optimum temperature at which it will grow fastest, and deviation from this value results in less growth. This should be obviously true given even the most rudimentary understanding of life. Average temperature of 30 degrees might be better than 29 degrees, but average temperature of 40 degrees will almost certainly be worse than growth at 30 degrees. This explains why tree ring growth moves in the opposite direction of temperature at times. For example, during the last 50 years, which are relatively hot, at least some species show change in the opposite direction. I find this explanation of divergence to be plausible, and a more parsimonious conclusion than the vague hypothesis that \"something happened in 1961\" that ruined the previous linear relationship.\n \n This implies that sometimes tree rings relationship with temperature is positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes there is not any clear relationship at all. Unless this relationship is very well understood, which it is not, tree rings are not a reliable representation of temperature, at best variation in their growth will indicate nondirectional variation in climate. If you make the unfounded assumption of linear growth and neglect the actual properties of the tree you are using as a proxy, there is a very good chance you will come up with a reconstruction which is not only poor, but shows the opposite of what actually took place. (see Mann's trees vs. the last 50 years)\n \n b) The tree ring record preferred by the CRU was not selected randomly, but cherrypicked first to the level of species, and then handpicked by Michael Mann down to the level of the individual trees he wanted to include in his reconstruction. Mann has been challenged on handpicking specific trees to create a \"hockeystick\" graph with limited historic variability, his only response has been to challenge critics to come up with a better way of handpicking trees. Critics generally don't see handpicking trees at all to be appropriate (and why should it be?).\n \n c) There are also the confounding variables you mentioned. Changes in temperature may be associated at least with rise or decline in precipitation, and this secondary impact may be greater than the direct impact of temperature on tree growth.",

This is like saying that unicorns don't exist, but there's no reason someone can't have a unicorn.\n You're nuts....\n\n \n Now get your little brain in gear..and read it again. what I implied was...there is no reliable conclusion so far...but I would not rule it out..\n The 'so far' on the end was the give away.\n Ask a real teacher and they may tell youemoticon_xclown\n \n \n \nNo, you said that the issue should be debated in public. This is not how science works, nor is it a reliable way of determining what is true. As has been demonstrated in this thread, average people don't have the requisite knowledge to form a reliable conclusion....\n\n Its not just about 'science' is it'\n Its about the social and economic consequences of that science.\n If the climate change scientists are of the same calibre as you they would'nt be able to read a scientific paper let alone publish one\n \n \nWhen did I say that I'm a physics graduate? I didn't, because I'm not. Please pay attention....\n\n I did suspect your knowledge of science came from Quantum physics for dummies but I later thought that maybe you might know a little more than I suspected..thank you for confirming it was BS.\n \n \nI'm in a position to educate people who are uneducated about certain subjects.

You're entitled to your opinions, but why should I believe you over people who are qualified?\n \n \nIts not just about 'science' is it'\n\n Right; it's also about truth, which is why I mentioned truth in the very same sentence.

   "I have never expressed any of that twaddle nor have I tried or cared what YOU believe.\n\n You have expressed such, you're just unable to play connect-the-dots like an average three-year old. You insist that a conclusion cannot be drawn. People with a real education in the subject disagree with you. It's quite obvious that you don't care what anybody who isn't you believes, not even when you should.\n \n \nFalsifying data to suit computer models is all about truth, isnt it.\n\n Not at all, and this is being investigated, is it not?\n \n \nLet the science be presented to the public just as you present the science to your pupils and lets see what happens.\n\n We've been over this, slowpoke.

Probabilities appear to be a necessary part of the physics. So why is this a poor analogy? Hint: It's not a poor analogy.\n \n \nBuilding a motorway and building a dockyard are both huge civil engineering projects but knowing something about one does not make someone an authority on the other.\n\n I agree. But you've shown yourself to be an authority on... well, nothing. At all.\n \n \nI'm sure they dislike it when you have gone..you probably make them laugh\n\n I do! But they laugh with me, not at me.
