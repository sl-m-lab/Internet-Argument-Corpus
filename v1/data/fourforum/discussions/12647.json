   "Video: Brian Brown gives bad talking points\n \n Brian Brown (with National Organization for Marriage) was interviewed by MSNBC. The interviewer busted NOM for their citations in their latest ad.\n Evidently, NOM only gave PART of the quote from the experts they \"quoted\", and ALSO failed to admit that the experts NOM quoted SUPPORT gay marriage... emoticon_emb\n \n \n Shuster also nails NOM for trying to blur the line between a CHURCH performing CHURCH functions, which should be protected...\n \n ... and people trying to IGNORE the laws against discrimination just cause they have a religious reason and/or are a church BUSINESS doing PUBLIC business practices.\n \n \n Video at the above web-link showing the interview... emoticon_xagree",
