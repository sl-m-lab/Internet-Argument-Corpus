I'd probably prefer it in the formal open debate section as my schedule is not exactly conducive to the sort of time constraints of a regular formal debate.\n \n I'd argue for Young Earth Creationism.\n\n \n \n As a suggestion, how about you and your opponent set it up similar to the past formal debates done here - whatever word limits or time limits you want - only with no judges or moderator (just moderate yourselves) and when you're done, there could be a new thread with a poll, for readers to vote on who they believe won, (the poll should show the names of who voted which way) and could have their comments too. \n \n The recent presidential /vice presidential debates inspired this idea for me. It seems like it's always the same story, each side thinks their candidate \"won\".
