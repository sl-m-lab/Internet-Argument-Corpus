   "There will be a shortage of housing\n\n \n Take the population density of an average city and then calculate how many people we can really fit on this Earth before it is covered with the density of an average sized city. You will find the number is near 40 billion. We currently have 6 billion. We are not near a housing shortage.\n \n \nof food\n\n \n Surprisingly we are really not anywhere near a food shortage. China is able to produce enough food right now to feed the entire world and lets face it, they are a big mountain. How are they able to fit 20% of our worlds population in their lands and still able to feed the entire population of the world? The US doesn't produce enough food to feed ourselves because we really don't need to. We are able to get 'buy' without having to grow all our own food. However if we had to we could also grow enough food to feed ourselves as well as many others.\n \n \nof education\n\n \n When will we run out of this? We are actually increasing the average IQ of a person by 3 every 10 years and have been doing so consistantly since the industrial revolution.\n \n \nof healthcare\n\n \n Based on the state of affairs in the US I really cannot debate this one except for the fact that technology is doing wonders for us at this point and will probably continue to achieve amazing things long into the future.\n \n \nMost of the developing nations are in the middle of baby booms. And where are they going to go?\n\n \n Based on your interpretation they are all going to starve to death and die without housing, education, or healthcare. So basically this would solve the problem. This is actually pretty likely to happen as well. Disease, lack of shelter and food, as well as exhastion of resources will slow population growth in over populated and under developed areas. Currently the developed areas of the world are facing slowing population growths because of the way of life. Eventually even China and India will be fully developed and see this same sort of stabilization of population growth. The world will find a balance and is well on it's way of doing so. The biggest threat to this is actually our technology increasing our lifespans drastically as well as increasing our food supplies.\n \n \nWhat do we do about this? Do we let nature run its course, and let overpopulation cause disease, food shortage, and pollution kill us off? Or should we try to do something about it.\n \n There are only two ways to control population:\n Increase death rates\n Decrease Birth rates\n Somehow I think the first option will have little support, if any.\n We pass out free Birth Control options in other countries, but we refuse to do it here. How much freedom is too much? When is it harmful?\n Should the government even have any say in this?\n\n \n Population control will happen naturally because eventually a barrier will be hit that we cannot cross. Clearly we don't want to get to that point or life will be horrible as people struggle to survive. Fortunantly our developed nations are able to control their population growth because of how they function. Europe is a classic example of this. The developed nations have long since stopped the rapid population growth of the past well before hitting any natural barrier. The rest of the world will one day follow although I'm sure nature will continue to play a role as a population barrier in some countries for many decades to come.",

   "The world is going up before it's too full. Think about places like Hong Kong... \n \n Half the world's arable land hasn't been used...and what has been used isn't being farmed efficiently.\n\n \n As I had wrote in another thread that it is estimated that one hectare of productive land is lost every 7.67 seconds. And only 3% of the world's surface is arable at that. This is land that produces our food, provides us with firewood and construction lumber, purifies the atmosphere, maintains precipitation levels, and slows down erosion. There will come a point when our growth will outpace what we can produce. There is no use sticking your head in the sand and denying it. The rest of the world is not as well off as well are now. Imagine if the rest of the planet lived as we do now? We only have 5% of the world's population in North America and we use up 25% of its resources. \n \n Look at what China has been forced into doing with their one child policy. I fear that even with many of ther drastic measures that it may already be too long for China. Already they are getting what they call Villages of Shame where men are marrying their sisters and close female relatives because females are rare since everyone wants to have a son only. Now there are many birth defeats appearing because of this. They have the belief that everyone MUST marry and have children in order to be a complete person.\n \n Have you every read a SF noval by Robert Silverberg called \"The World Inside\"? It is set in a future where just about everyone lives in a mile high building each with a population of 1 million people and the chief pass time is having children, because things like abortion are illegal and there is nothing much else to do. When the building gets too crowded they just contrsuct a new one. When someone acts aberrant, in any way, they are sent down the chute to be \"recycled\".",

Forget space travel at the moment (take astronomy and you'll see why) and focus on reality.\n\n \n Um, no that actually isn't the case. Interesting fact; the entire world can fit in the Island of Bali with each person getting 10 square feet of space. Also, if we wanted to create one big city with everyone living in it, we could live in Florida. The world's population per family is 2.9 children- the lowest ever. The population has in fact been slowing down. In 1994 the population growth was 86 million. In 1996 it went down to 79 million- 7 million less. Of course the world will eventually not be able to hold the entire human population, but by then we'll be on the moon or on mars. \n \n \n There will be a shortage of housing, of food, of education, and of healthcare much sooner than we think. \n Most of the developing nations are in the middle of baby booms. And where are they going to go?\n\n \n Housing? No, as I just proved. Food? Hardly. We have so many new technological breakthroughs. We know how to create skyscraper greenhouses. We know all this stuff. Education? That's not a very effective argument. We can always educate everyone. The same goes with healthcare. Read this article:\n \n Too Many People? Not by a Long Shot\n \n by Steven W. Mosher\n Wall Street Journal\n February 10, 1997\n \n Confounding the doomsayers, world population growth is slowing dramatically. The U.S. Census Bureau recently reported that the globe's population grew by only 79.6 million in 1996. This is seven million fewer than the 86-plus million in 1994, the high-water mark of population growth. It is a round 20 million less than the 100 million figure population-control alarmists like Vice President Al Gore were tossing around until recently. \n \n The immediate reason for this decline, which has since been confirmed by the United Nations Population Divisions, is shrinking family size. The Census Bureau reports that the world's total fertility rate-the number of children born per woman during her lifetime-has declined to 2.9, its lowest level ever. In 1985 the world-wide total fertility rate was 4.2. In many countries, couples commonly stop at one of two children.\n There are now 79 countries-representing fully 40% of the world's population-with fertility rates below the level necessary to stave off long-tern population decline. The developed nations are in the worst straits. Already 15 of them, including Russia, Germany and Italy, each year fill more coffins than cradles. Virtually all the others will soon follow suit. Efforts by anxious governments to arrest this looming demographic disaster have proved largely futile. In Germany and Japan, for example, despite hefty financial rewards to women willing to welcome more children into the world, the maternity wards remain empty. \n \n But this \"birth dearth,\" as Ben Wattenberg has called it, has now spread well beyond the developed world. There are now 27 \"developing\" countries where women are averaging fewer than 2.2 children. These include such unlikely candidates as Sri Lanka and Thailand. The human face of this population implosion is melancholy-villages bereft of children, schools closed for lack of students-and the economic consequences are grim: Labor shortages cramp production, the housing market grows moribund, and this in turn creates a drag on real estate and other sectors of the economy. How much of Japan's continuing economic malaise can be directly traced to a lack of young people to power the economy? \n \n While the population of portions of Africa, Asia and Latin America will continue to grow for several more decades, the rest of the world will soon be in demographic free fall. The bottom line: Population will peak at seven billion or so in 2030, and then begin a long descent. (This is essentially the U.N. Population Division's Nov.13 \"low variant\" prediction, with African, Asian and Latin American total fertility rates adjusted to converge on those of present-day Europe, or 1.35 children per woman.)\n How have those in the population-control crowd taken all this \"good\" news? Their response has been curiously schizophrenic. On the one hand, they are quick to claim credit for progress made and ask for money \"to finish the job.\" But in the same breath, they hotly deny that they are principally interested in reducing human fertility at all, claiming they have other laudable goals in mind, such as reducing maternal and infant mortality, improving reproductive health care, \"investing in women,\" and the like. \n \n Anyone who has seen the checkered path of other countries' family-planning programs will find it hard to take either claim seriously. Something over two-thirds of the world's fertility decline can be accounted for by simple modernity, as women marry later, have greater educational opportunities and work outside the home. The only population-control programs that have enjoyed conspicuous success have relied on the more or less compulsory sterilization of large numbers of women. The most notorious example is China, where for a decade and a half the government has mandated the insertion of intrauterine devices after one child, sterilization after two children, and abortion for those pregnant without permission. \n \n But the use of force in family-planning programs is not limited to China. Doctors in Mexico's government hospitals are under orders to insert IUDs in women who have three or more children. This is often done immediately after childbirth, without the foreknowledge or consent of the women violated. \n \n Perhaps the practice in Peru, where women are offered 50 pounds of food in return for submitting to a tubal ligation, cannot properly be called coercive. Still, there is something despicable about offering food to poor, hungry Indian women in return for permission to mutilate their bodies. And the potential for direct coercion is ever present, given that Peruvian government doctors must meet a quota of six certified sterilizations a month or lose their jobs. \n \n So tainted with coercion is the whole nation of population control that many of its strongest advocates have quietly reinvented themselves, and are now posing as social reformers eager to help women. The whole process resembles the strange metamorphosis of Soviet communists into Russian social democrats after the U.S.S.R. collapsed. It deserves the same level of credence. \n \n But let us, for the sake of dialogue, take at face value all the fine words about improving health and saving lives of Third World women and children. Let us then agree to redirect the $385 million to be spent on population control programs this year into bona fide health-care programs run by bona fide health-care agencies (not family planning groups in disguise). Let us save the 2.1 million children each year who, according to UNICEF, are dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. Let us provide Vitamin A supplements to poor children, averting one to two million deaths each year. \n \n Humanity's long-term problem is not going to be too many children, but too few: too few children to fill the schools and universities, too few young people entering the work force, too few couples buying homes and second cars. In short, too few consumers and producers to drive the economy forward. The imploding markets of Europe and the economic sluggishness of Japan will spread soon enough to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Why spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on contraception and sterilization that will only bring that day closer? \n \n Anyway, check out pop.org for more information.",

Why would we actually do that?\n \n \nWrong again. It is like the fishery. Many believe that the fish will last forever because they were always there and will always be. God will provide. The Spanish have this attitude in regards to the fishing grounds on our east coast. Even our own fishermen don't believe the government. People are in denial when it comes to such things untill it is too late.\n\n \n At this point we can provide for ourselves.

Look at all of the famines in Africa and other third world nations. They never stop.\n\n \n Well no kidding we have for a long time yet we haven't managed to succeed at it. As I said this isn't a sign of our over populating the world but rather a result of how human societies work. At any level of population we will have people being under fed when there is more than enough food to feed them.

BTW, only around 45 million people in the world have AIDS/HIV out of 6 billion.\n\n \n Sex has a lot to do with it! Since AIDS agencies brought condoms to Christian nations in Africa, people are now thinking \"Oh, condoms will save us, it's okay to have sex\". However, the condoms they use aren't very safe, as are not any condoms. \n \n \n The USA is the fourth largest country in the world (290,342,554 people.). Russia is the 1st (144,526,278 people.), Canada is the 2nd (32,207,113 people.), and China is the 3rd (1,286,975,468 people.). Out of these four largest countries in the world only China has more people.\n\n \n What's your point?\n \n \n Try doing this in many other places in the world.\n\n \n Exactly. It can happen. The point isn't that's where the world will be 200 years from now, the point is that is how much space we have; plenty. \n \n \n Please, you're still using 70's technology for your space crafts.\n\n \n You're just basing your argument on an opinion that the space technology wont work. Let's say it does work. Argue. \n \n \n Dreamer. Reality tends to get in the way.\n\n \n Think about how far we've gone in the last hundred years. How about the last 200 years. We've gone a very long way. \n \n \n Actually such situations are the result of famines as well. Too many people fighting for too little.\n\n \n Sure, famines are an issue as well. But are all the starving nations with corrupt governments?\n \n \n You don't have a clue what it actually means to build such things.\n\n \n A lot. But again, we've gone a long way. A century before today, building skyscrapers was a ludicrous idea. Now, we have them. A century before today, building giant flying objects was a ludicrous idea. Now we have them. For Christ's sake, people barely had calculators in 1900!\n \n \n Maybe if you include India. Without India it is a much lower percentage.\n\n \n Maybe if I include India? It's definitive! Who cares if without India it's a lowr population! India is part of Asia too! \n \n \n Around 1 billion people in the world don't get enough to eat.\n\n \n Yes, most of these people are in impoverished nations where corrupt governments hog the food and waste it! \n \n \n You don't have a realistic view of the world, but this is not too surprising considering where you live.\n\n \n San Francisco?

You can't really rely on them as such. Knowing human nature there will be roadblocks. I would like to think that we'd have a good future, but from what I've seen and studied that won't be to likely. Already the USA is invading other countries in order to secure a supply of oil to stem off the rapidly approuching time when the oil will run out. Yes, it would be better if the USA did move to alternative energy sources as soon as possible, but there is no short term profits in it. They are really only paying lipservice to the problem now. Fuel cells are a good idea once they can find a cheap way to extract the hydrogen that is. As it is the first fuel cell cars will be hybreds burning the oil (hydrocarbons) to get the hydrogen they need.\n \n \n#4 we have established that population growth is actually slowing as we speak and many nations are worried that they will not even be able to get population growth anytime in the near future.\n\n \n This is mainly in the West.\n \n \nBasically we have established that our population level is far from any major threshold level. Food, housing, and education are well under control.\n\n \n Go to some of the 3rd world nations and see if this is true for all of them.",
