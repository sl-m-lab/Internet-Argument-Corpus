   "Why does it offer no predictive power?\n \n A good theory is able to predict outcomes. Evolution does this quite well in predicting where certain species will end up in the geological record. It also does this quite well working hand in hand with geology in predicting where oil, gas and coal deposits are based on where the species that turned into hydrocarbons historically lived. Evolution also does a bang up job in predicting which species of plants and animals produce similar proteins that can be used by man for all kinds of stuff based on common descent. Other good theories such as the theory of gravity predict how objects will react based on certain principles. Even parts of accounting theory can predict where accounting abuse will likely occur based on the circumstances. Hydrology predicts how water tables will react and replenish rates based on the type of rocks in the aquifers and water tables, rain fall and other circumstances so well that the Army Corp of Engineers has been using it to manage huge amounts of our country's water tables. Agency theory predicts how agents will react in the service of others based on the circumstances within the relationship and purpose. A good theory should predict future outcomes and events. \n \n So what does Literal Creationism as a theory predict if it predicts anything at all?",

Especially since you're making the same point I made regarding larni's claim.\n\n Ok, let's back up and take this a step at a time. You said:\n \nAnd regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.\n\n The 'chemical ingredients' that make nylon are Nitrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen, in a long polymer. I assumed you knew that, and that you were referring to those elements when you said 'chemical ingredients'. Arranged differently, those same ingredients can make oil, sugar, cellulose - oh, and strychnine and hydrogen cyanide, which are lethal :) \n \n Thus it's not a question of being able to metabolise the individual elemental chemical ingredients of a substance, but rather to metabolise the complex structures into which those chemicals are formed. You can't unlock your front door with any old lump of brass; you need one shaped to fit the lock. Similarly, none of the enzymes produced by the mutant bacterial strain's ancestors were the right shape to catalyse the breakdown of nylon: a new gene coding for a new protein was required.",

   "Here's what bothers me about the way you guys debate. And is also a reason why links are necessary for quotes which are posted. Here is what Larni posted as evidence. \n This discovery led geneticist Susuma Ohno to speculate that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a gene duplication event with a frame shift mutation.[2] Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved this way.\n\n She makes it sound pretty cut and dry with this quote.\n Scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients. \n\n Then Peeling posted the above quote as further evidence to support their claims. What both of them failed to post was the info directly in between their respective quotes which say's this...\n A series of recent studies by a team led by Seiji Negoro of the University of Hyogo, Japan, suggest that in fact no frameshift mutation was involved in the evolution of the 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase.[1] \n\n Which pretty much negates both of their claims. The link goes on to define its Role in creation-evolution controversy:\n Main article: Nylon-eating bacteria and creationism\n There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. This is seen as good example of evolution through mutation and natural selection.[5][6][7] As a result nylon-eating bacteria have been discussed, in articles and on websites, in the context of the creation-evolution controversy.\n Which is based on this quote from the wiki link which puts the whole so called evolutionary discovery into proper perspective:\n In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of Flavobacterium living in ponds containing waste water from a factory producing nylon that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate, \n\n Notice that the bacterium was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, it wasn't consuming nylon. This is another case of micro evolution where the natural Earth created a new organism to consume the man made waste which was dumped in the ponds containing waste water chemicals. It isn't macro evolution which evolved the bacteria into any type of higher life form at all. And that is the claimed result that evolution say's defines it. Jay Gould proposed the idea that every living cell could possibly be encoded with the ability to change into any other living thing. He believes that an external stimulus causes this jump.\n \n This is a bigger stretch than gradual evolution. Based on his idea, simple pond microbes would have the same DNA encoding as humans and science has proven that this is not the case. Primitive life forms have far less genetic material than more complex animals such as a mammal. Gould\u00eds leap of faith also does not account for varieties of different species. If environment is the trigger and we all have the same DNA, the jump should be to the same creature. Plus we can plainly observe that this reaction does not occur today. Moving from a warm weather climate to a cold weather climate doesn't trigger a different type of offspring.\n Nylon-eating bacteria - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n What is Micro and Macro-Evolution?",

   "Then Peeling posted the above quote as further evidence to support their claims. What both of them failed to post was the info directly in between their respective quotes which say's this...\n \n (it wasn't a frameshift mutation)\n \n Which pretty much negates both of their claims. \n\n Why on earth would you think that? If you follow the reference you see that the paper in question attributes it to substitution mutations instead. \n \nNotice that the bacterium was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, it wasn't consuming nylon.\n\n I know - so what? They're still man-made byproducts unknown in nature. The significance of the event is undiminished.\n \nThis is another case of micro evolution where the natural Earth created a new organism to consume the man made waste which was dumped in the ponds containing waste water chemicals. It isn't macro evolution which evolved the bacteria into any type of higher life form at all. And that is the claimed result that evolution say's defines it.\n\n It's really difficult to make headway when terms keep getting misused like this. Right off the bat your source defines macroevolution as \"the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species\" - which is wrong in every important respect. The kindest thing one can say about it is that it is spelled correctly. But more importantly it is subtly wrong, such that the profundity of its error can become obscured in the semantics of a debate. An inattentive evolutionist might even agree with it, not realising that what it means to you is not what he would interpret it to mean.\n \n Let's break it down: \"The addition of new traits.\" If that were a defining criterion for macroevolution, the nylon bug's ability to digest a novel food source would certainly qualify. But macroevolution doesn't necessarily entail the addition of new traits. A species of bird, for instance, may lose the power of flight in the course of macroevolution.\n \n But the really tricksy, subtle error is in the second part: \"a transition to a new species\". Sounds a lot like \"In evolutionary biology today, macroevolution is used to refer to any evolutionary change at or above the level of species\", doesn't it? Do you think they mean the same thing? I wouldn't blame you if you did, because that's what you're supposed to think. That way, when creationists claim macroevolution has never been observed, and biologists respond that it has been observed and has happened many times in the past, their evidence sounds inconclusive. In a sense you've been vaccinated against a belief in macroevolution.\n \n From the page I linked above (which is fairly heavy-going but interesting and extremely thorough), observe the following diagram:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution/microevolution.png\n Look where genetics are: right at the bottom. That's right: with the possible exception of asexual bacteria mutations do not produce new species. If (as I suspect) you're rather surprised to hear me say that, or think I'm confessing to a gaping hole in evolutionary theory, my point is proven: you've been wrongly led to believe evolution requires mutation events that do produce new species. It should be obvious that mutations can't produce new species: mutations happen to individual creatures, and what use is one of a new species? It has nobody to breed with. \n \n No: all mutation in sexually reproducing organisms is micro-evolution: the addition of new variants to the gene pool. And that can involve new traits - like lactose tolerance in adulthood, for example. That's a mutation in humans that spread once we domesticated cattle: before that adult lactose intolerance was the norm:our body's way of weaning us off our mother's milk.\n \n So how do new species emerge?\n \n Look further up the diagram, and you'll find migration/dispersal and independent evolution. That's where the action is: two reproductively isolated populations. Because their genes are no longer mixing, independent microevolution causes their genomes to drift apart. In time, the sum of those differences can prevent interfertility between the populations, at which point the process of speciation (which as you can appreciate might be a protracted affair) is fully complete. Horses and donkeys are on the cusp of such a split: these days when they are bred their offspring are almost always infertile, making it impossible for their respective gene pools to be reunited. The same applies to lions and tigers: they split long ago but still retain enough interfertility to produce sterile(?) offspring on occasion.\n \n That's why the creationist 'lateral/vertical' distinction between micro and macro evolution is fundamentally wrong. If you trace back the lineage of any creature on earth, you won't find a 'macroevolutionary event', because macroevolutionary events don't happen to individual creatures. The word applies at the population or species level. Can you see now why it's utterly misleading to describe macroevolution as 'a transition between species', with the implication that it is an organism which is making that transition?\n \n Go back to horses and donkeys again. When you breed them, you get a mule, which is like a horse in some respects and like a donkey in others. If I were to take you back in time and show you a world where there were no horses or donkeys but only something in-between, you'd readily accept that a couple of million years of microevolution could turn that in-between thing into either a donkey or a horse. All common descent says is that, thanks to reproductive isolation of populations, it turned into both. Is that really so hard to believe? No - which is why creationist sources only ever talk about a bacterium turning into a fish, or a fish turning into a mammal: huge, impossible single strides by individual creatures. I've never yet seen a creationist source bang on about how impossible it would be for donkeys and horses to have shared ancestry; have you?\n \n If you like, I can go through the rest of the page you linked. It might be a bit of a long haul, though, given the misunderstandings engendered by the first two lines :)",

   "Let's face it peeling, the only consistency which can be found in the theory of evolution is your ability to explain away all of the inconsistencies that define it. That is after all, what this so called science consists of in any category we look at. We will look at what is in reality, then what appears to be regarding the conflicting evidence, and then your explanation which attempts to tie the two opposing results together in a reasonable way. But none of it is absolutely provable, EVER. What you refuse to admit is that it requires more faith for you to believe as you do, than it takes for me to believe in Intelligent Design. And since nothing you offer is consistent or provable either, then ID seems far more rational than the wishful thinking you propose in evolution.\n \n For example, All this link on the classification and evolution of bats does is go back and forth between the inconsistencies while explaining nothing concrete about their alleged evolution. Bats were formerly grouped in the superorder Archonta along with the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the similarities between Megachiroptera and these mammals. However, genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria along with carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans.\n So both genus's which they appear to belong to physiologically, they don't belong to at all, genetically speaking. \n \n \nUnder this new proposed nomenclature, the suborder Pteropodiformes would be defined to include all extant bat families more closely related to the genus Pteropus than to the genus Vespertilio, while the suborder Vespertilioniformes would be defined to include all extant bat families more closely related to the genus Vespertilio than to the genus Pteropus.\n In the 1980s, it was hypothesized based on morphological evidence that Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from Microchiroptera. The so-called Flying primates theory proposed that when adaptations to flight are discounted in a cladistic analysis, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features that are not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats show a number of advanced characteristics linking these animals to primates. Although recent genetic studies support the monophyly of bats[10], debate persists about the relative merits of DNA versus morphological evidence in settling this controversy[citation needed].\n\n \n Here, it is suggested that Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from Microchiroptera. Yet they also claim that they both evolved from the same Monophyly, which is a term which refers to a taxon comprised of members derived from a common ancestor which includes all descendants. This paragraph may sound fine on its own at first glance, but if the evolved from a common ancestor in the same environment, not only what pressure caused them to split into two types of bats, but what provoked their need to fly? And how did they survive the time it took to develop the power to fly? and when held up to the claims above regarding their comparisons to either primates or sloths, it becomes obvious to me that they are grasping at straws in attempting to fill these gaps rather than actually explaining anything real, or any scientifically verified information. \n \n So like every other aspect of this pseudo science, I'm left with more questions than answers. None of it bears out in a consistent common sense way at all. \n \n Bat - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "Let's face it peeling, the only consistency which can be found in the theory of evolution is your ability to explain away all of the inconsistencies that define it.\n\n And... that's a bad thing?\n \n This is just a crazy idea, but maybe when you reach the point of using the fact you can't find anything wrong with a theory as evidence against it, that's a hint you might be on the wrong track? :)\n \n Seriously, though, I'd love to hear you address the points I raised in my last post. It's easy to scoff at the idea of bacteria turning into fish, or fish turning into mammals. I scoff at the idea. But what about a common ancestor of donkeys and horses? And zebra, donkeys and horses? Is that really so incredible, given that even today they remain borderline interfertile? That's all common descent requires you to accept.\n \n I urge you to keep the diagram I posted above in mind when reading creationist sources. If they start talking about mutations producing new species (and how that never happens), or organisms transitioning between species (and how that never happens), you know they aren't talking about evolution. They're painting a stupid picture for you to look at and say \"Huh, that's stupid. Evolutionists must be stupid to think that's true\".\n \nBut none of it is absolutely provable, EVER. What you refuse to admit is that it requires more faith for you to believe as you do, than it takes for me to believe in Intelligent Design.\n\n That's an awkward accusation to refute, akin to \"You're in denial!\" \"No I'm not!\" :) Am I really refusing to admit something that's true, or is it just not true?\n \n I do know that common descent requires an explanation. Pretending that common descent isn't a fact is, to me, a waste of time. Even Behe admits as much in both Darwin's Black Box and Edge of Evolution. That alone was enough to make it impossible for me to believe any of the extant creation myths - at which point I understood I really don't have to just pick something and believe it for the sake of having faith. I don't know how life got started on earth. I think there are some tantalising nuggets of evidence being brought to light concerning how it might have occurred, but I'm perfectly happy - not to live in ignorance exactly, but to live with ignorance until such time as it can be eliminated.\n \n Perhaps you feel one has to positively believe in one thing before one can safely eliminate another - I disagree. A dead body with no gunshot wounds certainly wasn't shot, even if you have no idea how death did occur. Thus I discount the various creation myths, because none of them describe life on earth arising and evolving through the forms it clearly did. \n \n So... does admitting ignorance require more faith than professing certainty in the face of a gale of evidence? I genuinely can't see that it does. \n \nFor example, All this link on the classification and evolution of bats does is go back and forth between the inconsistencies while explaining nothing concrete about their alleged evolution. \n\n Yes, cladistics has been given a real shake-up by the advent of genetics; it's a whole new data-stream. It's particularly useful because it's possible for quite similar morphological features to evolve in parallel - which can skew our inferences of how closely two taxa were related. However, it's very unlikely that the genetic basis of those morphological changes would also be the same unless they genuinely did occur in a common ancestor.\n \n Let's have a look at what the page has to say... ok, this is some fairly cutting-edge controversy you've decided to dive into :)\n \nHere, it is suggested that Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from Microchiroptera. Yet they also claim that they both evolved from the same Monophyly, which is a term which refers to a taxon comprised of members derived from a common ancestor which includes all descendants. \n\n No, that's not quite what's being said. It says that morphological analysis (which would obviously include their flight-related features) originally suggested monophyly between the mega- and microbats. Then some people pointed out that if you eliminated flight characteristics from the analysis (effectively assuming they evolved flight seperately), megabats suddenly looked markedly closer to the taxon that included primates than microbats did - and in turn that degree of seperation made the independent evolution of flight more plausible. Then genetic analysis comes along and suggests that no, mega and microbats are indeed monophylic - and now there's debate over the weight that should be assigned to genetic versus morphological analysis...\n \n In short, it's an area of active research :) And it's a good thing. You constantly accuse me and others of making unwarranted assumptions - well here's your answer. Scientists don't just build a pretty theory and then sit around admiring it: they build a pretty theory and then invite everyone in to kick the hell out of it to see if it falls down.\n \n I honestly think that having to live with that sort of uncertainty is what turns you off the whole idea of evolution and science in general. You look at all this squabbling with a kind of appalled horror, I'm sure: how dare scientists say you're wrong about creation when they can't seem to agree over the evolution of bats? It goes back to what I was saying before: while individual scientists may choose to believe this or that to be true in advance, and there have been many inspired guesses that have subsequently borne fruit, science also grinds forward via the elimination of what is not true; locating knowledge by establishing where it isn't. That's why the 'problems' with dating methods creationist sources like to complain about were not found by creationists, but by mainstream scientists kicking hell out of existing theories to make sure they were sound before they went and built a career on them.\n \n To indulge in some unforgivable armchair psychology for a moment, I think that if any gulf between us is insuperable, it is that acknowledging uncertainty and ignorance doesn't make me feel insecure or frightened. Right now, you enjoy being cast-iron certain - and because I can't offer that to you (in any form other than the knowledge that you used to be more wrong than you are now :) ), there's little in science to appeal to you.",

   " \n Let's face it peeling, the only consistency which can be found in the theory of evolution is your ability to explain away all of the inconsistencies that define it.\n\n \n \nAnd... that's a bad thing?\n\n \n Yes, that's a bad thing. In true science, results a repeatable and verifiable. That isn't the case with evolutionary theory. It is all assumptions which are based exclusively on matching what you find with the preconceived outcomes you are seeking to verify. This isn't a search for an objective truth where you allow the chips to fall where they may, and then fill those gaps with newly discovered facts as they are discovered.\n \n Evolutionary theory is based on what Darwin forwarded in the 19th century and every new discovery is interpreted based on making it fit into that preconceived result. Evidence that doesn't fit neatly or even worse, conflicts with the required result is either disregarded or buried altogether, and never considered again as relevant. I suppose you will ask for examples now. Here is a link of many, but let's look at the fruit fly due to its short life span.\n GENETIC EXPERIMENTS\n \n After breeding over one million fruit flies, they still obstinately remain fruit flies! There is a wide variety of dog BREEDS but they are still dogs. Species bred beyond limits develop serious deformities. Darwin bred pigeons and knew this fact but in his \"Origins of Species\" he glossed over what is an impassable barrier to the \"evolution\" of one species from another.\n \n 6. RECAPITULATION THEORY\n \n This is the theory that the development of a fertilised germ cell retraces the history of the species.(e.g. that gill 'slits' in the human embryo are relics of its fish ancestry). This theory, once hailed as the Biogenic LAW is now discredited even by evolutionists. However it is still implied in some books. Prof. Haeckel (a fiery supporter of Darwin) faked his drawings to support the theory but was convicted by a University court.\n \n 7. ORIGIN OF LIFE\n \n (A) Passing a spark through a mixture of gasses forms simple amino acids but -\n \n (B) they are only the very simplest of 'building blocks' used in the formation of larger organic molecules.\n \n (C) they must be caught in a cold trap to prevent the spark from destroying them\n \n (D) a reducing (non oxygen) atmosphere is necessary.\n \n (E) any amino acids forming would have been destroyed by the ultra-violet rays of the Sun. These conditions would not have occurred in nature.\n \n (F) Even allowing millions of years, there has still been insufficient time or material in the whole universe for very complex organic molecules to have formed BY CHANCE.\n \n 8. PEPPERED MOTH\n \n There are two varieties - the light and the dark. Elimination of the light variety is NOT evolution. They are still Peppered Moths. Kettlewell's experiments were specifically designed to get the results he wanted and were seriously flawed. Results contradicting his evolutionary views were ignored.\n \n 9. WHALES\n \n Evolutionists are unable to explain how the whale, which is a mammal, went back into the sea without leaving any fossil evidence of intermediate forms.\n \n 10. DUCK BILLED PLATYPUS\n \n This strange animal has:\n \n (A) a soft, sensitive \"bill\" and lays eggs like a duck\n \n (B) fur like an animal,\n \n (C) webbed and clawed feet,\n \n (D) pockets in its jaws to carry food,\n \n (E) a spur on rear legs which is poisonous like a snake's fang.\n \n A question for the evolutionist- what were its ancestors?\n \n 11. RADIOMETRIC DATING\n \n This method is used to give an age to rocks (and thereby the fossils they bear) but it rests upon several unprovable assumptions, e.g.\n \n (A) Radioactive conditions are the same today as they were millions of years ago.\n \n (B) The 'half life' of the elements is constant.\n \n (C) No products of the radioactive decay were originally present nor have been added since the formation of the rock.\n \n These are all very large suppositions that cannot be easily checked in the field for every sample.\n \n When the same stratum is tested by different methods or even by the same method, it frequently gives an enormous range of ages. For example, one rock gave 14, 30, 95 and 750 million years by different methods. In another case, dating of the same rock for Leakey's 1470 'Man' gave 220 million years and 2.6 million years using the Potassium-Argon method. It is sometimes said that, despite discrepancies, radiometric dating shows that rocks are millions of years old, not thousands. One answer is that the 'daughter' elements found in some rocks are naturally occurring along with many other elements. To infer vast ages from the ratios of the elements found in rocks is unwarranted. The only reason why the results of Radiometric Dating tests are quoted is that they give ages in terms of millions of years. Other methods giving only thousands are completely ignored.\n \n All these long ages are greatly reduced due to the speed of light being VERY much higher in the past. - SEE THE SECTION ON THE DECREASE OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT ON PAGE 3 - EVIDENCE FOR GENESIS]evolution\n \n \nBut what about a common ancestor of donkeys and horses? And zebra, donkeys and horses? Is that really so incredible, given that even today they remain borderline interfertile? That's all common descent requires you to accept.\n\n \n Sure, from the same link of unprovable assumptions. It say's it much better than I could.\n THE HORSE 'SERIES'\n \n When challenged to produce a series of fossils demonstrating the transition of one species into another, the 4-3-1 toe evolution of the horse is frequently presented as evidence. However,\n \n (A) Over twenty different geneological 'trees' have been drawn up by various scientists. This is because there are 250 similar looking animals to chose from. Those which contradict the series are ignored.\n \n (B) All the known species of birds and mammals appear and 'diversify' within the last 150 Million years according to the evolutionists geological time scale. At this rate, the 70 million years it has taken simply to modify a horse's hoof is far too large a proportion of the time since mammals first appeared. There is therefore something seriously wrong with the time scale.\n \n (C) Some animals used in the sequence have differing numbers of ribs and lumbar vertebrae, indicating that various species have been used to compile the series, but this is ignored as this contradicts the theory. Most of these fossil animals have been found in America. Yet the first fossils of modern horses they are supposed to lead up to are found in Europe. (Present American horses are a recent introduction). Two evolutionists - Prof. George Gaylord Simpson said \"It never happened in nature\" and Charles Deperet called it \"a deceitful illusion\"\n \nIn short, it's an area of active research :) And it's a good thing. You constantly accuse me and others of making unwarranted assumptions - well here's your answer. Scientists don't just build a pretty theory and then sit around admiring it: they build a pretty theory and then invite everyone in to kick the hell out of it to see if it falls down.\n\n \n Really? That's what your community is all about? Then why haven't I ever seen you believers in evolution debating the merits of this very questionable evidence between yourselves? Every single debate is between we who questions its validity and you guys who defend it to the death. You not only never question its validity as a science, but you never question any discovery which is reported on in any way at all. You accept all info without question and hail it as a great leap forward, as you simultaneously disregard that which contradicts your preconceived notions as unimportant and irrelevant. \n And your cohorts can't defend it without personally insulting our intelligence because we refuse to buy into it until our questions are answered. But they never get answered really; we get answers like you're giving where you admit you don't have all the answers but that's a good thing cuz your mind is open to the next session of spoon feeding the talking heads offer you.\n \n You aren't an objective observer of this science at all peeling, you are told what to think and you promote it with faithfulness and fervor. \n \n \nTo indulge in some unforgivable armchair psychology for a moment, I think that if any gulf between us is insuperable, it is that acknowledging uncertainty and ignorance doesn't make me feel insecure or frightened. Right now, you enjoy being cast-iron certain - and because I can't offer that to you (in any form other than the knowledge that you used to be more wrong than you are now :) ), there's little in science to appeal to you.\n\n \n I object to your claim that there is little in science to appeal to me, as I love, respect and value the advancements in science which have taken place in my life time. I marvel and appreciate the advancements in medical, communications, electronics technology, transportation, entertainment, Space Travel. archeology, chemistry, marine biology and even the advancements in military science. Although I wish we lived in a world where that was unnecessary. \n \n And your assumption that it is I who is wrong regarding my world view is arrogant since your theory is far from being confirmed in any way. You rely on more faith in evolution than I do in my faith in my living and very personal God. And the reason for that is that your faith is placed in the men who make these fallacious and imaginary claims which you feel so smart in blindly accepting. My faith resides in the eternal maker of all that is and will ever be. And His Holy Spirit indwells me so I have first hand assurance of the truth which he represents.\n \n And there are many aspects of the creation story which we creationists can't explain here and now, so there is plenty of uncertainty and ignorance regarding timing and exact details. But my faith is far more well placed than yours because unlike your pseudo scientific religion of evolution, my God is real and truly does exist.",

Pay attention will you?\n \n \nYou have to be joking. There's no way you typed \"whale evolution\" into Google and missed the #2 return: Evolution of cetaceans - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n You're right; I didn't type anything in at all. I just asked Huntard to prove his claim. But in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence.\n \n The third problem, \"as Zimmer acknowledges\", is that there aren't very many early whale fossils. Does that surprise you? Evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. But there isn't really that much \"hard\" evidence. Whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best.\n Since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. At first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. So, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas.\n The first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher Phil Gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in Pakistan. Although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of Mesonychids and the Archaeocetes.\n ...\n \n Despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, Pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. In living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. Modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a \"fat pad\", which allows them to hear directionally underwater. Pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. These anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the Pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited.\n \n Although no post-cranial bones of Pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. ...\n \n The earliest known cetacean, Pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial Mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the Mesonychid carnivores. Although we have not found any post-cranial bones from Pakicetus yet, ... 5\n \n Consider what this evolutionist has just told us. First, they haven't found any post-cranial bones of Pakicetus. [Since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] Post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. So, all they have found is a skull. They don't have a single Pakicetus rib. They don't have any Pakicetus vertebrae. No other bones of any kind. Just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. Why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? Because its teeth look like whale teeth.\n \n But when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. The skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. Yet it \"demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial Mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the Mesonychid carnivores.\"\n In A Whale of Trouble\n \n So the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion.

   "Yes, that's a bad thing. In true science, results a repeatable and verifiable. That isn't the case with evolutionary theory. It is all assumptions which are based exclusively on matching what you find with the preconceived outcomes you are seeking to verify. This isn't a search for an objective truth where you allow the chips to fall where they may, and then fill those gaps with newly discovered facts as they are discovered.\n\n I really don't think that's fair comment, and here's why:\n \n First of all, you're misusing the term 'repeatable and verifiable'. That requirement applies to the methods applied and results achieved during an investigation, not to the event being scrutinised. In other words, scientists are not obliged to repeat the evolution of the whale in order for a study of its evolution to be scientific, any more than they are obliged to instigate another Chernobyl meltdown to conduct a scientific study of its aftereffects. They are obliged to detail their methods of study such that an independent team could replicate their results.\n \n Secondly, the 'search for objective truth' in the sense you describe it is merely a cataloguing of facts. In order to actually learn something one must attempt to construct a model to explain those facts, and then test that model by extrapolating and testing predictions. When you do that with the special creation model, nothing fits. The pattern of fossils predicted by special creation in no way resembles that we observe - but tallies perfectly with a common descent model. Vestigial and atavistic traits have no place in the special creation model, but are precisely what we expect from common descent, and so on.\n \n \nEvolutionary theory is based on what Darwin forwarded in the 19th century and every new discovery is interpreted based on making it fit into that preconceived result.\n\n Hardly. If that were the case we would not have models of genetic drift or punctuated equilibrium. That said, in broad terms Darwin got it right. We don't throw away theories that have proved themselves over and over and over.\n \n You're criticising science, yet you're coming at this from a preconceived and unshakeable standpoint that Darwin must have been wrong. Thus you are obliged to believe that the blossoming of theories derived from his work is undeserved. You won't countenance the idea that it has survived on merit.\n \nEvidence that doesn't fit neatly or even worse, conflicts with the required result is either disregarded or buried altogether, and never considered again as relevant. I suppose you will ask for examples now.\n\n That would be nice, yes. Unfortunately, while looking for them you didn't take my advice and didn't keep in mind the micro/macro evolution diagram.\n \n Take dogs, for instance. All that selective breeding, and they're still dogs, right? Now look at the diagram, and think: what are we doing when we selectively breed dogs? Answer: we are exploring combinations of existing canine genetic material. Have we kept breeds seperate long enough for independent mutations to accumulate in their lineages and render them mutually infertile? No. So are dogs evidence against evolution? No.\n \n6. RECAPITULATION THEORY\n \n This is the theory that the development of a fertilised germ cell retraces the history of the species.(e.g. that gill 'slits' in the human embryo are relics of its fish ancestry). This theory, once hailed as the Biogenic LAW is now discredited even by evolutionists.\n\n You have no idea how much it upsets me to see creationist websites feeding you this stuff. It's so clearly, calculatedly disingenuous, so cleverly worded so as to skirt the truth while giving an utterly wrong impression.\n \n Yes, recapitulation theory has been discredited: organisms do not precisely recapitulate their evolutionary development during gestation. But your source's implication, that the discrediting of recapitulation theory means gill slits in human embryos are not relics of fish ancestry, is completely false. Gill slits, the tail that first forms and is then usually reabsorbed - these atavisms are direct evidence of evolution patching and reworking our developmental process over the aeons. The only thing that has been discredited is the notion that foetal development recapitulates, in order, every such change.\n \n The origin of life is, as I've pointed out on numerous occasions, irrelevant to the fact of common descent, so let's move straight onto:\n \n8. PEPPERED MOTH\n \n There are two varieties - the light and the dark. Elimination of the light variety is NOT evolution. They are still Peppered Moths. Kettlewell's experiments were specifically designed to get the results he wanted and were seriously flawed. Results contradicting his evolutionary views were ignored.\n\n On the contrary: elimination of the light variety is evolution: a change in allele frequency in a population. What were these 'contradictory results?' Your source does not say. How were Kettlewell's experiments 'designed to get the results he wanted'? Your source does not say. Perhaps it refers to the fact he released the moths in daylight, potentially exacerbating the selective influence of their camouflage - if so, so what? He released all the moths in all the locations in daylight, and predation did have the predicted effect. Moreover, his results have subsequently been vindicated by experiments which took criticisms of his methods into account.\n \n9. WHALES\n \n Evolutionists are unable to explain how the whale, which is a mammal, went back into the sea without leaving any fossil evidence of intermediate forms.\n\n On the contrary, what we're unable to explain is why creationists think they can get away with continuing to make this same false claim. \n \n10. DUCK BILLED PLATYPUS\n \n A question for the evolutionist- what were its ancestors?\n\n That's an easy one. The same as all mammals: reptiles. Unlike other mammals, the platypus's ancestors did not lose quite so many reptillian features.\n \n And of course, our perennial favourite topic:\n \n11. RADIOMETRIC DATING\n \n This method is used to give an age to rocks (and thereby the fossils they bear) but it rests upon several unprovable assumptions, e.g.\n \n (A) Radioactive conditions are the same today as they were millions of years ago.\n\n On the contrary, that fact is eminently provable. Quantum mechanics shows that radioactive decay rates are tied to fundamental constants, and if those constants changed different isotopes would be affected differently. The fact that dating methods based upon different isotopes agree proves that no such change has occurred.\n \n(B) The 'half life' of the elements is constant.\n\n As above.\n \n(C) No products of the radioactive decay were originally present nor have been added since the formation of the rock.\n\n Only applicable for some dating methods, and situations in which this requirement may have been violated can be readily identified.\n \nWhen the same stratum is tested by different methods or even by the same method, it frequently gives an enormous range of ages. For example, one rock gave 14, 30, 95 and 750 million years by different methods.\n\n Again, your source provides no link or further information, so it's impossible for me to find out what they're talking about. \n \n(addressing the question of common ancestry for donkeys, horses and zebra) Sure, from the same link of unprovable assumptions. It say's it much better than I could.\n\n Except your source does not address the question I asked, which was: is it so incredible to believe that horses, donkeys and zebra share a common ancestor?\n \n But ok, let's deal with what your source does have to say.\n \n[INDENT][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]THE HORSE 'SERIES'\n \n When challenged to produce a series of fossils demonstrating the transition of one species into another, the 4-3-1 toe evolution of the horse is frequently presented as evidence. However,\n \n (A) Over twenty different geneological 'trees' have been drawn up by various scientists. This is because there are 250 similar looking animals to chose from. Those which contradict the series are ignored.\n\n Again, a claim that evidence is being ignored, without any details or anything to back it up. What evidence is being ignored?\n \n Once again, your source behaves dishonestly. Those 'twenty different geneological trees' by 'various scientists' - are they all current? Or are many of them from decades ago, prior to evidence coming to light which required their revision? Aren't you in the slightest bit perturbed by the fact your sources have to keep misinforming you?\n \n(B) All the known species of birds and mammals appear and 'diversify' within the last 150 Million years according to the evolutionists geological time scale. At this rate, the 70 million years it has taken simply to modify a horse's hoof is far too large a proportion of the time since mammals first appeared. There is therefore something seriously wrong with the time scale.\n\n Says who? That's what the evidence says happened, straight out of the ground. Exactly what do they think it contradicts? This is a completely meaningless criticism.\n \n(C) Some animals used in the sequence have differing numbers of ribs and lumbar vertebrae, indicating that various species have been used to compile the series, but this is ignored as this contradicts the theory.\n\n Wrong again. Remember from our long discussion? How fossils are hardly ever likely to represent direct ancestors, but rather cousins of those ancestors?\n \nReally? That's what your community is all about? Then why haven't I ever seen you believers in evolution debating the merits of this very questionable evidence between yourselves?\n\n Well, first of all because we're not active in those very specific fields, and we don't have access to the data in question. Secondly, you're continuing to confuse ambiguity in the details with the very clear and unambiguous evidence for common descent in general. There is no doubt whatsover that common descent has occured. Do we know - can we know for sure - the precise sequence of speciation that has occurred in the past? No. The data simply isn't complete enough in most cases, and scientists may disagree over the precise details of the 'best fit' model covering that data. Does that mean special creation is in with a shout? No: it doesn't fit the data at all.\n \nYou aren't an objective observer of this science at all peeling, you are told what to think and you promote it with faithfulness and fervor. \n\n I totally understand why you feel the need to believe that. After all, if that's what I'm doing it must be ok for you to be doing it too, right?\n \nI object to your claim that there is little in science to appeal to me, as I love, respect and value the advancements in science which have taken place in my life time. I marvel and appreciate the advancements in medical, communications, electronics technology, transportation, entertainment, Space Travel. archeology, chemistry, marine biology and even the advancements in military science. Although I wish we lived in a world where that was unnecessary. \n\n Yes, I thought I was being a little hasty there. Upon reflection I decided that it's the prospect of exchanging certainty for uncertainty, rather than uncertainty itself, which offends your sensibilities. You marvel and appreciate the advancements in other fields of science because you haven't already made up your mind that such advancements can't happen.\n \nAnd your assumption that it is I who is wrong regarding my world view is arrogant since your theory is far from being confirmed in any way.\n\n You keep saying that, but it doesn't get any more true :) This isn't about worldviews, it's about theories of natural history and whether they work in terms of bringing our expectations into line with reality. All worldviews can do is influence whether or not you're pleased about which theories work and which don't.\n \nAnd there are many aspects of the creation story which we creationists can't explain here and now, so there is plenty of uncertainty and ignorance regarding timing and exact details. But my faith is far more well placed than yours because unlike your pseudo scientific religion of evolution, my God is real and truly does exist.\n\n Well, that's good - for a moment there I thought you had put your faith in something you didn't think really and truly existed :) Not that the existence of god has any implications for common descent, any more than it has implications for what I had for breakfast: it still happened.\n \n The point I've been trying to make for some time now, with both you and with Marc, actually, is that there is a higher standard of proof than just really really wanting something to be true. You can't fly, no matter how much you believe you can, because the universe disagrees with what you think will happen when you flap your arms. Similarly, you can believe in the biblical flood and special creation as much as you like, but the universe disagrees with what that belief leads you to expect when you dig in the ground.\n \n Of course, the universe has often disagreed with what scientific theories of natural history led us to expect, too. The difference is that as a consequence of those controversies scientific theories have been modified such that our expectations are better met in future. That hasn't happened with creationism, which is, if you like, still flapping its arms and making endless excuses for why nothing's happening.",

Moreover, such a comment is completely irrelevant to the process of evolution and demonstrates that you know little about the topic.\n \nMere elimination is not evolution...\nSure it is.

That has been verified several times since Kettlewell did his work in the 1950s. In fact, J.W. Tutt (1896) and J.B.S. Haldane (early 20th century) both reached the obvious conclusion that the agent of change in the peppered moths was natural selection well before Kettlewell's experiments. Kettlewell's work was actually an effort to verify J.W. Tutt's hypothesis. The work was later verified by Michael Majerus and reported in his book on melanism (1998) and again in a paper in 2005, and 2007.\n \n It is particularly indicative of pure balderdash that your \"internal mechanism\" that is responsible for the change in color of the moths is unspecified. That is particularly odd since all five of the color alleles in the British peppered moth have been sequenced. The genetics is quite well understood.",

   "that's what I'm claiming is not entirely clear. As I said before an internal mechanism that gets activated during development could have resulted in the populational shift of colors. Moths and butterlies are known to exhibit plastic abilities.\n\n Very true - I believe we've discussed that in the past. Which is why it was important to test the theory that natural selection was responsible for (or at least contributed significantly to) the populational shift. The experiment measured predation of mature specimens and confirmed that the camouflage helped: a greater number of camouflaged moths survived, and thus had a chance to contribute their genes to the next generation, than those whose pigmentation caused them to be conspicuous to predators.\n \n When you consider it like that, is there really anything to disagree with? What's the point of camouflage if it doesn't help? And if it helps, it will inevitably result in population evolution, yes? Because that's what 'helping' means: increased chance of survival and/or reproduction, which means a better chance of contributing genes to the next generation, which means a bigger share of the next generation will possess your genes. There's no escaping it: natural selection works.\n \n That's why NS is considered a fundamental component of evolution: even if all else fails, even if you don't have fancy-pants phenotypic plasticity to help you out, even if all you have to help your species survive is undirected variation, NS will work. Because it can't not work. \n \n Nobody's denying the existence of responsive mechanisms like phenotypic plasticity. But it begs the question: how did the organism get that clever mechanism? How did it evolve? How did the species manage without it? Fundamental evolutionary principles like undirected variation and natural selection provide that answer.",

Thus, the theory cannot be validated by the mere elimination (or reduction) of a pre-existing trait.\nIt most certainly is balderdash. Evolution is not random genetic change accompanied by natural selection. The reason is simple. Evolution is, by definition, genetic change. It is a change in the genetic makeup of populations of organisms over generations. Stated more formally, evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in populations of organisms over time. Do you need for me to define some of those words for you? I'll assume so. An allele is one of two or more alternate formes of a gene. The change in the frequency of alleles means that the relative proportions of those alleles in that population change over time. A population is a contiguous group of interbreeding organisms. And by time is meant over generations.\n \n Hopefully you now understand why it is balderdash to claim that evolution \"takes\" random genetic change accompanied by natural selection. Whether or not the change is random depends on the mechanism of that change. While natural selection is one of those mechanisms, it is not random. Thus, evolution by means of natural selection is not random. On the other hand, evolution by genetic drift is random\n \n Of course, neither was the theory of evolution designed to explain how populations got built up over time. The theories of evolution explain why populations change. The theories, being just explanations of the causes of evolution, do not validate it. I'm not even sure what it means to \"validate\" a scientific theory.\n \n However, the elimination of a genetic characteristic from a population is, by definition, evolution. It doesn't matter why the characteristic disappeared, it is still evolution. There are many examples of the elimination in founder populations by genetic drift. Why this genetic change is random, natural selection is not a factor.\n \n Hopefully the ideas are clearer for you now.",

Of course I do not know enough about lizard anatomy to make that claim for sure. :)\n \n Since there are already related lizards that makes use of this particular muscle I don't believe we need to wait for the genome to be unravelled.\n\n \n Not quite.. the cecal valve was a MODIFICATION to a pre-existing gene. Sometimes, a gene will be duplicated , where you have an inactive copy and an active copy, then the gene that provides new function is a modification of the inactive copy. \n \n The Cecal valve was not already in place. This particular lizard is the only one in it's entire genus that developed a cecal valve. It does not 'grow with use'. It developed over succeeding generations.. where the ones which had even a little bit of muscle there had a slight advantage over those that did not. It is 'decent with modification' , where the very slight modification gave a slight reproductive advantage over the ones that did not have the modification. That is how new traits arise. \n \n If this particular varation of the lizard was kept isolated from the main group for several thousand years, it is predicted that there will be further changes in it's genome to make it unable to reproduce with the 'parent' species. There might be behavioral changes that make them unable to mate. There might be other changes that eventually would make their offspring infertile.\n \n Look at what happens with tiger and lions. They can mate and produce offspring. However, the male of their offspring (the tigons and ligers) are infertile. The females can sometimes be fertile,and you could feasible get a reproductive variation that is half tiger and half lion if you bread it back and forth over a period of time. If lions and tigers do not become extinct through man's intervention, sooner or later they would not be able to produce any fertile offspring. T\n \n New genes and new variations of genes happen through a number of mechanisms. Duplication of a gene , recombination , damage from the environment are several ways variations in genes (allees) can form. Most are\n neutral, some are damaging (even fatal), and some give a small advantage.\n \n Some of the neutral ones will give a little advantage when the environment changes... better resistance to heat or cold, better able to handle drought, etc etc etc. The ability to handle dry conditions don't give much of an advantage in a very very wet environment, until the environment drys out.. (it might not hurt though).\n \n That's how evolution works. Small advantages over successive generations (or perhaps neutral changes that chance introduces aren't eliminated).",
