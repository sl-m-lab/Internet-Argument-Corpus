   "What a strange coincidence.\n \n In the same recent issues of Science, there are little essays about evolution all over the place and this one was in a special issue about Einstein. Einstein didn't like QM so much, but this was in there all the same.\n \n http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/307/5711/871\n \n \nThe Quantum Measurement Problem\n A. J. Leggett\n \n Despite the spectacular success of quantum mechanics (QM) over the last 80 years in explaining phenomena observed at the atomic and subatomic level, the conceptual status of the theory is still a topic of lively controversy. Most of the discussion centers around two famous paradoxes (or, as some would have it, pseudoparadoxes) associated, respectively, with the names of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) and with Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. In this Viewpoint, I will concentrate on the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat or, as it is often known (to my mind somewhat misleadingly), the quantum measurement paradox.\n \n Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.\n \n Basically, the quantum measurement paradox is that most interpretations of QM at the microscopic level do not allow definite outcomes to be realized, whereas at the level of our human consciousness it seems a matter of direct experience that such outcomes occur (indeed, it seems so difficult to imagine what it would be like for the world to be otherwise that I suspect that Immanuel Kant, had he had occasion to consider the problem, would have classified our knowledge of this state of affairs as \"synthetic a priori\").\n \n It is convenient to classify reactions to this problem into three broad classes, defined by the following three different views on the status of QM: (a) QM is the complete truth about the physical world, at all levels, and describes an external reality. (b) QM is the complete truth (in the sense that it will always give reliable predictions concerning the nature of experiments) but describes no external reality. (c) QM is not the complete truth about the world; at some level between that of the atom and that of human consciousness, other non-quantum mechanical principles intervene.\n \n I briefly discuss each of these possibilities in turn [for a more extended discussion, see (1)]. Let's start with option (a). Consider the following two questions:\n \n 1. In a typical situation involving an ensemble of microscopic entities (such as a Young's slits experiment with, for example, electrons or neutrons) in which the QM description of the ensemble is by a superposition of amplitudes corresponding to alternative microscopic possibilities A and B (e.g., \"went through slit 1\" and \"went through slit 2\"), is it the case that each individual member of the ensemble either definitely realizes alternative A or definitely realizes alternative B?\n 2. In a (thought) experiment of the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat type involving an ensemble of macroscopic objects (e.g., cats) for which the formal QM description of the ensemble of relevant \"universes\" is by a superposition of amplitudes corresponding to macroscopically distinct alternative states A and B (e.g., \"cat alive\" and \"cat dead\"), is it the case that each member (cat) of the ensemble either definitely realizes alternative A or definitely realizes alternative B (in the absence of inspection by a human agent)?\n \n I believe that a large majority of the portion of the physics community that advocates option (a) would answer \"no\" to the first question and \"yes\" to the second (2).\n \n The usual argument given in favor of these answers involves the phenomenon of decoherence: As a result of the latter phenomenon, it is impossible to see any effects of interference between (for example) the living and dead states of the cat, and it is argued that \"therefore\" one state or the other has been definitely realized, irrespective of whether we have or have not observed the particular cat in question.\n \n As I have argued at greater length elsewhere, I believe this argument embodies a gross logical fallacy: It confuses the question of truth with the question of evidence. At the microscopic level, the adherents of view (a) felt (mostly) obliged to reject a realistic interpretation; the evidence they would cite against it is the well-known phenomenon of interference between possibilities A and B. By the time we get to the macroscopic level, the evidence has gone away, but the QM formalism is in no way changed; thus, its interpretation cannot have changed either.\n \n To complete my argument at this point, it would be necessary to discuss also those interpretations of QM (such as the Bohmde Broglie \"hidden-variables\" interpretation) that answer \"yes\" to both the above questions, and those (such as the Everett-Wheeler \"many-universes\" interpretation) that answer \"no\" to both. Because space is limited, I will just state my own view that both these interpretations amount to little more than verbal window dressing of the basic paradox, and thus that no interpretation of class (a) is viable (3).\n \n I next turn more briefly to option (b). According to the adherents of this view, the whole formalism of QM amounts to nothing but a calculational recipe, designed in the last resort to predict the probabilities of various directly observed macroscopic outcomes (\"this particular cat is dead/alive\"), and the symbols occurring in it, such as the probability amplitudes, correspond to nothing in the \"real world.\" The extreme operationalism implied in this view is often softened by the observation that under many conditions relevant to human existence, the experimental predictions of QM are \"as if\" the world had behaved classically; this argument is made most explicit in the \"consistent-histories\" (or \"decoherent-histories\") interpretation. However, that observation does not get around the fact that these conditions are not invariably fulfilled; in particular, it does not exclude a priori the possibility that we may some day be able not merely to generate quantum superpositions like that of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, but to observe the corresponding interference effects. Personally, if I could be sure that we will forever regard QM as the whole truth about the physical world, I think I should grit my teeth and plump for option (b).\n \n Finally, what of option (c)? Indeed, there have been a number of concrete proposals to modify standard QM at some level intermediate between that of the atom and that of human consciousness, the currently best-developed one being probably that associated with the names of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber, and Pearle. All of these proposals have in common the feature that at a sufficiently \"macroscopic\" level (the precise threshold depends on the specific proposal), the superpositions predicted by the formal extrapolation of the QM formalism do not occur; rather, some non-QM mechanism intervenes and guarantees the realization of a definite macroscopic outcome for each particular member of the ensemble in question. In principle, once the threshold for such realization is specified, it would be possible to test such theories unambiguously by comparing their predictions with those of standard QM; however, for the test to be definitive it is obviously necessary that QM continues to predict interference effects, i.e., that decoherence (which of course is a concept only meaningful within the QM formalism) has not washed them out. If one can indeed detect the characteristic QM interference effects at a given level of \"macroscopicness,\" then it is a reasonable inference [though not in itself a logically watertight one (1)] that no such mechanism of \"realization\" has come into play by that level.\n \n Even a decade ago, considerable skepticism existed about the prospect of ever observing quantum superpositions involving more than a few \"elementary\" particles. However, in the last 5 years progress in this direction has been spectacular, ranging from traditional Young's slits experiments conducted with C70 molecules (~1300 \"elementary\" particles) to SQUID experiments in which the two superposed states involved ~1010 electrons behaving differently (1). Thus, the experiments are beginning to impose nontrivial constraints on hypotheses of class (c). If in the future these constraints grow tighter and tighter, we may find that at the end of the day we have no alternative but to live with option (b).\n \n \n References and Notes\n \n 1. A. J.
