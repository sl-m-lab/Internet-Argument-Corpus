   "Allegations of corruption permeate Gaston Glock's empire. His former business associate, Charles Marie Joseph Ewert, now resides in a prison in Luxembourg, having been convicted in 2003 of contracting to have Glock killed. The murder plot-thwarted when the victim, then 70, fought off a hammer-wielding hit man-led to a trial that revealed a network of shell companies linked to Gaston Glock. That corporate web is now under scrutiny by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, according to lawyers familiar with the probe. Attorneys for Glock have acknowledged the misuse of company funds. But they blame most of the wrongdoing on Ewert, a money man known in the European press as \"Panama Charly.\" \n \n Among the Glock-related material the IRS allegedly is examining: boxes of invoices and memos provided by the company's former senior executive in the U.S., Paul F. Jannuzzo. Once one of the most prominent gun industry executives in America, Jannuzzo said in a federal complaint he filed last year that Gaston Glock used his companies' complicated structure to conceal profits from American tax authorities. \"[Glock] has organized an elaborate scheme to both skim money from gross sales and to launder those funds through various foreign entities,\" Jannuzzo alleged in the sealed May 12, 2008, IRS filing, which BusinessWeek has reviewed. \"The skim is approximately $20.00 per firearm sold,\" according to the complaint. Glock's U.S. unit, which generates the bulk of the company's sales, has sold about 5 million pistols since the late 1980s, Jannuzzo estimates in an interview. \n \n no surprise that an industry run by criminals keeps the black market well stocked with guns while being cheered by the gun lobby",

Alleged isn't the same thing as hard and provable evidence. So this is nothing more than supposition, theory, hearsay, musings, etc.\n \n Come back when you've got some hard evidence!",
