   "Albert Einstein found secondary education INTOLERABLE. He was expelled for his REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE but he found his niche and went on to get a good education.\n \n So the question is: have or are we EXPELLING the next Einstein without trying to help him or her find their niche? Are we MORE concerned with forcing square pegs in round holes than finding a ways to accommodate children with different wants, needs and ideas about education? Why do we bend over backwards to accommodate different adults but NOT allow are children to be different? It's a MISTAKE a prosperous nation CAN'T afford to make, IF it wants to continue being a prosperous nation. We CAN'T stay on top by burying your head in the sand. You've got to have people with NEW IDEAS. \n \n If we DON'T encourage our children to be different and help them find their niche and then mentor their interests the country is NOT going to be a leader much longer. I'm NOT saying I approve of what's happening in our schools. I'm saying WE have a PROBLEM that ISN'T going to go away if we DON'T find the cause and then solve that problem. FIGHTING SYMTOMS isn't the answer.\n \n Based on Einstein's story (see above), and the success of the Nazi school system (they had BEST scientists), I'd say we could learn from their school system. Maybe their educational system was the secret to Germany's success before the end of World War II. Remember, it was their scientists that made the Russian and American space programs the success they turned out to be. In case you DIDN'T know it Einstein was born in Germany and educated at the Federal Institute of Technology (FIT) in Zurich, Switzerland (was Switzerland really neutral?).\n \n If this country DOESN'T continue to move FORWARD, it will lose its ability to be competitive in the global market because everyone else will be passing us by. Thus by trying to stay where we are, we are actually move backwards because we'll be letting the rest of the world lead us instead of us leading them. We'll be buying technology and expertise from other countries (like after World War II when we hired German experts) rather than developing the expertise in our country.",

   "LATER NOTE:\n \n It makes me wonder, if the Germans sent all their BRIGHT students to Switzerland for their education. I believe it makes sense. Everyone else's children are being sent off to war. If their BIRGHT kids lived at home, people might start trouble with their families. And the Germans KNEW the future of their country depended on what kind of an education their future generation gets. \n \n They couldn't educate their children in Germany without exposing them to the war and the unhappy neighbors that had already lost their children in the war. So why not send them out of the country for their education.\n \n It makes me wonder if Germany helped staff schools outside the country. I heard they rounded up a lot of professors and such. Why not see if they would work for the Nazi party in another country training Germans before they sent them to death camps.\n \n The Germans weren't stupid. They moved their money to Switzerland to protect it. Their future scientists would have been worth more than money. So why wouldn't we think they'd find a way to protect them and get them the BEST education possible without the distractions of the war.",

I believe in setting rules but being flexible, only when its reasonable. If I am at my wit end I am thinking to send my children into troubled teenagers camps to help them discipline their self.",

   "Kids today are not be allowed to be creative. They look to the internet for instruction. They don't go out side and play and invent games, build forts in vacant lots and play hide in seek. We allow others to foster their ideas on our kids and them blame them for out mistake. We are busy golfing or working or shopping that we put our kids in front of the TV rather than invest our time in them. When things go wrong we blame the teacher. Take the time to talk to a teacher and she what were constraints are and her pay scale then take a look at the guy at the top and all the middle managers that do virtually nothing to help these kids.
