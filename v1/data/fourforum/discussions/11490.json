   "Thanks for posting this. I've been meaning to write an essay that names a lot of the mythical creatures \"good\" Christians should believe in, either because of a mention in the Bible, or through church tradition.\n \n I hope I'm not derailing your thread, but it would be great if contributors continue to add to your list. That way we could have a resource where these fantastical entities are all in one place for easy access.\n \n My essay's topic, by the way, was meant to make the theistic reader think of all the crazy creatures that populate Christianity, and perhaps give said believer pause. How effective that tack would be...who knows. The point being that once the mind accepts the leap to one supernatural being, it's quite easy to add to it. Over the centuries, it's quite an impressive, laughable list I suspect.\n \n My contribution of kooky monsters are the Incubi and Succubi, mentioned in the Bible. These devious entities are male and female angels which were made by God to cause all kinds of sexual mischief with us mortals. The Incubi--male--are particularly attracted to women's hair, and so the tradition began of women wearing hats in church in order to fend off these little horndogs. At least that is the story that has been passed down through the ages.\n \n Hope to see more additions! Thanks again.",

Remember that the Bible was translated into English long before the word \"dinosaur\" was coined. However, the word \"dragon\" appears 21 times in the Old Testament alone. \"You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet\" (Psalm 91:13). From the context it is clearly speaking about a real creature that it would be impressive and intimidating to step on! Jeremiah 51:34 tells, \"he has swallowed me up like a dragon...\" which brings to mind the way many carnivorous reptiles swallow their prey whole. Both dragons of the sea (Psalm 74:13) and field (Isaiah 43:20) are mentioned. Indeed, Genesis 1:21 can best be translated: \"And God created great sea monsters...\" One such sea monster became sufficiently well-known to the ancients to be given the special name \"Rahab\" (Isaiah 51:9). The prophet Ezekiel likens Pharaoh to a sea monster that invaded the Nile river and stirred up the mud (32:2). The Hebrew word, \"Tannin,\" is from the root meaning \"to extend.\" The language conjures up an image of a long-necked plesiosaur-like creature paddling up the river and stirring up mud from the Nile delta with its flippers. Just such a creature is depicted by the ancient Egyptians who may have netted one just as Ezekiel describes in verse 3. See the plesiosaur-like hieroglyphic (to the left) currently displayed in the London Museum. \n \n Job is the oldest book in the Bible. This book is very interesting from a scientific perspective because of the many natural phenomena that are addressed by God, Job, and his friends. Along the way, God points Job to two special creatures. The first, mentioned in Job 40:15, is usually translated \"behemoth\" in the English Bible. Some commentators have suggested that behemoth was a hippo or elephant. But the passage makes clear that this herbivorous animal was \"chief of the ways of God.\" Certainly the hippo and elephant (which had other Hebrew names) don't qualify as the biggest land animal, nor does their anatomy fit the clear language of verse 17. A cedar tree brings to mind a dinosaur's huge tail! In fact, pygmy peoples in equatorial Africa tell stories of a ferocious dinosaurian creature that occupies their swamps and rivers and lashes its opponents with its tail. It becomes fascinating, as one considers the tail as an offensive weapon, to review the description of Satan as a dragon: \"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon ...And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:\" (Revelation 12:3-4).\n \n Job 41 portrays yet another awe-inspiring creature: Leviathan. While clearly one of the fiercest creatures that God made, it is difficult to establish exactly what Leviathan was. The Bible describes a sharp-toothed, scaled creature whose habitat is the mire and deep waters. Ken Ham suggests the ferocious kronosaur as a candidate. Others have suggested that this fire-breathing monster was a land-dweller that merely spent much of its time in the water. Perhaps leviathan was a dinosaur with armor or claws whose \"sharp stones\" were employed to destroy ancient weapons. Maybe we have yet to discover the remains of a leviathan!\n \n The \"unicorn,\" mentioned nine times in the KJV Bible, is the Hebrew word \"Re-em.\" The Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated it \"Monokeros\" (one-horn) which was used in Bibles until the 19th century when Akkadian and Ugaritic records were found that mentioned the \"Re-em\" being hunted like a wild ox. However, their early pictograph for the \"Re-em\" shows an animal head with three horns, like a Triceratops. In Psalm 92:10 the \"Re-em\" has but one horn, while the language or Deuteronomy 33:17 implies two horns. Although most commentators and modern versions translate it as a bull or rhino, some have theorized that \"Re-em\" might be a Monoclonious (single horned dinosaur like Triceratops). In Job 39:9-12 God asks, \"Will the unicorn be willing to serve you, or abide by your crib? Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you? Wilt you trust him, because his strength is great?\" This passage shows that the unicorn, whatever it was, could not be tamed to be used in farming, as could an ox. In his classic work Naturalis Historia the first century author Pliny the Elder described \"an exceedingly wild beast called the Monoceros [one-horned]. ...It makes a deep lowing noise, and one black horn two cubits long projects from the middle of its forehead.\" He describes it as like an elephant in length, but with much shorter legs. Other classical authors like Aelian, Oppian, and Martial also mention a \"nose-horn\" creature (a \"Rinokeros\"). Some claim that the \"Rinokeros\" sharpens his horn on a rock and utilizes it in fighting elephants. This is the root word from which we get the modern name rhinoceros. But a rhino does not stab with its horn, which is actually composed of keratin (hair). The correlation between the classical authors and some modern cryptozoological reports is striking. Dr. Roy Mackal's explorations in the Congo brought back reports of a rare, single-horned animal called \"Emela-ntouka\" or \"killer of elephants.\" In a recent expedition, pygmies in Cameroon identified the horned creature (there called \"Ngoubou\") with a Ceratopsian dinosaur and claimed it could sport from one to four horns. Indeed, modern researchers believe that the ceratopsian dinosaurs likely did use their great horn for combat (Dodson, Peter, The Horned Dinosaurs:A Natural History, 1996, p.123.) \n \n In the Authorized version of scripture we find Isaiah twice mentioning the \"fiery flying serpent.\" Egypt is called the place of the \"lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent,\" (30:6). This fits with classical authors describing pterosaur populations in Egypt and Arabia. Goertzen notes: \"The Hebrew word, m'opheph Jpvfm, is a polal participle; a form used only by Isaiah when describing the reptilian saraph. The polal indicates an intensive of the root pvf ooph that means to fly or flutter. The imperfect form of the polal is found in Genesis 1:20, 'flying creatures that flutter to and fro' and Isaiah 6:2 'seraphim' (the same word as the reptiles here used for angelic creatures) that fly to and fro.'\" (Goertzen, John, \"The Bible and Pterosaurs,\" 1998.) This same word is employed in Numbers 21:6 to describe the poisonous reptiles that bit the murmuring Israelites. Indeed it is easier to envision an attack of nimble flying snakes (pterosaurs) killing many of the children of Israel rather than them being surprised and killed by snakes on the ground. The pterosaur becoming a type of Christ (John 3:14) seems more appropriate than the snake, which from Genesis to Revelation is a symbol of Satan. In addition, the spread wings on the top of the pole would form a cross.

It show you're at least attempting to be honest here.\n Too bad we can't get any of that from yourself. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n\n \n I repeat: When it is said ( Isa 13:21; Isa 34:14) \"the satyrs shall dance there,\" the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste. Some render the Hebrew word \"baboon,\" a species of which is found in Babylonia. To this day, nobody inhabits the land that was Babylon.\n \n And I reiterate - How does \"satyrs/baboons\" dancing equal a \"desolate waste\"? Where is your support for this claim?\n \n \n\n Why must I always ask for the supporting verses for proper context in order to refute your raping of the bible?\n Perhaps if you studied your bible more thoroughly and actually read what it said rather than spending your time here ranting about gays and atheists, you wouldn't have to ask.\n \n As to my \"raping of the bible\", Why would I spend time \"raping\" something when it does so well sticking itself in the @$$ without my help?\n \n Since you are apparently expecting verses (although you really didn't ask), here you go.\n \n Tyre: Ezekiel 26:3-24 (emphasis added by me):\n \n Therefore thus says Yahweh God: \"Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. It shall be a place for spreading nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,\" says Yahweh God; \"it shall become plunder for the nations. Also her daughter villages which are in the fields shall be slain by the sword. Then they shall know that I am Yahweh.\" \n \n For thus says Yahweh God: \"Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and an army with many people. He will slay with the sword your daughter villages in the fields; he will heap a siege mound against you, build a wall against you, and raise a defense against you. \n \n He will direct his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, the wagons, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached. With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. \n \n They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will lay your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water. I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more. I will make you like the top of a rock; you shall be a place for spreading nets, you shall never be rebuilt, for I Yahweh have spoken\"\n \n Too bad it never ended up happening. And hey, look Tyre is STILL around and inhabited! Or at least it was July 21st 2006 when that image was posted (I see no reason for it to have vanished in the past two years, do you?)\n \n Egypt: Check out Ezekiel 29. Old Zeke gives a prophecy that King Neb will conquer Egypt and that \"Egypt will become a desolate wasteland\" and \"No foot of man or animal will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years.\"\n \n Too bad that didn't happen either.\n \n \n \n \n\n Not when your side is making the mocking accusations that it's all a lie I don't. You're calling the bible wrong so prove it with evidence. So I repeat:\n \n Regarding Dragons, Leviathans, Unicorns and Dinosaurs/Behemoths as described in the bible, can you prove they never existed in a pre-flood world? Or even in the post-flood world until they were hunted to extinction? Go ahead and prove they were definitely mythical creatures, and then explain why artwork from those periods were found of allegedly extinct or mythical creatures? How did people from different lands who never had contact with each other draw pictures of creatures we accept as either mythical or once living if they were extinct for 60 million years already, in a pre archeology time when excavating bones and reassembling fossils would be considered a sacrilege\n DINOSAURS IN THE BIBLE\n There are a number of places where it appears that dinosaurs or other similar creatures are mentioned in the scriptures. Remember that the Bible was translated into English long before the word \"dinosaur\" was coined. However, the word \"dragon\" appears 21 times in the Old Testament alone. \"You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet\" (Psalm 91:13). From the context it is clearly speaking about a real creature that it would be impressive and intimidating to step on! Jeremiah 51:34 tells, \"he has swallowed me up like a dragon...\" which brings to mind the way many carnivorous reptiles swallow their prey whole. Both dragons of the sea (Psalm 74:13) and field (Isaiah 43:20) are mentioned. Indeed, Genesis 1:21 can best be translated: \"And God created great sea monsters...\" One such sea monster became sufficiently well-known to the ancients to be given the special name \"Rahab\" (Isaiah 51:9). The prophet Ezekiel likens Pharaoh to a sea monster that invaded the Nile river and stirred up the mud (32:2). The Hebrew word, \"Tannin,\" is from the root meaning \"to extend.\" The language conjures up an image of a long-necked plesiosaur-like creature paddling up the river and stirring up mud from the Nile delta with its flippers. Just such a creature is depicted by the ancient Egyptians who may have netted one just as Ezekiel describes in verse 3. See the plesiosaur-like hieroglyphic (to the left) currently displayed in the London Museum. \n \n Job is the oldest book in the Bible. This book is very interesting from a scientific perspective because of the many natural phenomena that are addressed by God, Job, and his friends. Along the way, God points Job to two special creatures. The first, mentioned in Job 40:15, is usually translated \"behemoth\" in the English Bible. Some commentators have suggested that behemoth was a hippo or elephant. But the passage makes clear that this herbivorous animal was \"chief of the ways of God.\" Certainly the hippo and elephant (which had other Hebrew names) don't qualify as the biggest land animal, nor does their anatomy fit the clear language of verse 17. A cedar tree brings to mind a dinosaur's huge tail! In fact, pygmy peoples in equatorial Africa tell stories of a ferocious dinosaurian creature that occupies their swamps and rivers and lashes its opponents with its tail. It becomes fascinating, as one considers the tail as an offensive weapon, to review the description of Satan as a dragon: \"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon ...And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:\" (Revelation 12:3-4).\n \n Job 41 portrays yet another awe-inspiring creature: Leviathan. While clearly one of the fiercest creatures that God made, it is difficult to establish exactly what Leviathan was. The Bible describes a sharp-toothed, scaled creature whose habitat is the mire and deep waters. Ken Ham suggests the ferocious kronosaur as a candidate. Others have suggested that this fire-breathing monster was a land-dweller that merely spent much of its time in the water. Perhaps leviathan was a dinosaur with armor or claws whose \"sharp stones\" were employed to destroy ancient weapons. Maybe we have yet to discover the remains of a leviathan!\n \n The \"unicorn,\" mentioned nine times in the KJV Bible, is the Hebrew word \"Re-em.\" The Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated it \"Monokeros\" (one-horn) which was used in Bibles until the 19th century when Akkadian and Ugaritic records were found that mentioned the \"Re-em\" being hunted like a wild ox. However, their early pictograph for the \"Re-em\" shows an animal head with three horns, like a Triceratops. In Psalm 92:10 the \"Re-em\" has but one horn, while the language or Deuteronomy 33:17 implies two horns. Although most commentators and modern versions translate it as a bull or rhino, some have theorized that \"Re-em\" might be a Monoclonious (single horned dinosaur like Triceratops). In Job 39:9-12 God asks, \"Will the unicorn be willing to serve you, or abide by your crib? Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you? Wilt you trust him, because his strength is great?\" This passage shows that the unicorn, whatever it was, could not be tamed to be used in farming, as could an ox. In his classic work Naturalis Historia the first century author Pliny the Elder described \"an exceedingly wild beast called the Monoceros [one-horned]. ...It makes a deep lowing noise, and one black horn two cubits long projects from the middle of its forehead.\" He describes it as like an elephant in length, but with much shorter legs. Other classical authors like Aelian, Oppian, and Martial also mention a \"nose-horn\" creature (a \"Rinokeros\"). Some claim that the \"Rinokeros\" sharpens his horn on a rock and utilizes it in fighting elephants. This is the root word from which we get the modern name rhinoceros. But a rhino does not stab with its horn, which is actually composed of keratin (hair). The correlation between the classical authors and some modern cryptozoological reports is striking. Dr. Roy Mackal's explorations in the Congo brought back reports of a rare, single-horned animal called \"Emela-ntouka\" or \"killer of elephants.\" In a recent expedition, pygmies in Cameroon identified the horned creature (there called \"Ngoubou\") with a Ceratopsian dinosaur and claimed it could sport from one to four horns. Indeed, modern researchers believe that the ceratopsian dinosaurs likely did use their great horn for combat (Dodson, Peter, The Horned Dinosaurs:A Natural History, 1996, p.123.) \n \n In the Authorized version of scripture we find Isaiah twice mentioning the \"fiery flying serpent.\" Egypt is called the place of the \"lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent,\" (30:6). This fits with classical authors describing pterosaur populations in Egypt and Arabia. Goertzen notes: \"The Hebrew word, m'opheph Jpvfm, is a polal participle; a form used only by Isaiah when describing the reptilian saraph. The polal indicates an intensive of the root pvf ooph that means to fly or flutter. The imperfect form of the polal is found in Genesis 1:20, 'flying creatures that flutter to and fro' and Isaiah 6:2 'seraphim' (the same word as the reptiles here used for angelic creatures) that fly to and fro.'\" (Goertzen, John, \"The Bible and Pterosaurs,\" 1998.) This same word is employed in Numbers 21:6 to describe the poisonous reptiles that bit the murmuring Israelites. Indeed it is easier to envision an attack of nimble flying snakes (pterosaurs) killing many of the children of Israel rather than them being surprised and killed by snakes on the ground. The pterosaur becoming a type of Christ (John 3:14) seems more appropriate than the snake, which from Genesis to Revelation is a symbol of Satan. In addition, the spread wings on the top of the pole would form a cross. In fact, a plate found with Sennacherib's booty at Calah (from the conquest of Palestine) depicts such a winged serpent on a pole that would seems to match the Nehushtan or brazen saraph of Moses that had become a symbol of worship by Hezekiah's reign (II Kings 18:4). The \"fiery\" flying snake even matches some cryptozoological reports from New Guinea, which attribute to alleged living pterosaurs a bioluminescent capability like a firefly. \n \n While some of this remains merely speculation, it becomes clear that some very fascinating animals have become extinct since Biblical times. But some might object to using arguments from the Bible, claiming that it is not a reliable resource. There are several lines of evidence that the Bible is God's Word. Skeptics respond that there are supposed to be a great many contradictions in the Bible. Again the facts come down on the side of God's Word being consistent, entirely without error in the original, and remarkably preserved.http://www.genesispark.org/genpark/bible/bible.htm\n \n http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml\n\n [/quote]\n Runing out of time, I'll get to the rest of this bunk sometime later (especially your Re'em (couldn't possibly be a rhino, now could it?)).\n \n As far as your Behemoth of Job goes, it i quite clearly describing a powerful animal with a very large penis. Could be a hippo, could be an elephant.\n \n \n Job's \"tail like a cedar\" is interesting because \"tail\" is a euphemism for \"penis\". In other words, he's describing a beast with a big Dong. \n \n Now, if that wasn't enough, he also tells us that: \"the sinews of his stones are wrapped together\", right after he makes the penis comment. I don't know about you guys, but that sounds like a set of testicles to me. \n \n Besides those, we have even more overwhelming proof beforehand. Job says: \"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.\"\n Certainly sounds lke he's calling the Behemoth to be quite the stud.\n \n Some believe he is describing a Hippo, which he very may well be, but I personally think he's describing an elephant - ever seen an elephant penis? If not, go google it and look at the youtube video of the amorous elephant walking away. From what I've heard they can get up to six feet long. Quite the cedar when compared to the measly size of humans.",

   "Again Oreo, the problem isn't with the prophecies, it's with your spiritual understanding. Actually read the complete chapters in question and apply actual history to them. And did you notice that the photo you submitted of Tyre from google map shows a barren piece of land?

For the most part conservative scholars have \n dealt with this problem by positing two stages of fulfillment sepa-\n \n ULRICH: Dissonant Prophecy in Ezekiel 26 and 29 123\n \n rated by several centuries. The first stage involved Nebuchadnezzar's \n partially successful siege. The second stage involved Alexander's \n conquest of the insular fortress in 332 BC. Besides an argument based \n on the actual course of history, conservative scholars have defended \n this solution on textual and hermeneutical grounds.\n According to Robert D. Culver and Gleason L. Archer, Nebuchadne-\n zzar did not fulfill Ezek 26:4 or 26:12, which predicted the sweeping \n of Tyre's rubble into the sea. Alexander's army cleared the rubble when \n it constructed a causeway from the mainland to the insular fortress. \n Archer also suggested that the pronominal switch in 26:12 from sin-\n gular to plural referred to the ethnically diverse Greek army.3 Norman \n Geisler and Thomas Howe added that the switch in 26:12 was signaled \n by the reference to many nations in 26:3.4 They seemed to have over-\n looked the possibility that Nebuchadnezzar's army could also have \n been ethnically diverse.\n Going a step further, Charles Lee Feinberg thought that Tyre was \n destroyed by a succession of invasions that began with Nebuchad-\n nezzar and ended with the Saracens in the fourteenth century AD. \n Ezek 26:12 refers to the sieges after Nebuchadnezzar's. Moreover, \n Feinberg reduced Tyre's descent into Sheol to the disappearance of \n Tyre's glory and fame. He took literally the description of Tyre's sub-\n mergence into the surging sea (26:19) and claimed that this has \"par-\n tially occurred.\"5\n J. Barton Payne offered the most thorough hermeneutical expla-\n nation for the two-stage theory. Ezekiel's Tyrian prophecies are an \n example of prophetic telescoping, which occurs in \"progressive pre-\n dictions that exhibit chronological gaps in their fulfillment.\"6 Behind \n this theory is the assumption that prophecy must be read on a histor-\n ical as well as transcendent level. Because of divine inspiration, the \n prophets often spoke more than they realized.7 According to Payne, \n Ezek 26:1-4a and 26:6-11 were fulfilled by Nebuchadnezzar, but \n 26:4b-5 and 26:12-21 were fulfilled by Alexander.8\n http://www.ibr-bbr.org/IBRBulletin/BBR_2000/BBR_2000_1a_07_Ulrich_Ezekiel26And29.doc\n Verse 12. Shall be desolate forty years] The country from Migdol or Magdolan, which was on the isthmus between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, was so completely ruined, that it might well be called desert; and it is probable that this desolation continued during the whole of the reign of Amasis, which was just forty years. See Herod. lib. iii. c. 10; and see Calmet.\n \n Verse 13. Will I gather the Egyptians] It is probable that Cyrus gave permission to the Egyptians brought to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, to return to their own country. And if we reckon from the commencement of the war against Pharaoh- hophra by Nebuchadnezzar, to the third or fourth year of Cyrus, the term will be about forty years.\n \n Verse 14.

The Hebrew word, \"Tannin,\" is from the root meaning \"to extend.\" The language conjures up an image of a long-necked plesiosaur-like creature paddling up the river and stirring up mud from the Nile delta with its flippers. Just such a creature is depicted by the ancient Egyptians who may have netted one just as Ezekiel describes in verse 3. See the plesiosaur-like hieroglyphic (to the left) currently displayed in the London Museum. \n Sound like someone tryingto describe an animal (a crocodile) that he has not seen before but is basing his descriptions off somone else's descriptions.\n \n \n \n\n Job is the oldest book in the Bible. \n Source? I thought according to you Christians that Genesis was the oldest book, you know, written by Moses and all that?\n \n \nThis book is very interesting from a scientific perspective because of the many natural phenomena that are addressed by God, Job, and his friends. Along the way, God points Job to two special creatures. \n Most scholars I've read consider Job as fictional -- a story written to illustrate various theological points, but fiction.\n \n\n The first, mentioned in Job 40:15, is usually translated \"behemoth\" in the English Bible. Some commentators have suggested that behemoth was a hippo or elephant. But the passage makes clear that this herbivorous animal was \"chief of the ways of God.\" Certainly the hippo and elephant (which had other Hebrew names) don't qualify as the biggest land animal, nor does their anatomy fit the clear language of verse 17. A cedar tree brings to mind a dinosaur's huge tail! \n \n\n I'll repeat from my earlier post as you did not respond to that part:\n As far as your Behemoth of Job goes, it i quite clearly describing a powerful animal with a very large penis. Could be a hippo, could be an elephant.\n \n \n Job's \"tail like a cedar\" is interesting because \"tail\" is a euphemism for \"penis\". In other words, he's describing a beast with a big Dong. \n \n Now, if that wasn't enough, he also tells us that: \"the sinews of his stones are wrapped together\", right after he makes the penis comment. I don't know about you guys, but that sounds like a set of testicles to me. \n \n Besides those, we have even more overwhelming proof beforehand. Job says: \"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.\"\n Certainly sounds lke he's calling the Behemoth to be quite the stud.\n \n Some believe he is describing a Hippo, which he very may well be, but I personally think he's describing an elephant - ever seen an elephant penis? If not, go google it and look at the youtube video of the amorous elephant walking away. From what I've heard they can get up to six feet long. Quite the cedar when compared to the measly size of humans.\n \n \n \n\n In fact, pygmy peoples in equatorial Africa tell stories of a ferocious dinosaurian creature that occupies their swamps and rivers and lashes its opponents with its tail. \n And it couldn't possibly be a crocodile LIVING IN RIVERS AND SWAMPS! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nIt becomes fascinating, as one considers the tail as an offensive weapon, to review the description of Satan as a dragon: \"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon ...And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:\" (Revelation 12:3-4).\n So now Satan is a Brachiosaurus? emoticon_xbouncer \n \n \n\n Job 41 portrays yet another awe-inspiring creature: Leviathan. While clearly one of the fiercest creatures that God made, it is difficult to establish exactly what Leviathan was. The Bible describes a sharp-toothed, scaled creature whose habitat is the mire and deep waters. Ken Ham suggests the ferocious kronosaur as a candidate. Others have suggested that this fire-breathing monster was a land-dweller that merely spent much of its time in the water. Perhaps leviathan was a dinosaur with armor or claws whose \"sharp stones\" were employed to destroy ancient weapons. Maybe we have yet to discover the remains of a leviathan!\n Or maybe it is a large croc that terrorized an area leading to a bigger story.\n \n BTW, any evidence of a water creature (Kronosaur) being able to breathe fire? And I laugh at the offering of Ken Ham as some sort of expert. So, Ham, where is your evidence that this flippered creature was a land dweller?\n \n \n \n\n The \"unicorn,\" mentioned nine times in the KJV Bible, is the Hebrew word \"Re-em.\" The Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated it \"Monokeros\" (one-horn) which was used in Bibles until the 19th century when Akkadian and Ugaritic records were found that mentioned the \"Re-em\" being hunted like a wild ox. However, their early pictograph for the \"Re-em\" shows an animal head with three horns, like a Triceratops. In Psalm 92:10 the \"Re-em\" has but one horn, while the language or Deuteronomy 33:17 implies two horns. Although most commentators and modern versions translate it as a bull or rhino, some have theorized that \"Re-em\" might be a Monoclonious (single horned dinosaur like Triceratops). In Job 39:9-12 God asks, \"Will the unicorn be willing to serve you, or abide by your crib? Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you? Wilt you trust him, because his strength is great?\" This passage shows that the unicorn, whatever it was, could not be tamed to be used in farming, as could an ox. In his classic work Naturalis Historia the first century author Pliny the Elder described \"an exceedingly wild beast called the Monoceros [one-horned]. ...It makes a deep lowing noise, and one black horn two cubits long projects from the middle of its forehead.\" He describes it as like an elephant in length, but with much shorter legs. Other classical authors like Aelian, Oppian, and Martial also mention a \"nose-horn\" creature (a \"Rinokeros\"). Some claim that the \"Rinokeros\" sharpens his horn on a rock and utilizes it in fighting elephants. This is the root word from which we get the modern name rhinoceros. But a rhino does not stab with its horn, which is actually composed of keratin (hair). The correlation between the classical authors and some modern cryptozoological reports is striking. Dr. Roy Mackal's explorations in the Congo brought back reports of a rare, single-horned animal called \"Emela-ntouka\" or \"killer of elephants.\" In a recent expedition, pygmies in Cameroon identified the horned creature (there called \"Ngoubou\") with a Ceratopsian dinosaur and claimed it could sport from one to four horns. Indeed, modern researchers believe that the ceratopsian dinosaurs likely did use their great horn for combat (Dodson, Peter, The Horned Dinosaurs:A Natural History, 1996, p.123.) \n Ockham says Rhino.\n \n And let's not point out the blatat falsehood about the horn. Their horns are indeed used in battle and in mating season, and to chase away lions, etc.\n \n \n\n In the Authorized version of scripture we find Isaiah twice mentioning the \"fiery flying serpent.\" Egypt is called the place of the \"lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent,\" (30:6). This fits with classical authors describing pterosaur populations in Egypt and Arabia. Goertzen notes: \"The Hebrew word, m'opheph Jpvfm, is a polal participle; a form used only by Isaiah when describing the reptilian saraph. The polal indicates an intensive of the root pvf ooph that means to fly or flutter. The imperfect form of the polal is found in Genesis 1:20, 'flying creatures that flutter to and fro' and Isaiah 6:2 'seraphim' (the same word as the reptiles here used for angelic creatures) that fly to and fro.'\" (Goertzen, John, \"The Bible and Pterosaurs,\" 1998.) This same word is employed in Numbers 21:6 to describe the poisonous reptiles that bit the murmuring Israelites. Indeed it is easier to envision an attack of nimble flying snakes (pterosaurs) killing many of the children of Israel rather than them being surprised and killed by snakes on the ground. The pterosaur becoming a type of Christ (John 3:14) seems more appropriate than the snake, which from Genesis to Revelation is a symbol of Satan. In addition, the spread wings on the top of the pole would form a cross. In fact, a plate found with Sennacherib's booty at Calah (from the conquest of Palestine) depicts such a winged serpent on a pole that would seems to match the Nehushtan or brazen saraph of Moses that had become a symbol of worship by Hezekiah's reign (II Kings 18:4). The \"fiery\" flying snake even matches some cryptozoological reports from New Guinea, which attribute to alleged living pterosaurs a bioluminescent capability like a firefly. \n\n So........ pterosaurs = fiery flying creature. Not sure how pterosaurs are associated with fire. Did they breath fire or something? emoticon_xbouncer \n \n \n \n\n While some of this remains merely speculation, it becomes clear that some very fascinating animals have become extinct since Biblical times. But some might object to using arguments from the Bible, claiming that it is not a reliable resource. There are several lines of evidence that the Bible is God's Word. Skeptics respond that there are supposed to be a great many contradictions in the Bible. Again the facts come down on the side of God's Word being consistent, entirely without error in the original, and remarkably preserved.\n http://www.genesispark.org/genpark/bible/bible.htm\n \n http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml\n\n Or rather all of this is compelte and utterly ridiculous speculation.......\n \n \n As far as pictures painted by ancient peoples being evidence for dinos, HA!\n \n Guess that means they had shopping carts back then as well?",

   "Sure thing. Knowing what I have known for more than 30 years now, and by that I mean Gods Holy Spirit which personally indwells me and and personally connects me to Him, which allows us to fellowship on such a deep level, if annihilation of the soul after this life was real, and we only had this time of life to actually live and fellowship with Him, then absolutely YES. I believe my time to spend with God would be even more precious as it would be temporary and not eternal. Gods love for us is unconditional, and so is a believers love for Him as a personal loving God.\n\n In that respect, Archie, you have my admiration, especially where I have highlighted part of your response. The minister that I was conversing with answered in the opposite vein, What would be the point? I give you that for what it's worth.\n \n Interestingly, we who are not of your religious persuasion have a similar worldview: this transient life is all we have so we try to make the damned best of it. Only we can do it without any god.\n \n But thanks for being open, Archie. emoticon_xhoho",

The minister that I was conversing with answered in the opposite vein, What would be the point? I give you that for what it's worth.\n\n \n Sadly for your minister charlie, he obviously didn't have a personal relationship with God, but simply had a job in the field of religion. So his response to you was evidence that his relationship with God was truly a conditional one that was based on what he could get from God. Such a relationship truly does define a person who is motivated by fear rather than love for an all encompassing God. \n \n Remember, when Christ returns and gathers His Bride/Church, the body of Christ, He won't go to any building or buildings to find them, but will draw us from around the world. And He will know us because His own Holy Spirit will be inhabiting us, His spiritual body on Earth. \n \n \nInterestingly, we who are not of your religious persuasion have a similar worldview: this transient life is all we have so we try to make the damned best of it. Only we can do it without any god.\n \n But thanks for being open, Archie. emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n You see charlie, in the bolded lies the rub. Transient defines out as temporary, short lived. Just because you see your life as being that way, that doesn't mean that it is in reality. As eternal beings who will live forever, you are saying that I'm going to live only for today without ever thinking about or planning for an eternal tomorrow. Is that how you live this life? Never planning for retirement or your families future security? Then why would you treat your eternal self so shabbily? It makes no sense at all.",

And Jairus' daughter. Are they reported as saying, What the F did you bring me out of heaven for? No.\n \n There is no evidence for an afterlife; only self-serving scripture and wishful thinking.",

   "Well, if I understand my pre-Christian theology correctly, they would have been in Sheol, the land of the dead. Think Hades but for Jews. The Christian understanding is that Christ's death and more importantly his resurrection broke the power of death over people, enabling entry to heaven even for the unrighteous. There is some conflation in areas of Christian thought of Sheol and the idea of Hell as a place of eternal torment.",
