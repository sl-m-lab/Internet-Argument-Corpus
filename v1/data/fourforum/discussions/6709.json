   "On October 28, 2005; Buffalo, NY will be having a second mayoral debate between State Senator Byron Brown, a Democrat; and Kevin Helfer, his Republican opponent. Now what does a local debate have to do with national politics? Simple. High ranking members of Brown's campaign have requested that WBEN, AM 930 be excluded from the debate. And the host TV station, WKBW channel 7, acquiesced. I beleive that this is setting a dangerous precedent because candidates will now want media outlets who are opposite of their views and stances to be excluded. Is there a double standard, here? Your thoughts.",

For all we know it's a shock radio station with a habit of throwing pies at people during debates.",

When Brown was questioned by the morning news staff, he said that he wanted reporters to ask \"fair\" questions. \"Fair\" meaning to put Brown in a more positive light, rather than call him on his record, as all journalists should. Hmmm. I just checked WKBW's webpage, so I wonder if they changed their minds? Regardless, this should never have happened in the first place.",

I don't see the same outcry from you about journalists calling any republican on his/her record esp Bush. It seems to me that when jounalists do try and call republicans and other coinservate polititicans on their record the journialist is painted as unamerican and discredited. A good examlpe is Dan Rather he was discredited for questioning Bush's military service.\n \n I suspect that the democrat in question knows he will be painted as unamerican and the questions that the conservate hatemongers will ask him will be an atempt to discredit him.",

All I see is you Demo bashing, and not very well either. Are we meant to be impressed by you citing a one word quote out of context, and then dumping your biased spin on it?",
