So it would not be Buddhism.\n \n The idea of 'no guidelines' is a mistaken view of Zen Buddhism.\n Enlightenment is obtained by looking within and considering unanswerable questions called 'koans' but the four noble truths and the eight fold path to happiness is just as important as in any branch of Buddhism\n The middle way is simply not evoking the law of Kharma...keeping you head down,,not creating bad vibes..easy.",
