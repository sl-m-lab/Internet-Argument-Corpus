   "Until recently I've always preferred to listen to BBC as I've considered it gave very correct interpretation of the facts and current events, happened in the world. But it's rather strange for such honorable radio station to report about so-called 200,000 Hollanders that called upon our Queen to stop deportation of local Chechen refugees. It hurts me to hear such wacky news from BBC. I experience Chechens firsthand, because I live in suburb of Eindhoven, where Chechen camping-ground inhabits. And as soon as they appeared here, a quiet life in our small town came to a close. We became witnesses of constant internecine robberies. Moreover, they've terrorized the neighbourhood. Frankly speaking, it seems to me all of them are simply bandits. And we will be glad to deport them as soon as possible, not speaking about putting our names down for petition the Queen for their special protection. I think these Hollanders behave like that, because they know nothing about Chechen group living. But why did BBC deal with the question?

   "Whether the Chechen refugees are misbehaving in Eindhoven, I have no idea - but the BBC is emphatically not a reliably impartial source of news about Chechen activities or about current events in general.\n \n The reputation of the BBC for objective reporting of the news does not survive close scrutiny: Reith conservatism has been supplanted by a liberal perspective through which editors \"amend\" and journalists interpret the news.\n \n Even a (sympathetic) report commissioned by the BBC's own board of governors found that there was an \"institutional mindset\" within the BBC and a tendency to over-simplify and to polarise issues.",
