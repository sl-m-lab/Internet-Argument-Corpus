   "Ohh Baby! This Just Keeps Getting Better!!\n \n Newt Considers a Run for RNC Chairman - Digital Journal: Your News Network\n \n Newt Considers a Run for RNC Chairman\n \n \n \nAs Georgia Republican Leadership meet today to plan for the expected run-off of Saxby Chambliss against Jim Martin, my sources tell me Gingrich is having meetings to discuss his own race. \n \n Newt is best known for leading the charge for the Contract with America. It is this famed Contract that has been credited for the Republican take-over of the US House and Senate in 1994. It is also well believed among traditional Republicans that it has been the abandonment of this contract by elected Republicans that has lead to their downfall. \n \n Since his retirement from elected office, Gingrich has stayed involved in the political grind on many different levels. Newt has released several books, founded American Solutions, and has acted as a political analyst appearing on numerous political programs and radio talk shows. \n \n The Republican base in Newt's home state of Georgia still hail him as a hero and hold him in high regard much like national Republicans do Ronald Reagan. Considering the obvious divide among Republican voters, Newt Gingrich just may be the leader they need to help them once again unite. Gingrich has a proven record of understanding the will of the American people and his experience as a leader is a proven matter of record.\n\n \n \n Man, this just made my year!! As we all know, Newt has no tolerance for RINOs and enjoys my favorite pasttime-pi$$ing off Liberals emoticon_cool",

   "The owners of large corporations produce very little their workers produce a lot, and a lot of Obama's donors were just those workers.\n\n \n Your statement \"the owners of large corporations produce very little\" is a basic political statement that everyone will never agree on. It does often seem like they do little more than sit in big fancy offices without a care in the world, but it's not quite that simple. While I'm no big fan of corporate executives who are set for life and pretty well immune to any disaster, I don't think many of them are that way. There is a lot more sympathetic coverage in the news media for the workers in layoffs and plant closings than there is for those who own those plants. A large percentage of them (small corporations) aren't set for life, and often don't even get unemployment benefits that workers get. More than one corporation owner in my area has committed suicide. \n \n Concerning Obama's doners, there is one big difference between organized special interest donations and individual (worker) donations. Here is a list of some of his doners. Just looking at the top one, we see that the University of California gave $909,283. If 50,000 workers give just $20 each, that's a little more - $1,000,000. There's no organization to the $20 contributors, they each probably have a slighty different idea what they would like Obama to do for them. Obama isn't likely to seek out any one $20 doner and ask what he wants in return. He's very likely to go to the one designated spokesman for the University of California, and ask what he wants, he may have even been required to ask before he got the money. And the answer could very well have been; \"we would like embryonic stem cell research made legal - could you get that done for us? Shame on you if you can't.\" Money does talk. By the same token, Bush could have gotten a $900,000 contribution from an oil company a few years ago. Their 'suggestion' - \"could you keep environmentalists off our backs so we can drill for oil\"? \n \n Just hypothetical examples, but you get the point. A sizable donation from an organization, with one spokesman, can make a political candidate jump a lot quicker and higher than individual donations from voters, even if they total more. Those organizations are special interests, and they control US politics a lot more than they should IMO, but that's the way things are. Our government is too big.",

The great majority of his money came from private donations - with the average one apparently being ~$80. This was also a diverse group of small donors that don't all follow one ideology. That leaves him more free to act in ways he thinks are best. Since he is a Democrat, then I am sure that he will follow the Democratic platform of supporting abortion rights, allowing stem cell research and supporting some limited gun control - all of which are issues that moderates generally support and are opposed only by those who would never have voted Democratic anyway. I have heard accusations that he wanted to ban all guns, but those accusations were based on very flimsy evidence - all his rhethoric seems to be along the usual Democratic line of gun control (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, etc.). As for gay marriage, I doubt that he will support that and, up to now, I haven't heard much rhethoric from him. That is one social issue that I would agree that most Americans are opposed to - including a core part of his constituency, the black vote. I wouldn't be surprised, though, if he did push for civil unions - something that I would personally think is a good intermediate step. \n \nThat all gets complicated because of the congress each president has, and the status of world affairs. I think middle east stability is more responsible than domestic give away programs, but that's just me. \n\n If Bush's plans had actually improved on Middle East stability, you might have a point. Unfortunately, it seems to have accomplished the opposite. \n \nHe is considering ROBERT KENNEDY, a environmentalist fanatic, as his EPA director. emoticon_frazzled emoticon_frazzled emoticon_frazzled What business owner doesn't have nightmares about that? \n\n I don't know much about Robert Kennedy but, even if he is a very left wing environmentalist, you must remember that the EPA has limited powers over industry. Any fanaticism on his part could only be used to more rigidly police environmental rules that are ALREADY in place. Any new environmental laws would be out of his hands and in the hands of congress - who show all signs of wanting to be more moderate and not go too far in environmental regulations (i.e. not so far as to strangle business).\n \nI can't argue with that, in the case of the banking industry. But it should stop there. The automobile industry? H#LL NO!!!!!\n\n I admit that I also have mixed feelings about the automobile industry bailout. A corporation such as Chrystler has been doing poorly for decades. At some point, one just should give up and take it as a loss for that company to fail. However, other companies - ex. Ford and GM - might still do well long-term and might be worth bailing out, though perhaps more in long-term low-interest loans than simple give-aways. However, any help we give them should be contingent on their making the proper modernizations, improvements in efficiency, etc to be competitive again.\n \nIMO Bush got a lot of criticism that he didn't deserve. Saddam Hussien (sp?) his sons, Al-Zarqui (sp?) and a lot of other prominent terrorists are dead, and they would still be alive under a Democrat president. I'm sure Bin-Laden is crawling out of his hole with a smile on his face right about now. After the newness of Obama's wonderfulness wears off, I think the future will be a little more kind to Bush. He will be gracious and smooth as he leaves office. The White House will not be vandalized by his staff as he leaves, like it was with Clinton.\n\n Bush was definitely worse in his first term than in his second, where he seemed to learn some of the lessons from his failures in his first term. Any recovery of his reputation would probably come from an aknowledgement that he did improve. I already have seen the first signs of this. Here is an article from Fareed Zakarhia (Newseek center-left columnist) about many of the improvements in Bush's policies. Outside of his apparent graciousness to Obama in recent days, it has helped me see him in a less harsh light:\n Zakaria: What Bush Got Right | Newsweek Politics | Newsweek.com \n \n As for Al Qaida's reaction to Obama, they seem to be in more of a wait and see mode. However, it is interesting to see the range of reactions from Bloggers on Islamic websites. CBS news had a bit about reactions around the world to Obama's win- including reactions from bloggers on Islamic web sites. From The World Welcomes Obama's Victory, A Log Of Reactions From Around The Globe To Barack Obama's Election Win - CBS News :\n \nWhat The Extremists Are Saying? There has been no reaction yet to Obama&#8217;s victory from any of the more prominent extremist Muslim leaders, reports CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer, but the radical blogosphere is hoping for a statement soon from al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. \n \n On the most influential Islamist Web sites over the past few weeks, discussion of the U.S. election has been sporadic and unsophisticated. The reaction to Obama&#8217;s win was similarly crude, including: \n \n The simply preposterous: Blogger &#8220;Al-Hakim&#8221; wrote on the well-known Alhesbah site that, &#8221;America elected Obama because al Qaeda decided so, the same way Bush was elected in 2004 - also because al Qaeda had decided so.&#8221; \n \n The skeptical: Obama is unlikely to bring about any real change, wrote one blogger on the &#8220;Nasr Lil Islam&#8221; (Victory For Islam) site. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get too excited. Obama is nothing but a pair of \"black gloves\" that the Americans will use to strike against Muslims.&#8221; \n \n The Disappointed: A blogger calling himself \"Big problem2\" on the &#8220;Ansar al-Mujahideen&#8221; (Supporters of the Mujahideen) chat room on Paltalk said, \"Sadly, Obama won. I really hoped he&#8217;d lose. He&#8217;s much smarter than McCain and we wanted the dumb guy. Anyway. It&#8217;s god&#8217;s will and whatever God decides must happen. Another contributor questioned the post, asking why \"Big Problem2\" had been rooting for McCain. \"Obama is smart. He will know how to pull America out of the Iraqi quagmire,\" came the response. \n \n Finally - a glimmer of conciliation: One blogger, going by the name &#8220;Ansar Allah,&#8221; predicted that Obama&#8217;s win could wind down the ideological war. &#8220;Now that Obama has won the vote&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s time to declare a truce.&#8221; \n\n The last two blogs give me hope that the threat of terrorism will diminish under an Obama administration.",

   "I remember Bush as the lazy, incurious man who vacationed endlessly through numerous warnings and allowed the events of September 11, 2001 to occur.\n \n.... Joe Conason has calculated that up until Sept. 11, 2001, Bush had spent 54 days at the ranch, 38 days at Camp David, and four days at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport-a total of 96 days, or about 40 percent of his presidency, outside of Washington.\n \n Yet by that inference, Bush has remained a remarkably out-of-touch-or at least out-of-town-leader, even in the two and a half years since 9/11. Dana Milbank counts that through his entire term to date, Bush has spent 500 days-again, about 40 percent of his time in office-at the ranch, the retreat, or the compound.\n \n The 9/11 commission has unveiled many critical problems in the FBI and the CIA. But the most critical problem may have been that the president was off duty.\n\n While Bush vacationed, 9/11 warnings went unheard. - By Fred Kaplan - Slate Magazine",

Yes, incrimental steps are often taken in politics but I think that Republicans vastly exagerate how far left they view the Democratic party's final goal. Often, the term \"Socialist\" is used. In my life, I have personally only met a couple of people who advocated true Socialism or Communism - even having grown up in Massachusetts and having done graduate studies in California, some of the most left-wing states. The great majority of Democrats either expressed or implied that regulated Capitalism is the best system. The Democratic party leadership generally reflects this more moderate stance. Also, nowadays, it is only the far left wing minority that views corporations as evil. Most Democrats realize that one has to make a balance between employee / consumer rights and competitiveness of corporations. \n \n As for social issues, Republicans will have to face the fact that most Americans agree with the Democratic stance of protecting abortion rights (at least first term rights), keeping some gun control laws, etc. The only social issue on which Republicans reflect general US opinion is the gay marriage issue - which is why they have made it such a centerpiece of recent elections. However, even there, it is only a minority of people who wouldn't give any rights to gay couples (the usual ~30% Religious Right). Though most people don't support calling a gay union a \"marriage\", a large minority support gay \"civil unions\" so that, if you add up those supporting gay unions as either \"marriage\" or \"civil unions\", that adds up to ~two thirds of Americans. It is clear that most people support rights of homosexual couples. Though the Democratic party might ultimately want gay unions to be called marriages, they recognize that this is devisive, which is why they have been fairly silent on the idea of gay marriage and, instead, often mention civil unions. Whether or not this will \"slippery slope\" into gay marriage will depend on future polls on the subject. \n \nThat depends on a persons point of view, based on speculation of what would have happened without Bush's plans. I think it would be less stable with Saddam Hussein still in power. Less stable with whatever actions (or lack of them) that a Democrat president would have taken. \n\n Saddam Hussein was never a threat to the US and any threat he might have posed locally could have been contained with a combination of UN inspectors and threat of military reprisal if he overstepped international boundaries with invasions. Instead, our invasion of Iraq has set the whole of the Middle East hating the US - something which certainly did not make the US more safe. It looks like this election of Obama will give an opportunity for some reconciliation.\n \nIt does? That's the first I've heard of it. The only limits I've ever heard of concerning the EPA involves their targets having enough money to fight them in court. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'd like to see a source. Is there a criteria that spells out their limits? \n\n I only meant that they cannot invent new environmental rules. That is up to Congress.\n \nWell, I'm not alone in thinking that they've already gone too far, by hindering oil exploration in the US. By making it too complicated for anyone to build a single new oil refinery in the US in 32 years. \n\n If you don't like their actions policing any particular environmental rule, then petition your Congressman to revoke that rule. I cannot address that at the moment since I haven't done the research into the pros and cons of such restrictions.\n \nA book could be written on why the auto industry is having trouble today, from their strong unions, foreign competition, government mandates on fuel mileage and safety etc, but I think one main reason cars don't sell well today is simply because we already have enough of them.

Clunker laws, pollution and safety laws for older, yet useful cars. It's a major loss of liberty when government mandates are placed on private property. \n\n If foreign car manufacturers can meet these standards and be very competitive, why can't our car manufacturers? Our auto industry always seems to be one step behind - late in introducing low gas mileage standards, late in introducing hybrids, always behind in reliability, etc. That is one of the main reasons why Americans buy fewer American cars. The foreign competitors are nearly always better. The question is - what is keeping our car manufacturers from fully catching up with the competition - is it really labor unions, or is there a problem with the attitude of the executives in resisting change? I suspect that there are many problems that need to be addressed at once.\n \nThe big three auto makers would like us to believe that they're the only ones in the US who can build cars, but it's not really true.

It's simply un-American - unfair to todays new entrepreneurs. Part of new capitalistic success can be built on old capitalistic failures. \n\n I am not convinced that the competitive climate of the auto industry would really allow new players to grow into large automotive companies. Even where foreign competitors are concerned, the main competitors continue to be the ones that have been with us for decades. Remember, even if the big three go down, the new competitors would still have to face the huge competition from foreign auto makers - i.e. the same competitors that are taking the big three down. A new auto maker would find it very hard to compete since the economy of numbers / volume would work against them.\n \nI hope that's true, but I'm afraid it could be because of appeasement. That's a band-aid - not a permanent solution to a problem.\n\n It depends on what you think of as the big problems. Is Iran a threat to us? Probably not. They would be insane to ever use nuclear arms against us or against Israel since our retaliation would cause their country to cease to exist. They are not that insane. Most of their rhetoric is simple saber rattling. The only threat they might pose is to be more open about their terrorist supporting activity if they have a nuclear shield to make it very expensive to invade them. If we think Iraq is a difficult war, that is peanuts compared to any war we might rage with Iran over this issue - where the Iranian people would immediately unite against us and destroy any fledgling hope that the country currently has of turning Democratic. However, it is still worth continuing sanctions on them and having multilateral discussions with them. They don't want to be isolated politically and economically from the world - which is our main advantage in discussions with them. We just have to let them save face in negotiations to be able to gain something from their dismantling of the nuclear program, as well as enabling them to feel some sense of security after all of our rhetoric of \"axis of evil\" and our history (invasion of Iraq and earlier history of bringing down a Democratic leader to help install a Western friendly Shah).\n \n As for Al Qaeda and the terrorists, Obama has made it quite clear that he wants to escalate the war in Afghanistan for precisely the reason to restrict the power of the terrorist groups - even go into Pakistany border regions if necessary. That is hardly appeasement.\n \n Is there any specific Middle East issue where you suspect that Obama will take a stance of appeasement?",

   "That is only true up to a point. Yes, incrimental steps are often taken in politics but I think that Republicans vastly exagerate how far left they view the Democratic party's final goal. Often, the term \"Socialist\" is used. In my life, I have personally only met a couple of people who advocated true Socialism or Communism - even having grown up in Massachusetts and having done graduate studies in California, some of the most left-wing states. The great majority of Democrats either expressed or implied that regulated Capitalism is the best system. The Democratic party leadership generally reflects this more moderate stance. Also, nowadays, it is only the far left wing minority that views corporations as evil. Most Democrats realize that one has to make a balance between employee / consumer rights and competitiveness of corporations. \n\n \n When you say Republicans exagerate how far left they view the Democratic party's final goal, what you may actually be seeing is Republicans projecting the Democratic party's final result, by applying their knowledge of history and human nature. The \"rich\" risk takers and entrepreneurs (the engines of capitalism) simply reduce, or completely refuse to take risks if they have too much regulation to inhibit them. With regulation comes unpredictability. Long range planning is important in big business. There is far more predictability in unregulated market trends than there is in government mandates. \n \n I think one big difference in liberal vs conservative views is that liberals tend to see their progressive social experimentation as non threatening if it doesn't work out exactly as planned, whereas conservatives see it as non-reversible - something that can't be reverted back to the way things were. \n \n \nAs for social issues, Republicans will have to face the fact that most Americans agree with the Democratic stance of protecting abortion rights (at least first term rights), keeping some gun control laws, etc. The only social issue on which Republicans reflect general US opinion is the gay marriage issue - which is why they have made it such a centerpiece of recent elections. However, even there, it is only a minority of people who wouldn't give any rights to gay couples (the usual ~30% Religious Right).

Whether or not this will \"slippery slope\" into gay marriage will depend on future polls on the subject. \n\n \n I don't really disagree with any of that, except to say that (as a member of that 30% religious right) my opposition to them having \"any rights\" isn't to impose my religion on them, it's to keep the almost certain slippery slope of special rights to become a reality for them. As far as them not having any rights, remember that they currently have ALL the same rights that single people do. As a single person, I think that should be enough for them. \n \n \nSaddam Hussein was never a threat to the US and any threat he might have posed locally could have been contained with a combination of UN inspectors and threat of military reprisal if he overstepped international boundaries with invasions. Instead, our invasion of Iraq has set the whole of the Middle East hating the US - something which certainly did not make the US more safe. It looks like this election of Obama will give an opportunity for some reconciliation. \n\n \n I don't think the whole of the middle east hates us to nearly the extent that the news media would have us believe. (remember the heavy voter turnout in Iraq just after Hussein was ousted?) I think it's clear that most of the middle east is glad Hussein is gone. As far as him not being a threat, remember most of the US thought that about Hitler in the mid thirties, about Japan on Dec 6, 1941, or about Bin Laden on Sept 10, 2001. \n \n \nI only meant that they cannot invent new environmental rules. That is up to Congress.\n \n If you don't like their actions policing any particular environmental rule, then petition your Congressman to revoke that rule. I cannot address that at the moment since I haven't done the research into the pros and cons of such restrictions. \n\n \n I can't either, but the EPA is a multi-million dollar bureaucracy whose actions can't always be blamed on Congress alone. Examples of EPA fanaticism aren't hard to find;\n \n \n The EPA recently introduced 570 pages of proposed regulations that would, among other things, establish Grass Mileage Standards for home lawnmowers and require permits for farms with as few as 25 cows. Those regulations would increase costs in all sectors of the economy and drive up prices at a time when many Americans are struggling to hold onto their jobs and make ends meet. \n \n In a flawed decision last year, five US Supreme Court justices said the EPA had to treat greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (the life-giving gas that makes trees grow tall and flowers bloom), as pollutants under the Clean Air Act (CAA). \n In response, EPA bureaucrats have submitted an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that attempts to cram the gigantic square peg of greenhouse gas regulation into the small round hole of the CAA.\n The result is a power grab on a scale that is difficult to comprehend. \n\n \n PHXnews.com | Stop EPA's Giant Power Grab\n \n Petitioning congress concerning the action of five US Supreme Court justices looks like the ultimate exercise in futility to me, in this day and age. \n \n \nIf foreign car manufacturers can meet these standards and be very competitive, why can't our car manufacturers? Our auto industry always seems to be one step behind - late in introducing low gas mileage standards, late in introducing hybrids, always behind in reliability, etc. That is one of the main reasons why Americans buy fewer American cars. The foreign competitors are nearly always better. The question is - what is keeping our car manufacturers from fully catching up with the competition - is it really labor unions, or is there a problem with the attitude of the executives in resisting change? I suspect that there are many problems that need to be addressed at once. \n\n \n Addressed by the private sector, yes. They need to go with chapter 11 bankruptcy, restructure and downsize. They're simply too big - their market is drying up. It wouldn't surprise me if fewer than 1 in 5 new cars in the US actually get worn completely out, most are carelessly torn up / abandoned.\n \n Chapter 11 for them wouldn't be pleasant for a lot of people, but it may not be the disaster it's made out to be. I heard someone say that 1 of 10 people are employed by the auto industry in some way, as if all of them will suffer if the big three go under. Chances are, half of them aren't directly employed by the big three (aftermarket parts, foreign companies etc.) and those will actually benefit with a loss of the big three. Demands on their products/services would increase!\n \n I've heard that foreign car makers (Toyota specifically) isn't exactly setting the world on fire right now. Sudden instability of fuel prices is the culprit for a lot of the entire auto industry's problems\n \n \nI am not convinced that the competitive climate of the auto industry would really allow new players to grow into large automotive companies. Even where foreign competitors are concerned, the main competitors continue to be the ones that have been with us for decades. Remember, even if the big three go down, the new competitors would still have to face the huge competition from foreign auto makers - i.e. the same competitors that are taking the big three down. A new auto maker would find it very hard to compete since the economy of numbers / volume would work against them. \n\n \n It wouldn't be easy of course, but they wouldn't have to start out large. Without the baggage that Detroit auto makers have, and with the void they would leave them, some fresh new ideas could really be surprising I think. \n \n \n \nIt depends on what you think of as the big problems. Is Iran a threat to us? Probably not. They would be insane to ever use nuclear arms against us or against Israel since our retaliation would cause their country to cease to exist. They are not that insane. Most of their rhetoric is simple saber rattling. The only threat they might pose is to be more open about their terrorist supporting activity if they have a nuclear shield to make it very expensive to invade them. If we think Iraq is a difficult war, that is peanuts compared to any war we might rage with Iran over this issue - where the Iranian people would immediately unite against us and destroy any fledgling hope that the country currently has of turning Democratic. However, it is still worth continuing sanctions on them and having multilateral discussions with them. They don't want to be isolated politically and economically from the world - which is our main advantage in discussions with them. We just have to let them save face in negotiations to be able to gain something from their dismantling of the nuclear program, as well as enabling them to feel some sense of security after all of our rhetoric of \"axis of evil\" and our history (invasion of Iraq and earlier history of bringing down a Democratic leader to help install a Western friendly Shah).\n \n As for Al Qaeda and the terrorists, Obama has made it quite clear that he wants to escalate the war in Afghanistan for precisely the reason to restrict the power of the terrorist groups - even go into Pakistany border regions if necessary. That is hardly appeasement.\n \n Is there any specific Middle East issue where you suspect that Obama will take a stance of appeasement?\n\n \n Specific, no - generally, yes. Mainly, that we are going to disengage too early from Iraq like we did in Germany after WW1, or Iraq after Desert Storm in 1991, resulting in both cases of our having to go back 1 decade later.",

   "The problem with Republicans is that they cannot accept anything having to do with abortion or gay marriage. They just can't because IMHO, they have been taken over by the right wing Chrisitans. This is why the Republican party is losing ground. They are just to damn far behind! The Democrats learned to diversify that's why they are winning. They have pro-gun control Demo's and they have Pro-gun Demo's who also support abortion and gay rights to some extent. That's why I'm not really afraid of an AW ban or anything like that, but I am more afraid of Obama's SCOTUS choices because he'd probably pick some one who is far liberal then the ones on the court right now. If Republicans really want to kick butt next election they have to accept some of this (like early term abortions or gay marriage, etc) and a the same time they can have someone who can appeal to the Christian right. For example, some one who can say I support early term abortions, or when the mother's life is in danger, or when she has been raped or due to incest, etc. To me, it seems they are just being illogical on some of the stances that most people would disagree with them. I do not want people to think I'm a liberal, really I'm not that liberal compared to some of the people here. I'm pretty much more open about social issues like abortion and gay rights, but when it comes to the economy I am a fiscal conservative that's for sure. I think lots of people are like that. They just want to live their lives like they want to, but also want the government to spend less and be more productive.",

The trouble with congress passing such a law is that the pro-life side knows that restricting third term abortions by law will take away much of its arguement, so it tries to add language or maneuver such third trimester abortion restriction support toward a bill that would open up a slippery slope into outlawing all abortions. So, it is hard for the two parties to find a compromise bill.\n \nWith all due respect, the issue of gay marriage was barely even touched upon in the presidential election.\n\n That is why I said recent elections, as opposed to \"this\" election.

Glock - Gunpedia which is also a trigger safety.\n\n Is your main concern about safety mechanisms for child safety? Are there other major risks you see for guns without safety mechanisms? Would you support a regulation requiring guns to have safety mechanisms?",

I suppose that I need more convincing through links to official sites that AWs don't fall under my concern of large casualties.\n\n \n Well, under California law they are banned. Why I do not know. GL that are attached, for example, on the sks are only available to NATO forces. That is the \"grenade\" used is not readily available in the USA to someone who is not in the military. So banning it is useless. It serves no real purpose on a regular gun you could buy at a gun shop because you couldn't use it anyways. Most people who collect AW's just want it for the authenticity nothing more or less. The problem lies that if the gun had one of these, they'd be automatically banned.\n \n Here's some pretty good info if you'd like.

   "Apparently, the FBI and CIA get a wide range of warnings daily - the great majority of which are bogus or unrealistic. I certainly do not think that the public should be overwhelmed by a full list of such warnings. However, I trust that the FBI and CIA can properly parse through all of the bogus warnings to narrow down to some that are fairly realistic and that those should be passed on to the public. The main thing that concerns me is that there might be political reasons to post fairly unrealistic warnings at certain times - ex. just prior to elections to boost Republican chances of winning.

   "The Newt idea is based on the notion that the Republicans could have won, if they were just a little more extreme. That is what the democrats thought when they nominated McGovern.\n \n Given the image problem republicans have right now, the last thing they need is a man who reminds them of corruption.\n \n In the OpEdNews.com /Zogby People's poll of 850 Pennsylvania voters, we found that Republicans were far more likely to expect corruption. We asked, \"Who is more corrupt, if at all, Republicans or Democrats?\" 48% of respondents said Republicans and 9% said Democrats. 41% said both equally. Women said 60% Republicans and 4% Democrats. \n OpEdNews >> Trickle Down Republican Corruption; Poll Results show right wing corruption exists at all levels\n \n And significantly, it's an opinion held by many conservatives:\n \n A poll of 508 persons attending the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C. found that Republicans experienced significant defeats in the 2006 elections because of illegal corruption; conservative leaders who kept silent while the Republican Party embraced Big Government; and President George W. Bush.\n \n The poll, sponsored by ConservativesBetrayed.com, asked each person to identify 10 choices, out of 31 individuals, factors, or groups, that caused Republicans to lose control of the House and Senate...\n \n 79.5% selected illegal corruption (such as Mark Foley, Robert Ney, and Jack Abramoff)\n Poll on GOP Election Losses Blame Corruption, Conservative Leaders, and Bush\n \n Might be time to look for some people who didn't lose their jobs because of ethical lapses.",

   "Man, this just made my year!! As we all know, Newt has no tolerance for RINOs and enjoys my favorite pasttime-pi$$ing off Liberals\n\n \n Let me get this straight. The Dems had a sweeping victory in November: a difference of seven million votes in the presidential race, gains in both houses of congress, and the overwhelming majority of counties nationwide voting more Democratic than four years ago. Moreover, young voters broke Democratic by roughly two to one. And you think that the Republican Party needs to make its platform even less tolerant of divergent views?!?\n \n Good grief, the Republicans are soooo screwed. Especially if they put Newt at the helm. For which reason I enthusiastically encourage them to do it, of course.\n \n Do keep enjoying your pastime, though. It seems that the Republican party has little to offer these days but ways to make people angry, including their suppporters, not just their opponents. And you can thank Newt, Rush, Sean, Ann, et al, for all that. But if it'll make your time aboard the sinking Republican ship that much more enjoyable for you, go ahead. Just be forewarned that the American people are tired of it, so it will only cause the ship to sink that much faster.\n \n Here's to Newt chairing the RNC! emoticon_xhoho",
