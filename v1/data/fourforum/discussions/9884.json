Don't confuse the gay marriage issue with that as being gay isn't a racial issue.

It is special rights they seek and that is what we are against. \n \n \nThe history of the human race is filled with gay people. Why deny what god made?\n\n \n God may have created all people but our sinful nature created us with flaws and handicaps, and because homosexuality is an across the board 5% minority in both the animal and human kingdoms it falls right in with the range of unnatural genetic anomalies that although is sad, doesn't warrant special rights. \n \n \nEvery society that persecutes gay people, even just by denying them their god-given rights, is homophobic. That Christianity has been traditionally homophobic for the last millennium doesn't make it right; it makes it bigoted.\n\n \n This is a ridiculous assumption that is in itself totally bigoted and steeped in ignorance. And Christianity as Christ taught it isn't homophobic and neither is my brand of it. God loves all gay people just as He loves all straights. But God hates the act of homosexuality just as He hates the acts of perversions that straight people practice. Have you ever heard of the verse that say's hate the sin but love the sinner ? That came from God ya know. \n \n Gays seem to think they deserve a special dispensation to live and act as they like sexually without concern for Gods laws or standards of morality. Well it just doesn't work that way. Just as I had to change from my lustful horny love em and leave em ways from my unsaved days to humble myself before my Father, so must the gay. And Christianity has been against homosexuality for the past TWO millenniums, not just the last one.\n \n \nThere is no love, justice or common sense in bigotry; just sheer, irrational hatred.\n\n \n Agreed, so stop painting everybody and anybody who opposes your lifestyle in such a way and I'll stop referring to you as such. emoticon_xangel",

The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\n \n Marriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/loving.html\n \n\n \n The word was \"happiness, not \"gayness\". :) \n And the opinion specifically, and narrowly limits its scope to racial discrimination.\n Show me where the SCOTUS has ever ruled that we had a fundamental right to gay marriage. \n \n\n True, many state governments are too bigoted yet to recognise this fundamental right.\n \n\n Many states recently enacted State Amendments banning gay marriage. That makes the law a popular belief, not something rammed down an unsuspecting public's throats. \n \n\n That doesn't make it a non-right; it makes them bigots. In the 1960s, bigots were offering exactly the same arguments against interracial marriage that are now being offered against gay marriage. \n \n\n The difference is that they were discriminating against blacks based on their race and race is a protected class. That's not the case for gays. \n \n \n\n Amazingly enough, gay marriage is a pretty conservative value -- well, any marriage is.\n\n Don't have many Conservative friends, I take it?

And it doesn't prevent gay people from having their own children, or adopting other people's.\n \n \nNeither should people who practice unnatural sex be allowed to marry and raise a family as if they are a true nuclear family when they would have no real genetic connection at all. \n\n \n This is a sadly feeble argument, as taking it to its logical conclusion would mean no heterosexual people should be allowed to adopt because they have no kinship to adoptive children, and worse, if they have any kind of sex other than whatever it is you personally approve of, they shouldn't even be allowed to keep their own!\n \n Sorry, but gay people do raise their own natural children; some help raise their partner's natural children; and some help society by selflessly adopting. Gay families exist whether you approve of them or not, and they deserve the same legal protections you take for granted for your own family.\n \n \nThe facts are that not every person gets all the rights of every other person in this World at all times no matter who they are.\n\n \n It is indeed a fact, and a fact that urgently needs to be changed. \n \n \nConditions exist and requirements exist that mean certain standards must be met in order to qualify for certain benefits in Society.\n\n \n Gay families meet those standards as much as straight ones.\n \n \nIs an amputee being discriminated against because he can't drive a bus ? I think not. \n\n \n Gay families are real, gays can and do drive this bus, and bigotry against them hurts the children of gay people. Time it stopped being promoted by government.\n \n \nSo should two gay men be allowed to marry and effect the lives potentially of little children they would adopt and raise with their values ? I think not. And evidently millions of Americans in 13 States who overwhelmingly voted against Gay Marriage in the 04 elections agree with me. \n\n \n Is this the \"millions of bigots can't be wrong\" argument? Maybe they're bigoted from fear and malice; maybe they are bigoted from ignorance or indifference; and maybe they are bigoted because of religious propaganda.

But your denial doesn't negate that it's a spiritual law and we will all be held to it, straight or gay.\n\n \n This is not a relevant argument. We do not have to live according to what you think is \"spiritual law\", we have to live with civil law, and your interpretation of your bible doesn't belong in it -- neither does anyone else's.

   "Excellent question. In the instance in which there is a conflict, the most recent statute is taken as the legal one. For example, you had Prohibition, followed by the repeal of Prohibition. \n\n That's a completely different scenario. We're not talking about repealing an amendment with another amendment, we're talking about an amendment that contradicts part of the constitution that you have no intention of getting rid of. If your constitution says \"The freedom of religion shall not be abridged\" and you somehow push through an amendment that says \"No one is allowed to be Catholic\" then what happens? You seem to be suggesting that freedom of religion goes out the door in that case.\n \n \n\n SCOTUS, when evaluating the constitutionality of a law will look at the most recent relavent Amendment because it represents the most current intention of the law.\n\n What are you basing that on? The US Constitution doesn't have all that many amendments, and they don't really tend to contradict each other. Can you give an example where they actually said, \"We're basing our ruling on this amendment and not that one because this one is newer\"?

That's just the way it is.\n\n \n I know you were addressing ShadowPikachu, but I have a comment on this. I guess if you go your way, we could be considered superior in that aspect - however, we are not unique in that aspect. For example, as far as intelligence and ability to reason (also compassion), there are many fellow animals that show these, some close to or equal to our own - birds encounter problems, and they make and use tools to solve them. Chimps encounter problems, and develop tools to solve them (reasoning and problem-solving). Squirrels are very adept at solving problems; as are raccoons and many other animals. \n \n Recently there has been research into the intelligence of octopuses. Other animals that I can think of of include the great apes, dolphins (many things here, including recent work on language - I'll repeat that for effect: LANGUAGE), horses, parrots, dogs, crows, elephants (capable of art, tool use), etc. To say that man is really that superior in this aspect (possibly somewhat, but not extremely) is to ignore the intelligence of many other animals.\n \n I read a good article on this a while back: Worldly Wise Web - TimesOnline UK\n \n I think the Doug Adams quote at the end applies aptly to this discussion: \n\"Man has always believed he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.\" \n",

That's just the way it is.\n\n \n I hink that GiantOreo has handled the response to this post aptly - humans may be slightly \"superior\" (which may or may not be true) in that aspect, but they are not unique, and many other animals have close to or equal the intelligence, compassion, and ability to reason that humans have.\n \n \n I won't be able to respond to any of your posts after this one as I am taking a hiatus of about two-and-a-half weeks - I'm getting married on Friday so I have a lot to do, and then my soon-to-be-husband and myself will be gone about a week on our honeymoon, so I'll be gone for a while. Now that I think of it, it is very sobering that I am soon to get married to the man I love, and yet in most of the US, other couples totally in love with each other are denied this ceremony - discriminated against due to the person that they are in love with - it is sick and cruel, and I don't see how anyone can condone doing that to these loving couples.\n \n If I feel anything needs responding to it will probably be in about two weeks (just so you don't think I'm ignoring everyone :) )",

   "That's a completely different scenario. We're not talking about repealing an amendment with another amendment, we're talking about an amendment that contradicts part of the constitution that you have no intention of getting rid of. If your constitution says \"The freedom of religion shall not be abridged\" and you somehow push through an amendment that says \"No one is allowed to be Catholic\" then what happens? You seem to be suggesting that freedom of religion goes out the door in that case.\n \n\n Exactly. \n \n\n What are you basing that on? The US Constitution doesn't have all that many amendments, and they don't really tend to contradict each other. Can you give an example where they actually said, \"We're basing our ruling on this amendment and not that one because this one is newer\"? And also, do keep in mind that we are talking about state constitutions here, I'm not sure the SCOTUS is even relevant.\n \n That's clearly not true though. If your constitution says FOO, and an amendment says NOT-FOO, then you have a contradiction. Something's got to give. And again, let me emphasize that we are not talking about an amendment that's designed to repeal or rewrite part of the constitution. There's nothing in the proposed amendment that says \"replace section 2B with the new phrase ...\" The MA constitution does have parts like that, and this isn't one of them. This is a straight addition which, if the AG is correct, contradicts part of the existing constitution.\n\n \n I disagree. Many of the amendments were enacted to limit previously allowed practices or to reverse others. The 13th ended the legality of slavery. The 14th gave them all of the rights and freedoms of citizens. Prior to that, hey were property. The 15th made sure that blacks couldn't be prevented from voting because they were black.\n The 14th guaranteed the right to vote for those 21 and over. The 26th Amendment changed that limit to 18. \n the 27th Amendment changed the rules that applied to pay raises for Congress. \n In summary, almost all of the amendments after the Bill of Rights either contradict or limit prior rights.",

Look at gorillas, for cripes sake! They can understand human language and communicate to us through sign language - Koko, for example loves to wath Seinfeld, and actually understands the jokes. She has expressed her desire for having a baby and many believe that she would teach that baby sign language as well. when asked \"where do gorillas go when they die?\", she answered that they sleep in a comfortable hole and they never come visit. Something 10x more intelligent than what a Christian might tell you. ;) I am sorry, but for you to claim that humans are the only sentient beings in the universe, just looking at this one of many cases I have provided, is completely false, not to mention fallacious.\n \n \n As to killing cows, I am a vegetarian for a reason - other animals are sentient and deserve to be treated as such - I am disgusted by the slaughter of animals for food. I don't know if I would go so far as a life sentence, but my personal view is that it should be illegal (I don't harbor any illusions that this will actually happen, but they are my views nonetheless). I think that most animals deserve the same respect as humans. Some of the more sentient ones deserve rights close to those of humans (In Spain, I believe, such a case is going on in a court for the recognition of a chimp as a \"person\" in the case of protection of image, protection from testing on them, etc.)",

   "[QUOTE=Archangel;263153]The gay agenda is the agenda by the combined gay/lesbian/bi/transexual community to force their same sex practices to be accepted by the World at large as normal and healthy for the individuals who practice them and the Societies they live within.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n There is no agenda per say. It is an effort to end ignorance and discrimination towards homosexuality. It's a tough job when there are those who worship and live to glorify a god who condones and approves the ignorance you all suffer from. \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n The gay lifestyle is the practice of the unnatural sexual acts of men with men and women with women which goes against the Laws of God as outlined in the bible.\n \n \n Gaetano:\n Could you please tell me what your bible has to do with other people's lives?\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Spiritual Laws are universal gaetano.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The only one that I can think of which could be considered universal and beneficial as well, is \"live and let live.\" Which is the one you seem to have no concept of.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n They affect all of us whether we acknowledge them or not, just like gravity does. And they are just as invisible as gravity but real none the less. So how dare you and so many others just declare them irrelevant because they are an inconvenience to you.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n What set of spiritual laws are universal? Let me guess,,,,,yours. I don't consider your laws in reference to homosexuality inconvenient. I consider them part of a book that I do not believe and has not a thing to do with what you perceive to be god. Just because you have turned an ancient text into your reality doesn't make it so. The fact that you have the nerve to judge other people based on your standards amazes me.\n \n \n Archangel:\n And try to understand what motivates the moral traditionalist to exercise their right to oppose what the GLBT community represents. It's our understanding that God judges a Civilization as a whole. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n What you understand is all fine and dandy. What you don't understand is that you live in a country that is not governed by your understanding of what you think god wants. You should be actively harassing Jews, and Hindu's as well.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n the moral degradation of the minority will effect His grace and protection over the whole.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Why don't you start with child abuse, spousal abuse, hunger, disease, ignorance, indifference, rape, murder, theft, etc. When your all done with that you can protest two people of the same sex who happen to care for another. Moral degradation is all yours, for you have no respect for that which you cannot comprehend.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And God didn't necessarily smite the Roman Empire, but by withdrawing His Grace and blessings from them because of their Idolatry, it opened the door for the barbarians to come in and destroy what they had built.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The Roman Empire flourished under the rule of their mythical gods, what are you talking about?\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We understand that just as God has blessed this great Nation, so can He withdraw His grace and we firmly believe He is slowly doing that in response to our moral and spiritual degradation as we turn to other gods that we place over Him in our acceptance of the things of this World which take our eyes off of the good and moral principles this country used to stand for.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Everybody and their brother has some version of how they think the world should be. Grab a number, get in line, and leave people alone. You can have this discussion with your maker when he pulls you from this life. In the meantime, in this life you are to obey the civil laws of this nation and stop bothering other people who are also in accordance with those same laws.\n \n \n Archangel:\n This is just wrong on so many levels that I had to quote it and point that out to you. We are a reflection of our beliefs so if one believes unnatural sex is right and healthy then that belief is reprobate as that which is unnatural is wrong from the scriptural perspective. And again, just because one rejects the spiritual perspective, it doesn't make it no longer exist. It just shows that person is in denial of reality.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The fact that you think that your spiritual perspective is a denial of reality shows a person who is dangerously deluded. Spirituality is just that. Reality is that which does not dissappear if you do not believe in it.",

How does abolishing slavery contradict any other right in the constitution? \n\n Prior to the abolition of slavery, slaves were property and as such slave owners were protected against the taking of their property. After the abolition of slavery, this \"former protected property\" was taken. This is clearly a contradiction. Women's suffrage was clearly a contradiction of prior law. Women went from not being allowed to vote to being allowed to vote. You don't think that represents a contradiction? emoticon_confused \n \n\n Or letting blacks vote? It's adding to the constitution, sure. That's what amendments do. But the fact that legal practices were being changed doesn't support your assertion that amendments contradict each other. The only example you give that actually shows one amendment contradicting another is the one that was designed to do just that; the one that changes the voting age.

Unfortunately for your theory here, that story was a lesson about hospitality, not sexual orientation. The Sodomites are to be found in the churches that condemn gay people. \n \n And I would have thought that a believer would not be so blasphemous as to claim that his god brought about what he hadn't intended. If we're here, and we are, and if god the creator is real, then we're intended.

Atheists just go one god more.\n \n When Christian bigots try to pass laws based solely on their interpretation of their scripture, they offend the spirit of the Constitution, and the intention of the good people who wrote it. This is just an attempt to write religious prejudices into civil law. There is no secular reason to have laws that effectively make gays second class citizens, depriving them and their families of equal protections under the law. Therefore, such laws have no reason to exist, are unconstitutional, and should be abolished, just as the laws prohibiting interracial marriage were abolished.\n \n Even anti-gay religious activists tacitly admit they are unconstitutional, in their effort to pass a constitutional amendment to make them constitutional.

It's the bigots who are trashing it.\n \n \nSo the court didn't usurp the legislature's authority, that's a bad thing? They didn't protect gays right to marriage because there is no such right.

As you are fond of saying, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.

Of the three, the only one I'm against is gay marriage. \n\n \n All this emoticoned, whining kerfuffle over a word? Why? Let me guess... because marriage indicates equality, and you refuse to admit that gays, specifically gay marital partnerships, are equal, just as some people still refuse to admit that blacks or women are equal, or that mixed race marriages should be allowed to happen. Prejudices die hard, we have never thought they don't.\n \n \nWe were speaking about the US. I don't care if China roasts gays on a rotisserie, it doesn't affect the US. By trying to incorporate what happens to gays in other countries, you attempted to use subterfuge in order to overstate your case. I find disengenuous attempts like that to be fair game and will call you on it every time. \n\n \n Bollocks. It's all part of an international social history of anti-gay hatred, which still exists in the US and is used to deny equal rights. You don't have to kill and torture people to oppress them, but even in the US right up to the 1960s, gays were historically subjected to imprisonment, involuntary medical \"treatment\" and even a form of torture euphemistically called electroconvulsive \"therapy\". Some gay children are still put through such \"therapies\" at the demand of their parents. Sodomy laws weren't abolished until Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and many states still carry them on the books.\n \n Of course there's a history of oppression and persecution of gay people in the US, though executions ceased over a hundred years ago, but just as some folk on the radical right think that what the Bush maladministration does to POWs isn't torture, they also like to think that deprivation of human rights isn't persecution -- so long as it doesn't affect them.\n \n \nI've been married for almost 30 years and have 3 adult children.

Of course it's partly about money -- we're tired of subsidising straight marriages while our own are ignored by the government because of religious prejudices. Though you claimed it's only about money, in fact it's all about fairness, equality and security for families. You just don't get it. Tell you what. Why not abolish civil marriage and all its family privileges and benefits for straight people? Then everyone would be equal, too, and those pesky, whiny, gay activists would finally shut the hell up.

It's comments like yours above that alienates those that would be your allies. Your intolerance towards others makes them not feel the least bit sympathetic towards your cause.

One would have thought simply ignoring the topic would suffice to express not caring -- if you really didn't care.

Either everyone gets a cookie, or no-one does.\n \n But you know, there are two reasons why the radical right is so keen to get a constitutional amendment now:\n \n (1) They realise current anti-gay laws are unconstitutional, even many of the state constitutional amendments, because they go right against the 14th (and arguably the 1st and 9th) Amendment(s) to the US Constitution.\n \n (2) They further realise that their anti-gay majority is eroding, so this is their last, best hope of maintaining anti-gay bigotry as law, because constitutional amendments are as difficult to rescind as they are to pass, and this one would be particularly difficult, since homophobic Christian churches support it enthusiastically. They are mortally afraid that now a tiny number of states have passed gay unions, it won't be too long before some more progressive legislature goes the whole hog and passes gay marriage to join Massachusetts. Then they'd be beefing about \"activist legislatures\" and demanding the judges restrain them!\n \n If they haven't the votes now to write equal protections for gay Americans out of the Constitution, which is what the marriage amendment is all about, they are even less likely to succeed in the future, though obviously we can't get complacent about it.\n \n I hope the right-wing tide has crested and is receding, and if it has, we probably have George Bush to thank for destroying public support of the GOP.

Polygamy is not a condition, it's not a deep need of any human being so far as I know, it's a socioeconomic and cultural custom.

How disengenuous do you think it is to call someone a homophobe or a Nazi before you know one fact about that person?\n As I've stated many times in the past, I believe very much in fairness. Our laws should reflect our sense of fairness. That's why I believe that gay civil unions should be allowed. All monogomous relationships in the US should be encouraged. We have far too much pain and suffering due to promiscuity practiced by all sexes. So, I see rencouraging monogomous gay unions as a plus for our society. It will help to bring down the spread of STDs, stabilize a segment of the population that could use some stability and bring some good to the country as a whole.\n That said, gay unions don't meet the traditional, nor highly desired goal of perpetuating the species and providing both a male and female role model for their offspring.

   "Most of this twaddle is mere anthropoidal and belligerent breast-beating and needs no response from me. Its vacuity will be obvious to any reader. However, there are a few gross errors that can do with correction:\n \n \nI've already demonstrated, with the facts, that the average gay household has a higher income than hetero households\n\n \n If you are the sort of person who places gullible credence in statistics of dubious provenance that support a position you like, I suppose there is little that contradicts your prejudices that you will not believe. Mere facts or argument will never suffice against devoted but credulous belief.\n \n \nShow me how gays are subsidizing straight marriages.\n\n \n We pay the same taxes you do; you gain over 1000 federal benefits alone that are denied to us. QED. \n \n \nThis should be an economic issue, not a matter of principle.\n\n \n It can't be both? Who knew? Why, pray tell, can't it be both?\n \n \nThat's why I find it amazing that some gays would commit political/economic suicide rather than accept the term civil union instead of marriage.\n\n \n I think you are being overly optimistic. Your side has taken some heavy hits, lately. Not everyone is a homophobe, or opposes equal rights for gay people, and their number is daily growing smaller, because our case is just, no matter how stridently you deny the facts.\n \n \nI'm too old and well-healed to be worried about marriage benefits and privileges. You can have mine. :) \n\n \n Fine. Sign over the social security benefits your \"spouse\" can expect on your death to some needy gay couple. Put your money where your mouth is.\n \n \nI do have three adult children that can benefit from them, so I don't believe that we should end one of the few benefits to encourage monogomous, childbearing/rearing activities in the US.\n\n \n Why don't you be the first ever anti-gay advocate to explain to us how government support of gay marriage undermines government support of straight marriage!\n \n I keep hoping someone will explain this allegedly zero sum game to me, but so far, no anti-gay activist has bothered doing it. Why not be the first.\n \n Explain to us exactly how it is gay marriage undermines straight marriage. Use an extra sheet of paper if you need to.\n \n \nOne thing I don't do is try to stifle debate by calling my opponent a racist, homophobe, Nazi or other inflammatory term with the sole purpose to squelch debate. I'll call someone an a$$hole if need be, but I'll do so without the intent to stop further debate. \n\n \n No you do it to insult people.\n \n \nI believe very much in fairness.\n\n \n Except for gays.\n \n \nOur laws should reflect our sense of fairness. That's why I believe that gay civil unions should be allowed.\n\n \n But civil unions aren't equal. The only reason you support them is because they are second class, and you can hide behind them against accusations of bigotry. Doesn't work.\n \n \nAll monogomous relationships in the US should be encouraged. We have far too much pain and suffering due to promiscuity practiced by all sexes. So, I see rencouraging monogomous gay unions as a plus for our society. It will help to bring down the spread of STDs, stabilize a segment of the population that could use some stability and bring some good to the country as a whole.\n\n \n Then support gay marriage and don't equivocate about so-called \"civil unions\", unless you support them for straights as well.\n \n \nThat said, gay unions don't meet the traditional, nor highly desired goal of perpetuating the species and providing both a male and female role model for their offspring. It simply isn't the same as marriage. Period.\n\n \n Bollocks. If you actually believed that idiocy, you would logically oppose the marriage of childless straight couples, which of course, you never do, because they are, cough, straight. Gay couples raise children and so support \"perpetuating the species\", as if breeding were the summum bonum of human activity.\n \n For you, this whole issue has nothing to do with raising children, which both gay ands straight couples do. It's all about denying equality to gay people. Breeding is just a smokescreen you raise to hide what you actually think.\n \n Gay marriage; straight marriage... they are the same.",

   "You certainly lack any ability to empathize whatsoever. While you say that your father nearly disowned you because you'd found Jesus, you can't see a much harsher correlary for gay people dealing with public disapproval.\n \n For a moment - just for a moment - pretend that you actually have compassion for your fellow man. Try to imagine what it must feel like to be gay in a world with preachers screaming hatred, schoolyard bullies taunting, violent crimes perpretrated, etc. It is not because we found it wrong, but because we were struggling to fit in with what everyone taught us was supposed to be \"normal\" when we did not fit that model. \n \n\n \n I can relate with the gay dilemma perfectly. On multiple levels too. As an Arab in a time of Arab Terrorism. As a Christian by secular humanists like you who's sole agenda in life is to reverse the moral values and traditions that I firmly believe made this Country great. And from rejection, condemnation and persecution by my own Father whom I was very close with prior to accepting Jesus as my Savior. \n \n So I can relate, especially since persecution against Christians is increasing at a steady rate around the World. interestingly, at a rate equal to the collapse of humanities moral standards. Isn't that an interesting trade off ? Why is it you're so blind to the constant attacks from your side about my beliefs ? Why is it you're not sensitive to the dedicated threats by your side to totally undo the values and traditions that the other 95% of the American population lives by ?\n \n I admit that tunnel vision exists, but not that it's mine alone.\n \n \nPersonally, I have no problem with someone saying it in terms of a 'heterosexual lifestyle'. The word certainly doesn't bother me like it does you. I never have understood why the word is supposed to be so bad. When 'lifestyle' is used in this context, it simply means the behavior of forming romantic relationships.\n\n \n You're absolutely right jyoshu. The reason why Matthew rejects being gay as a lifestyle is because only if they can prove it's inherent within their genetic make up can they also demand equal rights based on their gayness because they can't help it then, just as we can't help being heteros.

Homosexuals may have a predilection towards being attracted to the same sex but far to many of them have married women and been in long lasting relationships with them to insist the thought of being with a woman disgusts them as the thought of being with a man disgusts me.\n\n \n Well, maybe most gays are more enlightened and less judgmental than you. Ever thought of that? Also, owing to the social pressures created by religiously inspired homophobia, many gay people have felt obliged to pretend they are straight, and that means putting on a heterosexual performance to satisfy family and friends, even to the point of marriage and breeding. Also, it's possible that more people are bisexual than usually admit it, and can have a good sexual relationship with people of either sex, depending on their partner. A gay man might find a woman in a thousand he feels comfortable with, though in 99%+ of cases he'd get on better with men. Lesbians tend to be more bisexual, anyway.\n \n So on the whole, it is not very surprising that a lot of gay men have had some heterosexual experience, perhaps especially in youth when they are still trying to deal with the fact that they are gay in a heterosexist society where everyone is expected to be straight or get pounded on. Neither is it surprising that once a gay man forms a relationship with a woman, he's likely to try to stick to it out of a sense of caring responsibility, fear, or even a kind of love, even though, like many closeted, married gay men, he's likely to have flings on the side whenever opportunity presents itself. Is that the healthiest of relationships? I doubt it, but too many find themselves forced into it through social obligations and pressures.\n \n The important point is not to judge people on whom they fall in love with and marry. Love and mutual responsibility is to be honoured, whether it is male-female, male-male or female-female, and it will be strongest when the partners are compatible. I have to condemn any religion that fails to live up to this.",

The level of your hypocricy is mind boggling and the fact that you don't even recognize it in yourself just shows how very blind you are to a fair and balanced perspective on life.\n\n \n (1) I have referred to breeding, but I've never called anyone a breeder, as that would reduce them to a single function, which is unfair. In contrast, it is people dying for an excuse to ban gay marriage who eagerly embrace the idea that the sole purpose of marriage is procreation, or breeding. They are the ones who degrade marriage and breeding both, by talking as if making babies were our sole purpose in life and marriage.\n \n (2) I certainly have no disdain for heterosexuals. I do have disdain for heterosexists, those who think heterosexuals are better than gay people. They are no better than racists, in my view, just another variety of bigot.\n \n (3) Christianists are what they do, and that is to advocate that their version of Christianity should be the foundation of civil law that anyone, Christian or otherwise, who does not agree with their scriptural opinions, should nevertheless be compelled to obey on pain of punishment. They have come to worship their religion more than their god, and are as theocratic as Islamists.

This is the only way I know how to read this mantra. If you don't understand this, you have a flawed understanding of us, and even, I suspect, what it means to be human.

Not everyone, gay or straight, is cut out for celibacy, nor do I think that's a particularly worthy goal in itself. The only fulfilling sex gay people can have is with each other, not with the opposite sex. And denying people sex throughout their lives is not an expression of love, but of control.\n \n \nBut we're not talking about \"condemning\" you, at all.\n\n \n Granted, you personally are not. But the folk who chant the \"love the sinner, hate the sin\" mantra... that's exactly what they are doing. \n \n \nThe problem with that view is that it basically means someone can't disagree morally with an action of yours (or anyones) without disapproval of the person. That's just not true.\n\n \n OK, it is not universally true, but it's true in this case. They have a right to their opinion, but I have a right to mine. If they condemn my love, I condemn their hate.\n \n \n Actions can be disagreed with without value judgment being made on the person. I don't see why the issue of homosexual relations should be the only issue debated in society where people can't be allowed to disagree.\n\n \n Again, if you genuinely think this and aren't playing devil's advocate, I have to conclude you don't understand how personally and deeply this is felt. The issue of the legitimacy of gay love isn't just another issue like smoking in public places, the welfare state or gun control that reasonable people can reasonably disagree about. It goes to the very center of people's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There are few more fundamental human emotions than love and desire for sexual intimacy with a lover. It's right up there with the need to breath, drink and eat.\n \n You will never persuade me that being told not to have gay sex under any circumstances is no more of a moral and emotional burden than being told not to litter or say rude words in public. That sort of comparison is breathtaking in its failure to plumb human emotions. To tell a gay person gay sex is \"sinful\" is like condemning that person for breathing, and say living for you is OK so long as you don't draw breath... ever.\n \n So no, I absolutely do not accept that this is something reasonable people can reasonably disagree on. Religion is not rational, after all, so no argument derived solely from it can be considered reasonable. My human rights are not up for debate, and I will not accept or even consider any other position as legitimately reasonable.",

   "6.\n Gay Lifestyle in South Africa...\n\n \n I'm puzzled why it matters to you that some websites use this silly phrase \"gay lifestyle\". Gay people as a rule don't use it, because they know that a sexual orientation is not a lifestyle all by itself. For example, is Ohioprof bringing up an adopted daughter living the same \"gay lifestyle\" as some gym rat or disco bunny, and is the disco bunny living the same \"gay lifestyle\" as two gay people who have spent 50 faithful years of their lives together in a suburban marriage, and is that the same \"gay lifestyle\" of a Catholic priest who spends his life chasing altar boys?\n \n There's no such thing as \"the gay lifestyle\", but the reason Christian homophobes love this phrase, and most gays avoid it, is because it gives the false impression that being gay is something frivolous one can choose, as one chooses hobbies or fashions to wear. It gives the false impression it's not a deep-seated, integral part of gay people's psyches, and worse, that it's something negative but correctable, if only gay people would accept Jesus and try. \n \n The trouble is, while one can change a lifestyle, one can't change one's sexual orientation or who one is in love with by mere choice. That's what many religious anti-gay bigots can't accept, and the rest of them, such as Herr Ratzinger and the Vatican crew, think that although gays can't change, they should learn to be as miserably celibate as they are.",

Since you're clearly not that, you don't serve yourself well by using it.\n \n Think of it like this: many people erroneously consider Jews responsible for the death of Christ.

But regarding disagreement over gay relationships as behavior, I think the whole idea of whether or not it's \"reasonable\" is somewhat beside the point. For instance, it may not be \"reasonable\" (that is, having to do with reason) to disagree with someone who says there's no such thing as God. Reasonableness and whether or not disagreement is benign are two very different concepts. In fact, we weren't really even discussing the reasonableness of the disagreement until you brought that into the picture here; the issue I'm concerned with is just the idea that someone can't disagree with the behavior of a person without it being taken as an attack on the person. If there anything that's not reasonable, it's that very idea. You seem to think that the issue of gay relations is somehow different from every other society debate out there, and that it should somehow be off-limits to disagreement. You are certainly entitled to your opinion on that, but it's a very unrealistic opinion. I think on most any issue, if the issue affects a person more than others, then naturally that person is going to take it more personally, as you are doing here. The abortion debate is like that as well--if someone has had an abortion they might be more passionate about it and believe that even disagreement on the issue is wrong. Pro-choicers shouldn't be expected to not be able to disagree with pro-lifers just because those pro-lifers feel that the issue personally affects them. The flipside is true as well. And I'm sure you truly feel it as an affront when someone disagrees with the actions of gay people--IOW I have no doubt that you are being sincere here. But the reality is, people can and do disagree without intent of oppression and being an affront to the person; the ball is ultimately in your court as to how you're going to take that disagreement. Whether it is taken personally and as an affront is ultimately up to you; just like it is ultimately up to the pro-lifer with a personal stake in the issue to not take as an attack the disagreement put forth by a pro-choicer. You aren't going to turn off the debate and end it--it NEEDS to be debated, if anything so you can get the rights you need. The biggest problem I have with your idea that disagreement on gay relations should be of-limits is that it squashes discussion and debate. It drives out the market place of ideas and discourse. The debate in society on homosexual-issues is not something you should want put down--it is an opportunity to not only defend your views, but win people over in some cases. Why not welcome it as a chance to refute those arguments out there that you don't like? You seem quite capable a debater.",

   "But that's just it--I'm not talking about condemning something \"basic and integral to their personality.\" \n\n \n Yes, I know you, personally, don't do this. I am talking about those who do.\n \n \nI'm not arguing it's a lifestyle; JP is arguing about that, not me. But regarding disagreement over gay relationships as behavior, I think the whole idea of whether or not it's \"reasonable\" is somewhat beside the point.

In fact, we weren't really even discussing the reasonableness of the disagreement until you brought that into the picture here; the issue I'm concerned with is just the idea that someone can't disagree with the behavior of a person without it being taken as an attack on the person.\n\n \n Well, if someone decides to \"disagree with\" my marriage to my husband, how else do you expect me to take it except as a hostile attack on me? It's very personal, and to pretend it isn't is, as someone else pointed out, to trivialise gay relationships.\n \n \nIf there anything that's not reasonable, it's that very idea. You seem to think that the issue of gay relations is somehow different from every other society debate out there, and that it should somehow be off-limits to disagreement.\n\n \n Yes, I certainly do. As I said earlier, my fundamental human rights wth respect to choosing a life partner are not up for debate by others. I regard any such debate as an attack against them and on me, personally, and therefore must defend against such an attack. I marvel that you can't seem to grasp how personal such an attack is!\n \n \nYou are certainly entitled to your opinion on that, but it's a very unrealistic opinion. I think on most any issue, if the issue affects a person more than others, then naturally that person is going to take it more personally, as you are doing here.\n\n \n Look. Who else does my gay marriage affect except me, my partner, and our families and friends? Who else has any business having an opinion about it? Of course I take it personally. If I didn't, I wouldn't be human. The attacks are intended personally, after all.\n \n \nI'm sure you truly feel it as an affront when someone disagrees with the actions of gay people--IOW I have no doubt that you are being sincere here. But the reality is, people can and do disagree without intent of oppression and being an affront to the person; the ball is ultimately in your court as to how you're going to take that disagreement.\n\n \n The reality is I am going to take personal criticism personally. You can't \"disagree\" with homosexuality in the abstract and expect gay people to pretend they don't mind -- it's an intensely personal issue for gay people. It is an affront to me, and no amount of repetition that it shouldn't be is going to change the fact that it is. That's reality, mate. Even if the affront is allegedly unintentional, when it is pointed out to the attacker that it is an affront, repetition of the attack makes it personal.\n \n Your argument makes as much sense as asking a black person not to mind critical remarks about the colour of his skin. It's that personal, sorry.\n \n \nYou aren't going to turn off the debate and end it--it NEEDS to be debated, if anything so you can get the rights you need.\n\n \n My long term intent is to make the subject taboo for debate -- not here and now, obviously, but as society progresses toward acceptance. It shouldn't be a debatable issue at all, and that's the principle I argue. \n \n \nThe biggest problem I have with your idea that disagreement on gay relations should be of-limits is that it squashes discussion and debate.\n\n \n Absolutely. That is the ultimate goal, to put the rights of gay people beyond the possibility of arguing about them. Arguing about them now is necessary to get there, but that is the goal.\n \n \n It drives out the market place of ideas and discourse. The debate in society on homosexual-issues is not something you should want put down--it is an opportunity to not only defend your views, but win people over in some cases. Why not welcome it as a chance to refute those arguments out there that you don't like? You seem quite capable a debater.\n\n \n I want the debate to be a thing of the past. I want people who argue against gay rights to be too ashamed of their views to voice them openly. This is why I am debating now. I can't shut down debate on human rights by edict, nor do i want to, but I can argue that there should be no debate because human rights for gay people are accepted as fundamental by most people, and I can hope to change the climate of opinion to make such debate so embarrassing to people who still hate gays they won't speak in public because all mouths will be against them.\n \n I don't eschew debate today and have no intention of shutting anything or anyone down on this forum; but I argue my positions so those who came after me won't have this same, personal fight for their very right to exist and live free.",

   " Tell me this Jake, just out of curiosity. If being homosexual is so natural, normal and right, and one has had a lifetime getting used to being gay, Why would one feel intimidated or hesitant for even a minute to shout it to the World that they are gay ? \n\n First of all, I can't believe you are so naive as to have to ask this question.\n \n Just look at the hate and bigotry spewed at gays by the many \"christians\" in this country, look at the hate crimes, the murders of gay people (and straight people) because \"they acted gay\", and then ask again why someone would feel intimidated or hesitant to announce that they are gay. The only thin unnatural around here is the hate and bigotry of the \"christians\" in this country who do unspeakable things to gays.\n \n \n \n When I first accepted Jesus, my dad threatened to disown me. And with it a sizable inheritance. But I so knew of what I had received in Christ, I told him that if his love for me was so conditional that he must determine the path my life takes then he can disown me but I'll not reject Christ and His eternal love for a business in this world. \n\n So? when I first became an atheist, my parents wouldn't even speak to me. Over time this has changed, and they accept me for who I am and what I believe, and I will not reject my beliefs.\n \n \n \n I guess my question is, why does it take years of being gay, feeling guilty and wrong before someone is finally beaten down enough to finally accept what they are ? The day after getting saved I came out to my dad, and if you knew him, he would have preferred it if I was gay than a Christian. But I knew I was right 30+ years ago, and 30+ years later, I still know I received the eternal truth so no regrets here.\n\n \n \n As to taking years of feeling guilty, etc., one just has to look at the hate and prejudice preached by many of the \"christians\" of today against gays, and think of children being raised in such oppressive and hateful environments (including society itself), and you will have your answer.",

My het parents were aweful parents.... they manage do produce a handful of offspring. All except me and the one that commited suicide are straight. Being het does not make you a good stable parent.

But the argument itself is not. So there. Now you can say you've seen one, after all your years of arguing the issue, as you claim.\n \n \nIt's all very well to claim that being anti-gay is not being bigoted, but I'd like to see an argument that supports this peculiar view, beyond a bland assertion that it is so.\n\n \n Ok, look, you really, really need to stop speaking in generalities and vague terms. Define specifically who you're talking about here, and maybe we can get somewhere. We've had whole threads here, and rightly so, about how terms like \"anti-gay people\", \"bigots\", and \"homophobes\" are worthless words for the sake of debate because they are vague in terms of who specifically they are talking about and to what degree. Maybe it would help if you would explain to us exactly what you mean by \"anti-gay\". At what point does a person cross that line from neutrality to being \"anti-gay\"? And in regards to the other word you're throwing around here, you've already indicated you think there are degrees of 'bigotry', only complicating the matter more. I don't think it's too much to ask you to be specific here and lay out exactly who and what you're talking about rather than vague terms. Then maybe we can get somewhere, and maybe you'd have a better chance of getting the proof you're looking for from someone.\n \n \nOh come on. Civil union supporters are fair weather friends, looking for a peaceful life and compromise between human rights and bigotry, and you expect me to bless it?\n\n \n Compromise has nothing to do with it. The reason I'm a civil union supporter is that it's simply the only way to resolve the situation without starting up changing marriage every time a group comes along wanting to change it to fit their claim. From the standpoint of many of us, this is not just about gay marriage. It's about the right of groups to come along and redefine marriage from it's most absolute basic standards anytime they want, no matter what group it is doing it. Whether it's about changing the number of people in a marriage, the male-female make-up of a marriage, the reasonable age of people in a marriage, etc. I'm all about gays having benefits if they need them, and they do. But not by making marriage a change-on-a-whim institution in terms of it's most basic standards. The issue here is really about making the most basic standards of marriage \"redefinable\".\n \n \nNo compromise is possible.\n\n \n From the standpoint that civil unions are a compromise, sure it is possible. But only if we can get past this idea that it's automatically a form of \"bigotry\". Doh! There's one of those vague terms again. (Though as I said, I don't think it's really about compromise anyway.)",

   "Well, isn't this the same sort of argument as praising Mussolini for making the trains run on time?

I'm saying it doesn't cause either. Religion isn't a person (like Mussolini was). It can't make decisions, or have prejudice in it's thinking. It has no thinking.

The vast majority of anti-gay people are religious, and they excuse their bigotry by reference to their scriptures.

Half a loaf is better than no bread, but it still isn't a full loaf. emoticon_confused It's not as though what is being demanded here is some right to a church wedding. Churches are private organisations, and if they wish to institutionalise bigotry in their doctrine and rituals, they have a right to do it, though they do not have any right not to be criticised when they do it. However, that's besides the point -- it's civil marriage that's at issue in this debate. \n \n \nIt's not about being uncomfortable with gay people, it's about being uncomfortable with redefining marriage. And it would be the same no matter what group was trying to do it. That's what you aren't getting here.\n\n \n What I'm getting at here is that this \"redefinition of marriage\" mantra is a smokescreen to conceal something more basic and unpleasant, namely a prejudice against gay people. Wedded gay couples fulfill all the criteria of a straight marriage, except the approval of those straight people who don't particularly like the idea of people of the same sex falling in love.\n \n As for redefinition, marriage in the West has been redefined many times. this would be a fairly minor adjustment, amounting to little more that the extension of equal rights to another group of people, much as what happened when marriage was redefined by the supreme Court to include interr-racial couples.\n \n Presumably, you wouldn't have worried about THAT redefinition of marriage, yet a redefinition it most certainly was. Words and institutions get redefinied and modified all the time. Change is part of life, and often, change is an improvement, as in the legal acceptance of gay marriage.\n \n Why is it you don't get it?\n \n \nYou can call it a marriage all you want. No one is saying you can't do that. But you have an unrealistic world-view if you think gays own the concept of marriage. They don't. You don't have the right to redefine it for humanity.\n\n \n Oh? Now you're being really silly. No-one owns the concept of marriage, not you, not the churches, not the state, and gay marriage can't possibly invalidate marriage for straights, unless they already have some hang-up about gays that makes them want to avoid any club gays are allowed to be members of. Gay marriage doesn't mean that gays want to or could exclude straights from the institution. That's ludicrous!\n \n But you want to keep this straight club exclusively straight. Now why is that?",

   "Try the examples of changing the number of participants or reasonable age of marrying, instead. You belittle these concerns, but they are very real.\n\n \n Tell me, do you have any problem referring to people of some polygamous culture or religious tradition as \"married\"? They may not have a traditional Western-style marriage, but the marriage is as real. Polygomaous marriage has been a common human institution throughout recorded history, if not in every culture. It's accepted in your bible, after all.\n \n Second, age limitations are besides the point, because they pertain to the age at which a child is considered competent enough to give informed legal consent. Further, the age of marriage, even in the West, has varied enormously over time. Even in the US, different states have different ages of consent, with or without parental consent, and so on. Does that mean only the states whose marital laws you personally approve of have \"real\" marriages? \n \n There has never been a single, universally accepted definition of marriage. More, to argue that gay marriage is a slippery slope to accepting that anything goes is more camouflage. There is no slippery slope, as all the other varieties have their own grounds on which to be addressed. Legal acceptance of gay marriage doesn't necessitate acceptance of polygamy, or underage marriage. People who support such ideas can argue for them as separate issues, and trying to treat them as one is nothing more than an attempt to bury gay marriage with baggage in the hope that it can't get off the ground and become a reality.\n \n All these slippery slope arguments were presented when interracial marriage was legalised, but none of them were valid then or now. Gay marriage can be treated on its own merits, as the union of two, consenting adults, which gets rid of the red herrings.\n \n Of course, if you were to argue that the state should get out of the marriage business and leave it to the churches, you would be on far more solid ground than trotting out the ancient slippery slope fallacies. Then equal rights advocates would have to convert churches one by one, but they would have little legal recourse owing to the separation of church and state, unless employers and service providers discriminated against them on that basis. Still, I doubt that argument would find much favour, as straight couples find the protections of the law very convenient, and I can't fault them for that. But the only way gay couples can get the same protections is to recognise their marriages as such without any qualifications. A separate system is not called for.",

You only need to read the teachings of the religion's founder to see that.\n\n \n So you think I should trust your interpretation instead of, say, the pope's or Pat Robertson's? Look, there are precious few \"facts\" in or about the bible that everyone, even atheists, can agree on. What there is much more of, is mythology, stories and advice or laws -- mostly in translated (interpreted) form. Any time someone reads the bible, they must interpret it. They can't just glean \"facts\" from it without interpretation. All linguistic communication is about the interpretation of meaning, and reading the bible is no exception -- there are no facts in it separate from interpretation.\n \n Worse, this sounds remarkably like the \"No True Scotsman...\" fallacy in logic. \"No True Christian would do X, therefore if they do X, they aren't real Christians.\" But what causes them to do X? As often as not, it's the way they read their bible. OK, fine, you and other Christians read it a different way sometimes, but what makes you so sure your way is more valid than theirs? If it's just a matter of interpretation, then who is to judge which interpretation is better than another, and that's one of the problems I find with scriptures regarded as holy. They can mean all things to all men, depending on what they want to read into them, or take out of them.\n \n That's one of the reasons I gave religion up as an impossible job.\n \n \nWell of course, bad religion is bad. But you're the one condemning religion in general here. You should take your own advice about honesty in this case. The problem here is your blanket assertions.\n\n \n I've already said on a number of occasions here that I do not think all religion is all bad, all the time. And I've often said I am not generalising to all Christians. Heaven help us, some Christians are happily gay -- I do not understand how they accomplish this feat and stay Christian, but there it is. Some Christians do not condemn gay couples as sinners. All a matter of interpretation, I suppose. While there may be some posters who issue blanket condemnations of Christianity as an irredeemable evil, if you read my posts, rather than read things into them, you will find that I am not one one of these. I may occasionally generalise through sloppy wording, but I'm always happy to note that there are usually exceptions to most generalisations like these.\n \n I concede that it is my belief that no religion is remotely \"true\" in any historical sense, and that they are all mythologies invented by humans -- by mythology, I do not intend disparagement; mythology has a long, honourable and very useful history as a means of encapsulating certain truths about human nature, and as an attempt to relate humanity to nature. However, I do reject any belief that takes such mythology as real, because that's to confuse mythos with logos, as Karen Armstrong pointed out, and that's a devastating mistake. Also, my personal experience with mainstream Western religion has been pretty negative, so I take a jaundiced view. However, that doesn't mean I oppose human rights for religious believers, just because I think they are profoundly wrong. If they'd be happy to leave me alone, I'd be more than happy to return the favour.",

   "People re-define words all the time. The same has been true of marriage. The definition of one man and one woman of adult age and excluding others, is relatively recent, historically. There is a much longer tradition of the definition including polygamy and child brides. The idea that defining marriage to include gays will cause a slippery slope to polygamy is a logical fallacy. Polygamy has flourished when marriage was defined as straight, but this is not a reason to exclude straight people.\n\n \n I'm not saying marriage has never been redefined. I don't think anyone is saying that. It's just that marriage is, I believe, at the pinnacle of it's progress at this point--includes love, monogamy (not polygamy), and at least attempts to take into account the maturity of participants (age limitations). And is based on gender. These are all progress from your parade of problems such as historical polygamy, historical greek-society homosexuality, and child brides. We've made progress here, and those who don't want marriage redefined simply don't want to lose that progress. That doesn't mean it's perfect--there are still divorces, still people who have affairs, etc. But we've done the best we can on this institution. If we open it up to redefinition to any group that comes along wanting to do so, there's little point in having it be an institution of society. It has to have some boundaries. It has to have some very basic things that even make it marriage if we're to have something called \"marriage\". The issue is not just gay marriage, it's whether marriage should be redefinable at it's most very basic standards.\n \n \nThe Bible is only condemning showing sexual affection for other men, not gay men? That's saying its okay to be different, and it's not okay to demonstrate that difference. How do you explain the rest of the verse, which says the men themselves are to be put to death? That goes beyond attacking the behaviour or actions, it's attacking the person.\n\n \n I think you are spot on in saying the verse really simply means it's not ok for men to lie with men--it doesn't specify \"gay\" men (but then as has been pointed out here before, they didn't have words for that). They viewed the issue in terms of the behavior. And no, just because there was punishment involved doesn't mean it was any more \"personal\".",

   "Tell me, do you have any problem referring to people of some polygamous culture or religious tradition as \"married\"? They may not have a traditional Western-style marriage, but the marriage is as real. Polygomaous marriage has been a common human institution throughout recorded history, if not in every culture. It's accepted in your bible, after all.\n\n \n It was a form of marriage more common long ago. Today, I wouldn't call it a marriage in the sense that people think of marriage today.\n \n \nSecond, age limitations are besides the point, because they pertain to the age at which a child is considered competent enough to give informed legal consent. Further, the age of marriage, even in the West, has varied enormously over time.\n \n \n Why the heck is that beside the point? It is very much the point of the very basic standards of marriage. We're simply talking about \"old enough to be married.\" You see what this really touches on is pederasty and polygamy. Being able to marry an 8-year old would essentially be legalized polygamy. And so marriage age minimums are too an important part of those very basic standards for marriage these days.\n \n \nThere has never been a single, universally accepted definition of marriage.\n\n \n This is beside the point. What we're really talking about here is the fact that modern marriage has some very basic standards--some of them you clearly agree with. I'm not claiming (nor has anyone here) that there is a universal definition of marriage. Naturally there are going to be some variations here and there. But there are some standards that ARE universal, at least in terms of modern, progressed marriage. The whole \"gay marriage debate\" is really a debate about changing those standards, and making them changeable. We aren't talking about peripheral variations like cultures in Africa having parents more involved, or the Ethiopian go-between concept. \n \n \nMore, to argue that gay marriage is a slippery slope to accepting that anything goes is more camouflage.\n\n \n No, not a slippery-slope. No one is arguing gay marriage will LEAD to something else. What we're talking about is the fact this is a much broader debate than just gay marriage. It is a debate about marriage, and whether it should be open to change any time someone wants to come along and do so. That's not slippery-slope.\n \n \n \nOf course, if you were to argue that the state should get out of the marriage business and leave it to the churches, you would be on far more solid ground than trotting out the ancient slippery slope fallacies.\n\n \n Again, no one here but you is talking about slippery slope. But there has been quite a bit of support for the idea you've presented, and others have brought it up here. I too would not oppose it. Frankly, I could care less what you choose to call your union with whoever you're with (male or female). For all I care you can call it a 'marriage', a 'shack-up', a 'love affair', a 'union', whatever. No offense, but it just doesn't matter to me. I just don't like the idea of other groups, behavioral miniorities for instance, coming along and trying to change society's standards for it's institutions. It's not yours alone to do that with. Everyone else should have a say in that too. Nevertheless, I'd be fine with your idea about the govt. getting out of marriage altogether--I ain't married for the govt. benefits. But then the gay marriage movement would lose all it's arguments for legal gay marriage--all those supposedly over-1000-benefits you aren't getting, or whatever. You'd no longer have legal marriage, either. Given that the benefits are so often the argument made over getting marriage for gays, I'd be surprised if gays would go along with this.",

   "Then why do so many Christians quote the bible to justify hatred? Again, if I had a buck for every time I've seen some Christian quoting Leviticus or Paul as they frothed against gay people, I could retire.\n\n \n Depends on how far they take it. If they are quoting the Bible that Leviticus talks about a man lying with a man, then that's not hatred--that's just flat out what it says. The alternative is to have religious people pretend it doesn't, and go against the Bible in terms of their beliefs. Don't you think asking people to go against the Bible in terms of their beliefs is a bit much to ask? Not to mention presumptuous? \n \n Now, on the other hand, if they use to justify hatred (as you said), then you've answered your own question. It's not about what it says, it's about how it's used. It was used to justify hatred that was already there. There's a big difference.\n \n \nSo you think I should trust your interpretation instead of, say, the pope's or Pat Robertson's?\n\n \n What I'm saying is not an 'interpretation.' It's THERE, clear as day. You don't have to interpret Jesus saying \"Love your enemies\". How else are you going to interpret that, Lesz? How else could you possibly interpret Him saying \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"? It's not like those are vague statements. So the real question is, why shouldn't you just read it for what it says? Jesus statements about conduct are not vague, confusing messages, for the most part. So when Robertson or others treat gays badly, they're going against Christianity, not being Christianity. Comprende?\n \n \nLook, there are precious few \"facts\" in or about the bible that everyone, even atheists, can agree on. What there is much more of, is mythology, stories and advice or laws -- mostly in translated (interpreted) form. \n\n \n I don't think the admonition to love one's enemies and bless them that curse you is mythological at all, do you? Whether or not donkeys talk and seas roll back are not relevant to this discussion--the only thing that pertains to this are standards of conduct that come from the Bible (which are pretty universal outside the Bible anyway, for that matter). Whether the stories of the Bible are myth doesn't really matter much for the sake of this discussion.\n \n \nAny time someone reads the bible, they must interpret it. \n\n \n Whatever. Much of it, particularly some of the things pertaining to this subject, require only interpretation on the most mundane level. Like reading the word \"rock\" in the Bible and (slapping one's forehead) saying \"Doh! That much mean a rock! Whoda thunk it?\" Sorry, but there's just not many ways to interpret where it clearly says that God forbids a man to lie with a man, and things that Jesus says like \"love your enemies.\" We aren't exactly discussing systematic trinitarian theology here. The issues in the Bible are pretty clear. Disagree with it all you want, and let the chips fall where they may, but don't try and act as if it doesn't say what it clearly does.\n \n \nWorse, this sounds remarkably like the \"No True Scotsman...\" fallacy in logic.\n\n \n But in this case, it's the real deal. Believe it or not, the Bible really does say to love one's enemies and to show compassion. No fallacy there when pointing out that many Christians don't obey that.",

None of them have anything to do with gay marriage. No-one has any problems about age restrictions on marriage. Pederasty has nothing to do with marriage, and neither does pedophilia.

Gay people point out to you that there is more to marriage than a wedding of sex organs, and all of a sudden you whine about the redefinition of marriage.\n \n Sorry, but married gay couples fulfill all the important aspects of marriage; love commitment, companionship, mutual support, even children.

Here you are claiming that gay people are opening marriage to change any time someone wants to change it, and you are so oblivious in your desire to counter equality for gays, you can't even recognise the traditional fallacy of the slippery slope!\n \n Gay marriage is a very minor change considering all the definitional changes marriage has undergone in Western society over the last couple of hundred years. Why, man, women aren't even regarded as property any more! Didn't you object to that redefinition?\n \n \nAgain, no one here but you is talking about slippery slope.\n\n \n With all due respect, you are, only you haven't the wit to realise it.\n \n \nBut there has been quite a bit of support for the idea you've presented, and others have brought it up here.

I apologise that I had you pegged wrong originally, but your true lights have shone through.\n\n \n I'm not on any side of a fence. I'll call 'em as I see 'em on yours or whatever side you think is across from you. This isn't a football game, for cryin out loud. People have whole range of views on this. There are many things I more than likely agree with you on (adoption rights, couples' benefits, non-discrimination in the workplace and housing, etc.), and some things I don't. That's the way most people are--I dare say there are very, very few people out there who are exactly alike with others in every single one of their views. If you'd stop the partisanship for a moment you might even find something you agree with with many people here, including JP. Common ground ... imagine that.\n \n \nSo, you'd be perfectly fine if you, say, weren't allowed to visit your spouse in the hospital, had the chance of the kids she had being taken away from you by your spouse's family because they \"don't like you\", being taxed huge amounts on anything your spouse left you, and those just for starters?\n\n \n I think you misunderstood what the context was here. The idea many have proposed is the govt. giving such benefits with NO criteria other than maybe two people or something like that, and no longer calling it marriage. The only thing using the marriage term would be people on their own, or churches maybe. It would get govt. out of marriage altogether and would be further separation of church and state.

If you were talking about the government getting out of marriage altogether, and providing all of the current benefits through something like a \"domestic partnership\" or something which allows gays to get these benefits as well as heteros, then we definitely agree on this. \n \n I also agree that it is a good idea, to get further away from the church. Then, the actual ceremony can be called whatever enyone pleases - I know there are several churches who do ceremonies for gays that they call marriage, so then it will allow gays the same rights as heteros while removing a part that anti-gay people can argue over (and let them keep their arguments among their churches).",

   "I'm not saying marriage has never been redefined. I don't think anyone is saying that. It's just that marriage is, I believe, at the pinnacle of it's progress at this point--includes love, monogamy (not polygamy), and at least attempts to take into account the maturity of participants (age limitations). And is based on gender. These are all progress from your parade of problems such as historical polygamy, historical greek-society homosexuality, and child brides. We've made progress here, and those who don't want marriage redefined simply don't want to lose that progress. That doesn't mean it's perfect--there are still divorces, still people who have affairs, etc. But we've done the best we can on this institution. If we open it up to redefinition to any group that comes along wanting to do so, there's little point in having it be an institution of society. It has to have some boundaries. It has to have some very basic things that even make it marriage if we're to have something called \"marriage\". The issue is not just gay marriage, it's whether marriage should be redefinable at it's most very basic standards.\n\n \n The re-definitions you like, you consider to be progress. The things you call social \"problems\", such as polygamy and child brides were not believed to be problems at the time. Now, we see them as problems. Today, an increasingly growing part of society sees the exclusion of gays as a problem. We are not talking about \"any group that comes along\", we are talking about gay people. It would be convenient for you to avoid that fact, given the growing acceptance and inclusion of gays. Inclusion of gays challenges the \"basic standards\" as you call them, of every place where non-heterosexuals were excluded. That's not an argument to continue the exclusion of gays.\n \n \nI think you are spot on in saying the verse really simply means it's not ok for men to lie with men--it doesn't specify \"gay\" men (but then as has been pointed out here before, they didn't have words for that). They viewed the issue in terms of the behavior. And no, just because there was punishment involved doesn't mean it was any more \"personal\".\n\n \n Do you really believe that? That's pretty cold.

   "I sure don't consider them [polygamous] marriages by a progressed standard. Do you?\n\n \n Actually, I do (though not as progressive). It's just that it's a form of marriage that is far too closely associated with the subordination of women to men, which offends my egalitarian values of liberty for all, so I don't support it as I think it's bad social policy. However, it's been a recognised institution throughout human history, and very traditional.\n \n \nShow me anywhere where the Bible truly sanctions polygamy--i.e. says that it's ok and that people should do it. Go ahead, I dare you.\n\n \n Where does the bible condemn polygamy and say monogamy is better? C'mon, it just treats them as the standard social institutions of the day, like slavery. The bible doesn't condemn slavery, either -- in fact, it was used to justify it!\n \n \nYou'd like to approach gay marriage as an island, as if there is no broader issue here. They all have one thing in common--they are all possible changes to the basic standards of marriage.\n \n \n My point was that they can abd should be argued separately, because there is no slippery slope. If we extend legal recognition to a gay marriage does not automatically mean we have to accept the legality of polygamous marriage, pedophilia, or adulterated apple pie. \n \n As for age restrictions, you say:\n \n \nThere are definitely people out there that have problems with that.\n\n \n Well, yes, there probably are a few, and they can make their case, which is not likely to be accepted by most people. But the same arguments do not apply as to gay marriage. A gay marriage is entered into just as a straight marriage, with the unforced consent of two mature, mentally competent adults. Marriage to a child is marriage to a person not considered competent to give consent to such an contract. Of course, different jurisdictions have different ideas as to when a child becomes fit to consent to marriage, but even so, there is no legal symmetry to gay marriage, where both adults are of consenting age. Gay marriage does not oblige us to consider marriage to children.\n \n \nBecause for many of us, that's the crux of the debate.\n\n \n Sex organs are the most important aspect of marriage??? That's the crux? Oy veh! All I can say is I don't share that view of marriage, and frankly, I've known very few married people who think sex organs are the be all and end all of marriage, and they usually don't get married or stay married long. So some may think it vastly important that there be only one penis and one vagina to a marriage... so what? Why is that sufficient reason to deny equal rights to gay people? It's still just an opinion with not much rational basis. \n \n \nSorry, but you can't have an honest discussion about redefining marriage without these issues coming up.\n\n \n They are still slippery slope arguments that are irrelevant, and are used as a smokescreen to disguise the central issue, which is keeping gays second class citizens.\n \n \nI haven't said gays are 'opening' anything! Marriage is already open to change at it's most fundamental levels. If it weren't, we wouldn't be having this discussion.\n\n \n I agree marriage is and has always been open to redefinition. However, what gays require is not a basic redefinition, but an extension of legal rights. There is no sound reason, given the reality of gay relationships, why marriage should be denied to those who want and can benefit from it.\n \n \nLesz, you can call my marriage anything you want.\n\n \n I would never call it anything but a marriage. The issue here is not what it is called, but that it be one institution with gay couples an equal part of it. If you want to call all civil marriages unions instead, that's fine, just so long as the rights, benefits and privileges are equal for gay and straight couples. That's the only issue. Having a two-tier system doesn't address it, it's just a figleaf for bigotry.\n \n \nThis isn't a football game, for cryin out loud. People have whole range of views on this.\n\n \n It certainly isn't a game, but I have an issue with the concept that people's basic rights should be up for a vote by a majority of people who despise them. There is something so not right with that, that they wrote a Constitution to address that problem. All gay people ask is that the same protections be given them that are given to straight people under the same domestic circumstances.\n \n What is there possibly to disagree with about that, except a view that gays somehow don't deserve equal treatment.\n \n \nThere are many things I more than likely agree with you on (adoption rights, couples' benefits, non-discrimination in the workplace and housing, etc.), and some things I don't.\n\n \n I am sorry, but there is no room for compromise on equal rights. We cannot settle for half a loaf or crumbs off the table. There should only be one class of citizenship, and that's first. If people disagree with that, then yes, you could say I have problems with them.\n \n \nThe idea many have proposed is the govt. giving such benefits with NO criteria other than maybe two people or something like that, and no longer calling it marriage. The only thing using the marriage term would be people on their own, or churches maybe. It would get govt. out of marriage altogether and would be further separation of church and state. So this is not a bad idea.\n\n \n I have no problem with that, I just think it's a complete non-flyer of an idea in practice. I could be wrong, but I think there's a better chance of extending legal rights equally than taking govt. out of the marriage business. Marriage has pretty much always been a state-regulated institution, because of the many legal implications of such a contractual relationship, which have to be enforced by the state. If religions want a separate institution, why can't they call it Holy Wedlock or the Sacrament of Matrimony, and leave plain old marriage to the state?",

[the redefinition of marriage]I said nothing about 'sex organs'; that was your deflection.\n \n \nThey are still slippery slope arguments that are irrelevant, and are used as a smokescreen to disguise the central issue, which is keeping gays second class citizens.\n\n \n Well, you can think what you want. I can assure you that if any other group like that came along wanting marriage redefined, they too would meet opposition. It's not about keeping any group a \"second class citizen\" (whatever that means); it's about the fact that many believe marriage should not be easily redefinable.\n \n \nI agree marriage is and has always been open to redefinition. However, what gays require is not a basic redefinition\n\n \n This is where I believe you are wrong. How on earth is changing the male-female requirement not a redefinition something basic???\n \n \nIt certainly isn't a game, but I have an issue with the concept that people's basic rights should be up for a vote by a majority of people who despise them. There is something so not right with that, that they wrote a Constitution to address that problem. All gay people ask is that the same protections be given them that are given to straight people under the same domestic circumstances.\n\n \n The issue of marriage between two men or two women was not even on the radar screen when the constitution was written, so they certainly didn't address the constitution for this. That's because they would never have viewed such a legal marriage as a \"basic right\". In fact, marriage benefits period weren't around much at that time; they gradually developed over time. This is why I think it would be a good idea to leave marriage to peoples' use as a term and to churches, and have the government have separate formal process by which it gives couples/groups/whatever benefits they need (rather than each of these possible groups coming along and trying piggyback off marriage, redefining it every time).\n \n \nI am sorry, but there is no room for compromise on equal rights. \n\n \n Begging the question again, I see. Whether or not what you're after is equal rights is a debate itself.\n \n \nI have no problem with that, I just think it's a complete non-flyer of an idea in practice. I could be wrong, but I think there's a better chance of extending legal rights equally than taking govt. out of the marriage business.\n\n \n I disagree. Every time gays make any sort of inroad in redefining marriage, the public steps up and there's a mini-social revolution of conservatism. This is because, I believe, most people are basically conservative for the most part. There are really not that many people out there on the hard left. You pass a law in Massachusetts, you get conservatives on the SCOTUS. You get more civil unions passed in states, or a rogue mayor handing out illegal certificates, ballot initiatives against gay marriage shoot through the roof all over the country. For every state you get civil unions, you get several that make it clear they don't want it. You're polarizing things, and while it may look like you're making some in-roads, you're closing more doors than you're opening. And even if the public in general were not against you on this (and they are, lets' fact it), the RR is, and it's not going to go away anytime soon. It's influence on legislation is not going to go away. That's just being realistic I think.\n \n \nMarriage has pretty much always been a state-regulated institution, because of the many legal implications of such a contractual relationship, which have to be enforced by the state. If religions want a separate institution, why can't they call it Holy Wedlock or the Sacrament of Matrimony, and leave plain old marriage to the state?\n\n \n Because the term marriage is a general term that predates having legal issues attached to it. It's not just a legal term, it's a basic term in our language. Better to get govt. out of the \"marriage\" business and leave that to the ceremonial aspect of a union.\n \n \nGay people would agree with you it's wrong to punish gay relationships, whether they are casual or committed. Emancipated gay people would never agree that they are in and of themselves \"sinful\" or requiring forgiveness. We do not need your forgiveness or god's\n\n \n So? Whether you feel you need it doesn't have any bearing whether or not people have a forgiving spirit toward you, or at least it shouldn't.",

   "In fact, the examples it puts forth to follow in terms of marriage tend to be monogamous relationships. The polygamous ones in the Bible tended to have problems (e.g. David and his adultery).\n\n \n Actually, polygamous relationships aren't adulterous. There's nothing in the bible to support monogamy over polygamy, however. Still, on the whole, I don't see much to favour polygamy, but that isn't a moral judgement, just a pragmatic one.\n \n \nBut you see, you're just putting your own set of qualifiers for marriage there. You named 5 separate standards there: consent, two, mature, mentally competent, and adult. Already I can see problems with your standards. The mentally disabled can and do sometimes marry, but with your standards they can't. And maturity? C'mon. Immaturity isn't any sort of legal reason to prevent marriage.\n\n \n For heavens sakes, you are being totally disingenuous here. These are the basic standards used to decide whether a marriage is legitimate or not. And no, mentally incompetent people are not allowed to marry without permission from a guardian. Mentally disabled is not, so far as I know, the same as mentally incompetent to make a decision about marriage. That's up to doctors and courts to decide when necessary, not anti-gay crusaders.\n \n As for maturity, if you are making an argument that 5-year olds are mature enough to make such decisions, should I be reporting you to the police? Your excuses here aren't even reasonable, they're desperate.\n \n \nThe broader issue here is that all this points to marriage basic standards being redefined.\n\n \n Only with respect to your juvenile requirement for one penis and one vagina, which is all your whining boils down to. All the other requirements are unchanged.\n \n \nAgain, the issue ultimately whether marriage is going to be a malleable issue in terms of its most basic standards. And, who gets to change it for everybody.\n\n \n There you go again with the slippery slope argument. That silliness has been disposed of.\n \n \n\n No, please don't be intentionally disingenuous.\n\n \n I leave all disingenuity to you, you seem expert. You do seem extraordinarily concerned that a marriage should include only one penis and one vagina.\n \n \nWell, you can think what you want. I can assure you that if any other group like that came along wanting marriage redefined, they too would meet opposition. It's not about keeping any group a \"second class citizen\" (whatever that means); it's about the fact that many believe marriage should not be easily redefinable.\n\n \n I have no doubt you could assure me of that. But it is all about keeping gays second class citizens, whatever your protestations to the contrary. So far as what you write is concerned, your sole interest appears to be upholding heterosexual superiority.\n \n \nThis is where I believe you are wrong. How on earth is changing the male-female requirement not a redefinition something basic???\n\n \n It's only basic to someone who thinks heterosexuals have marriages, while gays are shacking up. Sorry, but your case, such as it is, boils down to asserting the superiority of a relationship between a penis and vagina over any other combination of sexual organs. I don't know why you are so obsessed by sexual organs in a marriage, and who has what, if any, but the really important aspects of marriage seem to escape you.\n \n \nThe issue of marriage between two men or two women was not even on the radar screen when the constitution was written, so they certainly didn't address the constitution for this. That's because they would never have viewed such a legal marriage as a \"basic right\".\n\n \n So what? They never envisaged votes for women or equal rights for blacks as a basic right, either. The point you keep evading is the constitutional rrequirement for equal treatment under the law, which gays are not getting.\n \n \nWhether or not what you're after is equal rights is a debate itself.\n\n \n More disingenuity from an anti-gay activist. If you can deny that, it is no wonder you spread smokescreens all over the place. You just don't really support equal rights for gay people. You are just too embarrassed to honestly admit you're anti-gay.\n \n \nEvery time gays make any sort of inroad in redefining marriage, the public steps up and there's a mini-social revolution of conservatism.\n\n \n And every time they lose more ground, because they reveal themselves to be bigots, so much that even they can't always deny it the way you deny it. nevertheless, your side is losing.\n \n \nThis is because, I believe, most people are basically conservative for the most part.\n\n \n perhaps, but they mostly aren't stupid, either, and they recognise unfairness and prejudice even when they don't like to admit it. Consequently, as reactionaries die off, the are replaced by people who have moved further along in the direction of equal rights. You are better than what went before, and those who come after will be even more accepting of equal rights.\n \n \nThere are really not that many people out there on the hard left.\n\n \n Oh for heaven's sakes... some of the biggest homophobes were on the hard left. Gay rights aren't a left vs. right issue. Gay marriage is a conservative value. I don't know what your problem with gay people is, but it's not because you're a conservative while gays are progressives. I suspect your problem is purely religious. Oh gag me.\n \n \nYou pass a law in Massachusetts, you get conservatives on the SCOTUS.\n\n \n Actually, what we get is a GOP putting more religious fascists on the court, because they think they are beholden to religious fascists to get them elected. It hasn't anything to do with Massachusetts. That's nothing to do with conservative values... I suspect you wouldn't know a conservative value from a hole in the ground. Many conservatives from Barry Goldwater on -- you have heard of him, I suppose? -- favour equal rights for gay people, because they don't think government should be dictating anyone's morals. Obviously, your mileage varies there. You think government should impose your morals on people like me, so you can feel more virtuous. Forget it.\n \n Reality is, you people are losing, and you are ticked off because of it. Sorry, but homophobia deserves to expire with the dinos... even your fairly mild sort. You may support some rights for gay people, but as long as you don't support equality, you remain part of the problem. Since we can't convince you, we have to wait until you no longer matter, and have been replaced by the next generation who don't have your religious hang-ups about gays.",

As for sides, if you remember it was Pat Buchanan who declared the Culture War against all sorts of progressive notions, including equality for gay citizens, during the first Bush's nomination at the GOP convention.

The GOP is no longer the party of Goldwater, and I am not sure it ever was, even in Goldwater's day. However, good luck with any campaign to get government out of marriage -- whatever they call it.

This should not be imposed on our lives.\n\n \n I completely agree with that, Jake. I don't think that marrying under age children is a good idea, nor do I think much of polygamy in a would-be egalitarian society. The argument for gay marriage is stand-alone, based on the existing similarities between real gay and straight families, with or without children. It's only if gay relationships were emotionally and economically significantly different from straight ones that one could really argue that gays need marriage less than straights. (Of course, not every gay or straight couple is going to want to get married, but that's no reason to deny marriage to any who do, if government is to regulate marriage at all.)\n \n Every reason that's been trotted out to deny marriage to gays also applies to some proportion of straight married couples, and these are the most common: not having children; not being physically able to have each other's children; and not raising children related by blood. Others include alleged promiscuity, lack of commitment, etc., which owe more to stereotypes than to reality. There are plenty of straight couples in similar circumstances, but I've never yet heard any anti-gay activist complaining their marriages should be annulled. No, their focus is on the sex of the partners, i.e. what's between their legs and ears, not on the functionality of the relationship.\n \n Then, of course, there's the argument that marriage should be left to churches, without any government regulation whatever. Frankly, that's a non-starter. First, it's completely untraditional, but much more important, it removes protections from partners, minors and families. If govt. were to get out of the marriage business, it would have to get into the domestic partnership or civil union business, instead, or individuals really would suffer.\n \n This might sound like a battle over the word marriage, whether the copyright should belong to church or state, but in fact, it's irrelevant -- most of the people who oppose gay marriage, mostly for purely religious reasons, also oppose gay civil unions or gay anything else. They do not want the govt. to recognise ANY intimate gay relationship as equivalent to theirs. So it doesn't really matter to them what it's called. There are some people in the middle who will accept civil unions so long as they are seen to be inferior to marriages, but will not accept full and equal marriage. This is probably a transitional state, because it isn't logically coherent, except for those who think their religion should dictate the terms of marriage, and not the secular state.\n \n If the state -- and that means also the federal government -- were to replace marriage with civil unions for all, that would solve the problem, but I just don't see any support for that, partly because it wouldn't address the concerns of religious bigots, and in large part because most people are wedded to the word. They don't really want to go around describing themselves as \"domestically partnered\" or \"civilly unioned\" (would a divorce be an \"uncivil disunion\"?) -- they are just ugly phrases.",

   "So, you have proof that animals are able to look into the future and act accordingly? Part of perceiving is being able to look at possible future events. What proof do you have that animals have that capacity?\n\n \n There have been plenty of studies on various species indicating that many animals can plan ahead and forecast the consequences of any planned actions. This has been particularly evident in observations of wild chimps such as those begun by Jane Goodall. For example, chimps that go termiting make the tools they'll need well ahead of time, and other chimps can learn from them. In fact, usually the materials they need for termiting are found in one place, the termite nests in another, and so chimps have to figure out where to go to make their tools before they actually go to the nest. They are pretty shrewd animals, not mere Skinnerian machines. I could go on with example after example of this kind.\n \n For behaviour of this sort of complexity, it seems that self-consciousness is needed. Many social animals, including chimps, elephants and dolphins, are able to recognise themselves in a mirror -- not all species seem able to do this, but it had once been thought that only humans could. The notion of self-conscious, thinking animals is now completely uncontroversial in post-Skinnerian behavioural biology. Obviously, they don't take these traits nearly as far as humans do, but the point it that these talents were once thought to be uniquely human, but know it is known they are not. Humans have developed them much further, that's all.\n \n \nOn the most simplistic level, what animal, capable of sawing off a branch would know that doing so while sitting on it would cause their death, for instance?\n\n \n I don't know whether animals know about personal death in the same way we do, although I can't see that they would need to to be self-aware -- one can be aware one exists without being aware of one's possible or even imminent death. Even human children have to learn about personal death. However, some species such as elephants and chimps do seem to exhibit behaviour in response to the death of a companion or relative that when observed in humans would be classified as mourning or remembering. They exhibit similar behavioural changes, such as watching over the body for a while, or becoming depressed or agitated. They do know there is a difference between a live or dead animal.\n \n \nJust because my morals are based on my Christian upbringing doesn't mean that I'm incapable of making my own decisions about issues. You're mistaken if you think that all people brought up as Christians think monolithically.\n\n \n Well, oddly enough I am aware that Christians aren't all thoughtless automatons following their priests and pastors without question. However, evolutionary psychologists will tell you that many of the morals you seem to think are specifically Christian are, in fact, common to all cultures, religious or not. They are essentially the behavioural traits necessary for the human species to be as intensely social as it is, more so than any except, perhaps, the eusocial animals, and certainly more social than any other of the apes.\n \n It's an interesting question of how cultural nurture reinforces innate moral tendencies, but the presence of so many commonalities irrespective of religious or other upbringing does suggest there is a moral foundation to people that is evolved and innate, and not merely learned. I.e. it is possible that humans are more inclined to learn certain moral behaviours compatible with innate moral tendencies than others, though they are not rigidly programmed biologically. They aren't blank slates on which any moral system can be imposed, but neither are they programmed inflexibly. Consequently, sound nurture is essential to developing socially responsible moral behaviour as well, the evolved foundation being only a foundation and not the whole edifice, but it doesn't have to be Christian. Many other alternatives seem to work just as well, and I can't think of any trait (in terms of moral behaviour, as opposed to theological doctrine or ritual practice) that is uniquely Christian. All cultures value honesty and penalise deception; all condemn murder; all respect personal property and punish theft; all value and reward people who behave selflessly or heroically, and so on. These all seem to be pretty basic traits necessary for a civilised society.",

   "JPSartre12\n \n In case you get the wrong end of the stick, I am not critical of all Christians; I do not attack Christianity in general; and I do not claim Christianity is the worst of all religions. I am an ex-Christian, specifically ex-RC, after all. Most people I've known are Christians, and I do not suffer fools gladly, so I do not asume that all Christians are fools. Christianists, however, are a different matter. \n \n Neither do I claim that the biological perspective on the evolution of human morality and consciousness I posted above represents the monolithic views of all biologists. However, it is a fairly common view, at present, and it is backed by empirical evidence from the observation of animal behaviour in captivity and in the wild.\n \n Humans are animals, we evolved from other animals, and we share many instincts with animals. We also are a unique species, as is every animal species, only our uniqueness comes from the evolution of our brains. Consequently, our consciousness and mental abilities are more developed than that of any other animal, so far as we can tell, which isn't always that far.\n \n At any rate, given what we now know as biologists of cetaceans (whales and dolphins), anthropoids (ourselves, chimps and gorillas), and some other species including some birds, I do not think it is reasonable to assume that sentience -- self-awareness, consciousness, or the ability to reason, plan and empathise with others -- is a uniquely human trait.

But one must have a consciousness of their eternal nature in order to appreciate that. The Natural Man has no such awareness, nor are they spiritually aware so they live for today as if this is all life offers when it is only the precurser to our life with the God who made us for fellowship with Himself.

Before you can even claim they are learning you must determine how long this practice has existed. Surely you'll agree that if it was a million years ago then they haven't learned anything but simply inherited a foraging technique. If the first one did it 40 years ago then maybe we're onto something. \n \n But if that's the case then why is the practice of chimps using sticks to attract ants a wide spread practice ? Doesn't that imply an instinctual practice rather than a learned one ? They can't communicate over long distances after all.\n \n To have actually learned would mean that they have now learned to use bait for example, to attract hundreds of ants to the surface at once so they can then capture them alive and feed their whole family and not just themselves with the few that cling to the stick.

Or could it have been a million years ago ?\n\n \n Very good question. I don't know when the capacity of chimps to use tools and plan ahead evolved. I do know that it is a cultural habit, however, because not all chimp troupes practice termiting, though they can all learn it.\n \n \nBefore you can even claim they are learning you must determine how long this practice has existed.\n\n \n Well, they certainly weren't born knowing how to termite, though they were born with some innate ability to learn how to use tools. All mammals have to learn how to be the animal they are, to some extent, and they learn in part by imitation, and in part by practice of innate skills. They aren't born perfectly able to do what do. Surely you've read about cats being taught how to hunt and chase their prey by their mothers?\n \n \nSurely you'll agree that if it was a million years ago then they haven't learned anything but simply inherited a foraging technique. If the first one did it 40 years ago then maybe we're onto something.\n\n \n I wouldn't agree with that at all. You may have heard of the Hundredth Monkey phenomenon? Well, the myth is a load of bollocks, but the underlying story is true. There are troupes of macaques in Japan that have been studied by researchers for decades. At one point, in order to facilitate observation, the researchers started feeding the macaques with sweet potatoes. The monkeys ate them, but at some point that was never documented, one of them began to wash his or her potatoes in the sea to get the sand off. Gradually, this behaviour spread by learning, but not all macaques picked it up. Some learned it, others did not. They certainly didn't inherit an instinct to wash sweet potatoes!\n \n Animals do have a very well documented capacity to learn, Archie, and I don't know why you refuse to credit their intelligence.\n \n \nBut if that's the case then why is the practice of chimps using sticks to attract ants a wide spread practice ? Doesn't that imply an instinctual practice rather than a learned one ? They can't communicate over long distances after all.\n\n \n It isn't a widespread practice at all, because not all chimp troupes use it. It's culturally transmitted, because chimps have been observed in the process of learning and practicing it. Not all chimp troupes practice this feeding technique, even when they have termites available.\n \n \nTo have actually learned would mean that they have now learned to use bait for example, to attract hundreds of ants to the surface at once so they can then capture them alive and feed their whole family and not just themselves with the few that cling to the stick. To learn means to improve and change over generations lesz, and you know that. But in order to defend your evolutionary doctrine you must ignore these common sense questions that science would normally require to determine actual learning by any species.\n\n \n They aren't being ignored. They are evidence -- and they aren't unique -- of cultural transmission of information among chimps. And termiting doesn't use bait. They just use the instinct of termites to seize hold of any foreign thing that enters the nest, such as a termiting twig. It's not even a major source of dietary protein for them, just one the troupes that have figured out how to do it enjoy.\n \n But chimps do need to practice termiting before they can get good at it. Jane Goodall tried, but she found it wasn't all that easy. Amazing what you can learn when you have an interest in biology! emoticon_xgood",

   "JPSartre12\n \n One addendum. If your point is that sexual promiscuity leads to a higher risk of HIV infection, then no-one, no gay person, would disagree with you. Promiscuous sex without condoms is undoubtedly irresponsible and risky, whether it is gay or straight. Maybe gay sex carries somewhat higher risks, I don't know, but that could because gay men have more opportunities for sex than straight men. Not that that speculation is a proven fact. At any rate, the risks are relative, not absolute, and depend on the number of sexual partners you have, not your sexual orientation. After all, I am gay, I've played the field, and am HIV-negative so far as I know.\n \n If you are trying to make some point that it is homosexuality that causes HIV infection, then that is dangerous misinformation. In America, HIV broke into the gay population first, and that's why it has largely stayed in that reservoir, because there isn't a huge amount of sexual contact between gay and straight populations, though some who use drugs may share needles. Even so, gay men account for fewer than half the new infections in the US, and straight women are one of the highest risk groups.\n \n In the world at large, HIV is a straight problem.

   "JPSartre12\n \n One addendum. If your point is that sexual promiscuity leads to a higher risk of HIV infection, then no-one, no gay person, would disagree with you. Promiscuous sex without condoms is undoubtedly irresponsible and risky, whether it is gay or straight. Maybe gay sex carries somewhat higher risks, I don't know, but that could because gay men have more opportunities for sex than straight men. \n\n If you aren't aware that HIV spread easier via MSM than heteros, then you're very, very naive or in a state of denial.\n \n\n Not that that speculation is a proven fact. At any rate, the risks are relative, not absolute, and depend on the number of sexual partners you have, not your sexual orientation. After all, I am gay, I've played the field, and am HIV-negative so far as I know.\n \n\n Lucky you.\n \n\n If you are trying to make some point that it is homosexuality that causes HIV infection, then that is dangerous misinformation. In America, HIV broke into the gay population first, and that's why it has largely stayed in that reservoir, because there isn't a huge amount of sexual contact between gay and straight populations, though some who use drugs may share needles. Even so, gay men account for fewer than half the new infections in the US, and straight women are one of the highest risk groups.\n \n\n I'm debating origins, not the current situation. The current situation has no relationship to how AIDS achieved a foothold in the US.\n \n \n In the world at large, HIV is a straight problem. It's an accident it hit gays in the West first. The problem is promiscuity, gay or straight. It's unprotected sex. Those are the real risk factors for contracting HIV infection. Not sexual orientation.\n\n It's a straight problem now because so many straights have contracted it through sex with bisexuals, drug use, tainted blood, etc., but it all goes back to Patient X. The disease probably existed for a long time without spreading. It took a promiscuous gay population to turn it into a world-wide problem. \n Refute that!",

   "JP, are you trying to make the earth-shattering revelation that early on, most of the cases of HIV in the US were among gay men?\n \n That is known. It is not news.\n \n I do not understand what significance you attach to that?\n The disease simply happened to appear first in gay men in the US. Gay men have sex with gay men and given that HIV may be sexually transmitted, these other gay men got infected. \n \n [I am using the word gay here to make a point of not shying away from the word or the fact that many gay men had and have HIV infections. The transmission has nothing to do with ones sexual orientation per se, of course, but the fact is that many of those men who were having sex with men happened to be gay. Not all, but that is beside the point.]\n \n The risk of male to female (and vice-versa) transmission of HIV through genital intercourse is quantitatively known with some degree of precision. The risk of male to male transmission is less clear, but seems to be greater than that of male/female. \n \n Whether loosening the sexual mores would have increased the enormity of the epidemic is pure speculation. Things were pretty loose. If more people were having unprotected intercourse with infected partners (for whatever reason), of course there would be an increased incidence of new infections. Whether the increase would have been great enough to kill us all off, or whatever dire speculation you are making, that can never be known. \n \n What IS your point?\n What is the point of speculating that if the conditions that promote infection had been increased, there would have been more infections?\n Are you attempting to make a point here?\n What is there to debate?\n Is there any value judgment you are implying?",

   "And the misconception that AIDS is a gay problem can be very dangerous indeed. When my daughter lived for a couple of years in the Czech Republic, she was horrified to find that Europeans refused to use condoms, under the misapprehension that they were safe as long as the ladies were on the pill. AIDS is epidemic in the heterosexual brothels of SE Asia and India. In Subsaharan Africa, it is almost entirely a heterosexual problem - and way too many of the victims are children. \n \n All this has been common knowledge for years. Surely no one who reads the papers can still think that AIDS is a purely gay issue.\n\n \n Surely you jest! emoticon_xangel Yeah, I wish, but people on the religious right believe so many things that aren't true, they've become impervious to reason and fact if it doesn't fit what they want to believe. They want to believe that HIV/AIDS is a \"gay problem\" or even god's vengeance against gays, and so nothing can persuade them otherwise. It's convenient to be able to blame gays for their troubles.\n \n Many black Christians in America go one step further, and think it's a white male gay problem, which leaves their community wide open to its devastation because they refuse to confront reality. In consequence, the incidence of HIV infection is much higher in the black American community, especially females, than any other. Fortunately, a number of black churches, which are generally among the most homophobic in the nation, and a variety of black activist groups, are getting hip to the problem and trying to figure out ways of getting light on this blind spot.",

   "Originally Posted by samiinh View Post\n The Roman Catholic Church is partially responsible for this as well by teaching that condoms don't work in prevention of disease. This is more of the evil that the church perpetrates on the poor and ignorant masses.\n\n \n \nI'm not familiar with the RCC teaching that. Do you have a source showing the RCC saying that? preferably a link? No one doubts that they have traditionally opposed condoms, but you're going further in saying they teach that condoms don't work in helping prevent STDs.\n \n Meanwhile, a Google search showed the Vatican going in the very opposite direction of being anti-condom:\n\n \n Odd. My Google search gave me rather different results:\n \n Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids\n The Catholic Church is telling people in countries stricken by Aids not to use condoms because they have tiny holes in them through which HIV can pass - potentially exposing thousands of people to risk.\n \n The church is making the claims across four continents despite a widespread scientific consensus that condoms are impermeable to HIV.\n \n A senior Vatican spokesman backs the claims about permeable condoms, despite assurances by the World Health Organisation that they are untrue. \n Catholic Church condom prohibition comes face to face with reality of AIDS in Africa\n Father Valeriano Paitoni, working in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, summarized this perspective: \"AIDS is a world epidemic, a public-health problem that must be confronted with scientific advances and methods that have proven effective,\" he said. \"Rejecting condom use is to oppose the fight for life.\"\n \n [...]\n \n The Vatican has not budged. Condoms thwart conception; therefore, by the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, their use is proscribed. End of debate. In a 2003 Vatican document titled Family Values Versus Safe Sex, the use of condoms in HIV-prevention programs was forcefully rejected:\n \n The Catholic bishops of South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland categorically regard the widespread and indiscriminate promotion of condoms as an immoral and misguided weapon in our battle against HIV/AIDS for the following reasons. The use of condoms goes against human dignity. Condoms change the beautiful act of love into a selfish search for pleasure-while rejecting responsibility. Condoms do not guarantee protection against HIV/AIDS. Condoms may even be one of the main reasons for the spread of HIV/AIDS. \n Condoms, cardinals and the Catholic church\n Conservative Catholic opinion on condoms is not intended to be cruel. As traditional Catholics see it, using condoms is wrong, even as a prophylactic against disease, because they prevent conception. Life, from the moment of conception to death is, Catholics believe, sacred. Only God can terminate life. It is also worth noting that John Paul II spoke out against discrimination against people with HIV, and Catholic AIDS ministries around the world put his words into action.\n \n But pseudo-scientific arguments have also been deployed by some conservative Catholics against the use of condoms as a means of HIV prevention. A recent BBC Panorama documentary found that some senior Catholic clerics were maintaining that not only were condoms theologically unsound, but were also spreading false information about the reliability and safety of condoms.\n Obviously, not all lay Catholics or even cardinals are as devoutly opposed to condom use as the Vatican, but yes, the Vatican was caught spreading what might charitably be described as untruths about condom use. Now, maybe at some point the Vatican will change its mind -- I hear it does do that every few hundred years. But people are being exposed to HIV because they believe what the church tells them.",

   "Take, for example, the Hebrew Law against eating pork. They didn't know that pigs carried parasites and other diseases, but their religion kept them from eating it it.\n\n \n Fine. I don't claim that all the biblical prohibitions on Jews were baseless or irrational, but only really observant Jews attempt to follow all of them today. And virtually all of the Christians I know consume pork with gusto. Any Christian who eats pork but condemns gay people is a cafeteria type.\n \n \nIt's not the lack of breeding, it's the rapid spread of disease that would have probably killed us had homosexuality not been so stigmatized.\n\n \n But how do we know HIV would even have entered the human population in the first place were everyone engaged principally in homosexual sex? (Not that this contingency is remotely likely!) The African epidemic is very much heterosexual, and that's where HIV originated and began to be spread. \n \n Also, you neglect that the problem is not gay sex, per se, but unprotected, promiscuous sex. Many gay people are monogamous or use condoms.\n \n \nYou're gay!? Who knew? emoticon_wow ;) And I never said that gays recruit. I just believe that more openness would have led to a faster spread of AIDS.\n\n \n Frankly, I believe the contrary. Were homosexuality not stigmatised, gay relationships would not be as clandestine and fleeting as they sometimes are, and usually had to be when homosexuality was illegal. Gay men wouldn't need to congregate in hidden places to have sex anonymously with strangers. They could have lived healthier lifestyles.\n \n I don't deny that part of the gay revolution in the West has included promiscuity, and I don't deny that as a factor in the spread of HIV among gay men. But it needn't have been that way had it not been for the sexual repression of gay men for all these generations. It developed an unhealthy psychology.\n \n Were gays able to be more open, HIV would have been dealt with faster and more comprehensively, and not allowed to fester in secret places.\n \n \nI said that it wouldn't have been the problem it is now in the US without homosexual transmission initially. If I'm wrong, prove it. Tell me the sexuality of Patient 1-1000 in the US.\n\n \n It's a fact that gay men in general in the US have changed their behaviour, which is why rates of infection fell over the last ten years, and gay men are now responsible for fewer than half of new infections, according to CDC figures. You can't blame homosexuality if the first patients in the US identified with the disease happened to be gay men. HIV doesn't care about your sex or sexual orientation, or even what you do in bed. \n \n If they had been straight men or women, you wouldn't be blaming heterosexuality, would you?\n \n Very disingenuous of you.

By 1980, HIV had spread to at least five continents (North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Australia).

What did the closure of the bathhouses actually accomplish? Did it stop dangerous sex? Of course not. It sent it underground. Gay men who used to frequent closed bathhouses found other venues: parks, beaches, private, invitation-only sex clubs. The behaviour went on, only now, no-one but invitees knew where it was going on.\n \n Closing bathhouses didn't address root causes of irresponsible sexual behaviour, it merely removed them from public view. Worse, it removed an opportunity for education, as you point out. Can you imagine what sending in good-looking, service-oriented people willing to demonstrate responsible, safe sex could have accomplished? Well, I'm sure we could! emoticon_xangel But sanctimonious moralising got the better of the argument.\n \n In fairness, I guess it wasn't obvious then what the best response would be, so they elected to brush the problem under the carpet rather than actually deal with it. It's a pity, but then, mistakes are what we learn from. We can't talk horny people into not having sex. Experience shows this. Still, we do have some hope of persuading them to have responsible sex. It is iniquitous that under this dreadful, religioholic Bush maladministration, we are still trying the impossible rather than the doable.",

   "Mid-1970's-1980 history\n \n We do not know how many people developed AIDS in the 1970s, or indeed in the years before. Neither do we know, and we probably never will know, where the AIDS virus HIV originated (see our origins page for some theories). But what we do know is:\n \n \"The dominant feature of this first period was silence, for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was unknown and transmission was not accompanied by signs or symptoms salient enough to be noticed. While rare, sporadic case reports of AIDS and sero-archaeological studies have documented human infections with HIV prior to 1970, available data suggest that the current pandemic started in the mid- to late 1970s. By 1980, HIV had spread to at least five continents (North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Australia). During this period of silence, spread was unchecked by awareness or any preventive action and approximately 100,000-300,000 persons may have been infected.\"\n \n - Jonathan Mann -1\n \n http://www.avert.org/his81_86.htm\n\n \n This is an excellent link and jives perfectly with my recollections of the time period. I also agree that just because Alarms went off beginning around 79 0r 80, that the virus was working its way through the gay population and into the straight population much earlier. This is the more relevant part of the link though and does accurately outline the sequence of events according to my memory. Also, remember that back then, needle sharing was also very common as its dangers were totally unknown so it was a combination of these unsafe practices that supported and promoted the virus unchecked before these dangers were identified. From your link:\n \n 1981 History\n \n Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) was a rare form of relatively benign cancer that tended to occur in older people. But by March 1981 at least eight cases of a more aggressive form of KS had occurred amongst young gay men in New York.2\n \n At about the same time there was an increase, in both California and New York, in the number of cases of a rare lung infection Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)3. In April this increase in PCP was noticed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. A drug technician, Sandra Ford, noticed a high number of requests for the drug pentamine, used in the treatment of PCP:\n \n \"A doctor was treating a gay man in his 20s who had pneumonia. Two weeks later, he called to ask for a refill of a rare drug that I handled. This was unusual - nobody ever asked for a refill. Patients usually were cured in one 10-day treatment or they died\"\n \n - Sandra Ford for Newsweek -4\n \n In June, the CDC published a report about the occurrence, without identifiable cause, of PCP in five men in Los Angeles5. This report is sometimes referred to as the \"beginning\" of AIDS, but it might be more accurate to describe it as the beginning of the general awareness of AIDS in the USA.\n \n A few days later, following these reports of PCP and other rare life-threatening opportunistic infections, the CDC formed a Task Force on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (KSOI).6\n \n \n Dr. Conant and Dr Volverg discussing\n Kaposi's Sarcoma. Circa 1981\n Around this time a number of theories were developed about the possible cause of these opportunistic infections and cancers. Early theories included infection with cytomegalovirus, the use of amyl nitrite or butyl nitrate \"poppers\", and \"immune overload\".7, 8, 9\n \n Because there was so little known about the transmission of what seemed to be a new disease, there was concern about contagion, and whether the disease could by passed on by people who had no apparent signs or symptoms.10 Knowledge about the disease was changing so quickly that certain assumptions made at this time were shown to be unfounded just a few months later. For example, in July 1981 Dr Curran of the CDC was reported as follows:\n \n \"Dr. Curran said there was no apparent danger to non homosexuals from contagion. 'The best evidence against contagion', he said, 'is that no cases have been reported to date outside the homosexual community or in women'\"\n \n - The New York Times -11\n \n Just five months later, in December 1981, it was clear that the disease affected other population groups, when the first cases of PCP were reported in injecting drug users.12 At the same time the first case of AIDS was documented in the UK.13\n \n 1982 History\n \n The disease still did not have a name, with different groups referring to it in different ways. The CDC generally referred to it by reference to the diseases that were occurring, for example lymphadenopathy (swollen glands), although on some occasions they referred to it as KSOI, the name already given to the CDC task force.14, 15\n \n In contrast some still linked the disease to its initial occurrence in gay men, with a letter in The Lancet calling it \"gay compromise syndrome\".16 Others called it GRID (gay-related immune deficiency), AID (acquired immunodeficiency disease), \"gay cancer\" or \"community-acquired immune dysfunction\".17, 18\n \n In June a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that the disease might be caused by an infectious agent that was sexually transmitted.19\n \n By the beginning of July a total of 452 cases, from 23 states, had been reported to the CDC.20\n \n Later that month the first reports appeared that the disease was occurring in Haitians, as well as haemophiliacs.21, 22 This news soon led to speculation that the epidemic might have orignated in Haiti, and caused some parents to withdraw their children from haemophiliac camps.23 \n \n The occurence of the disease in non-homosexuals meant that names such as GRID were redundant. The acronym AIDS was suggested at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in July.24 By August this name was being used in newspapers and scientific journals.25, 26, 27 AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) was first properly defined by the CDC in September.28\n \n An anagram of AIDS, SIDA, was created for use in French and Spanish.29 Doctors thought AIDS was an appropriate name because people acquired the condition rather than inherited it; because it resulted in a deficiency within the immune system; and because it was a syndrome, with a number of manifestations, rather than a single disease.30\n \n Still very little was known about transmission and public anxiety continued to grow.\n \n \"It is frightening because no one knows what's causing it, said a 28-year old law student who went to the St. Mark's Clinic in Greenwich Village last week complaining of swollen glands, thought to be one early symptom of the disease. Every week a new theory comes out about how you're going to spread it.\"\n \n - The New York Times -31\n \n By 1982 a number of AIDS specific voluntary organisations had been set up in the USA. They included the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF), AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA), and Gay Men's health Crisis (GMHC).32 In November 1982 the first AIDS organisation, the \"Terry Higgins Trust\", was formally established in the UK, and by this time a number of AIDS organisations were already producing safer sex advice for gay men.33, 34\n \n In December a 20-month old child who had received multiple transfusions of blood and blood products died from infections related to AIDS.35 This case provided clearer evidence that AIDS was caused by an infectious agent, and it also caused additional concerns about the safety of the blood supply. Also in December, the CDC reported the first cases of possible mother to child transmission of AIDS.36\n \n By the end of 1982 many more people were taking notice of this new disease, as it was clearer that a much wider group of people was going to be affected.\n \n \"When it began turning up in children and transfusion recipients, that was a turning point in terms of public perception. Up until then it was entirely a gay epidemic, and it was easy for the average person to say 'So what?' Now everyone could relate.\"\n \n - Harold Jaffe of the CDC for newsweek -37\n \n It was also becoming clear that AIDS was not a disease that just occurred in the USA. Throughout 1982 there were separate reports of the disease occurring in a number of European countries.38\n \n Meanwhile in Uganda, doctors were seeing the first cases of a new, fatal wasting disease. This illness soon became known locally as 'slim'.39\n \n 1983 History\n \n In January, reports of AIDS among women with no other risk factors suggested the disease might be passed on through heterosexual sex.40\n \n At about the same time the CDC convened a meeting to consider how the transmission of AIDS could be prevented, and in particular to consider the newly emerged evidence that AIDS might be spread through blood clotting factor and through blood transfusions. As James Curran, the head of the CDC task force, said:\n \n \"The sense of urgency is greatest for haemophiliacs. The risk for others [who receive blood products] now appears small, but is unknown.\"41\n \n The risk for haemophiliacs was so great because the blood concentrate that some haemophiliacs used exposed them to the blood of up to 5,000 individual blood donors.\n \n In March, the CDC stated that,\n \n \"persons who may be considered at increased risk of AIDS include those with symptoms and signs suggestive of AIDS; sexual partners of AIDS patients; sexually active homosexual or bisexual men with multiple partners; Haitian entrants to the United States; present or past abusers of IV drugs; patients with hemophilia; and sexual partners of individuals at increased risk for AIDS.\"\n \n The same report also said,\n \n \"each group contains many persons who probably have little risk of acquiring AIDS... Very little is known about risk factors for Haitians with AIDS.\"42\n \n Nevertheless, the inclusion of Hatians as a risk group caused much controversy. Haitian Americans complained of stigmatisation, officials accused the CDC of racism, and Haiti suffered a serious blow to its tourism industry.43, 44 Before long people were talking colloquially of a \"4-H Club\" at risk of AIDS: homosexuals, haemophiliacs, heroin addicts and Haitians.45, 46 Some people substituted hookers for haemophiliacs.47\n \n In the UK there were public concerns about the blood supply with references in newspapers to \"killer blood\".48 The media more generally started to take notice of AIDS, with the screening of a TV Horizon programme, \"The Killer in the Village\", and a number of newspaper articles on the subject of the \"gay plague\".49, 50\n \n In May 1983, doctors at the Institute Pasteur in France reported that they had isolated a new virus, which they suggested might be the cause of AIDS.51 Little notice was taken of this announcement at the time, but a sample of the virus was sent to the CDC.52 A few months later the virus was named lymphadenopathy-associated virus or LAV, patents were applied for, and a sample of LAV was sent to the National Cancer Institute.53\n \n But whilst progress was being made by scientists there was at the same time increasing concern about transmission, and not just in relation to the blood supply. A report of AIDS occurring in children suggested quite incorrectly the possibility of casual household transmission.54\n \n AIDS transmission became a major issue in San Francisco, where the Police Department equipped patrol officers with special masks and gloves for use when dealing with what the police called \"a suspected AIDS patient\".\n \n \"The officers were concerned that they could bring the bug home and their whole family could get AIDS.\"\n \n - The New York Times -55\n \n And in New York:\n \n \"landlords have evicted individuals with AIDS\" and \"the Social Security Administration is interviewing patients by phone rather than face to face.\"\n \n - Dr David Spencer, Commisioner of Health, New York City -56\n \n There was considerable fear about AIDS in many other countries as well:\n \n \"In many parts of the world there is anxiety, bafflement, a sense that something has to be done - although no one knows what.\"\n \n - The New York Times -57\n \n As anxiety continued, the CDC tried to provide reassurance that children with AIDS had probably acquired it from their mothers and that casual transmission did not occur:\n \n \"The cause of AIDS is unknown, but it seems most likely to be caused by an agent transmitted by intimate sexual contact, through contaminated needles, or, less commonly, by percutaneous inoculation of infectious blood or blood products. No evidence suggests transmission of AIDS by airborne spread. The failure to identify cases among friends relatives, and co-workers of AIDS patients provides further evidence that casual contact offers little or no risk... the occurrence in young infants suggests transmission from an affected mother to a susceptible infant before, during, or shortly after birth.\"58\n \n Reports from Europe suggested that two rather separate AIDS epidemics were occurring. In the UK, West Germany and Denmark, the majority of people with AIDS were homosexual, and many had a history of sex with American nationals. However in France and Belgium AIDS was occurring mainly in people from Central Africa or those with links to the area.59\n \n Examples of this second epidemic included a number of previously healthy African patients who were hospitalised in Belgium with opportunistic infections (such as PCP and cryptosporidosis), Kaposi's sarcoma, or other AIDS-like illnesses. All of these Africans had immune deficiency similar to that of American AIDS patients. However they had no history of blood transfusion, homosexuality, or intravenous drug abuse.60 In light of such reports, European and American scientists set out to discover more about the occurrence of AIDS in Central Africa.\n \n By this time, doctors working in parts of Zambia and Zaire had already noticed the emergence of a very aggressive form of Kaposi's sarcoma. This cancer was endemic in Central Africa, but previously it had progressed very slowly and responded well to treatment, whereas the new cases looked very different and were often fatal.61, 62\n \n In September the CDC published their first set of recommended precautions for health-care workers and allied professionals designed to prevent \"AIDS transmission\".63 In the UK, people who might be particularly susceptible to AIDS were asked not to donate blood.64\n \n In October, the first European World Health Organisation (WHO) meeting was held in Denmark. At the meeting it was reported that there had been 2,803 AIDS cases in the USA.65\n \n That meeting was followed in November by the first meeting to assess the global AIDS situation. This was the start of global surveillance by the WHO and it was reported that AIDS was present in the U.S.A., Canada, fifteen European countries, Haiti and Zaire as well as in seven Latin American countries. There were also cases reported from Australia and two suspected cases in Japan.66\n \n By the end of the year the number of AIDS cases in the USA had risen to 3,064 and of these 1,292 had died.67",

   "What our resident anti-gay posters don't seem to get is that any problems arising from gay sexuality arise not from the sexuality, per se, but from promiscuity and lack of safe sex practices.\n \n Now maybe some gay men are promiscuous and irresponsible. Not all are, by any means, but even though some are, they aren't promiscuous because they are gay; they aren't irresponsible because they are gay. They do these things because they are men with hormonally driven libidos who occasionally allow their lust to rule their reason. Maybe professional moralisers can whine about their lack of self control for lack of anything better to do, but it makes no sense to blame their sexual orientation. \n \n And IF gay men are more promiscuous on average than straight men, which is a questionable assumption, it's not because they are gay, but because they probably have more opportunity: after all, it is colloquially said (and probably has some truth to it) that men, but not women, are all after the same thing -- so when gay men find each other, negotiation is simpler.\n \n This business of blaming the homosexuality of gay people for their alleged sexual hyperactivity is so much garbage. Straight men are no better, or would not be given half a chance, but we don't see our prissy preachers complaining about them and condemning heterosexuality.\n\n \n Your prissy preacher has just pointed out some historical facts about AIDS and its early spread.

   "JP, are you trying to make the earth-shattering revelation that early on, most of the cases of HIV in the US were among gay men?\n \n That is known. It is not news.\n \n I do not understand what significance you attach to that?\n The disease simply happened to appear first in gay men in the US. Gay men have sex with gay men and given that HIV may be sexually transmitted, these other gay men got infected. \n \n [I am using the word gay here to make a point of not shying away from the word or the fact that many gay men had and have HIV infections. The transmission has nothing to do with ones sexual orientation per se, of course, but the fact is that many of those men who were having sex with men happened to be gay. Not all, but that is beside the point.]\n \n The risk of male to female (and vice-versa) transmission of HIV through genital intercourse is quantitatively known with some degree of precision. The risk of male to male transmission is less clear, but seems to be greater than that of male/female. \n \n Whether loosening the sexual mores would have increased the enormity of the epidemic is pure speculation. Things were pretty loose. If more people were having unprotected intercourse with infected partners (for whatever reason), of course there would be an increased incidence of new infections. Whether the increase would have been great enough to kill us all off, or whatever dire speculation you are making, that can never be known. \n \n What IS your point?\n What is the point of speculating that if the conditions that promote infection had been increased, there would have been more infections?\n Are you attempting to make a point here?\n What is there to debate?\n Is there any value judgment you are implying?\n\n \n My point is a very simple one. Given the gay community's responsibility in spreading one of the deadliest viruses known, how can a rational human being NOT be apprehensive about embracing gays in mainstream society? The gay community's track record, IMO, sucks! \n If you want to change the public's perception, the gay community needs to own up to its past mistakes. Aside from you and perhaps one other poster here, the rest want to resort to subterfuge and claim that gays don't have any responsibility for the spread of AIDS in the US or they want to divert attention to other areas of the world with differing problems. They claim \"it's a virus that just happened to infect the gay community first\" That's pure, unadulterated BS! It didn't just \"happen\" to them first. It was the high risk promiscuous bathhouse lifestyle practiced by many gays that took a few isolated cases of HIV and spread it like wildfire. Until the gay community accepts that responsibility, you have zero credibility with the public, IMO, and the public will be reluctant to deal with you on an equal footing. Lies beget distrust; distrust begets laws restricting actions. \n And calling someone, that wants to debate the issue in a politically-incorrect straight forward factual manner, a bigot just increases that distrust. \n \n I find it somewhat comforting that a few gays here understand the issue and don't try to resort to the old tired subterfuge or denial routine. It's old, played out and a lie. \n Unfortunately, root cause analysis ends with blame, but once that's agreed upon and corrected, energy can be spent elsewhere. Condoms, not sharing needles, checking the blood supply, reducing risky behaviors, all of these actions would never have occurred without someone looking for the root causes of HIV's transmission.",

   "Here's an article I thought was worth posting.\n \n http://www.pointofview.net/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID320166%7CCHID706734%7CCIID1690654,00.html\n \n feedback is welcome from those closer to the lifestyle than I am. Here's an excerpt.\n\n \n The Gay Deathstyle\n \n By Marlin Maddoux\n From the forthcoming book \"Public Education Against America\" by Marlin Maddoux\n \n \n Point of View - The homosexual rights movement is built on a foundation of lies, language manipulation, and factual disinformation.\n Seeking to gain total acceptance of their destructive behaviors, their propaganda machines work ceaselessly, pumping their poisonous lies and deceptions into the cultural bloodstream of America.\n \n But one cold hard fact that is always airbrushed out of the public image of the gay lifestyle is the number of young men and women who are dying of AIDS, hepatitis, and new strains of TB, all diseases whose ascendance is largely a result of homosexual activity.\n \n For example, researchers at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia published a report in 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology that concluded: \"In a major Canadian centre, life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men. If the same pattern of mortality were to continue, we estimate that nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently 20 years of age will not reach their 65th birthday.\"\n \n Gay authors Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen write, \"Alas, it turns out that, on this point, public myth is supported by fact. There is more promiscuity among gays . . . than among straights. They cite the pattern among gay males of the \"non-stick, one-swipe, disposable lover.\" Even among \"married\" gay males, they observe, \"the cheating ratio, given enough time, approaches 100%.\"\n \n Do statistics back up Kirk and Madsen's contention that \"there is more promiscuity among gays?\" Let's look at the facts! To start with, one widely regarded study, published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, had a representative sample of non-infected male homosexuals keep sexual diaries. On the average, these gay men had 106 partners per year.\"\n \n That was just the tip of the iceberg.\n \n A survey of gay men by researchers Bell and Weinberg in the mid-1970s found that only 14 percent of gay males, and only 40 percent of lesbians, were living in \"monogamous\" relationships.\n \n And as we have seen, monogamy in the homosexual definition of the word entails a much shorter duration than the standard meaning of the term. In fact, many studies indicated that the range for a so-called monogamous relationship for a homosexual often lasts no more than nine months, almost never more than five years (and even this is extremely rare).\"\n The Bell and Weinberg study found that:\n \n 43 percent of the gay men estimated having sex with 500 or more different partners. 75 percent estimated 100 or more partners. 28 percent estimated more than 1,000 partners.\n \n 79 percent said that more than half of their partners were anonymous.\n \n 70 percent said that more than half of their partners were men with whom they had sex only once.\n A later study by these two researchers estimated that only 2 percent of homosexuals could be considered monogamous or even semi-monogamous (having ten or less lifetime partners). Lesbians are often credited with more fidelity than gay men, and this is true to a point. Yet even here, the rate of instability seems to exceed any definition of a monogamous, normal community.\n \n One study found that 38 percent of lesbians surveyed had between 11 and 300 sexual partners. Another revealed that 41 percent of lesbians admitted to having between 10 and 500 lifetime partners.\n \n Yet even snapshots of typical homosexual behavior fail to give the total picture. A sizeable percentage of the gay community is not merely promiscuous, but wildly so, and therefore at risk for AIDS.\n \n Research into at-risk or HIV-positive homosexuals reveal astonishing figures. In one study, \"homosexual men . . . reported a median of 1,160 lifetime sexual partners.\" In another, \"the median number of lifetime sexual partners of over 4,000 homosexual respondents was 49.5. Many individuals reported ranges of 300-400, and 272 of them reported over 1,000 different lifetime partners.\"\n \n Another article in the Annals of Internal Medicine listed over fifteen severe injuries, diseases, or syndromes, including rectal tearing and hepatitis A and B, that commonly occur in gay males as a direct result of oral and anal sex.\n \n The article also said that the Centers for Disease Control reported that almost half of male patients with syphilis claimed homosexual or bisexual contacts, despite the fact that gays are only a small percentage of the population. Compiled studies by leading medical researchers show that:\n \n Homosexuals account for 80 percent of America's most serious sexually transmitted diseases.\n \n Youths engaging in homosexual behavior are 23 times more likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease than strictly heterosexual youths.\n \n Lesbians are 19 times more likely than heterosexual women to have had syphilis, twice as likely to suffer from genital warts, four times as likely to have scabies.\n \n Male homosexuals are 14 times more likely to have syphilis than male heterosexuals. They are also thousands of time more likely to have AIDS.\n It is also now known that hepatitis A, and a virulent, antibiotic-resistant strain of tuberculosis are rampant in the gay community. Other self-destructive patterns have been observed. Researchers have noted a disproportionate abuse of drugs and alcohol by homosexuals, as well as higher levels of emotional mental problems, social instability and disruptive behavior.",

They do all the things that gay people do. How can you blame gay people for not taking preventative measures, before anyone knew how HIV was transmitted, or had even identified the virus? Confusion was everywhere. Do you not see how unreasonable your blame game is? It goes beyond hindsight being 20/20. Was a prognostocator or a psychic meant to give gay people the clarity and accurate knowledge the CDC could not at that time? Therefore gay people should still face this reactionary attitude faced in the 1980s, and be treated as less valued people? It could have started in any community, ignorance helps it transmit, and only education has lessened it.",

Yet as we speak, Bath houses are open again in San Fran. Just out of curiosity, are there straight sex clubs and bath houses in San Fran ?

Health Commission may address clubs' return \n \n San Francisco Chronicle - Monday, June 14, 1999 \n Elaine Herscher, Chronicle Staff Writer \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Nothing in Dr. Mitchell Katz's eight years in the San Francisco Public Health Department has stirred passions as much as the idea being pushed by a group of gay activists to bring back the city's bathhouses. \n \"This is the only issue where people on the street come up to me, people at the gym come up to me,\" said Katz, who has been health director for two years. \n \n No one, he said, is ambivalent. \n \n Either bathhouses are a scourge that should never be resurrected -- which he hears most often -- or they are an important element in AIDS prevention. The issue could come before the city's Health Commission in the next few weeks, possibly as early as tomorrow. \n \n The gay baths thrived in San Francisco until 1984, when Health Department regulations and gay men's fears of AIDS forced them to close. A crop of sex clubs sprang up in their place with guidelines worked out by club owners and the gay community. \n \n The main difference between the two is that bathhouses feature private rooms in which sexual behavior cannot be monitored. In sex clubs, sexual activity takes place in the open, where others may watch or participate. San Francisco forbids a sex establishment from having private rooms. \n \n A small group of gay men and supporters from ACT UP San Francisco has been gathering signatures for a ballot measure to bring back the bathhouses. \"Dr. Katz's regulations send a clear message that gay men cannot be trusted behind closed doors,\" said David Attyah, who has been promoting the return of bathhouses. \"We need to reinforce clear messages that men have the power to stay healthy over a lifetime, in any sexual venue.\" \n \n LONG-STANDING ARGUMENTS \n \n The arguments have been as vitriolic and emotional as they were in the mid-1980s, when gay men who advocated closing the bathhouses were branded traitors to the cause of gay civil rights. Katz, who is gay, hears plenty of it. \n \n \"Mitch Katz, I don't care if you are gay, you're a homophobe,\" Todd Swindell of ACT UP San Francisco said at a recent meeting of the city's HIV Prevention Planning Council. \"This department's policy is homophobic.\" \n \n Both points of view on the bathhouse controversy are problematic. Those who do not want the bathhouses reopened wonder how someone who goes to a public place to have sex can argue that monitoring is an invasion of privacy. The bathhouse advocates say the government, by supporting sex clubs, has put itself in the position of requiring virtual orgies as a means of preventing disease. \n \n The health officials and gay men who advocated closing the bathhouses 15 years ago thought it would slow the spread of HIV. Bathhouse supporters say the city did not have the evidence to support that argument then and does not have it now. \n \n Katz admits that there are no numbers proving that risky sex is more likely to take place behind closed doors than in the open. Neither do any data support that privacy is safer, as bathhouse supporters assert. \n \n But Katz says he is relying on common sense. The sex clubs are required to post signs with safer sex guidelines and have easily accessible condoms and lubricants. Men having anal intercourse must use condoms. And the spaces for sexual activity must be well-lit and patrolled by staff at least once every 20 minutes. \n \n The idea, Katz said, is that the clubs be \"so committed to safe sex that if I'm having unsafe sex, someone is going to come up to me. Someone is going to say, `I'm sorry,' you have to put on a condom.' \" \n \n His detractors say the policy actually may be promoting risky sex. Without privacy, they say, they have less opportunity to talk and negotiate safer sex. They say monitoring gay men is \"infantilizing\" and detracts from their ability to take care of themselves and others. Bathhouses with closed doors would afford them both privacy and access to condoms while in an environment surrounded by prevention messages, they say. \n \n \"A ban on privacy in sex establishments precludes the simple dignity of a hello,\" said 26-year-old Kirk Read. In sex clubs, Read says, he is nervous and self-conscious about his body with men standing all around him watching. \"No wonder people get drunk or high before going to sex clubs,\" he said. \"You're on stage. It's scary. And this is San Francisco's idea of a prevention strategy?\" \n \n PRIVACY ISSUE \n \n Katz does not buy the argument that away from prying eyes, men will be more inclined toward safety. \n \n \"We certainly know that most unprotected sex occurs in private, so I don't think we can argue that if people have privacy they're going to have safe sex,\" he said. \n \n Others question why, when sexual behavior remains so complex, the city should take the chance that private-room advocates are right. \n \n \"There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of us are clearly capable of being safe in a bathhouse,\" said Dan Wohlfeiler, who co-chaired the committee that wrote the sex club guidelines and researches HIV prevention at the University of California at Berkeley. \n \n \"But we also know there are a number of people who have trouble staying consistently safe,\" Wohlfeiler said. \"One of the hardest questions for us to answer is, what risk do they pose to themselves and to others when you put them in an environment where there's a potential of their having unprotected anal sex with multiple partners?\" \n \n So far, the issue has failed to rally the gay community. Michael Petrelis, who has been gathering signatures for the pro-bathhouse initiative only in neighborhoods frequented by gay men, says he has collected just 1,000 names. Supporters need 10,200 valid signatures by July 5 to qualify for the November ballot. If they miss the July deadline, they can continue circulating petitions for the March 2000 election. \n \n Bathhouse advocates argue that sex establishments are safer than the streets for men who are newly exploring gay sex, or for young men who live with parents or roommates, and men from the suburbs, many of whom arrive in town wearing wedding bands. \n \n They say lack of privacy in sex clubs may be sending these men to the city's parks, where they are in danger of anti-gay violence and there are no bowls of condoms and tubes of lubricants within arm's reach. \n \n Some say the policy against privacy discriminates against minorities who cannot afford nice homes or hotel rooms but who might come to a bathhouse or sex club for $7 if they did not have to perform in public. \n \n COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION \n \n Faced with speakers only in support of bathhouses at its June 3 meeting, the HIV planning council recommended that the San Francisco Health Commission restore private rooms in sex venues. The Health Commission is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to consider the matter. \n \n Because no data support either side, commissioners will have to decide based on experience or intuition, not on science. \n \n \"Unfortunately, departments of public health across the country have a notorious history of choosing regulation over empowerment for a variety of health issues,\" said Steve Filandrinos, a bathhouse advocate and biomedical researcher. \"They choose this not because regulation is proven effective but because it is politically expedient.\" \n \n Katz questions why anyone would dismantle prevention efforts that appear to be effective. He is also concerned that much of the lobbying for bathhouses comes from the mistaken belief that AIDS is a less terrible disease than it was in 1984. Many fewer people are dying, but no one knows how long the new classes of drugs will work. \n \n \"Implicitly, for most people reopening the bathhouses suggests the epidemic is over, that circumstances have changed and the same level of vigilance isn't necessary,\" Katz said. \"That doesn't make any sense. The ways HIV is transmitted haven't changed at all.\" \n ",

   "Now keep in mind that ACT UP is a Gay Rights Organization.\n \n ACT UP/GG survey: Nearly four of ten SF gay men are barebacking; Up from 24 percent in 1994 Stop AIDS survey \n \n The Bay Area Reporter - April 3, 1998 \n Don Howard, ACT UP/Golden Gate Writers Pool \n \n www.aegis.com/news/bar/1998/BR980401.html \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Thirty-seven percent of gay men recently surveyed by ACT UP/Golden Gate report having had unprotected anal sex as a bottom or a top in the last six months. Unprotected anal sex, sometimes referred to as barebacking, is on the rise; in 1994 24 percent of gay men reported barebacking in STOP AIDS street surveys. Although there are no definitive answers to what is driving the barebacking phenomenon, one thing seems apparent from our ACT UP survey data; current prevention programs are failing to reach everyone and many gay men are at risk. \n The statistics \n \n During March, ACT UP/Golden Gate performed an anonymous survey of 105 men who have sex with men (39 percent HIV-positive, 54 percent HIV-negative, 7 percent unsure). The survey was conducted on the street in the Castro and in two popular sex clubs (Eros and Blow Buddies) in an effort to learn more about gay men's sex habits and attitudes about changes in the HIV epidemic. Some of the results: \n \n * More than one in three men surveyed (37 percent) has been a top or a bottom in anal sex without a condom (barebacked) in the last six months (41 percent among those surveyed in sex clubs, 33 percent among those surveyed on the street). \n \n * Almost half of the those who bareback are HIV-negative or did not know their HIV status (46 percent). \n \n * More than a quarter (28 percent) of those who bareback have sex to ejaculation (nearly equal rate among both negative and positive people who bareback). \n \n * Half of the HIV-positive men in the overall survey are not worried about reinfection with HIV. \n \n * Of those who bareback, 30 percent report that they are having riskier sex now than a year ago (vs. 18 percent of those who do not bareback). \n \n Other studies, similar results \n \n Our survey results are not surprising to Dan Wohlfeiler, education director for the STOP AIDS Project, one of San Francisco's leading HIV prevention groups serving gay men. \"Your numbers aren't that different from ours,\" says Wohlfeiler. \"Ours is just a bigger sample, based on almost 22,000 surveys. Our analysis - which we did with the Department of Public Health - is literally just out of the computer and I'm glad to make it public. \n \n \"Back in 1994, 24 percent of the men our outreach volunteers spoke with reported having unprotected anal sex with two or more partners. That has steadily increased, to the point where now 33 percent report the same behavior. More worrisome: 32 percent of the guys who reported having unprotected anal sex with two or more partners did not know their partners' HIV status. So while certainly some of the unprotected sex is attributable to negotiated safety - people choosing to have sex with men of their own HIV status - these numbers show that some men are not going that route, and are having unprotected anal sex with multiple partners without finding out their partners' status.\" \n \n Mitch Katz, Director of Public Health, agrees ACT UP/Golden Gate's \"results are quite consistent with other studies, including the recent young men's study, that over 30 percent of men who have sex with men have had unprotected anal intercourse in the prior six months.\" \n \n Is it the drugs? \n \n Some speculate that there is more barebacking because gay men think that HIV is not as risky as it was before the introduction of protease inhibitors and other new treatment advances. Our survey data indicate that men who bareback seem to have somewhat more faith in the new treatments than those who do not bareback - 69 percent of the barebackers agreed (or somewhat agreed) that \"HIV was no longer the death sentence it used to be\" vs. 61 percent of the non-barebackers. \n \n Others have argued that the availability of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (using anti-HIV drugs in the hours after being exposed to stay negative) is causing gay men to abandon safer sex practices. Our survey showed a slightly higher opinion or awareness of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) among those who bareback - 24 percent of those who bareback agreed (or somewhat agreed) with the statement \"there is a morning-after pill I can take for HIV\" vs. 13 percent of those who do not bareback. \n \n Have condom-centered prevention programs failed barebackers? \n \n In our ACT UP survey, twice as many of the HIV-negative men who bareback agreed (or somewhat agreed) that they are tired of using condoms (40 percent vs. 20 percent of the HIV-negative men who did not bareback). Our survey suggests that current prevention strategies, centered around the condom code, are not relevant to the growing number of gay men who bareback: twice as many men who bareback said that current HIV prevention programs are not relevant and do not help them stay safe (37 percent for those who bareback vs. 18 percent for those who did not). \n \n Race Bannon, a local sex activist who has worked on sex panic issues, says \"I believe that the increase in barebacking is a phenomenon that is likely to continue its rise within our community and that prevention efforts must address this reality directly. While I do not personally endorse barebacking, it would be foolish to ignore its ramifications. Our community must be careful not to scapegoat in order to come up with a reason for barebacking's popularity. As with so many sexuality issues, the reasons for barebacking are complex and no one fully understands them. The convenient, but misguided, explanation would be that 'sex is the enemy' - and such a viewpoint would spawn a whole new round of sex-negative prevention campaigns that would ultimately fail.\" \n \n Tom Coates, Director of UCSF's AIDS Research Institute, agrees that prevention agencies need to address barebacking within the community. Coates says, \"the agencies should be holding conversations with the community to understand better who is barebacking and why. I think that there is probably a variety of motivations behind barebacking and we don't fully understand all of them. \n \n \"It is also the case that the message is out there, and that people think it is dangerous - and that's probably why they do it. It's both dangerous and defiant, and the gay community has always enjoyed being dangerous and defiant. That's how we got to where we are now. We need to continue to be dangerous and defiant - it pushed us ahead in the battle against AIDS - but we also need to be around so that we survive and that's why barebacking concerns me. Danger and defiance are interesting, but HIV is lethal.\" \n \n The SF Department of Public Health is in the planning phases of a study, directed by Dr. Susan Buchbinder and Dr. Grant Colfax, to determine how prevention messages need to change to reflect changes in treatment of HIV disease. In the meantime, other communities, notably Boston, have begun poster campaigns discussing misconceptions that the epidemic may be over. Clearly, the rise in bareback sex is one more indication that more needs to be done in our community to address the changes issues negative and positive men confront in keeping themselves healthy in the new era of HIV treatment. \n 980403 \n \n ",

   "I repeat samiinh, note the sources of this and the other reports I'm posting. THESE ARE NOT FROM CHRISTIAN, ANTI GAY, OR EVEN STRAIGHT ORGANIZATIONS. Your denials do you nor your community any good at all.\n \n And are you implying that you have never heard of barebacking ? That you don't know of any gay or bisexual friends who participate in it ? And you're accusing me of lying ? What is it that is angering you the most, that I'm exposing the irresponsibilty within your community or that I'm revealing a well kept secret that has been pushed underground since the negative press it received in the 90s ?\n \n www.thebody.com/content/whatis/art12149.html \n \n Editorial\n \n Gordon Nary\n \n February 1999\n \n In this issue of the Journal, David MacDougall reports on data presented at the 36th annual IDSA meeting in Denver. Dave highlights HIV-resistance maven Douglas Richman's presentation on the disturbing increase in the incidence of drug-resistant HIV. According to Richman, the proportion of cases of HIV transmission contracted from persons who are aware of their diagnosis is increasing, and up to ten percent of patients with newly acquired HIV infection have virus with drug-resistant mutations. Considering that many clinicians and scientists were discounting the initial trickle of reports of drug-resistant virus at the Geneva conference only a few months earlier, the portents of a new epidemic of HIV-resistant virus are now being hastily divined by epidemiologists like the entrails of some cosmic crow. One of these portents is the growing popularity of extreme bareback sex. \n There has been increasing media and public attention to bareback sex, somewhat obfuscated by a parallel increase in confusion about what bareback sex is. While bareback sex is often used as a synonym for condomless vaginal and anal sex, it more accurately refers to such encounters in which one of the partners knows that he or she is HIV positive. Bareback sex can be applied to an occasional lapse in condom use, or to the exclusive practice of condomless anal/vaginal intercourse. Bareback sex can also refer to \"extreme sex\" which is high-risk sex involving the exchange of blood, semen, vaginal, and anal secretions when at least one party is HIV positive, and when the risk of infection or other bodily harm (i.e., via S&M) is a central component of the associated sexual gratification. So for clarification, this editorial uses the term extreme bareback sex. \n \n The focus of Sabin Russell's article in the January 29 San Francisco Chronicle headlined \"Russian Roulette Sex Parties\" with the subhead \"Rise in gay fringe group's unsafe practices alarms AIDS experts\" refers to extreme bareback sex and deservedly received considerable local and national attention. The two February POZ bareback sex features were about extreme bareback sex, and not the occasional lapse into unsafe sex. The Stephen Gendin POZ feature profiles an openly HIV-positive bareback hustler whom Gendin anoints as the \"Bareback Sex Poster Boy,\" for his lifestyle choice and not for unintentional lapses in condom use. \n \n Michael Scarce's POZ entry titled \"A Ride on the Wild Side\" is a thoughtful apologia of the extreme bareback sex phenomenon in the gay community, and includes a list of scientifically questionable hygiene tips offered to reduce the risk of infection by those whose raison d'etre is high-risk sex. Unfortunately, Scarce does not address the extreme bareback sex popularity in the heterosexual community, and provides only a glimpse into the division between the old-guard safer sex advocates in the AIDS community and the younger vanguard of sexual libertarians over \"Russian Roulette Sex Parties\" and public conventions of extreme bareback enthusiasts.\n MAYBE THIS EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE PRACTICE EXPLAINS THE INCREASE IN HIV/AIDS CROSSOVER FROM THE GAY TO THE STRAIGHT COMMUNITY.\n Missing from the extreme bareback sex debates is the response of the medical community to their HIV patients' possible high-risk sexual practices and/or attitudes toward such practices. There is data indicating HIV/AIDS patients on protease inhibitors are more likely to engage in bareback sex. Because of the general reluctance of physicians to take sexual histories, one might assume that many physicians who care for extreme bareback sex practitioners are unaware of their patients' sexual practices and the potential harm of such practices to these patients and their sexual partners. \n \n The medical community has the opportunity to reduce such potential harm through monitoring their HIV patients' sexual practices through regular sexual history/activity updates and, when necessary, counselling such patients to limit and hopefully curb bareback sex. Such monitoring, education, and counseling could reinforce their patients' knowledge of both the promise and limitations of virus-suppressing antiretroviral combinations, and the increased responsibilities of patients to themselves and to their sexual partners mandated by a diagnosis of HIV infection.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n This article was provided by International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care.

   "What a hateful, worthless, scapegoating diatribe. There isn't ironclad proof that the bulk of the first cases came directly from bathhouses, but it doesn't matter. Straight people are promiscuous in many different venues and have diseases too. They do all the things that gay people do. How can you blame gay people for not taking preventative measures, before anyone knew how HIV was transmitted, or had even identified the virus? Confusion was everywhere. Do you not see how unreasonable your blame game is? It goes beyond hindsight being 20/20. Was a prognostocator or a psychic meant to give gay people the clarity and accurate knowledge the CDC could not at that time? Therefore gay people should still face this reactionary attitude faced in the 1980s, and be treated as less valued people?

Why would someone do something so obviously dangerous to their health ? It boggles the mind. And you never said how many people you personally know who do such dangerous and irresponsible things. Why is that samiinh ?\n \n http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_7_18/ai_88583534\n \n How many guys bareback? - HIV Digest - unprotected sex survey - Brief Article\n \n Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are trying to gauge the statistical impact of \"barebacking,\" which involves potentially dangerous unprotected anal sex. In a CDC survey of 554 gay or bisexual men in the San Francisco Bay area, about one in 10 said they had recently barebacked.\n \n The investigators define the term closely, reserving it only for the pursuit of anal sex without a condom between \"non-primary\" partners, which excludes \"the context of negotiated safety.\" True barebackers must also be familiar with the concept; this distinguishes the act from poor planning or spontaneous decisions during sex.\n \n Of the 70 percent of the subjects who understood the term, 14 percent--22 percent of the HIV-positive men and 10 percent of the HIV-negative men--acknowledged that they had barebacked one or more times in the past two years. The median number of bareback partners in the previous 12 months was three. Although barebacking is ostensibly life-threatening only to those who are uninfected, HIV-positive practitioners are at risk for contracting drug-resistant \"super strains\" of the virus.\n \n \"The reason most frequently cited for barebacking\"--by four out of five men--\"was to experience greater physical stimulation,\" notes lead author Gordon Mansergh, Ph.D. \"Feeling emotionally connected with a partner was also a relatively common reason. A condom is a physical barrier, and it represents for some people an emotional barrier as well.\"\n \n The proportion of those who barebacked did not vary significantly when measured by race, ethnicity, education, income or sexual orientation. While there was a serostatus-associative trend (positives with positives, negatives with negatives), many men who barebacked reported unprotected receptive and insertive anal sex with men of different or unknown HIV serostatus during their most recent bareback encounter. Drugs and alcohol were a notable cofactor: 58 percent of the subjects reported being intoxicated during their last unprotected incident.\n \n Along with psychological issues such as anger and low self-esteem, medical misperceptions also tend to inform barebacking decisions. Some of the subjects considered AIDS to be a chronic, treatable disease and thought that HIV drags defuse the danger of viral transmission.\n \n Highly active antiretroviral therapy has extended the lives of many people with HIV, but the regimen has been in existence for only five or six years and its long-term efficacy is unknown. For some patients, HAART has harsh side effects; for others, there are no benefits at all. And though drugs that reduce viral load decrease the risk of transmission, they do not eliminate it.\n \n While the intent of the study, published in the journal AIDS, is to define the size of the barebacking subgroup, adding figures for spontaneous unprotected anal sex more than doubles the population at potential risk. \"If we look at those rates overall in the same sample, they're much higher,\" says Mansergh. \"It's 30 percent or so within just the previous three months.\" Social stigma may also keep some respondents from being honest.\n \n \"Behavior may differ by whether individuals are primarily putting themselves or others at risk,\" concludes Mansergh. \"New prevention approaches should simultaneously address specific risk behaviors, perceptions of HIV disease in an era of largely successful drug therapy, and issues of treatment resistance, side effects and failure.\"\n \n CONDOM COMEBACKS\n \n What to say when your partner doesn't want to use protection\n \n The excuse: \"You only live once.\"\n \n The response: \"That's what I was going to say.\"\n \n COPYRIGHT 2002 Weider Publications\n COPYRIGHT 2002 Gale Group",

Why do you attack me as a rightwing christer fascist as if these articles came from sources which are other than your own trusted pro-gay sites ? \n \n To me, it is you being the fascist by attempting to silence a dissenting voice that comes from within your own community, but is saying something you don't want to face. Call it an ugly truth if you will, but your comparisons to the hetero community are unfounded in that heteros don't purposely practice dangerous and extremely unsafe sex in order to increase their sexual gratification.",

It is dangerous and irresponsible of you to claim it is.\n \n \nIt was your community that had the lagst vested interest in finding a solution. The majority of victims were gay men, not Christian Fundamentlists, Southern baptists, etc., All you've demonstrated is that the party with the most to lose acted in their self-interests first. So what?emoticon_confused \n\n \n Of course you're confused.

Shoot the messenger, if you like. That's fine with me, but you're wasting your bullets. You need to target your efforts on showing remorse and demonstating that you are responsible members of society NOW. \n\n \n Nope. Only bigots who don't know truth from fundamentalist lies think that. Christian homophobes are the ones needing to show some remorse for their hatred, but I don't expect to see any anytime soon.\n \n \nMany of your fellow gay posters on this thread, along with their straight politically correct sympathizers, don't share your and my position that the \"facts aren't in dispute\" and that's exactly why I said that there is a lack of trust between the straight and gay community. People make mistakes. Some mistakes are bigger than others, but owning up to the itake is the first step in correcting it. Too many of your fellow gays don't want to take any responsibility and therefore, we can't move forward. \n\n \n Sweetie, gays have been taking responsibility for their actions since this whole thing began. That's why we have organisations dedicated to preventing HIV infection and handling its consequences. After all, we couldn't rely on a Republican government. Those who opposed as bashed us with their Christian bibles. We've modified our behaviour, and we are still waiting for self-styled \"Christians\" to modify theirs. We aren't holding our breath.\n \n \nYou let the horses out of the barn to run wild and blame the owner of the land for not rounding them up soon enough? THAT takes nerve, IMO. \n\n \n More lies. How was anyone supposed to predict HIV? No-one even knew at the beginning there were horses in the bloody barn that should have been stopped from bolting. And then we, and not the so-called Christian community, went trying to round them up. We survived AIDS thanks to our own efforts, not those of Christian churches who more often than not threw up obstacles rather than offering to help.\n \n \nWant to stop HIV in the US?

Just stop people from having sex. That's a really bright idea, Einstein. How do you propose we perform this fantasy of yours? Why not just shoot gay people? That would be about as effective, and very biblical.

   "With all of the attacks in the posts above, none of you have actually dealt with the issue of the dangerous sexual games gays play without concern for the effects it has on the possible spread of diseases. You do nothing but make excuses, condemn christians, obfuscate your responsibilities as responsible citizens and rant about how evil we are to point out the walking hipocritical contradictions that you are.\n \n So answer this article/survey from ACT UP, a Gay Group that supports gay issues. It's less than 10 years old so don't claim it's old news. And it isn't a christian group so don't blame me for its conclusions. Try for once to actually absorb an objectively given criticism and answer it without diverting blame or condemnation to others like the philosophical cowards you're acting like.\n \n \nNow keep in mind that ACT UP is a Gay Rights Organization.\n \n ACT UP/GG survey: Nearly four of ten SF gay men are barebacking; Up from 24 percent in 1994 Stop AIDS survey \n \n The Bay Area Reporter - April 3, 1998 \n Don Howard, ACT UP/Golden Gate Writers Pool \n \n www.aegis.com/news/bar/1998/BR980401.html \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Thirty-seven percent of gay men recently surveyed by ACT UP/Golden Gate report having had unprotected anal sex as a bottom or a top in the last six months. Unprotected anal sex, sometimes referred to as barebacking, is on the rise; in 1994 24 percent of gay men reported barebacking in STOP AIDS street surveys. Although there are no definitive answers to what is driving the barebacking phenomenon, one thing seems apparent from our ACT UP survey data; current prevention programs are failing to reach everyone and many gay men are at risk. \n The statistics \n \n During March, ACT UP/Golden Gate performed an anonymous survey of 105 men who have sex with men (39 percent HIV-positive, 54 percent HIV-negative, 7 percent unsure). The survey was conducted on the street in the Castro and in two popular sex clubs (Eros and Blow Buddies) in an effort to learn more about gay men's sex habits and attitudes about changes in the HIV epidemic. Some of the results: \n \n * More than one in three men surveyed (37 percent) has been a top or a bottom in anal sex without a condom (barebacked) in the last six months (41 percent among those surveyed in sex clubs, 33 percent among those surveyed on the street). \n \n * Almost half of the those who bareback are HIV-negative or did not know their HIV status (46 percent). \n \n * More than a quarter (28 percent) of those who bareback have sex to ejaculation (nearly equal rate among both negative and positive people who bareback). \n \n * Half of the HIV-positive men in the overall survey are not worried about reinfection with HIV. \n \n * Of those who bareback, 30 percent report that they are having riskier sex now than a year ago (vs. 18 percent of those who do not bareback). \n \n Other studies, similar results \n \n Our survey results are not surprising to Dan Wohlfeiler, education director for the STOP AIDS Project, one of San Francisco's leading HIV prevention groups serving gay men. \"Your numbers aren't that different from ours,\" says Wohlfeiler. \"Ours is just a bigger sample, based on almost 22,000 surveys. Our analysis - which we did with the Department of Public Health - is literally just out of the computer and I'm glad to make it public. \n \n \"Back in 1994, 24 percent of the men our outreach volunteers spoke with reported having unprotected anal sex with two or more partners. That has steadily increased, to the point where now 33 percent report the same behavior. More worrisome: 32 percent of the guys who reported having unprotected anal sex with two or more partners did not know their partners' HIV status. So while certainly some of the unprotected sex is attributable to negotiated safety - people choosing to have sex with men of their own HIV status - these numbers show that some men are not going that route, and are having unprotected anal sex with multiple partners without finding out their partners' status.\" \n \n Mitch Katz, Director of Public Health, agrees ACT UP/Golden Gate's \"results are quite consistent with other studies, including the recent young men's study, that over 30 percent of men who have sex with men have had unprotected anal intercourse in the prior six months.\" \n \n Is it the drugs? \n \n Some speculate that there is more barebacking because gay men think that HIV is not as risky as it was before the introduction of protease inhibitors and other new treatment advances. Our survey data indicate that men who bareback seem to have somewhat more faith in the new treatments than those who do not bareback - 69 percent of the barebackers agreed (or somewhat agreed) that \"HIV was no longer the death sentence it used to be\" vs. 61 percent of the non-barebackers. \n \n Others have argued that the availability of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (using anti-HIV drugs in the hours after being exposed to stay negative) is causing gay men to abandon safer sex practices. Our survey showed a slightly higher opinion or awareness of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) among those who bareback - 24 percent of those who bareback agreed (or somewhat agreed) with the statement \"there is a morning-after pill I can take for HIV\" vs. 13 percent of those who do not bareback. \n \n Have condom-centered prevention programs failed barebackers? \n \n In our ACT UP survey, twice as many of the HIV-negative men who bareback agreed (or somewhat agreed) that they are tired of using condoms (40 percent vs. 20 percent of the HIV-negative men who did not bareback). Our survey suggests that current prevention strategies, centered around the condom code, are not relevant to the growing number of gay men who bareback: twice as many men who bareback said that current HIV prevention programs are not relevant and do not help them stay safe (37 percent for those who bareback vs. 18 percent for those who did not). \n \n Race Bannon, a local sex activist who has worked on sex panic issues, says \"I believe that the increase in barebacking is a phenomenon that is likely to continue its rise within our community and that prevention efforts must address this reality directly. While I do not personally endorse barebacking, it would be foolish to ignore its ramifications. Our community must be careful not to scapegoat in order to come up with a reason for barebacking's popularity. As with so many sexuality issues, the reasons for barebacking are complex and no one fully understands them. The convenient, but misguided, explanation would be that 'sex is the enemy' - and such a viewpoint would spawn a whole new round of sex-negative prevention campaigns that would ultimately fail.\" \n \n Tom Coates, Director of UCSF's AIDS Research Institute, agrees that prevention agencies need to address barebacking within the community. Coates says, \"the agencies should be holding conversations with the community to understand better who is barebacking and why. I think that there is probably a variety of motivations behind barebacking and we don't fully understand all of them. \n \n \"It is also the case that the message is out there, and that people think it is dangerous - and that's probably why they do it. It's both dangerous and defiant, and the gay community has always enjoyed being dangerous and defiant. That's how we got to where we are now. We need to continue to be dangerous and defiant - it pushed us ahead in the battle against AIDS - but we also need to be around so that we survive and that's why barebacking concerns me. Danger and defiance are interesting, but HIV is lethal.\" \n \n The SF Department of Public Health is in the planning phases of a study, directed by Dr. Susan Buchbinder and Dr. Grant Colfax, to determine how prevention messages need to change to reflect changes in treatment of HIV disease. In the meantime, other communities, notably Boston, have begun poster campaigns discussing misconceptions that the epidemic may be over. Clearly, the rise in bareback sex is one more indication that more needs to be done in our community to address the changes issues negative and positive men confront in keeping themselves healthy in the new era of HIV treatment. \n 980403 \n \n \n",

All from pro gay sites and organizations. So rather than criticize the age of the study, or the size of it. How about actually dealing with the reality of the problem that exists within your own community. This doesn't show homophobic straights or Christians going around poisoning gay people, it shows gay people purposely infecting each other just for the thrill and intensity of the sexual gratification of getting off. \n \n So why are you lashing out at me, the poor little messenger ? Once again the christian is victimized by the hateful gays who want to oppress and condemn us simply for loving our God and asking questions that you can't answer without admitting that you are your own worst enemies, not us whom you relish condemning at every turn.\n \n \nThe Gay Deathstyle\n \n By Marlin Maddoux\n From the forthcoming book \"Public Education Against America\" by Marlin Maddoux\n \n \n Point of View - The homosexual rights movement is built on a foundation of lies, language manipulation, and factual disinformation.\n Seeking to gain total acceptance of their destructive behaviors, their propaganda machines work ceaselessly, pumping their poisonous lies and deceptions into the cultural bloodstream of America.\n \n But one cold hard fact that is always airbrushed out of the public image of the gay lifestyle is the number of young men and women who are dying of AIDS, hepatitis, and new strains of TB, all diseases whose ascendance is largely a result of homosexual activity.\n \n For example, researchers at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia published a report in 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology that concluded: \"In a major Canadian centre, life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men. If the same pattern of mortality were to continue, we estimate that nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently 20 years of age will not reach their 65th birthday.\"\n \n Gay authors Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen write, \"Alas, it turns out that, on this point, public myth is supported by fact. There is more promiscuity among gays . . . than among straights. They cite the pattern among gay males of the \"non-stick, one-swipe, disposable lover.\" Even among \"married\" gay males, they observe, \"the cheating ratio, given enough time, approaches 100%.\"\n \n Do statistics back up Kirk and Madsen's contention that \"there is more promiscuity among gays?\" Let's look at the facts! To start with, one widely regarded study, published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, had a representative sample of non-infected male homosexuals keep sexual diaries. On the average, these gay men had 106 partners per year.\"\n \n That was just the tip of the iceberg.\n \n A survey of gay men by researchers Bell and Weinberg in the mid-1970s found that only 14 percent of gay males, and only 40 percent of lesbians, were living in \"monogamous\" relationships.\n \n And as we have seen, monogamy in the homosexual definition of the word entails a much shorter duration than the standard meaning of the term. In fact, many studies indicated that the range for a so-called monogamous relationship for a homosexual often lasts no more than nine months, almost never more than five years (and even this is extremely rare).\"\n The Bell and Weinberg study found that:\n \n 43 percent of the gay men estimated having sex with 500 or more different partners. 75 percent estimated 100 or more partners. 28 percent estimated more than 1,000 partners.\n \n 79 percent said that more than half of their partners were anonymous.\n \n 70 percent said that more than half of their partners were men with whom they had sex only once.\n A later study by these two researchers estimated that only 2 percent of homosexuals could be considered monogamous or even semi-monogamous (having ten or less lifetime partners). Lesbians are often credited with more fidelity than gay men, and this is true to a point. Yet even here, the rate of instability seems to exceed any definition of a monogamous, normal community.\n \n One study found that 38 percent of lesbians surveyed had between 11 and 300 sexual partners. Another revealed that 41 percent of lesbians admitted to having between 10 and 500 lifetime partners.\n \n Yet even snapshots of typical homosexual behavior fail to give the total picture. A sizeable percentage of the gay community is not merely promiscuous, but wildly so, and therefore at risk for AIDS.\n \n Research into at-risk or HIV-positive homosexuals reveal astonishing figures. In one study, \"homosexual men . . . reported a median of 1,160 lifetime sexual partners.\" In another, \"the median number of lifetime sexual partners of over 4,000 homosexual respondents was 49.5. Many individuals reported ranges of 300-400, and 272 of them reported over 1,000 different lifetime partners.\"\n \n Another article in the Annals of Internal Medicine listed over fifteen severe injuries, diseases, or syndromes, including rectal tearing and hepatitis A and B, that commonly occur in gay males as a direct result of oral and anal sex.\n \n The article also said that the Centers for Disease Control reported that almost half of male patients with syphilis claimed homosexual or bisexual contacts, despite the fact that gays are only a small percentage of the population. Compiled studies by leading medical researchers show that:\n \n Homosexuals account for 80 percent of America's most serious sexually transmitted diseases.\n \n Youths engaging in homosexual behavior are 23 times more likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease than strictly heterosexual youths.\n \n Lesbians are 19 times more likely than heterosexual women to have had syphilis, twice as likely to suffer from genital warts, four times as likely to have scabies.\n \n Male homosexuals are 14 times more likely to have syphilis than male heterosexuals. They are also thousands of time more likely to have AIDS.\n It is also now known that hepatitis A, and a virulent, antibiotic-resistant strain of tuberculosis are rampant in the gay community. Other self-destructive patterns have been observed. Researchers have noted a disproportionate abuse of drugs and alcohol by homosexuals, as well as higher levels of emotional mental problems, social instability and disruptive behavior.\n",

Here are the latest statistics from UNAIDS (2005, I believe): an estimated 4.1 million (3.4 million to 6.2 million) which can be found here: http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH02_en.pdf\n Let's see, that would make (just with 100,000 gays), 4 MILLION new heterosexual cases (or around 6 MILLION with the upper estimate). What do you have to say about that, AA? Why are you so nonchalant about THAT?\n \n Heck, let's go with 500,000 gay cases! That is 3.6 MILLION hetero cases! Talk about nonchalance!",

   " Simply put, I'm trying to point out by mostly pro gay, or gay friendly sources, as I've never heard of this Maddoux guy before. the point of the articles exposing the practice of barebacking parties is that within the gay community itself there are some very self destructive practices that not only harm the members of the gay community itself but because of promiscuity today and that so many gays and straights cross over sexually, that this practice can reasonably be inferred to be a major cause of the continued spread of HIV/AIDS. \n\n \n 1. To be accurate, your sources are either garbage (Maddoux is a buffoon), or simply newspapers or unscientific surveys and all out-of-date. However, I will not quibble over details. There can be no doubt there is some risky stuff going on. \n \n 2. And my response to this is, \"duh!!!\". This is widely known information. It is a rather obvious statement to say that risky sexual behavior promotes sexually transmitted disease. It always has. This is not news. \n \n My question remains, are you making some public health statement that everyone already knows about, or are you trying to disparage gays? Because if it is the latter, there are oodles of people of all stripes out there whose behavior is a detriment to society. Irresponsible, self-destructive people exist. Some of them are gay. \n \n Now, my guess is that if you look at promiscuous gay men and compare them to promiscuous straight men, I would bet the gays have more partners. This is because they CAN. Men are horn-dogs. (Probabilistically speaking more than women.) It's VERY easy to make a connection if you know where to look and if you are young and cute. Straight men usually have to pay for it to get it so quickly and easily. And to this I say, so what? Now you can say that promiscuity is bad if you like, but that's a different topic.\n \n \n \n \n It can't be denied that with medical advances, if the homosexual community was being more responsible the spread of this disease could be minimized to the point much closer to 0 than as many as 10,000 new cases in a year. Instead we get rationalizations like this from samiinh.\n \n\n \n This is another obvious and self-evident statement. You are simply saying that if the risk factors for sexually transmitted disease were reduced, there would be fewer sexually transmitted diseases. Another, duh. It has nothing to so with medical advances, either. \n \n I don't think sam is rationalizing. He is merely trying to point out that this stuff has little to do with sexual orientation per se. I think he may be reacting to your value statements like \"if the homosexual community was being more responsible\", because that is not the least bit helpful. Human behavior is bizarre at times. Why would anyone smoke? Why would anyone bareback? Admonishment from a morally superior point of view is not helpful. Maybe it makes you feel good about yourself. Public health officials try to understand why people behave the way they do. Attempts at understanding is NOT the same as condoning. You can't do anything about another person's behavior unless you understand it.

   "The \"Bug Chasing\" Myth\n \n The February 6 issue of Rolling Stone hit the shelves with a cover teaser bound to grab the attention of a lot of newsstand browsers: \"Bug Chasers, The Men Who Long To Be HIV+.\"(1) The article was a lengthy feature on a so-called \"intricate underground world\"(2) of gay men who actively seek out sexual partners infected with the HIV virus, and who then practice unprotected sex in hope of becoming infected. A frightening prospect - but one that has been roundly discredited by HIV/AIDS experts and researchers.\n \n According to the article, \"bug chasers\" celebrate and eroticize HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. To bug chasers, the story maintained, \"the virus isn't horrible and fearsome, it's beautiful and sexy-and delivered in a way that is most likely to result in infection.\" The article profiles one anonymous bug chaser called \"Carlos,\" who describes his quest to become infected with HIV.\n The article's author Gregory A. Freeman quotes San Francisco-based psychiatrist Dr. Bob Cabaj as estimating that \"at least twenty-five percent of all newly infected men\" have some bug chasing tendencies, at least subconsciously. After some analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Freeman translates Dr. Cabaj's estimate into hard numbers, and concludes that a whopping 10,000 new HIV cases in the U.S. each year are attributable to bug chasing. Conservatives ranging from talk-show host Sean Hannity to the Traditional Values Coalition swiftly commented on the numbers, suggesting that thousands of gay men are irresponsible, mentally unstable, and seeking infection with the deadly virus.\n \n However, according to many researchers, the issue of \"bug chasing\" and the statistics quoted in the Rolling Stone article are problematic and inaccurate. Even if 25 percent of new HIV infections are attributable to bug chasing, only 42 percent of the CDC's 40,000 annually reported new cases of HIV involve men who have sex with men, which means 4,200 cases would be attributable to bug chasers, rather than 10,000. Furthermore, some of the experts quoted in the original Rolling Stone article seemed to disagree with the statistics and scope of the \"bug chasing issue,\" as portrayed in the article. In an interview in Newsweek, Bob Cabaj, the psychiatrist who suggested the initial estimate of 25 percent, retracted his statement and accused Rolling Stone of misquoting him.\n \n And, according to the CDC, there is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim of 25 percent. \"We have no data to show how many people are participating in this phenomenon,\" said Jessica Frikey, a spokeswoman with the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention. \"No studies have been done to see how many 'bug chasers' there are.\"(3)\n \n Among advocates and organizations that serve gay men and people with HIV/AIDS, \"bug chasing\" is a distraction from the real issues at hand. The spread of inaccurate information misrepresents the gay community-and gay men in particular-as irresponsible and self-destructive . \"If you repeat a lie often enough, people will start to believe it,\" says Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. \"This is reminiscent of the coverage of AIDS in the 1980s, focusing on a flamboyant part of the gay male population that quickly becomes a shorthand for the entire gay community.\"(4) Other organizations and leadership are concerned that these statements foster homophobia and contribute to discrimination, while it reinforces the myth that HIV and AIDS are issues for the gay community and other marginalized groups, rather than everyone.\n \n While there aren't data to support \"Bug Chasing\" as it was described in the Rolling Stone article, there is some evidence to suggest that gay and bisexual men may be less worried about being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, than they were in the past, and this may be contributing to increased infection rates among young men in certain cities.(5) According to the CDC's 2001 report \"No Turning Back,\" some gay and bisexual men \"may have become less concerned about HIV infection because of new treatments for HIV.\" In the Rolling Stone article, Carlos talks about HIV as a minor lifestyle inconvenience, rather than a fatal disease. In Carlos's words, living with HIV is \"like living with diabetes. You take a few pills and get on with your life.\"(6) According to James Loyce, San Francisco's Deputy Director of Health for AIDS Programs, the generation of young men who have seen the epidemic change over the past 20 years may think that being infected with HIV isn't that big a deal, with all the new drug treatments available. \"They've never seen the spots from Kaposi's sarcoma,\" Loyce said, in an article in the San Francisco Chronicle. \"They've never seen people wasting away from this-they just don't have the appearance of death in their mind's eye.\"(7) However, just as these drugs are helping many people to live longer lives, they don't work for everyone, and many have toxic side effects. In addition, the cost of long-term retroviral treatment can be crippling.\n \n There is no hard evidence supporting this idea of a \"bug chasing\" trend. What is certain is that given the many physical, emotional, and financial challenges of living with HIV, prevention is still the most important component of the battle against the disease. There is still no cure for HIV/AIDS. That's why practicing safer sex, by using latex condoms and getting tested for STDS on a regular basis, continues to be so crucial for all sexually active people, both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n \n 1 Seth Mnookin, \"Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated?\" Newsweek, 1/23/03.\n 2 Gregory A. Freeman, \"In Search of Death,\" Rolling Stone, 2/6/03. Unless otherwise noted, all citations from Rolling Stone come directly from this article.\n 3 Ellen Sorokin, The Washington Times, 1/24/03. \"'Bug Chaser' AIDS Story Disputed: Doctors acknowledge some men pursue 'gift' of HIV.\"\n 4 Seth Mnookin, Media: Using 'Bug Chasers\" February 17, 2003, U.S. Edition.\n 5 CDC, 2001.

Fix the beam in your own eye before complaining about the mote in ours.

The same conclusion cannot be established if 2 gay men have sex for 50 years. So as long as sexually active gays participate in such dangerous activities as barebacking orgies which bisexuals also participate in. Then they go and have random sex with other people who may spend most of their sexual history in the straight community, then that is how it's crossing over into the straight community.\n \n I'm not saying that straights aren't also promiscuous, having gay sex for sport and even bringing the disease into the straight community. I'm pointing to a shared cause for the spread of the disease, that's all.

   "January 24, 2003 | It was an all-red, over-the-banner Drudge headline, guaranteed to grab attention. \"MAG: 25% OF NEW HIV-INFECTED GAY MEN SOUGHT OUT VIRUS, SAYS SAN FRAN HEALTH OFFICIAL.\" Drudge was referring to a four-page story by one Gregory A. Freeman , in Rolling Stone magazine, owned by gay media mogul Jann Wenner. It was quickly picked up by conservative talk-show host Sean Hannity, who never misses an opportunity to denigrate gay men. For many who witnessed the media onslaught, it will soon be accepted as fact.\n \n That's a shame, because not long after hitting the newsstands, the story has completely fallen apart.\n \n The story centers on a bizarre sub-subcultural phenomenon known as \"bug chasing.\" A few HIV-negative gay men, for all sorts of deep and dark psychological reasons, appear actually to be seeking out HIV infection. Some HIV-positive men, it is also alleged, are just as willing to infect these troubled souls with HIV. This disturbing phenomenon is not new. There were occasional stories about it in the late 1990s, stories that fueled an urban legend but that never made it to the mainstream. Why? Because of simple lack of hard evidence that anyone but a very few disturbed people were involved.\n \n How widespread is this phenomenon today? According to the Rolling Stone story, a jaw-dropping 25 percent of new gay male HIV infections are due to bug chasing. That's an astonishing statistic, and it's what made this sub-subcultural practice suddenly an actual news story, worth four pages of Rolling Stone and a headline on Drudge. It's the hinge on which the merit of this story hangs. If true, we should indeed be alarmed.\n \n But now for the obvious follow-up: Which study found this alarming result? The answer is: none. The entire premise for the story, as published, is based on one doctor's \"estimate.\" And the more you read the story, the thinner it gets. How many actual bug chasers are interviewed? A grand total of two, one of whom -- the one who provides all the most lurid quotes -- is clearly disturbed and is given a pseudonym. How many HIV-positive \"gift givers\" are interviewed? None. So there you have it. One anonymous source; one named source; one doctor's completely unsubstantiated estimate; and lurid details from some Web sites. None of the major AIDS and gay specialists interviewed by Freeman agreed that this was a major phenomenon, let alone responsible for 25 percent of all new HIV infections.",

People can be just stupid when it comes to sex, no matter what their God-given orientation.\n\n \n In spite of the attacks on me in this thread and the implications that I have some vendetta against gay's, I have not said once that this is specifically a gay issue and that straights are innocent of also being dangerously promiscuous. My overall point has attempted to be that we are unavoidably connected because of socialization so whatever happens in the gay community affects the straight community and vice versa.",

This is what I mean by the mixing of fluids, even between the same two people after an extensive amount of time could wear down their resistance to infection and eventually make one of them sick. But in this World, monogamy is also a rare commodity in the gay community for an extended period of time so multiple partners is normal rather than the exception. I don't know about you but I find this info very disturbing indeed. And remember I didn't write it, I'm just posting it. But the rectal section actually scares me that people can participate in such acts.\n \n http://www.familyresearchinst.org/FRI_EduPamphlet3.html\n \n ORAL SEX Homosexuals fellate almost all of their sexual contacts (and ingest semen from about half of these). Semen contains many of the germs carried in the blood. Because of this, gays who practice oral sex verge on consuming raw human blood, with all its medical risks. Since the penis often has tiny lesions (and often will have been in unsanitary places such as a rectum), individuals so involved may become infected with hepatitis A or gonorrhea (and even HIV and hepatitis B). Since many contacts occur between strangers (70% of gays estimated that they had had sex only once with over half of their partners17,27), and gays average somewhere between 106 and 1105 different partners/year, the potential for infection is considerable.\n \n RECTAL SEX Surveys indicate that about 90% of gays have engaged in rectal intercourse, and about two-thirds do it regularly. In a 6-month long study of daily sexual diaries,3 gays averaged 110 sex partners and 68 rectal encounters a year.\n \n Rectal sex is dangerous. During rectal intercourse the rectum becomes a mixing bowl for 1) saliva and its germs and/or an artificial lubricant, 2) the recipient's own feces, 3) whatever germs, infections or substances the penis has on it, and 4) the seminal fluid of the inserter. Since sperm readily penetrate the rectal wall (which is only one cell thick) causing immunologic damage, and tearing or bruising of the anal wall is very common during anal/penile sex, these substances gain almost direct access to the blood stream. Unlike heterosexual intercourse (in which sperm cannot penetrate the multilayered vagina and no feces are present),7 rectal intercourse is probably the most sexually efficient way to spread hepatitis B, HIV syphilis and a host of other blood-borne diseases.\n \n Tearing or ripping of the anal wall is especially likely with \"fisting,\" where the hand and arm is inserted into the rectum. It is also common when \"toys\" are employed (homosexual lingo for objects which are inserted into the rectum--bottles, carrots, even gerbils8). The risk of contamination and/or having to wear a colostomy bag from such \"sport\" is very real. Fisting was apparently so rare in Kinsey's time that he didn't think to talk about it. By 1977, well over a third of gays admitted to doing it. The rectum was not designed to accommodate the fist, and those who do so can find themselves consigned to diapers for life.\n \n FECAL SEX About 80% of gays (see Table) admit to licking and/or inserting their tongues into the anus of partners and thus ingesting medically significant amounts of feces. Those who eat or wallow in it are probably at even greater risk. In the diary study,5 70% of the gays had engaged in this activity--half regularly over 6 months. Result? --the \"annual incidence of hepatitis A in...homosexual men was 22 percent, whereas no heterosexual men acquired hepatitis A.\" In 1992,26 it was noted that the proportion of London gays engaging in oral/anal sex had not declined since 1984.\n \n While the body has defenses against fecal germs, exposure to the fecal discharge of dozens of strangers each year is extremely unhealthy. Ingestion of human waste is the major route of contracting hepatitis A and the enteric parasites collectively known as the Gay Bowel Syndrome. Consumption of feces has also been implicated in the transmission of typhoid fever,9 herpes, and cancer.27 About 10% of gays have eaten or played with [e.g., enemas, wallowing in feces]. The San Francisco Department of Public Health saw 75,000 patients per year, of whom 70 to 80 per cent are homosexual men....An average of 10 per cent of all patients and asymptomatic contacts reported...because of positive fecal samples or cultures for amoeba, giardia, and shigella infections were employed as food handlers in public establishments; almost 5 per cent of those with hepatitis A were similarly employed.\"10 In 1976, a rare airborne scarlet fever broke out among gays and just missed sweeping through San Francisco.10 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that 29% of the hepatitis A cases in Denver, 66% in New York, 50% in San Francisco, 56% in Toronto, 42% in Montreal and 26% in Melbourne in the first six months of 1991 were among gays.11 A 1982 study \"suggested that some transmission from the homosexual group to the general population may have occurred.\"12\n \n URINE SEX About 10% of Kinsey's gays reported having engaged in \"golden showers\" [drinking or being splashed with urine]. In the largest survey of gays ever conducted,13 23% admitted to urine-sex. In the largest random survey of gays,6 29% reported urine-sex. In a San Francisco study of 655 gays,14 only 24% claimed to have been monogamous in the past year. Of these monogamous gays, 5% drank urine, 7% practiced \"fisting,\" 33% ingested feces via anal/oral contact, 53% swallowed semen, and 59% received semen in their rectum during the previous month.\n \n OTHER GAY SEX PRACTICES\n \n SADOMASOCHISM as the Table indicates, a large minority of gays engage in torture for sexual fun. Sex with minors 25% of white gays17 admitted to sex with boys 16 or younger as adults. In a 9-state study,30 33% of the 181 male, and 22% of the 18 female teachers caught molesting students did so homosexually (though less than 3% of men and 2% of women engage in homosexuality31). Depending on the study, the percent of gays reporting sex in public restrooms ranged from 14%16 to 41%13 to 66%,6 9%16, 60%13 and 67%5 reported sex in gay baths; 64%16 and 90%18 said that they used illegal drugs.\n \n Fear of AIDS may have reduced the volume of gay sex partners, but the numbers are prodigious by any standard. Morin15 reported that 824 gays had lowered their sex-rate from 70 different partners/yr. in 1982 to 50/yr. by 1984. McKusick14 reported declines from 76/yr. to 47/yr. in 1985. In Spain32 the average was 42/yr. in 1989.\n \n Medical Consequences of Homosexual Sex\n \n Death and disease accompany promiscuous and unsanitary sexual activity. 70%25 to 78%x,13 of gays reported having had a sexually transmitted disease. The proportion with intestinal parasites (worms, flukes, amoeba) ranged from 25%18 to 39%19 to 59%.20 As of 1992, 83% of U.S. AIDS in whites had occurred in gays.21 The Seattle sexual diary study3? reported that gays had, on a yearly average:\n \n fellated 108 men and swallowed semen from 48;\n exchanged saliva with 96;\n experienced 68 penile penetrations of the anus; and\n ingested fecal material from 19.\n No wonder 10% came down with hepatitis B and 7% contracted hepatitis A during the 6-month study.",

   "The \"Bug Chasing\" Myth\n \n The February 6 issue of Rolling Stone hit the shelves with a cover teaser bound to grab the attention of a lot of newsstand browsers: \"Bug Chasers, The Men Who Long To Be HIV+.\"(1) The article was a lengthy feature on a so-called \"intricate underground world\"(2) of gay men who actively seek out sexual partners infected with the HIV virus, and who then practice unprotected sex in hope of becoming infected. A frightening prospect - but one that has been roundly discredited by HIV/AIDS experts and researchers.\n \n According to the article, \"bug chasers\" celebrate and eroticize HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. To bug chasers, the story maintained, \"the virus isn't horrible and fearsome, it's beautiful and sexy-and delivered in a way that is most likely to result in infection.\" The article profiles one anonymous bug chaser called \"Carlos,\" who describes his quest to become infected with HIV.\n The article's author Gregory A. Freeman quotes San Francisco-based psychiatrist Dr. Bob Cabaj as estimating that \"at least twenty-five percent of all newly infected men\" have some bug chasing tendencies, at least subconsciously. After some analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Freeman translates Dr. Cabaj's estimate into hard numbers, and concludes that a whopping 10,000 new HIV cases in the U.S. each year are attributable to bug chasing. Conservatives ranging from talk-show host Sean Hannity to the Traditional Values Coalition swiftly commented on the numbers, suggesting that thousands of gay men are irresponsible, mentally unstable, and seeking infection with the deadly virus.\n \n However, according to many researchers, the issue of \"bug chasing\" and the statistics quoted in the Rolling Stone article are problematic and inaccurate. Even if 25 percent of new HIV infections are attributable to bug chasing, only 42 percent of the CDC's 40,000 annually reported new cases of HIV involve men who have sex with men, which means 4,200 cases would be attributable to bug chasers, rather than 10,000. Furthermore, some of the experts quoted in the original Rolling Stone article seemed to disagree with the statistics and scope of the \"bug chasing issue,\" as portrayed in the article. In an interview in Newsweek, Bob Cabaj, the psychiatrist who suggested the initial estimate of 25 percent, retracted his statement and accused Rolling Stone of misquoting him.\n \n And, according to the CDC, there is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim of 25 percent. \"We have no data to show how many people are participating in this phenomenon,\" said Jessica Frikey, a spokeswoman with the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention. \"No studies have been done to see how many 'bug chasers' there are.\"(3)\n \n Among advocates and organizations that serve gay men and people with HIV/AIDS, \"bug chasing\" is a distraction from the real issues at hand. The spread of inaccurate information misrepresents the gay community-and gay men in particular-as irresponsible and self-destructive . \"If you repeat a lie often enough, people will start to believe it,\" says Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. \"This is reminiscent of the coverage of AIDS in the 1980s, focusing on a flamboyant part of the gay male population that quickly becomes a shorthand for the entire gay community.\"(4) Other organizations and leadership are concerned that these statements foster homophobia and contribute to discrimination, while it reinforces the myth that HIV and AIDS are issues for the gay community and other marginalized groups, rather than everyone.\n \n While there aren't data to support \"Bug Chasing\" as it was described in the Rolling Stone article, there is some evidence to suggest that gay and bisexual men may be less worried about being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, than they were in the past, and this may be contributing to increased infection rates among young men in certain cities.(5) According to the CDC's 2001 report \"No Turning Back,\" some gay and bisexual men \"may have become less concerned about HIV infection because of new treatments for HIV.\" In the Rolling Stone article, Carlos talks about HIV as a minor lifestyle inconvenience, rather than a fatal disease. In Carlos's words, living with HIV is \"like living with diabetes. You take a few pills and get on with your life.\"(6) According to James Loyce, San Francisco's Deputy Director of Health for AIDS Programs, the generation of young men who have seen the epidemic change over the past 20 years may think that being infected with HIV isn't that big a deal, with all the new drug treatments available. \"They've never seen the spots from Kaposi's sarcoma,\" Loyce said, in an article in the San Francisco Chronicle. \"They've never seen people wasting away from this-they just don't have the appearance of death in their mind's eye.\"(7) However, just as these drugs are helping many people to live longer lives, they don't work for everyone, and many have toxic side effects. In addition, the cost of long-term retroviral treatment can be crippling.\n \n There is no hard evidence supporting this idea of a \"bug chasing\" trend. What is certain is that given the many physical, emotional, and financial challenges of living with HIV, prevention is still the most important component of the battle against the disease. There is still no cure for HIV/AIDS. That's why practicing safer sex, by using latex condoms and getting tested for STDS on a regular basis, continues to be so crucial for all sexually active people, both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n \n 1 Seth Mnookin, \"Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated?\" Newsweek, 1/23/03.\n 2 Gregory A.

   "The Researcher Who Make It UP\n \n Paul Cameron vs. Professional Ethics\n Jim Burroway\n March 21, 2006\n \n Right now, here in Lincoln, there is a 4-year-old boy who has had his genitals almost severed from his body at Gateway in the rest room with a homosexual act... It's really awkward. I could see where Gateway would want to suppress this. I could see where the parents would want to suppress it. It could be just a rumor. But enough things have happened recently so that such a thing doesn't have to be invented.1\n \n In 1982, Paul Cameron stunned a gathering to discuss a proposed addition to Lincoln, Nebraska's human rights ordinance covering sexual orientation. His sensational charge was immediately picked up by the local television stations and newspapers, where it quickly spread throughout the panic-stricken city.\n \n He may have said that \"such a thing doesn't have to be invented,\" but it turns out that this is exactly what he did. He invented it out of whole cloth. When the local news media investigated the story, they found the local police baffled - nothing like it had been reported. Reporters then checked all area hospitals, but none reported any admissions for what would clearly be a very grave injury. In the end, they determined that it simply didn't happen. Dr. Cameron made it all up.\n \n When the story was finally revealed as a hoax, the Lincoln Star blasted Dr. Cameron in an editorial:\n \n A leading opponent of the proposed Lincoln Human Rights Amendment spreads rumors of an alleged vicious incident calculated to damage the proposal's chances at the polls. When asked about it, he admits the rumor was without foundation. He refused to say from whom he heard the rumor. Nonetheless, he still insists it 'could be true', even though responsible authorities in the city say there was not a shred of evidence such an incident ever took place. The seed is planted, to the contrary.2\n \n Indeed, it may have worked. Lincoln voters voted down the gay rights ordinance by a four-to-one margin, and Dr. Cameron was thrust into national prominence as one of the foremost \"experts\" among anti-gay activists.\n \n Dr. Cameron, Chairman of the Family Research Institute, had been a published researcher for more than seventeen years before he became active in anti-gay politics. Yet until the early 1980's, he had published very little about sexuality. His published research bounced between such varied topics as issues surrounding aging, the effects of second-hand smoke, and the health benefits of pet ownership. He published a very short two-page article on the amount of time thinking about sex in 1967,3 followed shortly by another obscure article that discusses Freudian psychosexual development.4 Besides a paper on homosexuality in the obscure Human Life Review in 1978,5 there was little in his past to suggest that he would become the primary source for \"scientific\" data in the world of anti-gay politics.",

   "Paul Cameron: A Rightwing Charlton.\n \n After six other psychologists complained that he had deliberately misrepresented of their work in his anti-gay writings, the American Psychological Association (APA) began an investigation. They finally notified him on December 2, 1983, that the board voted to drop him from the membership \"for lack of cooperation with the Committee on Scientific and Professional Ethics and Conduct.\"6 In Dr. Cameron's rebuttal posted on his web site, he said he had already resigned from the APA on November 7, and that his resignation was accepted.7 But like most professional organizations, the APA cannot accept the resignation of a member while he is under investigation. This is a very common rule, meant to prevent a member from short-circuiting an ethics investigation. Meanwhile, the APA has taken extraordinary measures to disassociate themselves from him.\n \n But none of this fazed Dr. Cameron. When he misused Dr. A Nicolas Groth's research in a pamphlet entitled \"Child Molestation and Homosexuality,\" Dr. Groth wrote the Nebraska Board of Examiners of Psychologists on August 21, 1984 that Dr. Cameron:\n \n [Dr. Cameron] misrepresents my findings and distorts them to advance his homophobic views. I make a very clear distinction in my writing between pedophilia and homosexuality, noting that adult males who sexually victimize young boys are either pedophilic or heterosexual, and that in my research I have not found homosexual men turning away from adult partners to children.\n \n I consider this totally unprofessional behavior on the part of Dr. Cameron and I want to bring this to your attention. He disgraces his profession.8\n \n This led the Nebraska Psychological Association to pass a resolution on October 19, 1984, saying that it \"formally disassociates itself from the representations and interpretations of scientific literature offered by Dr. Paul Cameron in his writing and public statement on sexuality.\"9",

   "The Fabulist\n Anti-gay researcher Paul Cameron's falsehoods are well known. The incredible thing is the people who still cite them.\n By David Holthouse\n \n While he makes no attempt to disguise his personal bias, Cameron dresses up his studies with footnotes, bibliographies and charts, and then publishes them in bogus \"academic\" journals. His work is propaganda masquerading as science and has been repeatedly unmasked as such by many legitimate scientists. Cameron himself has been cast out of both the American Psychological Association and the American Sociological Association. The ASA declared that, \"Dr. Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented sociological research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism.\"\n \n But no matter how low his professional reputation sinks or how patently ludicrous his findings become (one recent Cameron study concluded that lesbians are 300 times more likely to die in car accidents than heterosexual women), the social impact of Cameron's so-called research far exceeds that of all but a few genuine research psychologists. Cameron's findings are repeated ad nauseam by lawmakers, radio talk show hosts, preachers and anti-gay activists across the country. In 2003, his research was cited by dissenting justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Court in the case that led to legalizing same-sex marriage in that state. In 2004, a majority decision by the Florida Supreme Court that upheld a law banning adoption by same-sex couples specifically cited Cameron's research as being \"consonant with the notion that children raised by homosexuals disproportionately experience emotional disturbance and sexual victimization.\"\n \n Religious right action groups including Focus on the Family, the American Family Association, the Family Research Council and the Traditional Values Coalition promote Cameron's statistics on their Web sites. The Christian Communications Network, a public relations firm run by anti-abortion zealot Gary McCullough -- media adviser to Operation Rescue and the parents of Terri Schiavo, whose feeding tube removal sparked a major controversy -- publicizes Cameron's findings to religious newspapers and helps distribute tens of thousands of his heavily footnoted pamphlets to church congregations.\n \n Not one of Cameron's anti-gay studies has been published in a respected scientific journal with rigorous content review standards. Instead, Cameron props up his fa\u00e7ade of credibility by publishing his studies in Psychological Reports, a Montana-based vanity magazine that advertises itself as \"The Scientific Manifestation of Free Speech\" and will publish practically anything for $27.50 per page.\n \n Unlike a serious academic journal, Psychological Reports does not employ a stringent peer review panel of scientists to guard against flawed studies. But its title looks good in footnotes, and Cameron has been publishing his work in the magazine since 1972, long before he joined the anti-gay crusade. His first study in Psychological Reports concerned the relationship between pet and non-pet owners and animals. Cameron concluded that pet owners are far more likely to be kind to animals than non-pet owners.\n \n Frauds, charltans, quacks....these are the sources that hate mongers use to support their evil thinking. These people who believe themselves to be Christian and promote these sources will rot in their own hell.",

   "Here is a speech given by AIDS Activist and carrier Larry Kramer that I got off the ACT UP Site. I don't want to imply that I agree with any of his extreme and bigoted social commentary, but he deals with the high risk sex and meth use that is common in the gay community and warns the young about the risks of such activities. He actually apologizes for bringing up barebacking and the consequences of participating in sex parties and orgies where these dangerous sex acts are common place as if he's breaking some unspoken cardinal rule for even mentioning these things. \n \n I dare you to call this speech slanted, bigoted, discredited or not credible as a gay spokesman. Here's an excerpt from the speech:\n \n http://www.actupny.org/reports/kramer_speech11-04.html \n \n The Aids service organizations are all about to collapse. No money. And\n the problem is too big to handle anymore. We have not slowed this thing\n down at all. $100 billion we're spending on Iraq. This is a conscious\n choice by our \"leaders\" and by a large portion of the population of this\n country. They have in their infinite and never-ending cruelty decided this\n was the most effective thing to do with 100 billion dollars that might\n also end Aids, and a few other things like worldwide hunger. But the cabal\n doesn't care about these. People say: well we can't take care of the rest\n of the world. That is so stupid. The rest of the world is us. We are so\n intertwined geopolitically that we cannot separate ourselves off into\n parts, into sections. Those days are over. If they ever were here. We have\n everything required to save the world except the will to do it. In a\n recent New Yorker piece Michael Specter writes that because of Aids Russia\n is on its way to disappearing. Disappearing. Imagine that.\n \n The immense knowledge we have learned about Aids has provided us with\n precious little more than that knowledge. HIV/AIDS is now the worst\n disaster in recorded human history. In parts of Africa 7,000 people are\n infecting each other each and every day. We who are here are XXXXXX if we\n think this fact is not going to alter our lives mightily. If your company\n loses enough world markets, which it most certainly will, you are going to\n lose your job. You will not have health insurance, for a start. And for a\n finish. Economies are simply going to collapse. This is already happening.\n \n In 1990, that is some nine years into what was happening, 46% of gay men\n in San Francisco were still ####ing without condoms.\n \n 60% of the syphilis in America today is in gay men. Excuse me, men who\n have sex with men.\n \n Palm Springs has the highest number of syphilis cases in California. Palm\n Springs?\n \n I do not want to hear each week how many more of you are becoming hooked\n on meth.\n \n HIV infections are up as much as 40%.\n \n You cannot continue to allow yourselves and each other to act and live\n like this!\n \n One of these days the miraculous drugs we have to keep us alive are going\n to stop working. Our systems cannot process these extreme chemotherapies\n indefinitely. That is what we are on. We are on daily chemotherapy. No one\n wants to call it that. We call it the cocktail. We are on chemotherapy!\n Chemotherapy either kills the disease or kills us! What are we going to do\n when they don't work any longer?\n \n Some 70 million people so far are expected to die. \"July 3, 1981, Rare\n cancer seen in 41 homosexuals.\" When I first started yelling about\n whatever it was there were 41 cases. THERE ARE NOW OVER 70 MILLION WHO\n HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH HIV. Somebody up there is really listening, don't\n you think? There is no way that all infected people can be saved. No one\n ever says that out loud. Have you noticed? Somehow in some dream world we\n are going to get treatment into 70 million people. It is never going to\n happen. IT IS TOO LATE. We told them. But they didn't do anything. Did you\n notice? Nobody every does anything. I hope it's finally dawning on you\n that maybe they didn't and don't want to. So, in case you haven't noticed,\n we have lost the war against Aids. I thought I'd tell you that, too. I\n hope you might have noticed. I can't tell.\n \n The President refuses to buy generic drugs for dying people. He is still\n saying he is waiting to hear if they are safe. These drugs have been\n approved. In some cases for several years. Does this sound like a\n President who wants to save anyone?\n \n I do not understand why some of you believe that because we have drugs\n that deal with the virus more or less effectively that it is worth the\n gamble to have unprotected sex. These drugs are not easy to take. There\n are many side effects. Not life- but certainly comfort-threatening. I must\n allow at least one day out of every week or two to feel really ######, to\n have no sleep, to be constipated, to have diarrhea, to require blood tests\n and monitoring at hospitals or in doctors' offices, and to have the\n shakes. The shakes, which come often, are not useful with a mouse or\n reading a newspaper or with a lover in your arms. And I don't enjoy eating\n anymore. Keeping on weight is a constant problem. I have dry mouth. I get\n up six or seven times a night to pee. Many of the meds we are now taking\n are new meds and were approved quickly and side effects have a sneaky way\n of showing up after FDA approval, not before. I recently discovered that I\n was taking an FDA approved dose of Viread that has turned out to be five\n times the amount I actually need. We are all probably taking too much or\n too little of every single one of our drugs. Doctors don't want to test\n for this; tests are not readily available. You have to do a lot of\n homework yourselves on these drugs. Is a #### without a condom worth not\n being able to taste food? Obviously for too many of you it is.\n \n My lover often sits on top of me to make me eat. The first time this\n happened I was in the hospital just after my liver transplant and I\n wouldn't eat and Dr. Fung said I had to eat, or else I would die, and I\n just couldn't eat (do you know how strange this is to someone who was\n always on a diet?). It was New Year's Eve. We were in beautiful downtown\n Pittsburgh. David had brought a hamper filled with my favorite dishes. And\n I could not eat anything. Furiously he crawled into bed with me, boots and\n all, and started to cry. \"We haven't come this far for you to die because\n you won't eat,\" he screamed, tears streaming down his face. I will never\n forget that. I will never forget this man I love so much in bed with me\n with his snowy boots on starting slowly to spoon into me whatever he'd\n made and I trying so desperately hard to swallow it, looking at him, this\n man I love so much, doing this for me, both of us now bawling our eyes out\n and hugging each other in this strange bed in this strange town, wondering\n how we got here.\n \n It's so wonderful being a gay person. I said that before. I'm going to say\n it again. I love being gay. And I love gay people. I think we're better\n than other people. I really do. I think we're smarter and more talented\n and more aware and I do, I do, I totally do. And I think we're more tuned\n in to what's happening, tuned into the moment, tuned into our emotions,\n and other people's emotions, and we're better friends. I really do think\n all of these things. And I try not to forget them.\n \n Since the very first day of this plague we have been given, almost as if\n by some cosmic intentionality, American leaders who most assuredly wish us\n dead. There can no longer be any way to deny this fact. Each day brings\n more and more acts of hatred. Tell me it is not so. Tell me that the\n amount of good that is being attempted is not totally and intentionally\n overwhelmed by the evil. Point out to me how this is not so. I cannot see\n it. I have been unable to see it since July 3, 1981. I thought it was\n because it was a tricky virus. That is what we have been told. It's a very\n tricky virus. I hoped for a while. But we are being played for chumps and\n it has been so since July 3, 1981. And we never saw it.\n \n We of course continue to be in our usual state of total denial and\n disarray. Whatever structure the gay world had, if we ever had one, is\n gone. Our organizations stink. Almost every single one of them. I cannot\n think of one single gay organization that despite the best will in the\n world is now anything but worthless to us. Oh maybe one or two. We have no\n power. Nobody listens to us. We have no access to power. The cabal\n disdains us totally. We are completely disposable. It is a horror show.\n There is not one single person in Washington who will get us or give us\n anything but #### and more ####. I'm sorry. This is where we are now.\n Nowhere. And you expect me to cry for you if you get hooked on meth or\n can't stop the circuit parties or the orgies. OK, I feel sorry for you.\n Does that change anything? I would say I feel sorry for myself, but I\n don't. I know I am fighting as hard as I can. I may not be getting\n anywhere but I am trying. It's exhausting and I have to do it every day,\n every single day, like taking my meds which if I stop I know my body will\n cease doing something or other. I have accidentally missed a few days of\n meds and boy do I know fast that was a mistake.\n \n I fear for us as a people. Is that crazy? I am always being called crazy\n by somebody. I love being called crazy. That's a sign to me that I'm on\n the right track. Maybe it takes a crazy person to see into the future and\n see what's coming. Straight people say \"my how much progress gay people\n are making. Isn't that Will and Grace wonderful.\" If it's so wonderful why\n am I scared to death? More and more I am filled with dread. That is my\n truth that I bring to you today. Larry is scared. Do you see what I see? I\n don't think so. Most gay people I see appear to me to act as if they're\n bored to death. Too much time on your hands, my mother would say. Hell, if\n you have time to get hooked on crystal and do your endless rounds of\n sex-seeking, you have too much time on your hands. Ah, you say, aren't we\n to have a little fun? Can't I get stoned and try barebacking one last\n time. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR ####ING MIND! At this moment in our history, no,\n you cannot. Anyway, we had your fun and look what it got us into. And it\n is still getting us into. You kids want to die? Because that's what I\n sometimes think. Well, then, die.\n \n You cannot continue to allow yourselves and each other to act and live\n like this!\n \n And by the way, when are you going to realize that for the rest of your\n lives, probably for the rest of life on earth, you are never going to be\n able to have sex with another person without a condom! Never! Every time\n you even so much as consider this I want you to hear my voice screaming\n like crazy in your ears. STOP! DON'T! NEVER! NO WAY, JOSE! Canadian\n scientists now warn that even partners who are both un-infected should\n practice safe sex. As I understand it, more and more new viruses and\n mutant viruses and partial viruses that are not understood are floating\n around. Are you ready for that one?\n \n Does it ever occur to you how much you have been robbed by both your\n country and your behavior? America let the men who should have carved out\n a space for you in the social discourse, the development of your history\n and being, America let these men who should have been your role models\n die. So there is this big empty space in which you live. And you don't\n know where to go or how to fill it in. This is not my original thought but\n Michael Brown's of the NYU gay student organizations that helped to bring\n me here, who gave me this to think about. It is sad for a young gay person\n to feel this way.\n \n I had people to follow and many of you have not. No baton was passed to\n you. In a way you must start everything over. You must invent a world from\n which you can move forward from. This is both an extraordinarily exciting\n challenge and a terrifying one, one that can just as easily leave you by\n the wayside as make a new man of you. I say man because it is gay men who\n appear to have the greatest difficulty, it seems to me, in moving forward,\n getting off their particular dime.\n \n Many of you deny the horrors of what happened to your predecessors. That\n is something I do not understand. Every moral code I know of requires\n respect for the dead. I often hear that many of you don't want to know\n about them or admit to them. You disdain anyone older who was there.\n \n This is denial of a most destructive nature. You cannot move forward\n without accepting your past. I am going to say that again. We cannot move\n forward without accepting and understanding our past. We were as varied as\n you are. We were no different, really. We were very different from those\n who preceded us. We were the first free gay generation and we were\n murdered because of our freedom. And yes you were robbed of this freedom\n that for obvious reasons could not be passed on to you as your heritage.\n So instead of being understanding of all this, you condemn your\n predecessors to non-existence and flounder into a future that you seem\n unable to fashion into anything you can hold on to that gives you\n emotional sustenance. You refuse to be part of any community. But if you\n don't have any community you have no political strength. You are too busy\n denying and disassociating to know that. You do not seem able, it seems to\n me, to fashion your future. To discover what you want. You don't even ask\n what you want. You don't even ask what you need. Your needs are as mighty\n as needs always have been, but you don't ask what they are, which amazes\n me. How can you not have curiosity about your future as a gay person?\n Don't you want to go anywhere? Do you want to stay where you are? That is\n too bad if you do because we are about to enter a place more monstrously\n worse. You can deny that, as you deny those of us who went before you, but\n just know that down this path of your numerous denials lies your own\n continued destruction, the continuing destruction of gay people as gay\n people, which this cabal of haters I shall shortly describe, and its\n supporters, which are legion, are intent on accomplishing with\n increasingly ruthless vengeance. If you do not fight back you will be\n murdered in ways just as hideous as the ways in which we got murdered.\n \n Every single president since 1981 has denied our existence and denied the\n existence of AIDS. And we let them get away with it. Oh a few thousand of\n us fought for the drugs that we got but many millions of us did nothing\n and of course an enormous number of them died. They died because they lost\n their health along their journey of non-involvement and their lack of\n responsibility to their brothers and sisters. Instead of learning from\n this lesson, you are repeating it. And you are acting like this with your\n health intact, many of you, which strikes me as even more perverse than\n what your dead predecessors did to destroy themselves.\n \n Does it occur to you that we brought this plague of aids upon ourselves? I\n know I am getting into dangerous waters here but it is time. With the\n cabal breathing even more murderously down our backs it is time. And you\n are still doing it. You are still murdering each other. Please stop with\n all the generalizations and avoidance excuses gays have used since the\n beginning to ditch this responsibility for this fact. From the very first\n moment we were told in 1981 that the suspected cause was a virus, gay men\n have refused to accept our responsibility for choosing not to listen, and,\n starting in 1984, when we were told it definitely was a virus, this\n behavior turned murderous. Make whatever excuses you can to carry on\n living in your state of denial but this is the fact of the matter. I wish\n we could understand and take some responsibility for the fact that for\n some 30 years we have been murdering each other with great facility and\n that down deep inside of us, we knew what we were doing. Don't tell me you\n have never had sex without thinking down deep that there was more involved\n in what you were doing than just maintaining a hard-on.\n \n I have recently gone through my diaries of the worst of the plague years.\n I saw day after day a notation of another friend's death. I listed all the\n ones I'd slept with. There were a couple hundred. Was it my sperm that\n killed them, that did the trick? It is no longer possible for me to avoid\n this question of myself. Have you ever wondered how many men you killed? I\n know I murdered some of them. I just know. You know how you sometimes know\n things? I know. Several hundred over a bunch of years, I have to have\n murdered some of them, planting in him the original seed. I have put this\n to several doctors. Mostly they refuse to discuss it, even if they are\n gay. Most doctors do not like to discuss sex or what we do or did. (I\n still have not heard a consensus on the true dangers of oral sex, for\n instance.) They play blind. God knows what they must be thinking when they\n examine us. Particularly if they aren't gay. One doctor answered me, it\n takes two to tango so you cannot take the responsibility alone. But in\n some cases it isn't so easy to answer so flippantly. The sweet young boy\n who didn't know anything and was in awe of me. I was the first man who\n ####ed him. I think I murdered him. The old boyfriend who did not want to\n go to bed with me and I made him. The man I let #### me because I was\n trying to make my then boyfriend, now lover, jealous. I know, by the way,\n that that other one is the one who infected me. You know how you sometime\n know things? I know he infected me. I tried to murder myself on that one.\n \n Has it never, ever occurred to you that not using a condom is tantamount\n to murder? I cannot believe you have never considered this. It is such a\n simple and intelligent thought to have. And we all should have had it from\n day one. Why didn't we? That has been haunting me for a while, that\n question. Why didn't we? It is incredibly selfish not to have at least\n thought that question at that moment, all those moments when we were\n playing Russian roulette.\n \n From here on I am going to get even more complicated. I want you to pay\n attention. This is the most important part of this speech.\n ",

   "Here is a speech given by AIDS Activist and carrier Larry Kramer that I got off the ACT UP Site. I don't want to imply that I agree with any of his extreme and bigoted social commentary, but he deals with the high risk sex and meth use that is common in the gay community and warns the young about the risks of such activities. He actually apologizes for bringing up barebacking and the consequences of participating in sex parties and orgies where these dangerous sex acts are common place as if he's breaking some unspoken cardinal rule for even mentioning these things. \n \n I dare you to call this speech slanted, bigoted, discredited or not credible as a gay spokesman. Here's an excerpt from the speech\n\n \n \n Archie, Archie.\n This is an example of the power of the Internet. There is a lot of information out there. You could never be accused of having a discerning approach to throwing up information you find somewhere. (The fact that you actually buy Paul Cameron's foolishness is an indication of your ability to discriminate.) It is though you are friendziedly rooting through the web until you sniff out and gobble up some tiny piece of data that may or may not have something to do with some thing you are trying to say and you regurgitate it up before your little noggin knows what it has done. \n \n In this case you actually seem to have posted something of substance. Even a broken clock is correct twice a day. I suppose I should give you credit for actually posting something from a creditable source. But I won't. I refuse to believe you scrutinize anything (that would require critical thought) and I believe it is much more likely you merely got lucky.\n \n Do you have any idea who Larry Kramer is? I am sure you don't. The way you speak of the AIDS epidemic has been out of vague recollection from someone who really knows nothing about it. Your only interest in this tragedy is to disparage gays. No surprise, you do not behave like a caring person.\n \n Larry Kramer is perhaps the poster child for AIDS activism. He has been in the thick of it. I think he actually founded Act Up and the NY Gay Men Health Crisis center. He has been there from the beginning and continues to fight for what he believes. He has been through the wringer lately as well. He is really in-your-face and more than a little nuts at times, but he is thoughtful, intelligent and sincere. You should read XXXXXXX.\n \n So yes, this is a reputable source. Clap. Clap.\n What are we to glean from this?\n Which parts are we supposed to agree with? You state there is \"his extreme and bigoted social commentary\", so which parts are OK, and which parts are not. Are we supposed to agree he is on target with the parts that lament the foolish behavior of gay men, but think he is full of baloney for the other stuff?\n \n Kinda like reading the bible, pick and choose what you like, huh?\n \n Even so, here is an example of a highly respected (at least of another generation) activist and author who is accusing young gay men of behaving recklessly. What more do you want? Again, no one is denying the unacceptable behavior. It is well known; you are not uncovering any secrets. Members of the community are speaking out. Happy?",

   "Not if Gays continued having bareback parties it wouldn't. And what would happen to the human species if the only members of it who can procreate stopped having sex ? Do you realize how ridiculous your suggestion is ?\n\n \n Don't be ridiculous. If you laid all the gay men on the planet end to end, it wouldn't stop straight people from having sex. The point is that short of locking people up in solitary confinement, you can't stop them from having sex if they have the desire and opportunity. You can, however, educate them into having sex responsibly and safely. Unfortunately it's Christianists who have made the public funding of such education impossible under the Bush junta, and that has the effect of keeping gay sex clandestine and irresponsible. I blame your churches much more than I blame gay men because they have created the dangerously hostile and homophobic climate clandestine sex exists to avoid.\n \n \nIt cannot be denied that if a straight couple has sex for 50 or 500 years together, HIV will never grow out of their activities. The same conclusion cannot be established if 2 gay men have sex for 50 years.\n\n \n Look, Archie, are you telling me that you are so ignorant of HIV/AIDS you think HIV is actually generated by gay sex? Tell me you don't actually believe this nonsense! Sweetie, two HIV-negative men could have sex together for a million years, and HIV would not spontaneously pop into existence. \n \n \nSo as long as sexually active gays participate in such dangerous activities as barebacking orgies which bisexuals also participate in. Then they go and have random sex with other people who may spend most of their sexual history in the straight community, then that is how it's crossing over into the straight community.\n\n \n Oh good grief. The straight community is perfectly capable of sustaining its infection rates even if every gay man hung up his gun and retired from the saloon. HIV does not respect sexual orientation, and has separate reservoirs in gay and straight communities. There is no good evidence for much cross-infection, though there will be some. But it's not the major route for straight people getting infected. They infect each other. Even if you lot shot every gay man on the planet, you wouldn't be shot of HIV.\n \n \nI'm not saying that straights aren't also promiscuous, having gay sex for sport and even bringing the disease into the straight community. I'm pointing to a shared cause for the spread of the disease, that's all. And these underground barebacking parties and sex clubs with private rooms where condoms are rejected as puritanical invasions of privacy is precisely the mind set and attitudes that must be changed if this culture of death is going to change. \n\n \n Fine. If you were genuinely criticising unsafe, promiscuous sex by anyone, and supportive of efforts to minimise it, I wouldn't be on your case. But the fact is you are blaming gays for what is as much a heterosexual epidemic as a gay one. But your only solution is to demand gay people stop having sex, which isn't going to solve problems for anyone, because it's just not feasible to lock everyone up in solitary. Worse, you apparently have some pretty misleading ideas about what HIV is and how it gets around.\n \n Why not support gay marriage and offer free condoms, instead? That would be much more effective.\n \n \nYour insecurity is showing again my friend. As is your prejudice and bigotry. And let me say also, some pretty incredible ignorance for not realizing that of the billions of dollars that our Government has budgeted to combat this predominantly gay disease over the past 25 years have come from the taxes paid by the 93% majority of Americans who are straight and also a large portion of which are Christians. So if one would be objective and fair, the gay community owes its very existence to us. Not that I would expect this ungrateful and spiteful demographic to appreciate that fact.\n\n \n I feel as friendly towards you as you evidently feel towards gays. The reason the US government eventually began spending money on HIV-AIDS was because they belatedly realised that it wasn't just a problem for homos and druggies, but everyone was at risk. They weren't magnanimously helping gays, they were trying some prevention for their own sakes. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It was simply politically impossible to exclude gays, though Christianists like the late and unlamented Jesse Helms certainly did their best to oppose funding for people with HIV-AIDS because at the time, most of them were gay. And now, of course that it's no longer a predominantly gay disease in the US -- though it never was in the world at large -- such funding is less controversial.",

   "We should be talking about some constructive solutions to this disease, today, instead of being stuck in the past and questions about who was unfortunate enough to get the virus first.\n And of course we are. Survival with aids has increased significantly in the developed world where effective drugs are available. Not perfect by any means but way way advanced beyond the early 1980s. Not that political biases and bigotry did not prevent a faster response. ANY disease like AID which finds a reservoir in a subpopulation is a danger to all. Such a pool of virus can with relative ease spread far beyond its original population and present a danger to everyone. Its a public health problem not a problem of morals. Nor will fixing the blame serve any useful prupose. Cool heads win this kind of war, NOT hotheads or bigots.\n\n \n I agree with most of what you wrote but would add one comment. If we don't learn from our past mistakes, we're more likely to make the same mistake in the future. Once the root cause is acknowledged, it should be noted, addressed and you move on.

   "Heterosexuals are playing their own role in the spread of std's. How should this be addressed? Abstinance only education is clearly not working. \n \n \n \n Sound off: Our money should go to sex education that works\n Tuesday, June 12, 2007\n \n Guest Commentary: Our money should go to sex education that works\n \n By CHAR WENDEL President and CEO, Planned Parenthood of Collier County\n \n Our children are having sex. Unsafe sex. Unprotected sex. Sex with multiple partners. By their 18th birthday, six in 10 teenage women and more than five in 10 teenage men have had sexual intercourse, a new federal study shows.\n \n In 2005, About 14 percent of high school students and 21 percent of 12th-grade students had had sex with four or more people. Thirty-seven percent of these students did not use a condom, with almost 45 percent of the 12th-graders reporting not using a condom during their most recent sexual intercourse.\n \n Of the approximately 19 million new sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the U.S. in 2000, nearly half were among people 15 to 24 years of age. STIs have been linked to infertility, miscarriages, cervical cancer, increased HIV risk and numerous other health problems. Their cost is estimated at several billion dollars annually.\n \n Not only are our children having sex, unsafe sex, unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners - our children are also having children.\n \n These are not statistics about other people's children. These are about our children too. Collier County's teenage birth rate continues to be higher than that of the Florida state average with the 35th highest (out of Florida's 67 counties) birth rate to teens. Our children also are infected with gonorrhea and chlamydia at rates higher than most of the state.\n \n How do we keep our children from having sex, having unsafe sex, having unprotected sex? Many agree, including all of us at Planned Parenthood of Collier County, that abstinence works. It is the only sure way to prevent unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and abortions.\n \n But what we have disagreed on is whether abstinence-education programs actually convince teenagers to remain sexually abstinent and/or change their sexual behavior. Under federal law, abstinence programs are required to teach that sexual activity outside of marriage is wrong and harmful - for people of any age; advocating contraceptive use or discussing contraceptive methods except to emphasize their failure rates is prohibited. There is currently no federal program dedicated to supporting comprehensive sex education that teaches young people about both abstinence and contraception.\n \n We have no reason to continue to disagree, however. We now know that abstinence programs (programs that are prohibited from endorsing or promoting the use of contraceptives) do not work, despite the fact that more than 1 billion federal dollars have been spent on these programs over the past decade.\n \n A long-term research study authorized by Congress in 1997 was presented by the Mathematica Policy Research group to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last month. (The study can be found at www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/impactabstinence.pdf)\n \n This study was authorized by Congress to assess the impact of abstinence-education programs addressing three questions: How successful are they in changing the knowledge, attitudes and intentions of youth? How successful are they in reducing teen sexual activity among youth? How do they change the risk of pregnancy and STIs?\n \n The answers to these questions were unequivocal. Youths in abstinence programs were no more likely to have abstained from sex, and of those who were having sex, had similar numbers of sex partners and had initiated sex at the same age.\n \n Despite the facts, President Bush recently requested a $28 million increase in the fiscal year 2008 federal budget to a total of $204 million for abstinence-only programs. Doesn't it make sense that Congress should accept the results of the study it authorized to evaluate abstinence-education programs and only fund programs that provide teens with the information they need to prevent unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS?\n \n Federal funds should only be directed to comprehensive sex-education programs.\n \n Unfortunately, state funds are also being wasted on programs that don't work. At last count, the Florida Legislature had allocated over $14 million for programs that fail.\n \n Comprehensive sex-education programs that provide information about both abstinence and contraception can help delay the onset of sexual activity among teens, reduce their number of sexual partners and increase contraceptive use when they become sexually active. (These findings were underscored in \"Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior,\" issued by former Surgeon General David Satcher).\n \n We cannot - we should not - continue to ignore clear evidence that only comprehensive sex education programs work. We can and we should spend our federal, state and charitable dollars on programs proven to work.",

   "Pride Or Peril?\n Sarah Tobias and Sean Cahill\n June 12, 2007\n \n Sarah Tobias Ph.D. and Sean Cahill Ph.D. are co-authors of Policy Issues Affecting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Families.\n \n It is another glorious June. The days are warmer, longer and lazier. Many of us are already contemplating the familiar rituals of summer-boardwalks, beaches and camp for the kids. Rainbow flags are everywhere, festooning porches and parapets, reminding us that June is also Gay Pride Month. At least on the outside, everything feels festive. But scratch the surface and a special type of danger lurks-one that seems at first glance to target only the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community but which, on closer inspection, threatens everyone who calls the United States their home.\n \n The danger emanates from Massachusetts. In the middle of this Gay Pride Month, Massachusetts legislators will gather for yet another constitutional convention to vote on whether an amendment defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman should be put to the popular vote. Only 50 legislators need to approve the measure in order for it to move forward and be placed on the ballot in November 2008.\n \n Fifty votes could put the basic rights of Massachusetts's same-sex couple families at enormous risk.\n \n Same-sex marriage first became a reality in Massachusetts in May 2004; just six months after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to wed the person of their choice. Ever since then, same-sex couples in the Bay State have been able to take advantage of many rights that married heterosexual couples take for granted.\n \n These include the right to file joint state tax returns, visit a sick partner in hospital, and make medical decisions and funeral arrangements for them. These rights also guarantee children of same-sex couples a legal relationship with both their parents-during their parents' marriage as well as in the event of a breakup. And if their biological parent dies, then children are guaranteed the right to maintain a relationship with their surviving parent-a right that children of same-sex parents living in many parts of the United States currently lack. That same-sex couple families can be torn apart by the state in times of crisis is an acute vulnerability and an enormous injustice.\n \n If the Massachusetts initiative is placed on the ballot for the 2008 election, then chances are good that lesbian and gay-headed families in the Bay State will be plummeted back into a cruel insecurity that they thought they had finally left behind. Something no families should be forced to endure.\n \n In other words, Massachusetts's legislators have the power to destroy more than Gay Pride Month.\n \n But although the most palpable victims of a decision to place an amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot would be members of Massachusetts's LGBT community, in actual fact all of us would suffer. By their actions, Massachusetts's legislators would be undermining our democracy. As we understand it in this country, democracy has basic guarantees. The Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, and an independent judiciary were created in large part to prevent the tyranny of the majority that founding father James Madison cautioned against. The Massachusetts Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution guarantees \"equal protection of the laws\" for all Americans regardless of sexual orientation or popularity. But anti-gay ballot measures-in which the rights of a stigmatized minority are granted or withheld by a majority in a secret ballot-are fundamentally an exercise in majority tyranny. Putting basic rights up for a majority vote is contrary to the best traditions of this country. And it sets a dangerous precedent. Today it might be the rights of the LGBT community that are at stake; tomorrow it might be someone else's rights.\n \n So the stakes are high this Gay Pride Month. Over 8,500 lesbian and gay couples have married in Massachusetts and are anxiously awaiting the legislature's decision. Along with all other LGBT people, they deserve full legal equality. Let's hope that legislators realize the magnitude of their decision and vote against discrimination by keeping the same-sex marriage ban off the ballot. Let's hope that Massachusetts's lesbian and gay-headed families can enjoy the beach, the boardwalk and those other summer rituals without worrying that the security of their families might be undermined by legal fiat.\n \n Denying loving and committed couples equal legal protections for their relationships and their children is discriminatory. Putting these rights and protections up for a popular vote is immoral, un-American, and anti-democratic.\n \n \n http://www.tompaine.com/print/pride_or_peril.php",

They are known to reduce teen pregnancies and STD infection in comparison with no sex ed. They're needed to avoid ignorance and more dangerously, disinformation.

How am I hurting a homosexual kid by homeschooling my child? At what age do you consider a kid a homosexual? My 7 year old kid is non-sexual. I don't need a gubment school employee to change that through indoctrination. My wife and I will impart our values onto the child rather than some gubment employee. In so doing we are not forcing our values onto your kid be he hetero, homo, asexual or otherwise. You, as an atheist, would probably be rather upset if some gubment employee taught your child to pray the rosary as it is opposed to your value set and you would be absolutely within your right to object. As a heterosexual, I am not interested in paying money to a gubment schools to teach sexual practices. \n \n This all dove tails rather nicely with the argument for school vouchers. As it stands, you either accept what the gubment school teaches or home school your child. Accept the level of failure and the high pupil to teacher ratio or homeschool your child. The decision to homeschool is not made out of homophobia but rather out of a desire to control the quality and emphasis of the child's education. Education is one thing, indoctrination is another. As you would not want your child exposed to religious teachings, so would I not wish my child to receive instruction in homosexual sex practices. Moreover, given the test scores found in the public schools these days, it would be rather challenging for the homeschooling parent to do worse. \n \n I would not begrudge you from sending your child to a homosexual academy or homeschooling your kid and filling their brains full of rainbows.

For all I could tell, this was a referendum on religion and home schooling. \n \n I actually voted for leaving the forum before I voted against it. I am the John Kerry of the Gay Rights Forum.\n \n Seriously, I am glad that you are able to go back and review old posts. Go back further and you will find that the problem I have is not with the homosexual argument. The problem is that of late many have chosen not to advance their argument but to tear down others. There is no reason to attack religion or homeschoolers and you are not likely to gain any points by doing so. You do not get your point across by alienating those you would convert. Knowing that the majority of Americans are religious, or at least spiritual, why would you seriously mount an attack on their values in hopes of advancing yours? \n \n Contrary to popular belief, most Americans do not sit at home plotting ways to keep the gay community down. There is a vast undecided sea in the middle who may be pulled in either direction. Some of those attend church regularly, others home school their kids. When you attack these groups you needlessly alienate those who may ordinarily be convinced by the sincerity of your argument. Tell someone their beliefs are stupid and they will likely respond in kind.\n \n As I have previously stated, and Jyoshu has echoed, the Gay Rights movement has valid points. But whatever compassion for their cause they hope to engender is suppressed and killed by the relentless attacks on religion, home school, boy scouts, and other institutions with valuable social benefit. The virulence typically posted here is not reflective of the typical member of the homosexual community who just wants to be left alone to live their life with whom they will. They are not served by the hate directed outward any more than the hate directed inward. I do not dispute that homosexuals have suffered much vitriol at the hands of their opponents. I merely advise that you do not defeat hate with hate, but rather by rising above it and allowing those in the middle to observe the contrast in behavior. By responding in kind you play right into your opponents hands.\n \n Would the homosexual community adopt the tactics of Gandhi and MLK, they would be better served than the in your face shock tactics espoused here.

All bluster, no argument. \n \n \n Given the way homeschool students tend to outdo students from public schools academically in most cases, apparently many parents certainly ARE capable of doing it.\n \n What documentation do you have to support this statement, CJ?\n \n \n Well, it took me all of two minutes to find the following:\n \n Scholastic Achievement and Demographic Characteristics\n of Home School Students in 1998\n Lawrence M. Rudner\n ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation\n College of Library and Information Services\n University of Maryland, College Park\n This report presents the results of the largest survey and testing program for students in home schools to date. In Spring 1998, 20,760 K-12 home school students in 11,930 families were administered either the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) or the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), depending on their current grade. The parents responded to a questionnaire requesting background and demographic information. Major findings include: the achievement test scores of this group of home school students are exceptionally high--the median scores were typically in the 70th to 80th percentile; 25% of home school students are enrolled one or more grades above their age-level public and private school peers; this group of home school parents has more formal education than parents in the general population; the median income for home school families is significantly higher than that of all families with children in the United States; and almost all home school students are in married couple families. Because this was not a controlled experiment, the study does not demonstrate that home schooling is superior to public or private schools and the results must be interpreted with caution. The report clearly suggests, however, that home school students do quite well in that educational environment.\n \n \n And another:\n \n \n \n Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Newsweek informs us that in 1998, 41 states had no minimum academic requirements for parents who wanted to homeschool their children. Nevertheless, says Newsweek, homeschooled children managed to average 23 of 36 on the ACT, compared to an average score of 21 for traditionally schooled students. A 23 qualified a student for a \"selective\" college. In 2000, home-schooled students scored an average of 1,100 on the SAT, 81 points above the national average.\n \n \n Are ye scrolling over this inconvenient \"rant\"\n \n \n \n Three empirical studies, specifically focused on the first-year academic performance of the home school college student (Galloway 1995, Gray 1998, Jcnkins 1998), attempted to remedy higher education and policy makers' lack of knowledge. Galloway (1995) found home school graduates outperformed their conventional private school peers on the ACT English subtest. Jenkins (1998) found that full- and part-time community college home school students' average first-year grade point averages were higher than non-home school graduates. Jenkins also found that the home school student's out-performed their peers in reading and mathematics on the Texas Academic Skills Program. Finally, Gray (1998) found no significant differences between home school and traditional students at three institutions in Georgia (including a public university, a private university and a private college) on the SAT scores, English grades or cumulative grade point averages.\n \n \n So ye see, by attacking home schooling which has an empirically demonstrated social benefit ye are not advancing your argument. People will make a judgment about the veracity of your argument based on your attack on a demonstrated societal benefit and simply \"scroll over your rant\".\n \n Now if ye would kindly return to your discussion of homosexual rights and stop attacking religion and home school, perhaps us curmudgeons would leave ye the hell alone.\n \n (Insert poorly constructed ad-hominem reply here.)",

   "The reason that homeschooling tends to be as good overall as public schooling in terms of academic achievement is because of two factors: a.) some of the curriculum is very good (some public schools are even moving to some of the curriculum), and b.) the students get a lot of individual attention and interaction. It is far more interactive than sitting in a classroom with a lot of other kids as just one of a large group. \n \n Anyway, homeschooling people don't have the burden of showing it is \"better\" than public or private schools. Heck, it doesn't even have to show it's just as good, although it certainly is. It's here to stay, so we can remain on this weird diversion if those who brought it want to do so, but it's not going to change reality. of course none of this is to say that there aren't people out there who home-school to overly-shelter their children, but that doesn't mean homeschooling is always bad as one would ascertain from the generalisations we've seen some here. It depends on the situation and the way it's being conducted.\n \n Which leads us to this: it's also important to note that homeschooling comes in many flavors. Some people who aren't religious at all home-school, some people home-school only up to a certain point, and yes, some people home-school for religious reasons. Homeschooling has been around for decades (really centuries) and the sky hasn't fallen, society hasn't fallen apart, and science continues to progress. No generalization is going to accurately convey anything about it, except that, when done well it works, and when not done well it doesn't work, just like any school. It's a huge movement with a lot diversity. Welcome to the 21st century.",

However, home schooling doesn't work as well for average or below average kids, because most parents don't have the skills to teach at high school level, or make up for educational deficits.\n \n The reason the religious right supports home schooling is because it allows them to pass on their religious prejudices to their kids, without their being challenged by different ideas. That includes prejudice against gay people.\n \n Public high schools are not allowed to support religious bigotry, which is why many religious parents prefer home schooling. \n \n It ensures the transmission of religious bigotry from one generation to the next.

   "Parents' Reasons for Homeschooling\n In the earlier Parent survey conducted as part of the 1999 NHES, parents were posed an open-ended question asking them to list their reasons for homeschooling. Parents provided a broad range of reasons for homeschooling their children, which were coded into 16 different categories. In 1999, three reasons for homeschooling were the most frequently cited: 49 percent of homeschooled students had parents who cited the ability to give their child a better education, 38 percent had parents who cited religious reasons, and 26 percent had parents who cited a poor learning environment at school (Bielick, Chandler, & Broughman 2001).\n \n While the 1999 survey was able to provide a context for why parents were homeschooling their children, it had two main limitations. First, when faced with an open-ended question, parents may not have recalled or responded with all of the reasons for homeschooling that were applicable to their situation. Second, parents were not specifically asked to report their primary reason for homeschooling. Questionnaire items in the 2003 collection were designed to address these limitations. The 2003 survey presented parents with a series of questions asking them whether particular reasons for homeschooling applied to them (table 4). Parents were then asked which of those applicable reasons was their most important reason for homeschooling.\n \n The reason for homeschooling that was most frequently cited as being applicable was concern about the environment of other schools including safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure. Eighty-five percent of homeschooled students were being homeschooled, in part, because of their parents' concern about the environment of other schools. The next two reasons for homeschooling most frequently cited as applicable were to provide religious or moral instruction (72 percent) and dissatisfaction with academic instruction at other schools (68 percent).\n \n Parents were asked which of the reasons they homeschooled was the most important reason. Figure 2 and table 4 show the most important reasons students were being homeschooled in 2003, as reported by parents of homeschooled students. Concern about the environment of other schools and to provide religious or moral instruction were the top two most important reasons cited. About a third of students had parents who cited concern about the environment of other schools as their most important reason for homeschooling (31 percent). Approximately another third of homeschooled students had parents who were homeschooling primarily to provide religious or moral instruction (30 percent). Sixteen percent of homeschooled students had parents whose primary reason for homeschooling was dissatisfaction with the academic instruction available at other schools, making this the third most common primary reason for homeschooling.\n \n http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/parentsreasons.asp",

   "These seem to be old reports. And why do I need to find the documention to support your declarations? That's what I get told in these forums. So I'm giving it back to you and your friends. Support your own damn statements.\n \n \n These reports are 9 years old. Census data is older, yet we have no problem accepting census data from 2000 as sacrosanct. But alas, here is yet another positive correlation between homeschool and performance, this one merely 4 years old. \n \n In 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:\n \u0095 Homeschool graduates are active and involved in their communities. 71% participate in an ongoing community service activity, like coaching a sports team, volunteering at a school, or working with a church or neighborhood association, compared with 37% of U.S. adults of similar ages from a traditional education background. \n \u0095 Homeschool graduates are more involved in civic affairs and vote in much higher percentages than their peers. 76% of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 24 voted within the last five years, compared with only 29% of the corresponding U.S. populace. The numbers are even greater in older age groups, with voting levels not falling below 95%, compared with a high of 53% for the corresponding U.S. populace. \n \u0095 58.9% report that they are \"very happy\" with life, compared with 27.6% for the general U.S. population. 73.2% find life \"exciting\", compared with 47.3%.\n \n Presumably, if home school has gone to hell since then you should be able to rake up the data. Instead we find this:\n \n Your Life Is Not My Fault\n \n A brilliant retort. And then:\n \n So the reason we have sex education in schools is pretty much the same we have most other kinds of education in schools: professional teachers are better qualified, in most cases, to teach kids all the things they need to know than parents. And most parents know it.\n \n Yet the data has already demonstrated that public schools fail to educate students better than home schools. If the gubment school cannot teach a child to read or write better than a home-schooled child, why should I believe that these will teach sex education better than the home school teacher?\n \n But the ignorance marches on:\n \n I have no idea why people who should know better claim that home schooling is better than public schooling. It isn't, and there is no evidence to suggest it is. Intelligent kids will make the grade one way or another -- even the dumbest home schooling parent probably isn't going to be able to hurt a bright kid, provided that kid has access to other sources of learning.\n \n It's the not-so-bright kids who are at risk from parents who mistakenly think they are qualified to give their child a high school education in all subjects. There may be a few out there with the education and independent income to do it, but they are rare birds indeed.\n \n My guess is this effluvia in favour of home schooling is just more mindless support for the religious right.

Their superstitions aren't being taught, and they resent that.\n \n Frankly, I think a sectarian religious education is child abuse. Fine, let the child learn there are religions, and learn a sampling of what those religions are. Let the child also learn about atheism and agnosticism.

They want schools to indoctrinate their kids in their superstition. Learning that one religion is true while others are false is child abuse, and I don't see why they should get away with it.\n \n \n Before guessing out loud, or relying exclusively on faith as you accuse the vile right of doing perhaps you should check the data. \n \n According to a 2003 U.S. Census survey, 33% of homeschooling households cited religion as a factor in their choice. The same study found that 30% felt school had a poor learning environment, 14% objected to what the school teaches, 11% felt their children were not being challenged at school, and 9% cited morality.\n \n According to the U.S. DOE's \"Homeschooling in the United States: 2003\", 85 percent of homeschooling parents cited \"the social environments of other forms of schooling\" (including safety, drugs, bullying and negative peer-pressure) as an important reason why they homeschool. 72 percent cited \"to provide religious or moral instruction\" as an important reason, and 68 percent cited \"dissatisfaction with academic instruction at other schools. Homeschooling is sometimes opted for when a child has a significant career hobby (such as acting, circus performance, dancing or violin), or for families who wish to abstain from mandatory immunizations.\n \n \n Oh, but this is the best part! \n \n It's the not-so-bright kids who are at risk from parents who mistakenly think they are qualified to give their child a high school education in all subjects. There may be a few out there with the education and independent income to do it, but they are rare birds indeed.\n \n If this were true, those dumb parents would mis-educate those dumb kids and the numbers would reflect in the averages. The data clearly shows that this has not happened. The average scores of home school kids are higher than the average scores of the public schools. The data suggests that your paste eater would be much better educated in a home school environment where the ratio of teachers is 1:1 than in a gubment school with a ratio of 30:1.\n \n Why persist in attacks against religion, stay at home parents, home educators in the hopes of advancing your ideals? Page after page of studies have been presented but since they don't fit with your preconceived notions, all we get is more bluster and opinion.",

   "I can only speak from personal experience with regard to homeschooling. I went to public schools. But I learned a great deal from my parents and my surrounds. In the summers my father would bring home a rather good binoc scope and we would go microbe hunting in the local ponds, livestock tanks, soils, bushes, etc. It really stimulated my interests in the micro world. During the winters both parents would get up early (as would I) and get ready to go to school (as would I). I was ready earlier than they and they would park me in front of our primitive television set. When I was in the fourth of fifth grade the morning programs included something called continental classroom which in effect was a series of college level lectures on chemistry/biochemistry and mathematics. Not knowing any better I absorbed the material -much more of it than you might guess. It served me well in later years although my school teacher often wondered what the heck I was talking about in science classes. Later on Sputnick resulted in a considerable enrichment of my cirriculum when NSF started pumping really neat technical books into our library. Still later NSF ran summer science prgrams for HS students which I was privileged to participate in. So was I educated in the public schools, at home, by TV, or at colleges? Beats me.",

Some tidbits:\n \n From the wingnuts at MassResistance:\n \n \nThe VoteOnMarriage amendment went down in flames today, with an even more appalling result than anyone could have imagined. Prayers without compromising the truth may work. Prayers when the truth is compromised cannot.\n \n VoteOnMarriage's campaign failed because the debate was boiled down to \"letting the people vote\" and ensuring \"children have both a mother and a father.\" But it left out the important truth about homosexual \"marriage\": It's based on immoral and unhealthy sexual perversions. Morality and public health needed to be part of the debate.\n \n But VoteOnMarriage (and its prime actor, Massachusetts Family Institute) never spoke about these issues. Why didn't they say plainly that disordered sexuality cannot become an accepted basis for \"marriage\"? And after compromising with Mitt Romney, they could hardly address preserving the integrity of our constitution, and the common accepted meaning of the words therein.\n \n [...]\n \n When leaders fail to achieve their goal, they should be fired. VoteOnMarriage and the Massachusetts Family Institute have been discredited, they have failed the faithful pro-family people of Massachusetts. So we say to them: Don't ask for another penny, another drop of our blood and sweat.\n\n \n My word, they are killing each other in the pro-bigotry movement!\n \n And from Tony Perkins of the \"Family\" Research Institute, another anti-gay, religious lobby group:\n \n \nMore than 200 years ago, the Second Continental Congress resolved that one flag would represent America to the world. It ordered that \"the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\" Today, on the very date reserved to honor the flag's proud and glorious history, what was seen waving throughout Boston wasn't Old Glory, but a handful of rainbow flags, symbols not of unity but of division.\n \n The colors crowned a contentious battle for marriage, which, this afternoon, suffered a vicious blow at the hands of the Massachusetts legislature. Spurning their own constituents, state lawmakers voted 45 to 151 to take the decision of protecting marriage out of voters' hands. In the end, all three branches of government conspired to frustrate the desire of the voters, ignoring over 170,000 residents who signed petitions, wrongly believing that the principle of representative government would prevail. News outlets like the Boston Globe hinted that Gov. Deval Patrick (D) was buying off votes with political favors as late as yesterday. National politicians also weighed in, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Chairman of the DNC Howard Dean, fearing the issue would become a rallying cry for the 2008 elections. \n \n\n \n Awwww... emoticon_cry \n \n This is a real bloody nose for anti-gay Christian activists. It's a rejection of their divisive tactics trying to insert a wedge of separation between gay human beings and the rest of society. And with every year of legal gay marriage, their window of opportunity to fire up a popular vote for bigotry closes a bit further.

   "Hi, everyone. I have not been posting lately because I have been dealing with my father's estate, and also my computer crashed but is now working better than ever. The students at my college succeeded in extracting all my documents, and they reinstalled Windows, and it's faster than it's ever been.\n \n I am thrilled about the news from Massachusetts. Yesterday I was holding my breath, expecting the worst. It's great to hear that the proposed amendment failed, and the soonest the anti-gay forces can hope to force a popular vote on same-sex marriage in Mass. is 2012! I feel confident that by then, even if the measure were to get to the voters, people in Mass. will be so used to same-sex marriage that efforts to eliminate it will not succeed. The legislature has clearly accepted same-sex marriage, and they are not willing to undo it. This demonstrates that, at least in Massachusetts, a court is not forcing same-sex marriage on the state; the elected legislators and the elected governor support same-sex marriage. And polls suggest that a majority of voters there do also, because they have seen that the legalization of same-sex marriage has harmed no one. \n \n Bravo to all the folks who worked so hard in Massachusetts to keep same-sex marriage legal. This is a great victory. \n \n I see that folks have been discussing home schooling. I have quite a few friends who home school, and they are progressives and not of the religious right. There is a small progressive movement of home schoolers. They have created several groups to support each other and to organize educational activities. \n \n I am not a big fan of home schooling, but I don't oppose it either, so long as the states ensure that certain minimum educational standards are met. Most families cannot home school, because you can't realistically do it in families with two working parents or with a single parent who works for wages.",

Here are some independent historians and historical, non believing, non biblical sources who spoke of Jesus and His crucifixion and even referred to His resurrection. \n \n http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/dieandlive_sources.htm\n \n Do Other Sources Confirm Jesus Christ's Existence?\n \n Many people assume that, apart from the Bible, history is silent concerning Jesus of Nazareth. But in fact, many independent witnesses testify of Jesus' existence. Let's notice a few.\n \n Testimony from the Romans\n \n Cornelius Tacitus (ca. 56-120) was a Roman senator, consul and governor of the Roman province of Anatolia (covering most of modern-day Turkey) as well as one of ancient Rome's greatest historians. Late in his life he wrote a 16-volume history of the Roman emperors, the Annals.\n \n No friend to either Nero or Christians, Tacitus writes that Nero blamed \"a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.\"\n \n He goes on to explain that \"Christus [Christ], from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty [crucifixion] during the reign of Tiberius at the hand of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome ...\" (Annals, 15:44, quoted by Lee Strobel, The Case for Christ, 1998, p. 82).\n \n A contemporary of Tacitus, Caius Suetonius Tranquillus (ca. 69-140), overseer of Rome's libraries and court official to several emperors, writes that the emperor Claudius \"banished the Jews from Rome, who were continually making disturbances, Chrestus [Christ] being their leader\" (Lives of the First Twelve Caesars: Life of Claudius, quoted by Grant Jeffrey, Jesus: The Great Debate, 1999, p. 163). This banishment of Jews from Rome is mentioned in Acts 18:2.\n \n Also, \"Pliny the younger, the Roman legate of Bithynia-Pontus (what is now north-central Turkey) in the early second century, wrote to the emperor Trajan, requesting advice on how to deal with Christians who refused to reverence Caesar's image. Pliny noted that these Christians met regularly and sang hymns 'to Christ as if to a god' (Letters 10:96.7). The phrase 'as if to a God' suggests that Pliny knew Jesus had been a person who had lived on earth but was reluctant to call him divine\" (Craig Blomberg, The Historical Reliability of the Gospels, 1987, p. 196).\n \n From these historical sources, none connected in any way with the Bible, we see references to these facts:\n \n A group called \"Christians\" derived its name from \"Christus\" (Christ).\n This \"Christus\" was executed during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of Pontius Pilate (Tiberius reigned A.D. 14-37; Pilate held office from 26 to 36 or 37).\n This new movement involved \"a most mischievous superstition,\" quite possibly a reference to Christians' belief that Jesus rose from the dead after His crucifixion.\n This new movement begun by Christians began in Judea and spread to Rome.\n Early Christians considered Christ to be a divine Being.\n Testimony from Josephus\n \n Flavius Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the first century, is well known to historians and scholars. Born into a priestly family in A.D. 37, Josephus was well educated and commanded a Jewish detachment in Galilee during the Jewish revolt of 66-70 until his capture by the Romans. At the end of the war he went to Rome with the Roman general Titus, where he lived and wrote until his death about A.D. 100.\n \n Josephus twice mentions Jesus in his monumental work Antiquities of the Jews, written A.D. 90-95. His most extensive quote reads:\n \n \"Now, there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works,-a teacher of such men as received the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day\" (Antiquities, Book 18, chapter 3, section 3).\n \n While many scholars dispute parts or all of the passage, it is quoted as above by the historian Eusebius as early as 315.\n \n A second mention of Jesus by Josephus is seldom disputed by scholars. It concerns the martyrdom of James, His half brother: \"Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of the judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others [or some of his companions;] and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned ...\" (Antiquities, Book 20, chapter 9, section 1).\n \n Another prominent figure from the Gospels mentioned by Josephus is John the Baptizer: \"Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, ... thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause ... Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus,... and was there put to death\" (Antiquities, Book 18, chapter 5, section 2).\n \n Although Josephus was never a Christian, in his works we find mention of many other figures from the Gospels and other New Testament books. These include the family of the Herods; the Judean procurators and members of the high priestly families. His books, like the writings of the Roman historians and officials, provide powerful independent corroboration of the historical accuracy of the Gospels and the existence of Jesus Christ.\n \n ",

   "My dear, the reason most people don't home school their kids is because they aren't qualified. Even if they had the time, they aren't qualified. And if they are qualified, they haven't the time because they are teaching other people's kids to earn a living.\n \n Capisce? Probably not.\n \n So the reason we have sex education in schools is pretty much the same we have most other kinds of education in schools: professional teachers are better qualified, in most cases, to teach kids all the things they need to know than parents. And most parents know it. \n \n Why do you have a problem with this? Because they don't teach your religion?\n\n \n It appears that your knowledge base on homeschooling is non-existent. \n \n Parent educational levels:\n \n\n \n Compared to the nation, a much larger percentage of home school mothers are stay-at-home mothers not participating in the labor force. Some 76.9% of home school mothers do not work for pay. About 86.3% that do work do so part time. Nationwide, in 1996, only 30% of married women with children under 18 did not participate in the labor force (US Dept of Census, 1997a, Table 632). \n A very large percentage of home school parents are certified to teach. Some 19.7% of the home school mothers are certified teachers; 7.1% of fathers. Almost one out of every four home school students (23.6%) has at least one parent who is a certified teacher. \n Only 7.7% of the respondents were enrolled in a full-service curriculum program, i.e., a program that serves students and their parents as a \"one-stop\" primary source for textbooks, materials, lesson plans, tests, counseling, evaluations, record keeping, and the like for the year's core required subjects such as language, social studies, mathematics, and science. \n \n\n \n Even though only 19.7% of mothers and 7.1% of fathers that home school are certified teachers, the MAJORITY of homeschooled students outperform public schooled students.\n \n\n It is readily apparent from Table 3.3 that the median scores for home school students are well above their public/private school counterparts in every subject and in every grade. The corresponding percentiles range from the 62nd to the 91st percentile; most percentiles are between the 75th and the 85th percentile. The lowest percentiles are in Mathematics Total with Computation subtest (labeled Math in the tables); the highest in Reading Total. While the grade-to-grade increase in national medians is 13 DSS points in the lower grades, the annual increase for home school students is about 16 points. These are exceptional scores and exceptional grade-to-grade gains. \n As shown in Table 3.4, the same superiority of median scaled scores holds when comparing home school students to students enrolled in Catholic/Private schools. The Catholic/Private school percentiles corresponding to median scaled scores range from the 53rd percentile to the 89th percentile; most are between the 65th to 75th percentile. In every area and every grade, the median scores for home school students exceed the median scores of students enrolled in Catholic/Private schools. \n \n\n \n http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v7n8/\n \n There are lots of studies that show that home schooled students outperform public schooled students regardless of parents' education. emoticon_wow",

   "The answer to this is question is simple. Because I don't corrupt, manipulate, lie and twist Gods word to satisfy my own perverted World view as you do Matthew. What you do to Gods Word is nothing short of blasphemy and you don't even realize it. I just corrected another one of your distorted verses yesterday as you attributed a verse you changed the words to and therefore meaning of, to Jesus Christ. \n\n You corrupt, manipulate, lie and twist God's word every time you post about it. You are constantly talking about things like Angels and why they \"don't have free will\", the \"tribulation\" and that the end of the world is coming in \"this Age\", etc., none of which is supported by the Bible. You twist verses of the Bible to try to justify your hate towards Gays and Muslims, and it is just disgusting. You also tell us that God is a decietful god, etc.\n \n \n \n \n\n Matthew, how blind and dumb do you think other people are on this forum ? Do you think they can't read or comprehend what we write here ? I am the only person here who speaks to the true Grace and Mercy of Gods plan for the redemption and salvation of humanity. I have spoken of it because I personally know of it because I have personally experienced it. \n \n You and SP speak to what you hope will be. You speak to what you want to be. But you don't speak to what you know in any way, that is why you say my God is one of fear and hate. Because you don't have a clue about His true character. If you did, you wouldn't just make up verses and attribute them to Him. Because to knowingly lie about the living God is a terrible thing indeed.\n \n And as I already told you in that \"True Christian\" thread, only an anti christian, an ally of satan himself would post such a thread in opposition to the believers in Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Wow, Archie, thanks for the laugh!\n \n And you DON'T speak of what you hope and want when you talk? You do not know, any more than us, what the truth is. However, we very easily DO know that your god is not Jesus Christ, as we know you by the fruits of your actions and statements.",
