Because shark attacks receive more publicity and because they are easier to imagine (after seeing the film Jaws, for example), most people rate shark attacks as the more probable cause of death. Since information about shark attacks is more readily available, the availability heuristic helps explain why people overestimate the chances of dying in this unusual way. \n \n More Americans die from diabetes and stomach cancer than from homicide and car accidents, by a ratio of nearly 2:1. Many people guess homicide and car accidents, largely due to the publicity they receive and in turn, their availability in the mind. \n \n More Americans are killed annually by lightning than by tornadoes. Because tornadoes are often preceded by warnings, drills, and other kinds of publicity, the most common answer is tornadoes. The large amount of information about tornadoes, coupled with the availability heuristic, leads to the misconception that tornadoes are a more frequent cause of death. \n \n http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/11/e11expand.html",

   "If people want to pray, no one is going to stop them. But people, some on this forum, have put forward as evidence of the existence of God the fact that prayers have been answered. If you're going to promote something as evidence then you need to be prepared to have your evidence scrutinzied. If your prayer is just between you and your God then I don't think anyone is going to give a hoot, but if you're using your prayer as a tool in an argument then no, you can't expect people to just accept it.\nI haven't personally put forward any claim of answered prayer. The thrust of this thread revolves around prayer and whether answers come to those who pray. I did not start the thread. I think it was not intended to degenerate into another fruitless debate whether God exists or not. I suspected from the beginning that that extension of argument would be the precise reason for atheists to argue that prayer does not work and that it never recieves answers in any form other than coincidental resemblance.\n \n \nForget proof. I'm not even hoping for evidence at this point. If we can simply get a description of how a prayer was answered I'll feel like we've made progress.\nI thought I gave one in relating the football team story. It is plausible that they have a better win-loss record when they pray, as the coach implied. Whether God is helping them win or their increased positive attitude is doing it doesn't matter. When they pray, they win more. Prayer at work. And the causal relationship has been determined. It is the praying that enables them to win more. I am not claiming that it is God's help that gives them more wins. True, it is tacitly implied, but it is clearly a separable thing and is not necessary in order for prayer to have worked. The team is boosted by their own prayers. Their prayers work for them whether it's God, karma or my paternal grandparents affecting their play.\n \n BTW, Kronus.

I'm not able to recall your having ever acted like the pseudo-intellectual twit who stands next in line.\n \n \n \n \nYou don't even understand what it was you said!

Our problem with accepting stories of the efficacy of prayer as evidence is that they are so selective: they overlook all the occasions when the fervently prayed-for sick child goes ahead and dies anyway; or, more trivially, the fact that if two devoutly prayed-for sports teams meet, one will end up losing, while the other attributes its success to the prayer.\n \n If it could be shown that every instance of prayer were answered, I for one would consider that very serious evidence indeed. But like lesz and others I can't take seriously a cherry-picking approach that asks me to consider only the apparent successes and ignore the huge number of patent failures.\nUnderstanding that the patent failures are the children that die despite prayer and the teams that lose despite prayer, you're requiring that all prayers are successful to even consider the stats as evidence.

   "http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-belief.html \nAppeal to Belief is a fallacy that has this general pattern: \n Most people believe that a claim, X, is true. \n Therefore X is true. \n This line of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because the fact that many people believe a claim does not, in general, serve as evidence that the claim is true. \n \n There are, however, some cases when the fact that many people accept a claim as true is an indication that it is true. For example, while you are visiting Maine, you are told by several people that they believe that people older than 16 need to buy a fishing license in order to fish. Barring reasons to doubt these people, their statements give you reason to believe that anyone over 16 will need to buy a fishing license. \n \n There are also cases in which what people believe actually determines the truth of a claim. For example, the truth of claims about manners and proper behavior might simply depend on what people believe to be good manners and proper behavior. Another example is the case of community standards, which are often taken to be the standards that most people accept. In some cases, what violates certain community standards is taken to be obscene. In such cases, for the claim \"x is obscene\" to be true is for most people in that community to believe that x is obscene. In such cases it is still prudent to question the justification of the individual beliefs. \n \n See also Appeal to Popularity. \n \n Examples of Appeal to Belief\n At one time, most people in Europe believed that the earth was the center of the solar system (at least most of those who had beliefs about such things). However, this belief turned out to be false. \n \n God must exist. After all, I just saw a poll that says 85% of all Americans believe in God. \n \n Of course there is nothing wrong with drinking. Ask anyone, he'll tell you that he thinks drinking is just fine. \n",

   "Here it is again. Millions of people have claimed to have had their prayers answered by Zeus. I think we agree there is no Zeus? Therefore the \"experiences\" of millions of people was wrong. If the evidence of their experience was wrong, then their evidence wasn't very strong. Therefore one can not claim that the mere fact that millions of people experience something is strong evidence.\n \n That's the logical basis for my claim; if you don't address the logic then you're not doing a good job of refuting me.\n\n \n Your logic is fine, but its a logic that's dependent on an outside variable: that, in hindsight, a given experience of all those people turned out to be incorrect. What if millions of people say they saw a man walk on the moon? Would you say that was weak evidence that it happened? If you have one guy that says \"no, the moon landing was a hoax\" and then you have millions of others who say they saw it (right there, on their televisions in 1969), which one are you going to conclude was right? If you say the millions who saw it, then you're putting their claims of having experienced that event up as strong evidence, that it happened. Could it have been a hoax? Yeah, it's theoretically possible. It's possible for millions to be wrong. But not likely. \n \n And regarding the Zeus example, in particular, I'd say that because it was a religious experience of some sort, that the jury is still out in terms of whether or not they had a religious experience. No, it may not have been a specific thunder-throwing god with a long beard, but that's a different (much more specific) issue than whether or not there's something real to religious experience and whether it should be taken as evidence for the supernatural.",

   "interesting discussion, too bad i missed out earlier. i never really thought about god answering prayer with a \"no\". in fact, i've never ever heard anyone say that there was ever a possibility that god could say \"no\" to a prayer request. even among religious circles, the convention is that god didnt answer the prayer, and that the person should keep praying until the request was granted. in other words, in order to perpetuate the idea that god answers prayer, religions must teach the congregation to not accept no as an answer, even if its from god himself. very interesting\n \n why i think prayer works is the same reason i believe positive thinking, goal setting and affirmations work. its entirely psychological, yet extremely powerful and effective. and acheiving what you prayed for will strengthen the belief in the process and make it even more effective. the concept is a fundamental one, and whether you call it meditation, positive thinkin or prayer, there is abundant evidence to show that it works",

I offered my opinion regarding whether God actually acted in such a way as to alter the outcome of a situation (giving an example of a football coach's claimed successful use of prayer) and you counter with the illogical foregone conclusion that all apparent answers to prayer are simply coincidental occurences that appear to the petitioner as an answer from God. If a prayer has a placebo effect and causes a greater and winning effort that would have otherwise not come about, then the prayer worked.

If the extra effort required came about as a result of the prayer, the prayer worked. I cannot prove that the extra effort came about as a result of the prayer.

Since you have not proved that something does not exist, you cannot say that there is no possibility of its existence. Therefore, you cannot say in truth that it is unreasonable to think that it MIGHT EXIST. \n \n \n \n\n It drives my reasonable conclusion that it is pointless to think it can or will happen. So maybe a flagon of water will turn itself into a flagon of wine. So unlikely, it would be foolish to wait around for it to happen.\nI cannot disagree with that...except to say that being wrong about the existence of God might have far more serious consequences than being wrong about he existence of the orbiting teapot.\n \n \n \n\n Nope. It is not reasonable at all, unless you have other grounds for asserting it besides the inability to disprove it conclusively. Otherwise, you might as well advocate the validity of belief in the purple unicorn as in god.\n \n E.g.\n \n \n Yes, the possibility exists, but I'd be a total idiot to take it seriously. And that is how I regard your god.\nSo would you consider anyone who believes there is anything to the God thing to be a total idiot? If so, you are putting Einstein and Steven Hawking both in that category. I seem to recall both saying that. Newsflash: Neither of them is a total idiot.",

   "So??? It's not like all these scientists were in the field of biology. Are you actually saying you think if all these scientists had come AFTER Darwin, they wouldn't have been Christians???? Get real.\n\n \n It's a fact that most scientists today, probably well over half on average and approaching something like 80% among the high flyers, are not Christians or religious in other ways -- and that's in the US, one of the most religion-ridden nations on the planet outside the Islamic ones. (And many of the rest don't believe in a personal god, eternal life or salvation, either.) It was perfectly reasonable and understandable for scientists before about the mid-19th century to be believers, and there weren't very many of them compared to today. William Paley's Argument from Design then was a plausibly rational perspective, because no-one in Paley's day had the insight offered by Darwin and Wallace. \n \n Darwin was a watershed for science in general, not just biology, and since then, the advance of science and technology has made it ever more reasonable and intellectually satisfying for educated people to be non-believers, and scientists are amongst the most educated where it matters. Scientists today -- and there are more alive today than ever existed before Darwin -- are way ahead of the rest of the population in their unbelief. It takes some explaining why scientists are something like 5-10 times more likely to be non-believers than the rest of the population (say a conservative figure of 50% of scientists being atheists/agnostics, compared to 5-10% of the pop. at large).\n \n Now, it's an interesting question of why this should be, and several answers occur to me. First, science might attract the curious and skeptical more than the complacent and unquestioning. Second, scientists might have more reason to doubt religious claims, because they learn more about the natural world. Scientists may be more unconventional in their thinking than average. There may be other possibilities. \n \n Would the scientists you listed have been atheists had they lived after Darwin, and known what post-Darwinian scientists learned about the universe? Would Paley? I would have to guess that yes, they probably would be much more likely to be unbelievers. The reason they were believers might well have been no more than a reflection of the limitations of scientific knowledge on the one hand, and the enormous political power wielded by the Catholic church on the other. Need I remind you of Galileo? Scientists of the day learned their lesson from that.\n \n \n YOU equated faith to idiocy and that it was for \"ninnies\".\n\n \n Ooops, sorry... I keep making the assumption that the strenuous religious apologists on these boards are representative of believers everywhere! emoticon_xangel But I know that isn't true, and I will attempt to keep it in mind.\n \n \nIts you who needs to understand here that religion and science don't have to be incompatible, and that these scientists are very respectable.\n\n \n I simply disagree with this. I think science and religion are incompatible to the extent that you can't let religious ideas bleed into science. Science and religion require two incompatible modes of thinking. When religious scientists, either today's or those of yesteryear, exercise their religious side, it's in a completely different intellectual compartment than their scientific work, because it's based on different methodological and metaphysical assumptions. Science must perforce assume methodological naturalism in its investigation of the universe, and it is but a step from there to philosophical naturalism with it's atheistic metaphysics.\n \n There may be some forms or religion that aren't incompatible with science -- Buddhism springs to mind as a possible example, though it is most often a non-theistic form of religion. But despite the occasional flirtations of Christian churches, especially the Catholic church, with science, there has remained an attitude of deep suspicion of science by the church, because science tends to ask religiously awkward questions, and find religiously uncomfortable answers. I find this perfectly understandable: religion finds its roosts in the gaps scientific knowledge leaves -- as those gaps get filled, there is less and less room for traditional animistic religion. There is bound to be tension between religion and science, as only certain types of religion can be successfully reconciled with naturalism. (I have grave doubts that the currently dominant forms of Christianity are among them.)\n \n \nIt proves you're wrong. These scientists weren't ninnies. And they weren't XXXXXX, and therefore people can have religion and not be. Deal with it.\n\n \n As I explained to Jim, despite occasional hyperbolic flights when particularly frustrated by the denseness of a pro-religious argument, I don't think religious believers need be total XXXXXX, despite many outstanding examples all over the place to the contrary. I can understand religious belief from an emotional angle, but from an intellectual one, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even highly intelligent people can be blind in some areas -- even if they are brilliant scientists. Fred Hoyle, for example, made a total XXX out of himself over evolutionary theory, but was still greatly respected as an astronomer. Of course, he wasn't a Christian, either. And had Newton spent a fraction of the time on physics he spent on alchemy and putzing about with bible codes, imagine what additional prodigies he might have accomplished! What a waste.\n \n So I can readily understand that people can make excellent scientists in a field separate from their religion, yet think relatively irrationally in the religious sphere. They are human beings, and do not have to be perfectly consistent.",

   "It's a fact that most scientists today, probably well over half on average and approaching something like 80% among the high flyers, are not Christians or religious in other ways -- and that's in the US, one of the most religion-ridden nations on the planet outside the Islamic ones. (And many of the rest don't believe in a personal god, eternal life or salvation, either.) It was perfectly reasonable and understandable for scientists before about the mid-19th century to be believers, and there weren't very many of them compared to today. William Paley's Argument from Design then was a plausibly rational perspective, because no-one in Paley's day had the insight offered by Darwin and Wallace. \n\n \n The \"high flyers\"??? That's a nice, convenient way to not have to validate and be specific--but I'm not going to let you off that easily. Your claims here are only true IF you prejudge and leave Christian scientists out of the equation to begin with. (And no doubt, you think they should be left out of it!) Let me guess ... there would never be any religious scientists that would make your list of \"high flyers\", would it? emoticon_xdonno \n \n This is a very problematic (not to mention unscientific--ahem!) approach you are using, and that has been used elsewhere too. For instance, one article (http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html) takes this approach of \"leading\", \"top\", and \"greater\" (the same idea as your 'high flyer' statement) scientists mostly being atheist by defining what determines \"greater\" as being those who are members of the National Academy of Sciences!!! Membership to an organisation is the qualification for being a high flyer! Which of course opens up lots of other questions: does this organisation prefer atheists over religious scientists, for instance? Are there reasons out there that religious scientists avoid the NAS, if nominated??* So in reality, this distinctive assertion that scientists are almost all atheist is really impossible to prove. It's a meaningless assertion that has no teeth, because there may be scores and scores of people out there with scientific degrees who are, in fact, religious but just don't qualify in your mind as \"scientist\" because they also happen to be religious. \n \n Whether you're able/willing to face it or not, your post quite ably demonstrated the problem: that many non-religious scientists have this ridiculous idea that everyone that is religious and also a scientist are unable to separate the two in their minds, and leave the religious questions for religion and scientific questions for science. When you and others are willing to somehow find a way to see religious scientists as REAL scientists, then I think you'd find your high flyer's club would look quite a bit different to you.\n \n \n \n * The NAS site has this to say about how they choose their members: \"Members and foreign associates are elected annually in recognition of their distinguished achievements in original research; election is considered one of the highest honors that can be accorded a scientist or engineer. Currently, as many as 72 members and 18 foreign associates may be elected annually.\n \n Although many names are suggested informally, formal nominations can be submitted only by an Academy member. Nomination materials and candidate lists are confidential. The nomination and evaluation process occurs throughout the year, culminating in a final ballot at the Academy's annual meeting in April. The names of newly elected members and foreign associates are announced in a press release, available on our web site. Because membership is achieved by election, there is no process by which an individual may apply for membership.\" \n \n So the NAS itself, and it's members (which we've already established are mostly atheist) determine who gets in. Gee, is it really any surprise that a largely atheist organisation would prefer only athiests? emoticon_rolleyes \n ",

   "Well, that didn't take too long -- here's one I had a vague recollection of, though it isn't unique -- first a news article:\n \n Scientists May Not Be Very Religious, but Science May Not Be to Blame\n \n \nThe 2005-07 study, \"Religion Among Academic Scientists\" (RAAS) was conducted by Elaine Howard Ecklund, assistant professor of sociology in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University at Buffalo and principal investigator.\n \n The study is based on a survey of 1,646 academic scientists at 21 elite research universities and in-depth interviews with 271 of them.\n \n The survey sample consisted of academics in seven different natural and social science disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, political science, psychology and sub-fields like molecular biology, biochemistry, social psychology and neuroscience. The rate of response to the survey was nearly 75 percent, which Ecklund says is extremely high for a faculty survey. \n \n [...]\n \n The authors then examined how natural and social scientists differ from the general public and how they differ from one another in terms of religiosity. They also considered some of the sources of these differences.\n \n They concluded that academics in the natural and social sciences at elite research universities are significantly less religious than the general population. Almost 52 percent of scientists surveyed identified themselves as having no current religious affiliation compared with only 14 percent of the general population.\n \n And while nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population who responded to the GSS describe themselves as \"evangelical\" or \"fundamentalist,\" less than 2 percent of the RAAS population identifies with either label.\n \n The only traditional religious identity category where the RAAS population has a much higher proportion of religious adherents than the general population is among those who identify as Jewish -- 15 percent compared to 2 percent of the general population.\n \n Among scientists, as in the general population, being raised in a home in which religion and religious practice were valued is the most important predictor of present religiosity among the subjects.\n\n \n About 52% of this general surveyclaimed no religious affiliation. However, the survey doesn't conclude that training in science causes decrease in religiosity:\n \n \nEcklund and Scheitle concluded that the assumption that becoming a scientist necessarily leads to loss of religion is untenable.\n \n Ecklund says, \"It appears that those from non-religious backgrounds disproportionately self-select into scientific professions. This may reflect the fact that there is tension between the religious tenets of some groups and the theories and methods of particular sciences and it contributes to the large number of non-religious scientists.\" \n\n \n I am not sure if the actual survey is online, but here's a PDF of a brief summary of the results by one of the co-authors:\n \n Religion and Spirituality among University Scientists\n \n \nWhen asked their beliefs about God, nearly 34 percent of academic scientists answer \"I do not believe in God\" and about 30 percent answer \"I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out,\" the classic agnostic response. This means that over 60 percent of professors in these natural and social science disciplines describe themselves as either atheist or religiously agnostic. In comparison, among those in the general U.S. population, about 3 percent claim to be atheists and about 5 percent are religiously agnostic.9\n \n When it comes to affiliation with particular religions, scientists are also vastly different from members of the broader society. About 52 percent of scientists see themselves as having no religious affiliation when compared to only 14 percent of the general population. Scientists who are not religious justify their inattention to religion through language that stresses the irrelevance of science to religion. Those not raised in religious homes, the case for the majority of scientists without religious affiliation, also emphasize their lack of experience with religion. \n \n When comparing scientists who do have a religious identity to those among the general population, there are still big differences. According to data from the General Social Survey, a national survey of U.S. adults, 14 percent describe themselves as \"evangelical\" or \"fundamentalist,\" while less than 2 percent of scientists identify with either of these combined labels. The only traditional religious category where the science professors have a much larger percentage of members is among those who are Jewish. Among the broader American public a little less than 2 percent identify as Jewish. In comparison, about 15 percent of the scientists are Jewish.\n \n\n \n So my memory wasn't playing me up -- about 60% of these academic scientists describe themselves as atheist/agnostic, though a small number still claim religious affiliation.\n \n Two other significant findings are that Jews are very much over-represented, while Christian fundamentalists are very much under-represented.

Most scientists probably don't care or think about religion at all, and the only reason they have been forced to is because of the dangerous political activities of the religious right in interfering with science, especially biological sciences. But it's not just biologists who have awoken to the danger, because the danger isn't just to biology: it's to the naturalistic metaphysics of science in general. Naturalism is a deadly philosophical danger to fundamentalist religion, so much so that many adherents think that even methodological naturalism is too much.\n \n \nBefore one of you misreads my post I would like to clarify that I do not hold a position that science has a bias against religion... I merely state it could be argued. I personally haven't cared to look into the topic.\n\n \n I've studied the clash between religion and science intensely for some years, and I am very concerned about the bias religious extremists have against science. Science is never going to support religion, because it is not able to by its very nature, so believers just have to figure out how to get along with it, or dispense with it altogether.",

   "actually, the analogy is faulty in that the belief in the existence of an orbiting teapot can be much more easily substantiated than the belief in the existence of god. if anyone made a claim that such a teapot existed, i would estimate that there would be at least a dozen investigations to figure out if such a claim were true. and none of them would be laughed to scorn.\n\n \n Well, no analogy is perfect -- if it were perfect, it wouldn't serve as an analogy that helped understanding. The differences are as important as the similarities. But again, the value of this analogy is in the way it highlights how belief works, or doesn't.\n \n \ngetting back to the topic, apparently not many people can separate the concept of prayer from the concept of theism. i see prayer as a very ancient version of positive affirmations and agreement. i wouldnt be surprised if the concept of god came about after people had been practicing forms of prayer for generations. what causes a favorable outcome is focusing mental energy on visualizing that outcome. by verbalizing the outcome, it helps the mind form a clear picture. by having another person share the vision of the outcome, it exponentially increases the motivation to acheive it, and the mental activity aimed towards getting the outcome\n \n of course, all i've said above sounds almost as supernatural and spiritual as theism itself, but its not. you guys may be surprised to learn that there are many spiritual atheists. believing in the power of prayer does not at all necessitate believing in god or any form of spiritual deity\n\n \n I'm not surprised there ae spiritual atheists at all -- I'm not one of them myself, but i can understand the feeling. As I've said previously, there may be value to individual prayer as a way of focussing one's thinking. I've never denied that. It's the implication that there is something supernatural about it I find implausible.",

   "Your claim was that the analogy I did in fact present (I certainly didn't \"claim\" to present it, I presented it) -- which was nothing more than the analogies Bertrand Russell and Carl Sagan developed -- was \"invalid\" -- by which you meant, it seemed to me owing to the angry and snide tone of your posts, that you disagreed with and resented it. However, I don't think this particular pie-throwing spat deserves a board of its own, do you?\nNo, dear. I said that what you presented as an analogy (therby claiming it to be a valid one) was indeed false. I believe I said that you have done nothing more than make a statement about two things. In fact, that is all you did.\n \n I had not read this particular article when I last answered you, but it puts my thoughts in better terms.\n \n http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,374,Our-Teapot-which-art-in-heaven,Murrough-OBrienIndependent-UK,page2#10262\n \n Dawkins also can't resist whipping out Russell's Teapot Paradigm. To explain: we cannot definitively prove that a teapot is not at this moment orbiting the earth but the balance of probability weighs against it. For teapot, read (of course) God. Oh dear. The analogy fails spectacularly because it's predicated on the fallacy of \"all things being equal\", that \"all things being equal\" we should have no reason to suppose that a God existed. But all things aren't equal: to think otherwise is to indulge in counterfactuality. To put it another way, the \"delusion\" of God is here opposed by the illusion of a human history devoid of religion. The fact is that a belief in transcendent powers of one sort or another is, so far as we can tell, as old as humanity, and has been upheld by some of its greatest minds. So no, a teapot won't do really. Some otherwise intelligent people seriously believe that the Earl of Oxford wrote the plays of Shakespeare and, were all things equal, they would have a case. But, again, all things that matter remain obstinately unequal: you've got to explain why it isn't Shakespeare before you attempt to prove why it is the earl of Oxford. An old tradition may be false, but in your way it lies. \n \n So Russell's Teapot is no more than a cute version of the idea that the burden of proof rests with the believer, not with the sceptic. It's a fair point. But equally fair is the believer's retort that the burden of self-proof rests with the greenhorn, not with the veteran. In the history of human thought, neo-Darwinian atheism is the new kid on the block and, if this book is anything to go by, it has yet to prove itself to the 'hood.\n \n \n Your \"analogy\" is nothing more than a one-size-fits-all statement about any two things that you choose to fill in the blanks (God, teapot, purple unicorn, fire-breathing dragon, little red wagon, four-eyed golden frog...ad infinitum) for which you have established absolutely no relevant similarity with which to apply an analogy. Yours is a false analogy, therefore not truly an analogy. Bertram's original is no different.\n \n The use of more and more ridiculous comparisons is just your way of ridiculing religion and belief in God.\n \n Cute and humorous, but you get no cigar!",

   "Sorry, Jim, but I think mine and Bertrand's (who is this \"Bertram\" fellow? were you thinking of Bertie Wooster?) judgment is more reliable here. I think all we need do is post Russell's original point in the final paragraphs of his essay, Is There a God?:\n \n \nMany orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it. I do not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied history. Practically all the beliefs of savages are absurd. In early civilizations there may be as much as one percent for which there is something to be said. In our own day.... But at this point I must be careful. We all know that there are absurd beliefs in Soviet Russia. If we are Protestants, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Catholics. If we are Catholics, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Protestants. If we are Conservatives, we are amazed by the superstitions to be found in the Labour Party. If we are Socialists, we are aghast at the credulity of Conservatives. I do not know, dear reader, what your beliefs may be, but whatever they may be, you must concede that nine-tenths of the beliefs of nine-tenths of mankind are totally irrational. The beliefs in question are, of course, those which you do not hold. I cannot, therefore, think it presumptuous to doubt something which has long been held to be true, especially when this opinion has only prevailed in certain geographical regions, as is the case with all theological opinions.\n \n My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity.\n\n \n The bolded text, which was the gist of your original contention that because god cannot be disproven, it is perfectly reasonable to think he exists, is where the analogy to belief in god lies. I think Russell's exposition is far more erudite and convincing than the frantic angst on the part of religious apologists who don't like to admit the sheer irrationality of their beliefs.\n \n Yes, Jim, if they want me to believe in their deity, or his alleged penchant for granting the prayers of his favorites, I do expect some evidence. Any reasonable person would. If they can't put up, they'll just have to contend with the frequent giggling from the peanut gallery at their act.",

Regardless, you've now addressed the issue.\n \n \nI am totally ignorant regarding the terms of which you speak.\n\n I figure that's true for the vast majority of people here, particularly those who've never taken an organic chemistry course. But really, the terms don't matter; the concept being illustrated is the key. If we're told information x, and especially if we have lots of other information related to information x, and then we are told that information x is really false, we seem to be wired to be very skeptical of this claim, even if our reasons for accepting information x to begin with are less reliable than reasons for rejecting it.\n \n \nIt is the fact that the events surrounding Jesus changed the world so dramatically as to define the beginning and end of two time-keeping periods that makes me believe something enormously powerful happened while Jesus was alive on earth.\n\n I'm not a historian (I was trained in chemistry, obviously), but I'm pretty sure that this system came about way, way after the fact...\n *puts on muzak and checks internets*\n So, a quick bit of reading reveals that the BC/AD calendar trick arises from a desire to remove the confusion that results from countless methods of counting years. Why, we must wonder, was the approximate time of Jesus' birth chosen as the starting point? Was it necessarily because Jesus had such a major impact? No, it was because monks were the ones working on a unified dating system, their desire was to pin down important religious dates, and the materials they had to work with all related to Jesus' birth, life, and death.\n \n \nHad it happened only 200 years ago, I would still believe that a higher power did it. It is far more impressive though that it happened before printing presses and radio came about and that it still generates bible sales in the millions each year...in just about every language known to mankind. Yessir..something REALLY strong happened 2000 years ago. There should be no doubt about that.\n\n The irony is that I came back to this thread a few minutes ago because I wanted to add something to my previous post even before I saw your response:\n Monotheism is much, much older than 2000 years old. In fact, so is belief in YHWH specifically. But prior to about 1900 years ago, YHWH was seen as a rather mean sky man that you just didn't want to tick off.\n The modern view of the Christian God is not nearly that old. It keeps adapting and shifting based on what the believers think. As an example, I'm sure that most modern U.S. Southerners now view slavery as contemptible. But the Bible surely doesn't say so, and U.S. Southerners a century and a half ago almost surely didn't think so. Different denominations have different views of many things, including God and what God wants.\n \n In my opinion, that amazing, \"REALLY strong\" thing that happened nineteen hundred years ago was that somebody realized that they could catch more flies with honey. Ease out that evil view of God, come up with an incredible feel-good story, rationalize the lack of evidence, and stand back while the masses swallow it whole.",

   "...\n \n As has been pointed out by others, the analogy is between belief in these objects and the burden of evidence for that belief, not between the objects themselves.\n \n ... \nTry this, if you will.\n \n \n \n http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com/posts/1169851433.shtml\n \n \n \n \n Russell's Teapot: Does it Hold Water?\n Here is a famous passage from Bertrand Russell's Is There a God?\n \n Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.\n \n One thing Russell is doing in this passage is making an unexceptionable point about burden of proof and/or the ad ignorantiam fallacy. If the existence of X has not been disproven, it does not follow that X exists, or even that it is reasonable to believe that X exists. So if anyone were to affirm the existence of something like Russell's celestial teapot or Edward Abbey's angry unicorn on the dark side of the moon, then the onus probandi would be on him to support his outlandish claims. The burden of proof would not rest on those who deny or dismiss such claims. \n \n So far, so good. Russell is of course doing more than underscoring a couple of obvious points in the theory of argumentation. He is applying his points of logic to the God question. Here too I have no complaint. If the existence of God has not been disproven, it does not follow that God exists or even that it is reasonable to believe that God exists. \n \n But the real appeal to atheists and agnostics of the Teapot passage rests on a third move Russell makes. He is clearly suggesting that belief in God (i.e., belief that God exists) is epistemically on a par with believing in a celestial teapot. Just as we have no reason to believe in celestial teapots, irate lunar unicorns (lunicorns?), flying spaghetti monsters, and the like, we have no reason to believe in God. But perhaps we should distinguish between a strong and a weak reading of Russell's suggestion:\n \n S. Just as we cannot have any reason to believe that an empirically undetectable celestial teapot exists, we cannot have any reason to believe that God exists.\n \n W. Just as we do not have any reason to believe that a celestial teapot exists, we do not have any reason to believe that God exists. \n \n Now it seems to me that both (S) and (W) are plainly false: we have all sorts of reasons for believing that God exists. Here Alvin Plantinga sketches about two dozen theistic arguments. Atheists will not find them compelling, of course, but that is irrelevant. The issue is whether a reasoned case can be made for theism, and the answer is in the affirmative. Belief in God and in Russell's teapot are therefore not on a par since there are no empirical or theoretical reasons for believing in his teapot.\n \n Another suggestion embedded in the Russell passage is the notion that if God existed, he would be just another physical thing in the physical universe. But of course this has nothing to do with anything maintained by any sophisticated theist. God is a purely spiritual being.\n \n Another problem with the teapot analogy is that God as traditionally conceived in the West is not an isolani - to use a chess expression. He is not like an isolated pawn, unsupported and unsupporting. For if God exists, then God is the cause of the existence of every contingent being, and indeed, of every being distinct from himself. This is not true of lunar unicorns and celestial teapots. If there is a lunar unicorn, then this is just one more isolated fact about the universe. But if God exists, then everything is unified by this fact: everything has the ground of its being and its intelligibility in the creative activity of this one paradigmatic being.\n \n This is connected with the fact that one can argue from general facts about the universe to the existence of God, but not from such facts to the existence of lunar unicorns and celestial teapots. Thus there are various sorts of cosmological argument that proceed a contingentia mundi to a ground of contingent beings. But there is no similar a posteriori argument to a celestial teapot. There are also arguments from truth, from consciousness, from apparent design, from desire, from morality, and others besides.\n The very existence of these arguments shows two things. First, since they move from very general facts (the existence of contingent beings, the existence of truth) to the existence of a source of these general facts, they show that God is not a being among beings, not something in addition to what is ordinarily taken to exist. Second, these arguments give positive reason for believing in the existence of God. Are they compelling? No, but then no argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling.\n People like Russell, Dawkins, and Dennett who compare God to a celestial teapot betray by so doing a failure to understand, and engage, the very sense of the theist's assertions. To sum up. (i) God is not a gratuitous posit in that there are many detailed arguments for the existence of God; (ii) God is not a physical being; (iii) God is not a being who simply exists alongside other beings. In all three respects, God is quite unlike a celestial teapot, a lunar uncorn, an invisible hippopotamus, and suchlike concoctions.\n \n I am quite at a loss to explain why anyone should think the Teapot analogy any good. It leaks like a sieve. \n \n Posted by William F. Vallicella on Friday January 26, 2007 at 8:22pm",

   "My snidery pales in comparison to yours. I haven't claimed victory...just tired of jawing with you. You might want to look up impasse.\n\n \n Evidently, not tired enough!\n \n \nPlease feel free to claim your argument by authority. That's another common logical fallacy. Bertrand Russell is no more authoritative than J. Fred Muggs. All Russell succeeds in verifying is that the burden of proof is on the believer, not the sceptic...something we already knew. Nothing that Titanic Captain Russell or anyone else can say will ever prove that God does not exist. The iceberg may be just around the corner.emoticon_xbye\n\n \n I appeal to reason, and Russell presents his case in a clarity of language and reason I can only envy (and his critics can't match). Russell was not claiming a disproof of god, so I don't understand why you keep resurrecting this tired and discredited notion. He was just making a simple, straightforward and perfectly understandable analogy to the vacuity of arguments for believing in this one. Maybe you are so brilliant and well educated you don't need an analogy to help you understand this point, but then, we aren't all as intelligent and insightful as you. :)",

   "One thing Russell is doing in this passage is making an unexceptionable point about burden of proof and/or the ad ignorantiam fallacy. If the existence of X has not been disproven, it does not follow that X exists, or even that it is reasonable to believe that X exists. So if anyone were to affirm the existence of something like Russell's celestial teapot or Edward Abbey's angry unicorn on the dark side of the moon, then the onus probandi would be on him to support his outlandish claims. The burden of proof would not rest on those who deny or dismiss such claims.\n\n This is the entire extent of my claim. I'm glad you and your source go along with it.\n \nBut the real appeal to atheists and agnostics of the Teapot passage...\n\n Ah, now your source claims to know my mind better than I do. I find this odd.\n \n... rests on a third move Russell makes. He is clearly suggesting that belief in God (i.e., belief that God exists) is epistemically on a par with believing in a celestial teapot.\n\n Really? Where, exactly? Russell, and I, and I think lesz, were making a point solely about who bears the burden of evidence in arguments over a posited but unobservable thing's existence. The fact that you and your source see hidden assertions of equal absurdity says more about your own sensitivity on this issue than about anything we have said.\n \n \nPerhaps ...and if we'd not found the Rosetta Stone or the Dead Sea Scrolls, we'd know a lot less than we do now.\n\n But we did. And Constantine did win the battle of Milvian Bridge. I can't see what kind of point you're trying to make here. The fact remains, christianity's prominence in western history is a consequence of purely contingent historical events. Had these events been otherwise, I suspect right now there'd be a version of jim's trucking defending the Dionysian cult against atheism with the same passion you bring to Jesus's.\n \n I think you're right (in your post to lesz) that we've reached impasse here.",

There is enough difference between the belief in God and the belief in an orbiting teapot to preclude an analogy between them being valid. There is no relevant similarity. The Russell worshippers claim that the analogy is only between the existence of God and the existence of the teapot, neither of which can be proved or disproved. The assumption that the \"analogy\" proves that belief in God makes as much sense as belief in the teapot is predicated on the equalization of the concept of God and the concept of the teapot. This is where Russell implies that God is the same as the teapot is the same as the unicorn is the same as the spaghetti monster is the same as the dragon blah blah blah.

However, it has nothing to do with ego on my part. I just refuse to roll over and concede based on the tenacity of the Russell worshippers. My amusement comes from the instances of various statements used in argument and then reversed in later posts as if they meant to say the opposite. It actually makes no difference which of us is correct. That is why I admitted an impasse exists and quit arguing with the wolf pack. It is also interesting that as in nature, when the wolves are done, the lowly jackals appear with their little parting bites.\n \n There is nothing sacred about Bertrand Russell.",

For the most part, they aren't. If religious people were out to prove to people that god exists, making an issue of it, then yeah, it would be their burden to do so. Most that I've been around (myself included) aren't out to do that, we mainly just want to be left alone and believe what we want to believe. The idea that someone else has a burden to prove something in a fight that you pick is pretty ridiculous. It's basically you giving a rhetorical shove and saying \"hey! You're god doesn't exist!

Your expecting people to prove something back to you over a claim that YOU'RE making (that he doesn't exist). I suppose anyone could go out and find someone and say \"hey, your deceased parents don't really exist anymore in an afterlife--prove me wrong!!\" Why should they be expected to do so when it's the challenger who has the problem?\n \n Now if a religious person comes along and says \"God exists\" wanting to debate that, then yeah, they need to prove their claim. Or as in this case, if they say \"God answers prayer!\" and are doing so as a point of debate, then yeah, they need to try and prove their claim.

Almost every case is a claim made by the atheist that so-and-so 'doesn't exist, and I want to be proven wrong'. \n \n The bottom line is that burden of proof only matters if someone is out to prove something.

I'll quote them in several translations, but they all seem to say about the same thing:\n \n Various translations of Matthew 6:6:\n \n \nNew American Standard Bible (&#169;1995)\n \"But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.\n \n GOD'S WORD&#174; Translation (&#169;1995)\n When you pray, go to your room and close the door. Pray privately to your Father who is with you. Your Father sees what you do in private. He will reward you.\n \n King James Bible\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n American Standard Version\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.\n \n Bible in Basic English\n But when you make your prayer, go into your private room, and, shutting the door, say a prayer to your Father in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward.\n \n Douay-Rheims Bible\n But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.\n \n Darby Bible Translation\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render it to thee.\n \n English Revised Version\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall recompense thee.\n \n Tyndale New Testament\n But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door to thee, and pray to thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\n \n Weymouth New Testament\n But you, whenever you pray, go into your own room and shut the door: then pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.\n \n Webster's Bible Translation\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.\n \n World English Bible\n But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.\n \n Young's Literal Translation\n But thou, when thou mayest pray, go into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee manifestly.\n\n \n I presume the good governor is probably Baptist, but even if he isn't, ONE of those translations should be familiar to him. In what sense is a press conference on the Capitol steps homologous to \"a private room\", \"closet\", or \"inner chamber\"? \n \n You know, I can understand churches organising prayers -- it's one of the things they do. Had the governor gone to his church and prayed there quietly with his congregation, no eyebrows would have been lifted. It's his making a public spectacle of himself and his religiosity that brings his religion into disrepute by openly inviting mockery.

St. Augustine could have given him a few tips on that.\n \n Religious belief has been taken far too solemnly for far too long in American society, especially in the bible belt.

Satire and mockery are potent oratorical weapons, which is, of course, why jyoshu and jim have had such negative reactions to them here, and there is all the difference in the world between the GA governor making a public circus of himself and his religion, and a private funeral or church service. And many beliefs do invite ridicule, and as billsco points out, the best way to avoid ridicule is to avoid having such beliefs. If the governor can't take the mockery, he should stay out of politics.\n\n \n I love how prejudicial belittling has been reframed here as \"satire\", as if this is some kind of Mark-Twain thing going on. The content of your post doesn't just satirize. Sorry, no matter how much you dress it up, you just don't like religion (and you've basically said as much). Forget specifics, forget the fact Perdue might have been genuine in his prayers, forget all that. By golly, he dared prayed and called on others to do so!! How dare he, huh? You and Waxy keep dancing around the real issue here, and the real issue isn't \"satire\" as a tool, and it's not whether or not prayers should be public or not. Those are both beside the point. You have a prejudice problem toward religion, plain and simple. There is absolutely no reason a governor or president should not feel completely free morally and socially to call on people to pray over a major and protentially tragic problem. We do it all the time in the wake of major problems and disasters, from 9/11, to a day of prayer for peace. Democrats do it too!\n \n Don't get me wrong ... you're certainly constitutionally free to mock, laugh, and belittle people when they engage in religious practices all you want. You can even give the excuse that \"it's because it was PUBLIC\" (give me a break emoticon_rolleyes ). But for those of us who see through it, it betrays you and shows you to harbor the bigotry that you do.",

There are a few left among the Democrats, but not as many as there used to be. Presidents and governors are free to pray as much as they want, just as is any other private citizen, but when they do it as stupidly and brazenly as Perdue did, they justly make themselves open to ridicule. What they do is an abuse of religion, not a celebration of it -- if I were religious, I'd be cringing as well.\n \n And yes, I am prejudiced against religious belief, with just cause, given the damage it can do, and frequently does. \n \n \nDon't get me wrong ... you're certainly constitutionally free to mock, laugh, and belittle people when they engage in religious practices all you want.

Objection to hypocrisy isn't bigotry, either. But if it salves your soul to consider me a bigot because I argue vehemently against religious belief, and the cynicism of politicians courting the credulous vote, go ahead.

Merely providing an explanation for something doesn't make a belief reasonable; the explanation it provides would have to be reasonable itself for that to be the case. To use your own example, simply saying that the orbiting teapot is spilling water and causing rain does not in any way make its existence more plausible, it's still an absurd notion. Saying that the teapot makes rain does not make belief in it any more reasonable. Likewise, I see no phenomena for which \"an invisible, omnipotent, omniscient being that works in mysterious ways did it\" is a reasonable explanation. Possible? Sure. But reasonable? No. And that's the real point here.\n\n i never said that either of the beliefs were reasonable. and in this regard they can be considered similar. but like it or not, there is actually a reason why people believe in god. the belief in god exists as an explanation for observable phenomenon. in this regard, the belief in god has a basis that the teapot does not",

It's based on the personal belief that God is more than a teapot - God is observable, God's influence can seen, etc... To some extent I see the point they're trying to make -that there's a lot more hearsay, conjecture and speculative evidence for God at this point that there is for a teapot.

Unfamiliar with the structure of Hebrew poetry, Matthew simply misunderstood the parallelism in the original statement of Zechariah, so this resulted in a misquotation:\n Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an XXX, even upon a colt, the foal of an XXX (Zech. 9:9, ASV).\n Parallel emphasis was used extensively in Hebrew literature, and that was all that Zechariah was doing in this text. The XXX was a colt, the foal of an XXX, and this was all that Zechariah meant. Certainly, he did not mean for his readers to understand that this king (whoever he was) would ride on both an XXX and her colt, as Matthew interpreted the statement to mean. (Incidentally, this mistake constitutes implied proof that whoever wrote the gospel of Matthew was non-Jewish and therefore unfamiliar with a Hebraic literary form that the real apostle Matthew would probably have known had he been the actual writer.) The misinterpretation resulted in an absurdity that is missing from Mark's and Luke's versions of the story, because they correctly understood the original statement.\n\n But this by no means is meant to imply that this is the only one.

   "Yes, \"Matthew\" was mistaken because he didn't understand the writings in Zechariah that he was trying to match. Or are you saying that \"Matthew\" was mistaken in that he actually saw Jesus ride in on a single donkey but -- for some inexplicable reason -- went to great lengths to explain how he rode in on two? Again, take your pick, jyoshu; neither bodes well for you.\n\n \n Yeah, so it's different on a detail. Big freakin' deal. What are you trying to prove here, exactly? Are you trying to say they aren't credible at all because of some differences here and there? Nah, it doesn't speak to the credibility of the whole event because the writers got so much more of the accounts the same and similar. It's sorta like if someone recounts the Battle of the Bulge a little differently than someone else, it doesn't mean the battle didn't happen. You're making a mountain out of a molehill here.\n \n \nYou've got to be kidding me. You believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of God that describes the life events of Jesus, and when faced with damning evidence of bullspitting by the author, it's \"not a big deal.\" Disgusting. You believe that God gifted you with a brain, but you refuse to use it.\n\n \n Did you think you were discussing with an literalist inerrantist? LOL Sorry to disappoint you.",

   "It's not so much what it has to cover as how good a fit it is to subsequent events. The famous Micah 5 passage foresees a 'ruler in Israel' (which Jesus never was) who will win a military victory over the Assyrians (which Jesus never did). Only by special pleading (they're metaphors, or it hasn't happened yet) can these be made to fit.\n \n 'Could instead mean'? 'Suggesting another possibility'? Jyoshu, I'm suggesting the passage means what it says. You are the one suggesting it 'could instead mean' something else. As I said, special pleading.\n\n \n And Christians also suggest it means what it says! It's too vague to clearly and comprehensively apply to either, 100%! Not to mention that prophecy nearly always involves metaphor, so that's certainly not an inappropriate way to look at it. Your problem is that you're being more of a literalist than those Christians themselves in your approach here! You're doing the SAME thing the people of the time who rejected Christ did by only viewing messiah in the context of a military leader, when in fact using military allusions were a common means of metaphor in scripture (and still are, in religion). You're apparently expecting prophecy to be some word-for-word account of Jesus with no surprises. That's completely unrealistic, IMO, and no Christian I know of views prophecy in that sense and role to begin with anyway.",

   "Really? What is vague about foretelling someone who is going to be 'ruler in Israel' and 'shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword'? Both are highly concrete, verifiable statements; neither remotely attaches itself to Jesus.\n\n \n Well, let's look at the whole passage, shall we, and see what's vague and what not?\n \"13 And he [7] said, \"Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son [SPECIFIC], and shall call his name Immanuel. [VAGUE - just means \"God with us\"] [8] 15 He shall eat curds and honey [COULD BE SPECIFIC, OR VAGUE] when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good [VAGUE]. 16 For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. [SPECIFIC, BUT THIS IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE--ASSYRIA *WAS* CEASED AS AN EMPIRE BY THE TIME OF CHRIST] The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house [VAGUE] such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-the king of Assyria.\"\n \n 18 In that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. [VAGUE] And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. [VAGUE]\n \n 20 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River-with the king of Assyria-the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.[SPECIFIC]\n \n 21 In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, 22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.[SPECIFIC]\n \n 23 In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels [10] of silver, will become briers and thorns. 24 With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns. 25 And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.\n \n You see, these are general, sweeping themes. The \"in that day ... they'll eat curds and honey\" thing is about prosperity. That God will bring prosperity. And the idea is that it will be that way in a time as the one born of a virgin. I think you're making too much of the Assyria king thing--Assyria would obviously have represented oppression to them, if you know the history. But even if you take that literally, the king WAS gone by the the time of Christ. Keep in mind that the passage does NOT say the one born of the virgin would be the one to defeat him.\n \n Honestly, I think you have a misunderstanding of the way most Christians view prophecies like this. They view them in terms of sweeping themes, with clues here and there that point to what is said in the New Testament about Christ. The prophecies aren't assumed to be comprehensive or extremely specific. Or even necessarily following a strict chronology or time-line.\n \n \nA classic case of begging the question. It is only because examples like the above can be interpreted your way only with recourse to metaphor that you conclude 'prophecy nearly always involves metaphor'. A circular argument.\n\n \n Except that it's pretty obvious, in the text, that they are metaphorical. I mean, for example do you really think the text intends to mean that EVERY SINGLE person , from babies on up, without exception, in Judah will eat curds and honey, necessarily? It's a metaphor for prosperity. Anyone giving it a reasonable reading is going to conclude that.\n \n A lot of work has been done of this sort of thing--there's nothing here that Biblical scholars have not poured over many times through, and so when I say that prophecy nearly always involves metaphor, I'm telling you this because that's the way prophecy-literature works. Anyone who's been around Biblical scholarship and critical studies for much of any time whatsoever is going to tell you that.\n \n \nAgain with the 'surprises'. What were the prophets meant to be, scenario writers specialising in unexpected plot twists?\n\n \n No, I'm saying they weren't such. I don't think it's really being fair to hold to them to some standard that doesn't leave any room for the unexpected, when the world-changing event--the lifetime of an individual--takes place.\n \n \nif they didn't contain huge, concrete inaccuracies which can be explained away only with recourse to special pleading.\n\n \n How is it an inaccuracy here when nowhere in the text above is the child mentioned claimed to be the one to defeat the Assyrian king? The text was encouraging the people about Assyria by saying there would be a day it would be deserted and no longer be an empire, but it could easily be read in a more general sense involving in the future.",

[VAGUE - just means \"God with us\"] [8] 15 He shall eat curds and honey [COULD BE SPECIFIC, OR VAGUE] when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good [VAGUE]. 16 For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. [SPECIFIC, BUT THIS IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE--ASSYRIA *WAS* CEASED AS AN EMPIRE BY THE TIME OF CHRIST] The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house [VAGUE] such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-the king of Assyria.\"\n \n 18 In that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. [VAGUE] And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. [VAGUE]\n \n 20 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River-with the king of Assyria-the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.[SPECIFIC]\n \n 21 In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, 22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.[SPECIFIC]\n \n 23 In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels [10] of silver, will become briers and thorns. 24 With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns. 25 And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.\n \n You see, these are general, sweeping themes. The \"in that day ... they'll eat curds and honey\" thing is about prosperity. That God will bring prosperity. And the idea is that it will be that way in a time as the one born of a virgin. I think you're making too much of the Assyria king thing--Assyria would obviously have represented oppression to them, if you know the history. But even if you take that literally, the king WAS gone by the the time of Christ. Keep in mind that the passage does NOT say the one born of the virgin would be the one to defeat him.\n \n Honestly, I think you have a misunderstanding of the way most Christians view prophecies like this. They view them in terms of sweeping themes, with clues here and there that point to what is said in the New Testament about Christ. The prophecies aren't assumed to be comprehensive or extremely specific. Or even necessarily following a strict chronology or time-line.\n \n \n \n Except that it's pretty obvious, in the text, that they are metaphorical. I mean, for example do you really think the text intends to mean that EVERY SINGLE person , from babies on up, without exception, in Judah will eat curds and honey, necessarily? It's a metaphor for prosperity. Anyone giving it a reasonable reading is going to conclude that.\n \n A lot of work has been done of this sort of thing--there's nothing here that Biblical scholars have not poured over many times through, and so when I say that prophecy nearly always involves metaphor, I'm telling you this because that's the way prophecy-literature works. Anyone who's been around Biblical scholarship and critical studies for much of any time whatsoever is going to tell you that.\n \n \n \n No, I'm saying they weren't such. I don't think it's really being fair to hold to them to some standard that doesn't leave any room for the unexpected, when the world-changing event--the lifetime of an individual--takes place.\n \n \n \n How is it an inaccuracy here when nowhere in the text above is the child mentioned claimed to be the one to defeat the Assyrian king? The text was encouraging the people about Assyria by saying there would be a day it would be deserted and no longer be an empire, but it could easily be read in a more general sense involving in the future.\n\n \n \n Except of course. let's look at the entire thing in context.. from a historical point of view.\n \n Isaiah was giving Ahaz a sign. That sign was 'A child is going to be born soon, and before that child knows the meaning of Good and Evil, the kingdoms of assyeria that are giving you so much trouble will suffer a defeat.\n \n Also... Almah is hebrew for 'a young woman', not virgin.. .. which shows that Matthew was working off the Greek texts, which sometimes has parthnos as virgin, but not exclusively.\n \n It further goes on to say how this was acheived. Isaiah 8:3-4 had Isaiah going to the prophetess , and insuring she conceived. Now, In those days, there is only one way for a man to insure a woman conceives.. .. and that doesn't leave the woman in the state we currently call 'virginity'. If you don't accept that, read a bit further on.. Isaiah 8:18 says the signs he was talking about earlier were he, and his own sons. \n \n Context, sir,.. context.. Read the WHOLE thing.. not just a paragraph.\n \n And, understand what it meant to the writer.. not retrofiting by people trying to prove something else hundreds of years later.",

   "Well, fine. Except that I was in Micah, and you've suddenly swept us into Isaiah. Please at least give the occasional nod to consistency.\n\n \n Sorry, I thought you had mentioned Isaiah earlier; that's why I used that passage.\n \n \nIn other words, they make the a priori assumption that they're about Christ, then look for 'clues' to retrofit them. That's a pretty candid admission, Jyosh.\n\n \n No, at some point Christians notice things like virgin birth, and being given stripes from a beating, and then connect the dots. How could they not do so??? Now you may think those dots aren't valid, but that's a matter of opinion.\n \n Here's the thing. It perplexes me that, given that you put no stock in prophecy whatsoever, your basis of arguing here seems to be that it's more likely something else that was said in the text. (pertaining to defeating Assyrians.) But if you put no stock in the validity of the text, or prophecy, why is that your basis?? To be consistent, I would think you'd put no stock in Isaiah or Micah toward prophecy regarding ANYTHING--Assyrian invasion included. If I ask 'which did he supernaturally foresee: a conquerer of Assyria or a different kind of Messiah,' you're not likely to take either choice and say no prophecy is valid, right? So, to be honest, I'm having trouble taking your argument on this seriously at all! If you say \"well, NO prophecy is valid\" then your whole idea that he intended an Assyrian messiah is out the window too, because you'd have to be of the view that he didn't foresee ANYTHING.\n \n \nBut why should it be unless you have an agenda to fulfill? I know I keep using the phrase 'special pleading'; but that's only because you keep indulging in it.\n\n \n I see no reason prophecy can't be equally expected to be general and/or specific. For that matter, it's often a criticism against prophecy that it tends to be general and applicable to any number of things, so I find it ironic you're defending it being specific in this case.",

   "Also... Almah is hebrew for 'a young woman', not virgin.. .. which shows that Matthew was working off the Greek texts, which sometimes has parthnos as virgin, but not exclusively.\n\n \n It's generally understood that it can also mean \"virgin\". I find it surprising that people actually argue against this on the point that you just did, and here's why. Why would the text only intend to say someone would be born from a \"young woman\"? There's nothing noteworthy about that whatsoever. After all, many babies were born to young women. Because that would be such a pointless thing to say, it makes more sense from the context that the intention is that it means she was a virgin--unmarried. The author wouldn't use \"young woman\" just to give a sense of the age of the mother; that has no significance whatsoever, since most women probably bore children young anyway. (They could be married at 12, I believe.) It makes much more sense to assume, from the context, that he means an unmarried woman--a virgin.\n \n As you said yourself ... context, sir, context.\n \n And certainly, Matthew isn't the only gospel writer to make the case of a virgin birth.\n \n \nIt further goes on to say how this was acheived. Isaiah 8:3-4 had Isaiah going to the prophetess , and insuring she conceived.

Thanks for clearing that up. emoticon_xgood You're doing the same thing John Hanks did. See, you don't get to argue against one possible option that the writer supernaturally saw ahead of time by using a different option that he might have supernaturally seen ahead of time, if you don't hold to the legitimacy of prophecy to begin with. If you don't hold to the legitimacy of supernatural prophecy at all, then Immanuel as Christ is no less valid than the possibilities you're arguing. Because it was still written off as a foreseeing of events, in the text, no matter which way you go on it. The only honest argument you can make (consistent with yourself, that is) is that you think the whole book is bull, rather than it means something else than Christians think it does.",

As mentioned earlier, the whole book reeks of Fudging for Fulfillment\u0099. Assuming Jesus rode in at all, he rode in on either one or two animals. The other Gospels describe one, \"Matthew\" two. Either \"Matthew\" was there and didn't see Jesus ride in on two, choosing instead to fudge the story to fit his erroneous reading of Zechariah (i.e. lie), or \"Matthew\" has no idea what really happened and wrote the story to fit the prophecy independent of what happened (i.e. lie). He didn't mess up his reading intentionally, but he did fudge intentionally, and that is evident because he didn't know how to read.\n \n \nLOL. Electro, I mean no offense in saying this, but there's a good chance I know more about Biblical criticism over this stuff than you do. ...\n\n I hope you're right; I won't claim to be an expert.

I can't separate critical thinking from questioning intent of an author, and as such it just doesn't add up in terms of intent. I do realise there are numerous other books out there where people lied by trying to pass themselves off as an apostolic authority (they are usually referred to as the pseudopigraphic writings).

I didn't intend it that way; I don't assume to know how much you do or don't know about this sort of thing. I was simply trying to get across that I didn't just 'fall off the turnip truck' when it to issues, and have definitely read a lot about this stuff and thought through it.\n \n \n... and eliminate the fluff that isn't needed.

And there may be SOME accuracy there anyway (though not a \"worldwide\" flood) in the sense of localised Dead Sea area flooding and so forth.\n \n And remember, the Noah story probably came from oral tradition, originally. So we'll never really know for certain whether it or the Gilgamesh version came first.

Rather, I'll say \"long-standing view\" of some things. For instance, there is no doubt that very, very early Christians believed the synoptics were legitimate, and written by who they said they were. Clement of Rome quoted them before 100AD, and Ignatius did so not long afterwards. I think there's something to be said for that. The farther back you go with a view of something, almost to the event, the more it attests to it's legitimacy, IMO. If you have accounts about the battle of Waterloo that go back nearly to the battle, then it helps the case that it really happened.\n \n \nSo is it the history that matters, or the ideas that matter? This is an extremely important question.\n\n \n History matters, but the ideas matter more, IMO. That's why I can overlook that some of the 'events' described in the Bible are either contrived or metaphorical. For instance, a fish likely didn't swallow a man and him survive 3 days inside, but IMO the story is a good one about not having bigotry and prejudice and instead offering good towards people that one doesn't necessarily like.

You can't believe that an author might embellish an event even if he did see it?\n \n \nWell, upon re-reading my statement, it sounded somewhat arrogant. I didn't intend it that way; I don't assume to know how much you do or don't know about this sort of thing. I was simply trying to get across that I didn't just 'fall off the turnip truck' when it to issues, and have definitely read a lot about this stuff and thought through it.\n\n Let's face it: most Christians seem to have just fallen off the turnip truck. The fact that you were able to rattle off these significant issues shows me that you really have paid attention to them. Kudos to you for this, jyoshu.\n \n \nSee, I'd say it's not fluff. IOW, whether or not something is fluff or not doesn't necessarily rest on whether or not it's historically accurate. And there may be SOME accuracy there anyway (though not a \"worldwide\" flood) in the sense of localised Dead Sea area flooding and so forth.\n\n I agree that there may be some parts of the Bible that are historically accurate, and I agree that historical accuracy isn't the sole determining factor for \"fluff or not.\" But it is damning when the bits that are allegedly the best reasons for believing these things turn out to be inaccurate.\n \n \nAnd remember, the Noah story probably came from oral tradition, originally. So we'll never really know for certain whether it or the Gilgamesh version came first. Though, yes, the recording of it in the Torah certainly was later.\n\n The Epic of Gilgamesh came before even the precursors of Genesis, and there is no evidence to support the position that there could have been the Noachian flood story floating around before Gilgamesh. While I agree with your other statements, I maintain that it doesn't matter. A worldwide flood clearly did not happen, therefore it did not occur as God's punishment, rainbows are not a reminder from God, etc. But this should make you wonder what other BS is in the Bible.\n \n \nWell, maybe 'tradition' isn't the best term for what I'm talking about, because in today's day and time it tends to carry a lot of baggage. Rather, I'll say \"long-standing view\" of some things. For instance, there is no doubt that very, very early Christians believed the synoptics were legitimate, and written by who they said they were. Clement of Rome quoted them before 100AD, and Ignatius did so not long afterwards. I think there's something to be said for that. The farther back you go with a view of something, almost to the event, the more it attests to it's legitimacy, IMO. If you have accounts about the battle of Waterloo that go back nearly to the battle, then it helps the case that it really happened.\n\n First, this is what we ragged on jim's trucking about earlier in this very thread. You are right in that the date of a claim (considering the date of the event it describes) might be useful, but the age of a claim has no correlation to its truth value. Second, these gospels were written nearly fifty years after the events. Matthew contradicts the others -- in this example -- on the number of animals Jesus sat upon. And if you've been keeping up with my posts to jim's trucking, these are the sorts of things that we'd expect to be written down immediately. If Clement was lending credence to them around AD 100, then he's thirty years after the first Gospel and 70 years after the events in question. Play \"telephone\" with ten people for ten minutes and see how well conservation of details works, then extrapolate to forty years. The fact that a solid analysis of the books didn't happen until much, much later in no way devalues that analysis, especially because there is more information now than just those four gospels.\n \n \nHistory matters, but the ideas matter more, IMO. That's why I can overlook that some of the 'events' described in the Bible are either contrived or metaphorical. For instance, a fish likely didn't swallow a man and him survive 3 days inside, but IMO the story is a good one about not having bigotry and prejudice and instead offering good towards people that one doesn't necessarily like. (Among other 'morals to the story'.)\n\n Without trying to belittle the value of the \"morals of the stories,\" why do some of the falsehoods get a free pass? How do you determine which are contrived and which are not? For example, how can you say that Jesus didn't really ride into town, but it's part of the story of prophecy fulfillment that \"shows\" that Jesus was really the son of God, such that people who read the story will follow Jesus' advice?\n \n ETA: This clearly should have been added above: if you value the realtime input so much, why don't you value the realtime determination made by the Jews that Jesus was not the Messiah? They knew the writings, they knew the prophecies, but they didn't think Jesus was the one. Decades later there were writings trying to make the case, and you believe those...",

   "No they didn't, but IMO that's sorta the point.\n\n Uh, this is my point. I get to \"prophesy\" (i.e. pull out of my XXX) some event, then I get to claim that it just hasn't yet happened...\n \n \nIsaiah, for instance, mentions things clearly intended to be end-of-the-world type stuff, off in the future. So obviously he didn't intend to be limited to the time of Assyria.\n\n How do you know? Did he say that it would be beyond the time of Assyria?\n Seriously, let's use this example, because it's clearly drastic. If we're still here, then the world hasn't ended, so the prophecy just hasn't come true yet. After the world ends, nobody will know... but if we take the hypothetical where someone is still around to know, what good was the prophecy? Would that person have completely missed the fact that the world ended had it not been for the prophecy? No... the \"prophecy\" was completely useless. Was anybody able to prepare for this in any reasonable sense? No... the \"prophecy\" was completely void of predictive power.",

   "So, to be honest, I'm having trouble taking your argument on this seriously at all! If you say \"well, NO prophecy is valid\" then your whole idea that he intended an Assyrian messiah is out the window too, because you'd have to be of the view that he didn't foresee ANYTHING.\n\n Sorry, but this is specious. The fact that I don't believe Micah had supernatural foresight has nothing to do with my contention that what he believed to be his vision of the future concerned a military ruler who would defeat the Assyrians. It isn't poor old Micah I'm arguing against: it's the NT writers and their present-day followers who twist and distort Micah's perfectly plain words in order to fit them to a different character altogether.",

Sorry, but it DOES matter that these are early writings.

Typically, writings about an event in ancient times that are dated to only 50 years after the event would be considered a treasure trove--and make no mistake, they WOULD be considered evidence in most cases. Most anything else would be. But not these books! They're judged by a different standard than everything else, 'cause they have to do with religion. Never mind the fact that we use Egyptian religious-related texts to assume various Pharoahs existed. Never mind that much of ancient literature and records were full of religious allusions as well, and we view them as valid evidence for events, places, and people of the time. \n \n \nIf Clement was lending credence to them around AD 100, then he's thirty years after the first Gospel and 70 years after the events in question. Play \"telephone\" with ten people for ten minutes and see how well conservation of details works, then extrapolate to forty years.\n\n \n This has got to be one of the absolute weakest and absurd arguments I hear for the non-validity of the gospels. By that standard, ANY writing in the past of anything that happened decades before is useless! That's just unreasonable thinking on your part. Imagine how much of history we need to discount if such a standard is applied that any account 50 years or so after the fact isn't going to be considered reliable! Heck, forget what I said awhile ago about the spurious addendums to Josephus--because you must assume EVERYTHING attributed to Josephus is BS, including what he really DID write! Your standard would allow for no ancient historian to write after the fact if the writing takes place several decades after the event.\n \n \nWithout trying to belittle the value of the \"morals of the stories,\" why do some of the falsehoods get a free pass?\n \n How do you determine which are contrived and which are not?\n\n \n You mean like water covering the whole planet?

Because it's not the intention of the story to purport the amount of water on the earth, but rather a deeper message. You're missing the forest for the trees.\n \n Now, I'll freely say it's difficult sometimes to separate the myth from what may have really happened. But we just have to remember the Bible isn't there to be a science book, or teach a fact-based history lesson. It's there to teach us about God. At least that's my opinion of it.\n \n \nETA: This clearly should have been added above: if you value the realtime input so much, why don't you value the realtime determination made by the Jews that Jesus was not the Messiah?

If \"Matthew\" wasn't at the event but truly believed that the event happened because (1) he believed Jesus was the Messiah and (2) he believed that Jesus fulfilled the \"prophecies,\" then Matthew could have written even with a completely clear conscience about an event that he didn't know never happened.\n \n \nThe thing that I find troublesome about this sort of thinking is that it is an all-or-nothing way of looking at the scriptures.

That's not the point of the story!\n\n Stick Genesis in the same location on the library shelves as Cinderella and Hansel and Gretel, and I won't have so much to complain about. About half of people in this country refuse to understand the evidence in support of evolutionary theory because of the book of Genesis. I've told you about Baby Fae, yes?\n \n \nSo, if someone writes about an event that happened 50 years earlier, it means it's spurious? Come on.

Read The Odyssey and The Iliad. Do you doubt that there was a Trojan war? Do you doubt that there was a person named Achilles? Do you doubt that Achilles was dipped in the river Styx and was thereafter invulnerable except for the ankle?\n The claim that this is from within one person's memory is not one that is supported by the evidence. The author was likely not Matthew the apostle, and even if it were, we can look at the other Gospels and see that something is damn fishy.\n \n \nSorry, but it DOES matter that these are early writings. If you say it doesn't then you need to assume any writings of antiquity are useless if they report events that happened 50 or more years earlier.\n\n Have you no response to my points about these allegedly amazing and important events happening in the proximity of people who would be indescribably motivated to put these events in writing immediately, and yet... decades?\n \n \nSee, this is what I find most annoying--if not double-'standardish', about critics who make these sorts of arguments. Typically, writings about an event in ancient times that are dated to only 50 years after the event would be considered a treasure trove--and make no mistake, they WOULD be considered evidence in most cases.\n\n It's not that they're completely disregarded. They might be less scrutinized if for example, [1] they weren't so incredible (extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence) [2] their nature didn't make them unlikely to remain unrecorded for so long, [3] there wasn't the synoptic problem alongside the stench of fudged history.\n You might want to look at it this way: if I up and declared that Jesus came back in June of 1968, and lots of people saw and worshipped, and even though there were religious scribes who knew how to read and write, nobody bothered to write it down until today... nobody would believe me, including you.\n \n \nThis has got to be one of the absolute weakest and absurd arguments I hear for the non-validity of the gospels. ... Your standard would allow for no ancient historian to write after the fact if the writing takes place several decades after the event.\n\n No, my standard would allow for no original work several decades after the fact.

But rainbows are a well-understood physical phenomenon, and thinking of them as some sort of sign from God flies in the face of Occam's Razor... and pretty much all reason.\n\n \n Whether or not they are fact (in the sense of actually having occured in history) is irrelevant. The Bible is not meant to be a history book. It doesn't matter if someone believed Jonah really got swallowed. Now, there are other issues in the Bible that it DOES matter if they believe it, such as a literal 6 day creation event, because that compromises science as we know it. But your way of looking at rainbows presupposes that God doesn't exist to begin with, and that nature has nothing to do with Him. If God creates (even if you're a deist), then rainbows may HAVE been intended to represent something. Frankly, I'd hate to think I only looked at the world in a very clinical, sterile sort of way, to where the only thing I considered in looking at a rainbow was the scientific principles involved. You can keep that limitation, thank you.\n \n One thing I find troublesome about your view is that it is an all on-or-off view of scripture. It has no room for the idea that there may BE historical reality in some of those events, and that it's written in a non-literal way. For example, just because the Bible portrays creation in periods referred to as \"days\" doesn't necessarily mean it has to be interpreted as days in the sense of what we understand to be 24 hours. \n \n I get the impression you struggle with the idea of principle and message here, and that you really want to make the Bible fit a sort of binary way of thinking, where everything is either fact or fiction, on or off, black and white, and that nothing else matters. Nothing between the lines. That seems to be the way a lot of scientifically thinking people want to approach it, but it's not a valid way of looking at it. It doesn't take into account the way of thinking of the authors at the time who saw life much differently, or the type of literature it involves. You have to approach it in a different way to understand and glean value, in my opinion.\n \n \nI didn't say they'd be worthless, but let's face reality: what happens to these stories when they're not written down? Read The Odyssey and The Iliad. Do you doubt that there was a Trojan war? Do you doubt that there was a person named Achilles? Do you doubt that Achilles was dipped in the river Styx and was thereafter invulnerable except for the ankle? \n\n \n I think you're giving oral tradition, as an art, way too little credit here. It's NOT like the phone game; it was taken seriously as a serious form of keeping information alive in less-literate societies. They took enormous care in keeping the stories straight from generation to generation. Oral tradition is a fairly well-studied form of information transmission.\n \n \nHave you no response to my points about these allegedly amazing and important events happening in the proximity of people who would be indescribably motivated to put these events in writing immediately, and yet... decades? You might want to look at it this way: if I up and declared that Jesus came back in June of 1968, and lots of people saw and worshipped, and even though there were religious scribes who knew how to read and write, nobody bothered to write it down until today... nobody would believe me, including you.\n\n \n So you're holding up the idea that we have no writings from the 50 or so years right after he was here (even though we DO have them 50 years later) as proof he wasn't a real figure, or that the gospels are not legit? Even though the 50 year-later writings are still within living memory? That's pretty shaky. For one, we don't know that they didn't write about him. Mark is generally believed to have been based on the Q source, which WAS written earlier, it's believed. Your argument is no less speculative than what you are arguing against.

No corroboration from contemporaneous Roman records of Judea. Not an artefact. Not even a tomb or box of bones. That doesn't mean he wasn't a real figure. One wouldn't expect much evidence if he was a marginal agitator at the time, but the evidence is hearsay. It is certainly possible Jesus has all the reality of Robin Hood.\n\n Ah! So you would accept the various writings, records, coins, statues, etc., etc. as evidence of Caeser's existence, but not for Jesus' existence?\n \n As statues are evidence to you, there are likely millions more statues of Mary than there are of Caesar. Do you believe Mary was a real person?\n \n I doubt anyone will ever discover a \"box of bones\" that belonged to Jesus either. The tomb is empty. Lucky for you we can't prove He was ever there....just like we can't really prove that Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Yet the written records of Jesus' time on earth are far more published than records of the Roman Empire and its various leaders. Not one of them (Roman rulers) was the subject of ancient prophesy.",

   "But your way of looking at rainbows presupposes that God doesn't exist to begin with, and that nature has nothing to do with Him.\n\n My way of looking at them is totally independent of God and therefore neutral to His existence; your way shoehorns the concept of God into an otherwise completely coherent description.\n \n \nFrankly, I'd hate to think I only looked at the world in a very clinical, sterile sort of way, to where the only thing I considered in looking at a rainbow was the scientific principles involved. You can keep that limitation, thank you.\n\n I'm sorry you don't find beauty in nature without attributing it to a deity. You can keep that limitation, if you'd like.\n \n \nOne thing I find troublesome about your view is that it is an all on-or-off view of scripture. It has no room for the idea that there may BE historical reality in some of those events, and that it's written in a non-literal way. For example, just because the Bible portrays creation in periods referred to as \"days\" doesn't necessarily mean it has to be interpreted as days in the sense of what we understand to be 24 hours.\n\n You are still misinterpreting. I didn't say that there was zero historical fact or relevance in the Bible. I didn't say that we must reject the entirety of every single story because a literal interpretation is absurd. But even if we accept the \"day-age\" idea of creation, it still is contradicted by scientific discovery... and common sense. Light before the sun? Plants before the sun? Bats are birds?\n \n \nI get the impression you struggle with the idea of principle and message here, and that you really want to make the Bible fit a sort of binary way of thinking, where everything is either fact or fiction, on or off, black and white, and that nothing else matters.\n\n I get the impression that you're trying to pigeonhole me into this stance. Try reading my posts again.\n \n \nI think you're giving oral tradition, as an art, way too little credit here. It's NOT like the phone game; it was taken seriously as a serious form of keeping information alive in less-literate societies.\n\n As art, oral traditions aren't pertinent to our discussion. The rub here in this discussion is that we aren't talking about a woefully illiterate society, a point which you seemingly want to overlook.\n \n \nSo you're holding up the idea that we have no writings from the 50 or so years right after he was here (even though we DO have them 50 years later) as proof he wasn't a real figure, or that the gospels are not legit?\n\n Yes and no. Is this fact alone all the reason one needs to reject the accounts in the gospels as truth? Perhaps not. When we combine this with the fact that nobody wrote these down for so long, even though there should have been clear motivation to do so, with the fact that the gospels are contrary and appear fudged, I think it's unreasonable to use them as the default position. We can see from your non-response to my hypothetical 1968 second coming that you don't have much of a counterargument for this.\n \n \nNot on issues related to science! I'm talking about principles and spiritual issues here. \n\n Maybe science doesn't have in its toolbox the ability to address some of these issues, but the fact that every controlled scientific study of prayer has shown that it has no effect doesn't stop you from believing that prayer works. (Hot damn, we somehow got back onto the original topic!) That seems to be a spiritual issue that can be touched by science. So where is the line of demarcation?\n \n \nGee, the Bible just can't win, can it? On one hand you definitely don't want the Bible to be considered historical fact, but then when it's used only as a book of principles instead, you then berate it because it's not treated as historical fact in following it's principles!\n\n No, I berate it when its contents are being used to support ideas that are only supported when the \"history\" becomes pertinent. I begrudge it when it promotes something as unreasonable as believing that rainbows didn't exist before the flood and are a sign from God.\n Alleged fulfillment of prophecy is one of the most-used arguments for Christianity, but the stories of fulfillment are from a certifiably questionable source. It's definitely different to use the admittedly fictional story of the tortoise and the hare to promote a good idea than to use a questionable or fictional story to promote an idea that is only valid if the story itself is true.\n \n \nSome of them who knew, very well, the writings and prophecies said yes. Paul of Tarsus being one of them.\n\n Balderdash. Saul punished Christians terribly because he thought they were heretical. Only after falling off of his horse and hitting his head hard enough to go blind did he suddenly believe. And it wasn't because of prophecy, it was because he had a \"vision\" after hitting his head. Let's see, falls off horse, slams visual cortex against the ground, his vision is messed up, and he \"sees\" something related to the rather nasty deeds he's been doing and has been tasked with continuing.

We've reached common ground to some extent, but we seem to have different degrees of which we think Bible stories have value. You've 'complimented' me for thinking through this more than most Christians, but frankly, I think you don't give the Bible nearly enough credit. You're too hung up on something the Bible isn't always even out to do: the issue of it being a scientific and factual source of information. You keep saying you don't entirely reject value in the Bible, but then you haven't really defined how you'd determine what's valuable and what's not. Your position seems more on the side of paranoia that things will be taken too far; mine is more that the determination of the Bible's value will be relegated to whether or not it's always factually historical (which is, after all, the issue you were most concerned with). I see no point in continuing at this point. \n \n \nBalderdash. Saul punished Christians terribly because he thought they were heretical.

Well let's see ... your take is based on an event that isn't recorded at all, whatsoever (nowhere does it say anything about him hitting his head!); mine is based on what was recorded of the event.

But we'll ignore the curiosity of that fact for now; the information I've seen says that a flash of light spooked his horse, Saul fell off, had a vision, and was afterward blind. Let's put two and two together: which makes more sense: that God struck him with blindness, or that damage to the occipital lobe -- which is extremely likely when you fall off of a spooked horse -- caused the blindness?
