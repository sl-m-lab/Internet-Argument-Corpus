   "Confidential memo reveals US plan to provoke an invasion of Iraq\n \n \nA confidential record of a meeting between President Bush and Tony Blair before the invasion of Iraq, outlining their intention to go to war without a second United Nations resolution, will be an explosive issue for the official inquiry into the UK's role in toppling Saddam Hussein.\n \n The memo, written on 31 January 2003, almost two months before the invasion and seen by the Observer, confirms that as the two men became increasingly aware UN inspectors would fail to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD) they had to contemplate alternative scenarios that might trigger a second resolution legitimising military action.\n \n Bush told Blair the US had drawn up a provocative plan \"to fly U2 reconnaissance aircraft painted in UN colours over Iraq with fighter cover\". Bush said that if Saddam fired at the planes this would put the Iraqi leader in breach of UN resolutions.\n \n The president expressed hopes that an Iraqi defector would be \"brought out\" to give a public presentation on Saddam's WMD or that someone might assassinate the Iraqi leader. However, Bush confirmed even without a second resolution, the US was prepared for military action. The memo said Blair told Bush he was \"solidly with the president\".\n \n The five-page document, written by Blair's foreign policy adviser, Sir David Manning, and copied to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, the chief of the defence staff, Admiral Lord Boyce, and the UK's ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, outlines how Bush told Blair he had decided on a start date for the war.\n \n Paraphrasing Bush's comments at the meeting, Manning, noted: \"The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March. This was when the bombing would begin.\"\n \n Last night an expert on international law who is familar with the memo's contents said it provided vital evidence into the two men's frames of mind as they considered the invasion and its aftermath and must be presented to the Chilcott inquiry established by Gordon Brown to examine the causes, conduct and consequences of the Iraq war.\n \n Philippe Sands, QC, a professor of law at University College London who is expected to give evidence to the inquiry, said confidential material such as the memo was of national importance, making it vital that the inquiry is not held in private, as Brown originally envisioned.\n \n In today's Observer, Sands writes: \"Documents like this raise issues of national embarrassment, not national security. The restoration of public confidence requires this new inquiry to be transparent. Contentious matters should not be kept out of the public domain, even in the run-up to an election.\" \n\n Confidential memo reveals US plan to provoke an invasion of Iraq | Politics | The Observer\n \n The more I hear about Bush and his attempts to justify the war in Iraq, the more disgusted I get.\n PROVOKING a war...\n And people wonder why he had such a LOW approval rating...",

   "Well, we all knew that the invasion of Iraq was done for 3 motives: 1) the ideologues neo-cons wanted to invade and 2) for oil concessions to American oil companies and 3) to get the biggest share of the pie when the time came to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq, hence the massive destruction of bridges, electricty network, roads etc \n \n But this development is more worrying to me:\n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may seem very different, but they are united in their apocalyptic religious visions.
