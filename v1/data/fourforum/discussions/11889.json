Many people believe in astrology or crystal healing or some other placebo. Even in businesss, the psychometric tests employed to predict who will make the best employee are often groundless.\n \n Even on this board, many people hold a similar faith in global warming.\n \n The only reason creationism is even an issue is because the public school system makes it impossible for these kinds of beliefs to be resolved in a voluntary manner.

   "You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure...\nYou're being silly or you are a dupe. Intelligent design creationism isn't straight forward, logical, rational, or common sense. It is faith driven and requires suspension of reason and logic. There are no steps. ID creationism and the simple creationism it is trying to replace are the epitome of ideological consensus based on mythology.\n \nProponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture,\nActually, they do. They just don't want it to leak out. But it's too late. The cat is out of the bag. Internal documents from the Discovery Institute as well as statements by ID creation proponents from the Dover trial make it quite clear that ID creationism is based on religion and scripture as much as \"creation science\" was.\n \nthey let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done.\nThen you should probably make an effort to learn what science is and how it works. Empirical evidence doesn't prove anything. Only scientific illiterates make such statements. True science has always used empirical evidence to form hypotheses, which are speculative explanations based on experience and guess work. The hypotheses are used to make predictions of observations that have not been made that must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. The predictions are said (in science) to have the power to falsify the hypotheses. Experiments are then designed and executed to test the prediction. When stringently tested, an hypothesis is called a theory in science. However, there always exists the possibility that some unknown piece of data (observation) might indicate that a theory is wrong. Science works to reconcile the discrepancy. ID creationism and creationism simply ignore any evidence that is contrary to religious dogma.\n \nVerify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...\nSo there's the typical creationist claim that, \"if you don't believe as I do, then you are trying to escape the punishment of my petty god.\" How bizzare that you claim that science has something to do with how one wants to live his life, while ID creationism and creationism are somehow based on evidence.\n \n So, why not present the evidence that ID creationism has any logical or empirical support. Show me the evidence.\n \nThere happens to be no scientist who is taken serious [sic] who discards the the global flood, why? [pray tell]\nActually, I've never known a scientist whose reputation was based on acceptance of some mythical global flood. I can't actually remember any scientists who actually expressed an opinion on the topic in a scientific context. I can't even imagine a scientist who would actually state that mythology is somehow true in every detail. The concept is ignorant beyond belief.\n \nBecause their [sic] is ample evidence to for the flood.\nThen why hasn't anyone ever presented any of this evidence? People like Henry Morris, Duane Gish, Carl Baugh, Don Patton, Kent Hovind, Ken Ham, and Don Batton try to dupe the ignorant for profit.\n \nSo even the secular world has to start there...\nThat's a hoot. The \"secular world\" (in other words, real science) starts from observations of the universe. Science does not start from a book of (obvious) mythology.\n \nThe same fossil tables here, are the same in Russia, Israel.... and are Sumatra.\nReally? Please cite the scientific papers that report fossils of Marella, Yohoia, Naraoia, Waptia, Canadaspis, Pikaia, Opabinia, Anomalocaris, Hallucigenia, and Odontogriphus being found in Russia, Israel or Sumatra.\n \nSecondly... the [just to throw this in] the [sic] pyramids of Giza, Egyptologists tried to suppress find the skeleton of a manatee in the upper chambers one of the larger pyramids, because they are Muslim... and what would that finding lend credibility to?\nSince Muslims believe in the flood of Noah, I have no idea why they would want to suppress this find. Perhaps you would explain. Perhaps you would also tell us in which of the \"larger pyramids\" this manatee skeleton was found, and why you think it is meaningful. Of course you will also provide reliable evidence that what you say is true. Please do not embarrass yourself by failing to support your assertions.\n \nMaking blanket denials is no way to engage a debate... try offering evidence to support your positions, I do for mine.\nI have not observed that you have in the past. Please correct my misconception by supporting your above assertion about the manatee and the \"same fossil table\" (whatever that means).",
