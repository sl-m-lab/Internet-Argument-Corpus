   "Oh, harken ye back to a year in the past millenium, 1948.\n \n Honestly, I had no idea that this was where it all started (Wikipedia):\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Italian_election\n \n \nItalian general election, 1948\n The Italian elections of 1948 were the first democratic elections with universal suffrage ever held in Italy. They were held on 1948-04-18.\n \n They were won by the conservative Christian Democracy, defeating the left-wing, pro-Soviet Popular Alliance (also known as the Democratic Popular Front or by its Italian acronym FDP).\n \n The elections are likely unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy's history, on both sides. The Christian Democrat propaganda became famous in claiming that in Communist countries \"children sent parents to jail\", \"children were owned by the state\", \"people ate their own children\", and claiming disaster would strike Italy if the left were to take power.\n \n The 1948 general election was heavily influenced by the United States as part of their ongoing effort to fight communism. In order to influence the election, the US agencies undertook a campaign of writing ten million letters, made numerous short-wave radio broadcasts of propaganda and funded the publishing of books and articles, all of which warned the Italians of what the US felt would be the consequences of a communist victory. The CIA also funded the centre-right political parties and was accused of publishing forged letters in order to discredit the leaders of the Italian Communist Party (PCI).\n \n Perhaps because of this campaign, the Christian Democrats won the 1948 election with 48 percent of the vote, while the FDP only received 31 percent. A leftist coalition would not win a general election for the next 48 years, till 1996. This was due to the Italians' traditional bend for conservatism, on one side, but even more importantly to the Cold War, with the US closely eyeing Italy, and often heavily meddling in its politics, not always by licit means (see: strategy of tension), after their desire to maintain a vital NATO presence amidst the Mediterranean.\nSo, Italy was the training ground for later covert actions in South and Central America.\n \n So interesting to learn of Italy's role in the history of the United States secret activities.",

   "My tipoff was this obit in today's NYTimes:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/us/06wyatt.html\n \n July 6, 2006\n F. Mark Wyatt, 86, C.I.A. Officer, Is Dead \n By TIM WEINER\n F. Mark Wyatt, a career Central Intelligence Agency officer who played a significant role in the agency's first major cold war covert action, an operation to swing the Italian elections of 1948, died on Thursday in Washington. He was 86.\n \n The cause was complications of a stroke, said his daughter, Susan Wyatt.\n \n Mr. Wyatt joined the C.I.A.'s clandestine service in 1948, months after the agency's birth, and plunged into its first successful covert effort. The mission was to ensure the electoral victory of Italy's Christian Democrats over the Communist Party. \n \n Mr. Wyatt helped deliver millions of dollars to the eventual victors; the precise cost of the covert campaign has never been declassified, though the details of the operation were. \n \n \"We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their political expenses, their campaign expenses, for posters, for pamphlets,\" Mr. Wyatt said in a 1995 interview recorded for \"Cold War,\" a 1998 documentary shown on CNN. Suitcases filled with cash had changed hands in the four-star Hotel Hassler in Rome, he said. The Christian Democrats won the elections by a comfortable margin and formed a government that excluded the Communists.\n \n The C.I.A.'s practice of buying political clout was repeated in every Italian election for the next 24 years, and the agency's political influence in Rome lasted a generation, declassified records show. \n \n Mr. Wyatt spent most of his next two decades with the C.I.A. in Italy, becoming deputy chief of the Rome station in 1964. He worked as a liaison aide with South Vietnam's spies at the Saigon station in 1968 and 1969; at the C.I.A.'s New York base, focusing on the United Nations, from 1970 to 1972; and as chief of station in Luxembourg from 1972 to 1975. After his retirement, he worked to help Soviet defectors start new lives in the United States.\n \n Felton Mark Wyatt was born in Woodland, Calif. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1942, and served in the Pacific on the destroyer Conner in World War II. He joined the C.I.A. after earning a degree in foreign affairs at George Washington University.\n \n In 1951, he married a fellow intelligence officer, Ann Appleton Wyatt.\n \n Besides his wife and daughter, of New York; surviving are two sons, Alan, of Carrboro, N.C., and Thomas, of Warwick, Mass.; and four grandchildren.",

   "Viva Padania!\n \n I believe that it is time to bring into action what northern provinces of Italy have been preparing themselves since the early 1990s - secession of Padania from federal state! We did not do it before but no in conditions of global financial crisis we got to do it finally! Yes, like all padanians I know I advocate secession! I hope financial crisis will speed up this process! Let us not put up any more money for the impoverished southern Italy, the agrarian provinces and the moors. It was enough of serving them up, now why don't they try to live on their own? We got our own problems to take care of! Now, get Padania broken away!",
