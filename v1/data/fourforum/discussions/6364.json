   "This EU membership for Turkey, isn't it an egregious mistake? I know that many EU countries oppose our membership. They have their certain terms for us to join. I should say they don't add to my optimism. Actually we're going rather loose than win if we are let into EU. Look. The vital issue of delivering more of autonomy to Kurds threatens to split our country in the long run. Kurds obsessed with the idea of creating independent state of their own will never stay idle. They are definitely to continue with their struggle. And they will enjoy both USA and EU support in the drive. Bush promised support as a reward for Kurds taking his side in the Iraqi campaign. EU will gladly get rid of the old headache. So those two heavy weights are the most interested parts relating Turkey EU membership. Paradoxically, Turkey itself is not! It goes too costly for us! EU membership is actually our whim, not vital necessity. We are not Europeans and we'll never be. Then what's the use of steering our boat into EU harbor?",

OF course not....unless they wish to stop being a borderline third world nation.\n\n \n \n The fact of the matter is that when Angela Merkel wins the german elections in sep 18.2005 and becomes the next chancellor , she will withdraw German support for Turkish membership in EU and offer instead a privileged partnership. So the brakes have been put on EU membership for Turkey..Granted there are a lot of misconceptions and lets fact it prejudices against Turkey in much of europe but , the question is --- Will Turkey be ready to transform itself to a liberal democracy with rights for homosexuals, women..Certain cultural factors will make it impossible for Turkey to comply with EU requirments such as rights for gays, religious minorities etc....so maybe Angela Merkel's plan is in hindsight a good idea...",
