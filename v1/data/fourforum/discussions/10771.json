Confirms what we already knew, but it's nice to see that correlation made.\n\n That's nothing. Check out this Pew study.\n \n Here's some commentary from a user from iidb.com:Now I'm breaking out origins beliefs themselves by educational level. There's simply no way to read this as anything but a strong correlation between creationism and ignorance.\n \n Some people think humans & other living things have existed in their present form [PF] since the beginning of time. Others think humans & other living things have evolved over time [EV]. Which comes closest to your view? [DK = don't know]\n \n PF / EV / DK - Category (sample size)\n 42 / 48 / 10 - total sample (2000)\n \n Education\n 27 / 66 / 07 - College grad (710)\n 42 / 51 / 07 - Some college (465)\n 50 / 38 / 12 - High school grad (661)\n 50 / 30 / 20 - < High school grad (158)\n\n \n \nPF / EV / DK - Category (percent)\n 42 / 48 / 10 - total sample (100)\n \n Biggest influence on view of how life developed\n 60 / 29 / 11 - religious beliefs (43)\n 14 / 80 / 06 - education (29)\n 43 / 44 / 13 - other (28)\n ___________\n \n Here, I've ranked on break size (and combined all \"other\" influences). Note that religious beliefs trump education in overall influence (43 vs. 29), but that education is a better predictor of an evolutionary viewpoint.\n",

This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.",
