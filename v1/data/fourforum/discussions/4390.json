   "this has slightly bugged me, since most evolutionists don't understand why men have nipples. its quite simple, but it requres a bit of thinking outside the box:\n \n men have nipples because the laws of nature called for economized genetic code. think for a minute: if you have a perfectly good non asexual creature, do you really want to let that creature die out when you start another creature from scratch? i wouldnt. it would make no sense- thats why the sexual organs of men and women are basically inverted copies of each other- testicles to ovaries, penis to vagina, etc. the ONLY exception- and possibly not an exception, if we ever learn more about it- is the clitoris. small variations are what produce more or less attractive variations: for example, if a male human has man-tits, he's less attractive and therefore less likely to breed. if somebody has huge elephant-like ears, they won't breed unless there is a socially acceptable reason for them to (look at prince charles). however, if the good things outweigh the bad- if the guy with man-tits is a marathon runner who can go two or three times as long as anyone else in the world- then maybe, just maybe, they will be genetically viable.",

Those who wish to invalidate evolutionary theory might pose the question, \"Was man descended from woman?\" The answer, of course, is no. Both men and women have nipples because in early stages of fetal development, an unborn child is effectively sexless. Nipples are present in both males and females; it is only in a later stage of fetal development that testosterone causes sex differentiation in a fetus. All mammals, male and female, have mammary glands. Male nipples are vestigial; they may perform a small role in sexual stimulation and a small number of men have been able to lactate. However, they are not fully functional and, because cancer can grow in male or female breast tissue, the tissue can be dangerous. \n \n \n http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/top10_vestigial_organs-2.html\n \n \n Um, about the discovery channel, Sorry, nothing\n \n Um, about popular science, nothing\n \n What exactly were you trying to cite?",

   "i draw these paralells [sic]: penis(the shaft)=vagina\n\n Boy do you creationists get all bent out of shape when you are shown to be wrong. And you certainly are upset. Why else would it be necessary to call me profane names? I guess I hit the nail on the head.\n \n It doesn't matter how parallel you think they are, the penis and vagina are not derived from homologous structures. As I mentioned, if you actually had any knowledge of female anatomy you would realize that if inverted into a penis like structure, the vagina would be in the wrong place. Besides, all the necessary parts are there, right where you would logically expect them to be, that is if you had actually ever looked.\n \n Or maybe you might check out female spotted hyenas. They produce lots of male hormones and thus become masculinized. They have an enlarged and elongated clitoris that is quite similar to the males penis - and they still have a vagina and a uterus that isn't turned \"inside out\".\n \ni've been called gullible and stupid for saying something you disagree with? no wonder everybody who doesn't agree with you hates you. you're a high and mighty *******.\n\n Please get your facts straight. I didn't call you stupid. You hung that on yourself, and you are in a far better position than I to know. And let me point out again that it isn't a matter of whether I agree with your errors or not. It is a matter of you being laughably wrong. So calm down and dry your tears. Your hysterical screaming really isn't very becoming.\n \n And why would people hate me? It isn't that I'm high and mighty, it's a matter of actually having learned something about the topic. Nor do I imagine that if I have a fantasy idea without even bothering to check if it made sense and then call others stupid because we aren't \"thinking out of the box.\" As I said, that's creationist code for not being willing to accept antiscientific drivel.\n \n Perhaps the next time you'll make an effort to check if your fantasy actually makes sense instead of implying that you are a great thinker while we are somehow limited in our thinking.",

   "i've been proven in one point and disproven in another\n\n No. Actually I told you that the genetilia of males and females develop from homologous structures. You said that male genetilia were just female genetilia turned inside out. Somehow your assertion was supposed to be \"thinking out of the box\" even though you equated some female structures to the wrong male structure. How is that thinking out of the box?\n \n You were wrong - laughably wrong. Development from homologous structures is not in any way similar to turning something \"inside out.\" The labia are not turned inside out to form the scrotum, since the labia aren't inverted in the first place. And the penis certainly isn't a vagina turned inside out - unless maybe your penis is below your scrotum.\n \nthis is getting out of hand. pandion, you're turning this into a dick measuring contest by not reading what i've posted entirely (made obvious by the fact that you're calling me a creationist when i have clearly stated i am not), and have yet to make a relevant point\n\n Right. You post some silly **** about how you are a great thinker and then procede to post incorrect information based on your fantacy. And yet it is my fault that it is getting out of hand when I correct your errors. It has nothing to do with anyone's dick since we are discussing easily verified facts. You are wrong and have been from the start.\n \n I suspect that you must be a creationist troll. Why else would you post creationist code? Because rational thinking inside the logical constraints of the scientific method, along with stringent testing is how science works. \"Thinking out of the box\" means to accept assertion without evidence. You are clearly a creationist.\n \n Besides, when you realize that you have made yourself look like a fool, your resort to insult and vulgarisms - quite typical of creationists.\n \n You can quote all you want in order to inform me that I was correct from the start, and that you were wrong. None of it is turned inside out, is it?\n \ndoes that satisfy you?\n\n Not really. It would have been better if you had appologized for your insult when I pointed out your errors. Now you have actually supported what I told you and still you continue with insult and try to make it seem as if I am trying to make some sort of vulgar contest out of it. How pathetic! Not only that, you claim that your quote supports your initial error. It doesn't. That isn't what you said. You were wrong from start to finish.\n \n Sadly it seems that you haven't actually observed the female genitelia, and yet you try to speak from authority and pretend that my observational knowledge is somehow a contest about your crotch. Grow up.\n \n By the way, a quick count of my book shelf comes up with 12 books by Gould. I don't have the last two of his natural science series, but I do have most of his other books and have read them. I also have books by other evolutionary biologists (Dawkins, Maynard-Smith, Mayr, Stringer, Tattersall, Walker, Shipman, Ridley, Berra, Futuyma, Zimmer, Schwartz, Paul, etc.) I've read them all.",
