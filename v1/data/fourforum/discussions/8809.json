   "Ok...this is really a continuation of my \"Evolutionists' Worst Nightmare Post.' It's merely an extension that PROVES the dishonesty of evolutionists. \n \n The following blows the barn doors wide open as to exactly how evolutionists operate. It proves that they make stuff up on the fly - and that their methods of dating humans are completely flawed and flexible at any moment -- just like their whole theory is. Read on...this is delicious.\n \n In this post, though, I'm going to build on top of what we've already learned. And what we've learned is that even though the fossil evidence shows that all modern day humans are descendants of Homo-erectus and Neandertals (both fully human), evolutionists have had to camoflauge this by dreaming up a new scenerio. This new scenario was not a result of new fossil evidence - or ANY fossil evidence - it was a result of a pre-rigged computer model. Of course, once again, evolutionists are just expecting Christians to trust the fact that they know more than us, and are able to outthink us. See, since we southern pig-farm-raised folks are too stupid to be able to come up with these computer models, we are obviously too stupid to understand them as well! It's the same with DNA, bacteria, viruses and dating methods....We hicks just don't understand. And obviously, us rural Christians are in the dark because our brains just aren't as \"fit\" or as \"well-wired\" as evolutionists' brains are - which is why they'd just assume we'd all be \"unselected\" so they can do all the thinking.\n \n But Let's reflect on the evolutionists' problem. \n \n Homo erectus fossils' dates are scattered all over the place. For example, in Asia, Homo erectus bones (Java man, Peking man) are dated at 400,000 years. European Homo erectus fossils are dated from 500,000 years. Rhodesian Man, on the otherhand - which evolved out of Africa - are dated at 40,000 years. Therefore, it is obvious that this scenario indicates that Africans (Blacks), due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians, are almost 400,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards. Thus, they got a late start!\n \n Ok so that's the problem - let's now look at the solution. As you can imagine, the solution is pretty predictable. They obviously cannot change the bones - thus, in true dishonest fashion, evolutonists geniuses merely make up new dates! In fact, Rhodesian man, in less than 85 years, ages from approximately 11,000 years old to up to 400,000 years old! - all in the name of political correctness. It's the epitome of what they stand for.\n \n But lets start back at the beginning. \n \n Rhodesian man was first discovered June 17, 1921 at the bottom of a cave used for mining lead and zinc. (By the way...Did they mine for these things 400,000 years ago?).\n \n The original 1921 report, written by Dr. Arthur Smith Woodward says this: \"The skull is in a remarkably fresh state of preservation, the bone having merely lost its animal matter and not having been in the least mineralized.\"....The occupation of the cave, therefore, seems to have been at no distant date - it may not even have been so remote as the Pleistocene period.\" -- this period ends 11,000 years ago.\n \n The article goes on to say: \"It is strangely similar to the Neanderthal race found in Belgium, France and Gibralter.\"....talking about the brain, it says \"the braincase is much more ordinarily human than that of the La Chappel Neanderthal skull.\"\n \n http://www.amendez.com/Early%20Man%20Seminar%20Poster/EMSP%20Rhodesian%20Man-text.pdf#search='Rhodesian%20Man%20Nov%2017%2C%201 921'\n \n \n There are 4 basic conclusions that lead the author to believe this person was not particularly old:\n \n 1) lack of fossilization - despite being in a heavily mineralized environment\n \n 2) bone tools, which are considered to be a cultural phenomenon for modern humans and Neandertals were found.\n \n 3) The chemical analysis gave the same age as other \"more modern\" humans in the same area. \n \n 4) Since these individuals were mining, this suggests, as Genesis 4:21 suggests, that this was an unmistakably adavanced culture.\n \n Yet, in 1962, Carleton Coon, based on dating techniques, changed the fossil date to 40,000 years old. This evidently remained the same up until 1973 when Richard G. Klein moved the date up to 125,000 years based on the analysis of some tools in the area. Then for no apparent reason, Ian Tattersal in 1999 just pulled out the new date of 300,000 - 400,000 years out of thin air! This, was obviously done for no other reason to give Rhodesian man adequate time to leave africa and move out into the rest of the world - and most importantly -- \"enough time to evolve\" into a homo spapien!!!! This is nothing but an intellectual cover-up to black people - of whom evolutionists evidently think are not smart enough to figure out. Of course, look at the evolutionists' artist's sicko rendition of Africa's homo erectus - this will tell you everything you about how they view the ancestors of black people.\n \n http://images.fok.nl/upload/homoerectus.jpg\n \n http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/images/homoerectus.JPG\n \n It's laughingly disgusting....and many an evolutonist authors have proclaimed that Rhodesian homo erectus could not even talk.\n \n But anyway, the delimma has now been solved....and it's nothing but an evolutionist cover-up of the real facts. Thus, Rhodesian man aged over 350,000 years in less than a century!!!!\n \n And so what is the conclusion? Once again - we are left with the concept that evolutionists simply cannot help themselves. They cannot stop themselves from grouping and classifying humans. And they just cannot stop themselves from making assumptions based on physiological features. They assume, because of Rhodesian man's skull, that he is nothing but a \"savage.\" This goes for much of the homo erectus \"group.\" This practice defines who evolutionists are. They're no different than the cheap, plastic label-maker my wife uses to tag things around the house.\n \n And interestingly, Rhodesian man has long been considered (by evolutionists) to be one of the most \"savage\" of human fossils by evolutionists. This is based on nothing but skull morphology. Yet Woodward notes in his article that there were also tibia and femur bones found at the site - both of which were very modern in shape and did not differ from present-day humans. Thus anyone who's not a racist would conclude that skull morphology has nothing what-so-ever to do with how \"primitive\" or \"savage\" a person is. This is only dreamed up in the minds of racists. As a Christian, I do not believe it is right to attribute the contour of one's skull to measure how intelligent or he is. I'd rather not have my grave dug up in 5,000 years only to have a bunch of atheist evolutionists label me as a \"wild beast\"....which is exactly what they are doing right now with our ancestors. It's nausiating to watch these intellectuals stick their noses high in the air and proclaim superiority. \n \n In the article, Woodward even compares Rhodesian man directly to the fossils of Java Man - which would indicate that Java man and Rhodesian man might be of similar recent age. \n \n And as far as the tools go, the artifacts found with Rhodesian man include Middle Stone Age quartz, bola stones, chert stone tools, and bone tools. The bone tools are interesting because it is claimed that they were not used by Neandertals in the Middle Stone Age, but in the Upper Stone Age - which is associated with Cro-Magnon peoples.\n \n And if you tie all this together, you can easily deduce that Rhodesian man, Java Man, and Neandertals were all similar in structure - at least in terms of being fully human - and this would imply that they all had a fairly recent common ancestral source. (Of course I believe that source was possibly in Turkey where Noah's Ark touched down). And this goes without saying, that having a different phyiscal appearance has absolutely nothing to do with how cultrually adapted these people were. It also has nothing to do with the date or time that these individuals were alive. It also has nothing to do with not being able to talk, walk, pray or raise a family. It also has nothing to do with being \"genetically inferior.\" It also has nothing to do with evolutionsts deluding themselves that they are BETTER than these people. \n \n evolutionary racism quote from Gould\n \n That point of origin (evolving directly from Homo erectus) was so long ago, that human races have been so separate for so long that substantial genetic difference translating to inequalities have evolved. Steven Gould\n \n In reality....skull morphology is all about location, climate, and environment in which they lived. Facial structures are shaped and formed by their environment - as is the whole body. We see this pattern all over the dad-gum WORLD -- not only in the human population but the animal population as well. Life is not an accident....everything is directed - everything has a cause. There's a cause for every effect. \n \n In the case of racism, the theory of evolution is not the cause - SIN is the cause. But the thoery of evolution happens to be a warehouse for sin. And when sin is in control then predjuice, hate and intellectual superiority take over...which can cause a dark and sinister philosophy to emerge from within the shadows - which is what Toe is.\n \n So what's worse, evolutionits??? My posts or your latest digital prostate exam?\n \n I love you all -- take care. S",

It's merely an extension that PROVES the dishonesty of evolutionists.\n\n \n Well, given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist's mind, I suppose you're right. Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong. It's fundementally weak, but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound. \n \n \nThe following blows the barn doors wide open as to exactly how evolutionists operate.

Rhodesian Man, on the otherhand - which evolved out of Africa - are dated at 40,000 years.\n\n \n If you were not lying you'd have a argument. Rhodesian Man is dated between 200,000 and 125,000 years. Your other dates are off as well. \n \n \nTherefore, it is obvious that this scenario indicates that Africans (Blacks), due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians, are almost 400,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards. Thus, they got a late start!\n\n \n Not really. It just means that Homo erectus was around in Africa 200,000 and 125,000 years ago. So some of them stayed around in Africa.

   "Just in case anyone (obvious child) thinks I'm out of my mind that this whole looney theory is based on obsessive-compulsive political correctness disorder by the likes of the liberal-left:\n \n http://www.grahamkendall.net/Unsorte...n_Ancestry.txt\n \n After World War II, in the aftermath of Nazi horror, anthropologists\n hastened to throw out all these ideas about racial hierarchy. The\n collapse of the European empires in Africa and Asia also helped cure\n white scientists of the old habit of thinking of themselves as\n members of the master race. By 1960, no reputable anthropologists\n were still talking about racial differences in evolutionary status.\n \n The old hierarchical interpretation of the fossil record--and the\n prehistoric genocides implicit in it--got thrown out as well\n \n The upshot of the controversy\n over Coon?s book was that some anthropologists began to view the\n whole regional-continuity model of human origins as a theory tainted\n by racism.\n \n For this reason, some fossil experts hail every piece of evidence for\n the out-of-Africa theory as further proof of modern human equality.\n (If we?re all descended from an African ?Eve? who lived just 100,000\n years ago, we can?t be very different from one another, can we?)\n Others see the regional-continuity model, with its ages-long pattern\n of gene flow back and forth among all human populations, as a bulwark\n against racial typology. And some of us, who were trained back in the\n sixties and got all those old tree diagrams of racial divergence\n stuck in our heads, still have a vague feeling that real egalitarians\n shouldn?t discriminate against Neanderthals. (If Neanderthals are\n fully human, the differences between modern races are too trivial to\n bother about, aren?t they?).....\n \n .....During the 1950s and 1960s it came to be regarded as vaguely racist to\n exclude any fossil humans from our own ancestry. All the taxonomic\n doors flew open. Australopithecus joined the human family,\n Pithecanthropus was welcomed into the genus Homo, and the\n Neanderthals were recognized as just an extreme racial variant of\n modern Homo sapiens.\n \n Can someone tell me what RACE has to do with SCIENCE??????????\n \n This theory is a piece of Grade-A GARBAGE.",
