   "YAWN!\n \n Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan's refusal to fire State Trooper Mike Wooten from the state police force was \"likely a contributing factor\" to Monegan's July dismissal, but Palin had the authority as governor to fire him, the report by former Anchorage prosecutor Stephen Branchflower states.\n \n The state senator managing the probe, Sen. Hollis French, fueled those complaints with a September 2 interview in which he warned the inquiry could yield an \"October Surprise\" for the GOP. But Palin's lawyers already had begun pushing for the state Personnel Board to launch its own investigation, calling it the proper legal venue for the matter.\n \n From msnbc: \n \n Lawmakers don't have the authority to sanction her for such a violation, and they gave no indication they would take any action against her.\n \n Under Alaska law, it is up to the state's Personnel Board - which is conducting its own investigation into the matter - to decide whether Palin violated state law and, if so, must refer it to the Senate president for disciplinary action. Violations also carry a possible fine of up to $5,000.\n \n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27105917/#storyContinued\n \n She isn't guilty of nothing, this is just a panel recommendation, but there is NOT enough evidence to charge her. Hence the lack of possible action as the panel indicated...and as one of the panel members put it, take it with a grain of salt.",

   "OK, even if what you say is true, the man should not be stalking America claiming to be a big war hero.\n\n \n``I was no hero. Nor have I ever considered myself such,'' McCain said in an interview with The Chronicle. ``I was privileged to serve in the company of heroes. I observed 1,000 acts of courage and compassion and love that enriched my life. -John McCain\n\n \n \nBut McCain's fellow POWs, including those who served with him in the notorious Hanoi Hilton compound, reject McCain's tough self- assessment of his actions during POW years -- especially the idea that he somehow ``failed'' his country, or them. \n \n ``We're some of the toughest SOBs who ever walked the valley,'' said Orson Swindle, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who spent 6 1/2 years in POW captivity and ``slept side-by-side for two years'' in a cramped cell with McCain. ``We have endured. We're tough, not because we're supermen, but because we recognize our limitations, and our strengths. \n \n ``I don't know of a single person who . . . was tortured, who did not break under the torture,'' said Swindle, now a federal trade commissioner. ``It was one of the lessons we learned: The mark of real men is not that you can avoid being beaten down. The mark is to get up off the floor and fight again.'' \n \n Swindle said he also confessed under torture. ``I found out I wasn't John Wayne. And it hurts, to this day.'' \n\n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/08/16/MN18848.DTL\n \n \nHe broke; others didn't. End of story.\n\n \nOther American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract \"confessions\" and propaganda statements.[134][135] Many, especially among those who had been captured earlier and imprisoned longer, endured even worse treatment than McCain.[136] Under extreme duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their captors.\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_and_military_career_of_John_McCain#Solitary\n \n \nDon't you find it a bit strange that the man who was treated in this manner has not expressed himself over and over again in his campaign against what we are doing to our detainees?\n\n He has, where have you been? In fact, he was a major champion of legislation banning torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners. He actually gave a very moving speech on the floor of the senate regarding this subject. I just recently saw a clip of it, so it's out there if you look for it. \n \n \nCome to think of it, why aren't YOU doing that?\n\n Who said I support torture or otherwise inhumane treatment of prisoners. You're trying to change the subject.\n \n \nOr is this behavior acceptable when we do it to others?\n\n No, it is not. \n \n You should be ashamed of yourself.

His father - himself deep in the throes of a daddy complex - had secured a political post as the Navy's chief liaison to the Senate, a job his son would later hold, and the McCain home on Southeast 1st Street was a high-powered pit stop in the Washington cocktail circuit. Growing up, McCain attended Episcopal High School, an all-white, all-boys boarding school across the Potomac in Virginia, where tuition today tops $40,000 a year. There, McCain behaved with all the petulance his privilege allowed, earning the nicknames \"Punk\" and \"McNasty.\" Even his friends seemed to dislike him, with one recalling him as \"a mean little ####er.\"\n \n McCain was not only a lousy student, he had his father's taste for drink and a darkly misogynistic streak. The summer after his sophomore year, cruising with a friend near Arlington, McCain tried to pick up a pair of young women. When they laughed at him, he cursed them so vilely that he was hauled into court on a profanity charge.\n \n McCain's admittance to Annapolis was preordained by his bloodline. But martial discipline did not seem to have much of an impact on his character. By his own account, McCain was a lazy, incurious student; he squeaked by only by prevailing upon his buddies to help him cram for exams. He continued to get sauced and treat girls badly. Before meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time, McCain got so shitfaced that he literally crashed through the screen door when he showed up in his white midshipman's uniform.\n \n\n http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/make_believe_maverick_the_real_john_mccain/page/2\n \n As far as I am concerned, McCain is a disgrace to the military. And, he is no friend to America's military and our vets:\n \nSeptember 2007: McCain voted against the Webb amendment calling for adequate troop rest between deployments. At the time, nearly 65% of people polled in a CNN poll indicted that \"things are going either moderately badly or very badly in Iraq.\n \n July 2007: McCain voted against a plan to drawdown troop levels in Iraq. At the time, an ABC poll found that 63% thought the invasion was not worth it, and a CBS News poll found that 72% of respondents wanted troops out within 2 years.\n \n March 2007: McCain was too busy to vote on a bill that would require the start of a drawdown in troop levels within 120 days with a goal of withdrawing nearly all combat troops within one year. Around this time, an NBC News poll found that 55% of respondents indicated that the US goal of achieving victory in Iraq is not possible. This number has not moved significantly since then.\n \n February 2007: For such a strong supporter of the escalation, McCain didn't even bother to show up and vote against a resolution condemning it. However, at the time a CNN poll found that only 16% of respondents wanted to send more troops to Iraq (that number has since declined to around 10%), while 60% said that some or all should be withdrawn. This number has since gone up to around 70%.\n \n June 2006: McCain voted against a resolution that Bush start withdrawing troops but with no timeline to do so.\n \n May 2006: McCain voted against an amendment that would provide $20 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for health care facilities.\n \n April 2006: McCain was one of only 13 Senators to vote against $430,000,000 for the Department of Veteran Affairs for Medical Services for outpatient care and treatment for veterans.\n \n March 2006: McCain voted against increasing Veterans medical services funding by $1.5 billion in FY 2007 to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.\n \n March 2004: McCain once again voted for abusive tax loopholes over veterans when he voted against creating a reserve fund to allow for an increase in Veterans' medical care by $1.8 billion by eliminating abusive tax loopholes. Jeez, McCain really loves those tax loopholes for corporations, since he voted for them over our veterans' needs.\n \n October 2003: McCain voted to table an amendment by Senator Dodd that called for an additional $322,000,000 for safety equipment for United States forces in Iraq and to reduce the amount provided for reconstruction in Iraq by $322,000,000.\n \n April 2003: McCain urged other Senate members to table a vote (which never passed) to provide more than $1 billion for National Guard and Reserve equipment in Iraq related to a shortage of helmets, tents, bullet-proof inserts, and tactical vests.\n \n August 2001: McCain voted against increasing the amount available for medical care for veterans by $650,000,000. To his credit, he also voted against the 2001 Bush tax cuts, which he now supports making permanent, despite the dire financial condition this country is in, and despite the fact that he indicated in 2001 that these tax cuts unfairly benefited the very wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\n \n http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/articleid/9559",

   "Again I am amused by the inability of liberal children to stay on topic. Some of you should be banned.\n \n The committee voted to release the report. They did not vote unanomously to condemn Palin. The report writer (singular) was paid to write the report. The report writer is a supporter of Barack Obama. The press is gleeful regarding the writer's conclusion presented in the report.\n \n To conclude that Palin is guilty of anything based solely on the published opinion of one of her known political enemies is evidence of gullibility, stupidity or both.",

   "Well if you are going to rag on Palin for doing something wrong, then you need to extend it to all politicians, and the person you see in the mirror everyday. There is not a politician in office who has not at one time or another, voted on or done something that was self beneficial. And the same can be said about all of us, we have all done something wrong at some time in our lives. The reason I will vote for McCain is because I distrust Obama more than I distrust McCain. I have personally seen Obama disrespect both our flag and anthem, and I have seen Obamas past record, and it highly differes from what he says in this election. So, did he somehow change his mind all the sudden, or is he flat out lieing to everyone just to get elected. And if he(Obama) is elected, and his presidency was won on lies, just what kinds of changes are we really going to see. I just cant take the chance on Obama, he scares me too much.",
