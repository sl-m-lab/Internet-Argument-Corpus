Putting a guest worker program into place that recognizes the labor demand without \n turning immigrants into slaves allowing fat, lazy Americans to become fatter and lazier is a solution.

EVERYBODY in America whether they are legal aliens, illegal aliens, or citizens, have the same rights. Everybody on US soil has those rights regardless of sex, religion or country of origin. It does not matter. Anybody who took any kind of US government or US history class should be well aware of this. In fact, the Supreme court has ruled in recent years that the person does not even have to be on US soil.

   "There is, in fact, a very interesting program that has been in place in Texas for many years designed to get income from the illegal aliens. Many people have argued that the act is regressive and hard on lower income Americans, but it certainly gets money from illegals.\n \n Sales tax\n \n An illegal immigrant living in the US buys in the US, so any money they spend goes through sales tax. At least in Texas. I certainly am not advocating a federal sales tax, as sales tax is regressive and hits lower economic classes harder than others.\n \n The immigration issue is one of the biggest issues we face today. Immigrants are coming in to take the jobs Americans don't want to do and the jobs we do want to do are being outsourced to India. \n \n The only major arguement I've heard against illegal immigrants is that they are a burden on the government. While it is true that we lose a great deal of money to illegal immigrants recieving health care and other government programs, no truly effective solution has been put forward. To treat the migration as a crime is strategicly silly. If we can't stop drugs from going across the border, how do we stop a million Mexicans with a better life on the line? The worker program is interesting but not very novel. The same concept has been used throughout Europe, the result being clusters of isolated immigrants who have never truly assimilated. A similar system is occuring here.\n \n I know a girl who is a fifth generation Texan, but she still has a heavy hispanic accent. She lives in The Valley where the hispanic population is roughly 85%. We like to think that we should preserve native cultures, but America is a melting pot, meaning the cultures blend together with all aspects being represented.
