   "A roadmap or any other attempt [democratic elections] at achieving an agreement establishing two independent states [the continuation of the State of Israel and a separate Palestinian state], existing together in peace, is bound to fail. Why? Consider the hate factor.\n \n If the State of Israel were to suddenly disappear, Palestinians and the rest of the Muslim world would still hate the Jews. But the \"Zionists\" would no longer be a persistent pain in the middle of a Muslim neighborhood. And they could live with that. \n \n The enmity between the Jews and Muslims began after Muhammad, the founder of Islam, fled from his home in Mecca in 622 and settled in the relative safety of Medina in the northern part of Saudi Arabia. While there, his efforts to convert the local Jews to the new religion were rejected and the \"Prophet\" was subjected to ridicule. \n \n In Chapter 5 of the Quran God declares: \"O You who believe, do not take as allies those who received the Books [Jews] before you, but who now treat your religion as a joke and a game.\"\n \n Muhammad responded to the indignities by having his critics, including a nursing mother, assassinated and by undertaking a jihad against Jewish villages [no free speech here]. In april of 627, after the surrender of the Beni Quraidha near Medina, the Prophet had all of the men and boys of fighting age [about 900] beheaded. The women and children were taken as slaves and their property divided among the members of the Muslim army. His campaign wiped out most of the Jews in the area. \n \n Three years before his death, Muhammad survived an attempt to poison him by a Jewish woman named Zainab. Some Muslims blame his death in 632 on the effects of the poison and thus consider Muhammad a martyr for having been killed by a Jew.\n \n As a result, the Quran does not deal kindly with the Jews. Every Muslim knows the history of bad blood that existed between Muhammad and his detractors.\n \n There is no compromise in Islam. Muslims consider the words in the Quran, the Muslim bible, to be the words of God. There can be no criticism, no reformation. This \"perfect\" book is filled with examples of the fate that awaits unbelievers, especially the Jews.\n \n Sura 48, verse 29 reads: \"Muhammad is God's Apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers but merciful to one another.\" The Muslim resentment is deeply embedded and Muslims are very vocal when Jews become the topic of conversation. Over the past 20 years my talks with Muslims from \"Palestine\", Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon, and Kuwait have elicited only negative comments.\n \n Response to my questions can be summed up as a desire to see the State of Israel eliminated, or as a Pakistani professor put it: \"Why don't we make it [the reality of Israel] a myth?'\n \n Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Muslim perspective in 1937, said: \"Our hatred of the Jews dates from God's condemnation of them for their persecution and rejection of Isa [Jesus Christ] and their subsequent rejection later of his Chosen Prophet [Mohammad].\"\n \n He added: \"...God teaches us--and we implicitly believe this...that for a Muslim to kill a Jew, or for him to be killed by a Jew, ensures him an immediate entry in Heaven and into the august presence of God Almighty.\"\n \n Whenever I interviewed Muslims, I would ask them to show me Palestine on a map. Each one would move his hand from north to south over Israel. A Palestinian added that they should have taken the land for peace deal. \"It would be a start,\" he said.\n \n Given that hatred of Jews is a fundamental part of Islam, any hope for a lasting peace between the two parties would require a drastic change in the religion. That will not happen.\n \n There is a very slim chance that Palestinian moderates [those who don't break things or kill people] will see that, in the short term, an agreement is the best route to follow. They will at least have a state. And that would be, as the Palestinian said in my interview, \"a start.\"\n \n Will a peace agreement bring peace? Not in the mind of a Muslim. Whether in Riyadh or Detroit, this is a conflict destined to continue until the Jewish State ceases to exist. The Muslim true believers, the beheaders and the suicide bombers, will continue to do whatever they can to make this a reality - God willing.",

   "As I stated, the post contains verifiable facts and is a straight forward account of the Muslim hatred of Jews. Muslims base their hatred of the Jews on the Quran and the Hadiths, the words and deeds of Muhammad. \n \n I gave you a Sura on the Jewish rejection of Muhammad [Sura 5:60]. Another Sura 5:85 - \"Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers wilt thou find The Jews and Pagans.\" \n \n There are a number of Suras that describe the fate of those unbelievers, such as Sura 5:89 - \"But those who reject faith and belie Our Signs, -They shall be companions of Hell-fire.\"\n \n Muslim men are told to emulate the deeds of Muhammad, that \"most perfect human being.\" There was, of course, Muhammad's order to assassinate vocal critics of him and his religion, including an old man and a nursing mother. Does that ring a bell? How about the murder of a Dutch man for making an unflattering film about Islam? Remember the fatwa against the man who wrote The Satanic verses? \n \n Muhammad also had his jihad against the Jews of the Medina area, nearly wiping out the Jewish population. As I mentioned, Muhammad really liked beheading people. Does that remind you of similar behavior, say, in a number of Muslim countries?\n \n Muhammad treated women as property. Sura 2:223 states: \"Women are your fields; go then into your fields whence you please.\"\n \n Muhammad is reported as saying in one hadith that \"...the majority of people in Hell are women.\" He also set the standard for marriage when he consumated his marriage with Aisha, at the age of nine. \n \n The list goes on. This is the kind of government, based on the sharia [Muslim law], that the Shia want to impose on Iraqis when the Americans pull out. \n \n This is also the kind of government Europeans will get once the population of Muslims reaches the necessary level. The demographic trend is for the indigenous population to continue to decline while the opposite is true for Muslims. The problem is not with the immigrants, but with Islam. There is no compromise in Islam, no reformation. The clerics and the true believers will do what is needed to make this a reality. \n \n The problem with some non-Muslims is that they make value judgements about other cultures and religions based on their own cultural baggage. As a result they get it wrong.\n \n Islam is not a peaceful religion nor is it compatible with democracy or any other religion.",

If so, then surely we can also interpret the Bible literally, which would mean Christianity/Judaism is just as bad as Islam (Eating pork a sin?!)\n \n \nThe list goes on. This is the kind of government, based on the sharia [Muslim law], that the Shia want to impose on Iraqis when the Americans pull out.\n\n If Iraq gets a Shia government, it's because Iraqis want and voted for a Shia government (thanks to US I might add). Amazing what Democracy can do for a country.\n \n \nThis is also the kind of government Europeans will get once the population of Muslims reaches the necessary level.

If God says to kill all the Jews and Christians wherever you find them, you do it. \n \n No quarter is given by the Muslim clerics and the true believers. To defeat them, you must understand that there are no rules.

Those [who say this] are witless. Islam says: Kill all the unbelievers just as they would kill you all?' (Islam Unveiled, Spencer)\n \n Another example from an Al-Qaeda training manual affirms this. The jihadists know that \"...an Islamic government would never be established except by the bomb and the rifle. Islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief, but rather confronts it.\"\n \n The young Muslim soldiers are \"...to prepare themselves for jihad [holy war], commanded by the Majestic Allah's order in the holy koran.\" They will \"...strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah...\"\n \n The manual restates that \"...Islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and cooperative councils.\" (UIC/BM-8 translation)\n \n Nearly a hundred years ago an Iranian cleric, who fought against the secularization of Iran, made this point just before he was hanged. He said: \"Either this system must go or Islam will perish.\"\n \n Once again, Islam is not a peaceful religion nor is it compatible with democracy.",
