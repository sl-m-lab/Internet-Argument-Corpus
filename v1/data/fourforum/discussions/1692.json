   "Palestine is mentioned in the bible. It is also mentioned in several crusade era texts. It is marked on a map I have that shows Afric, the middle east and part of Asia that was draw circa 1700.\n \n I think part of the problem people have when considering things like this is that they look at it from a European viewpoint. In Europe, borders have been well defined and defended for a long time. In the middle east, they weren't quite so anal about such things.\n \n I once read an interesting book written by a British officer that was stationed in the region during WWII. Of course, he just refered to the whole area as Arabia. He noted that often when speaking to inhabitants of rural villages, they had no idea what \"country\" they were in, and they often trned out to be wrong when they did believe they knew. \n \n Pre-western influence, the borders in Arabia were ill defined, unless there happened to be a river handy, and tended to change frequently, depending on who you asked. A kingdom would consist of a capitol and a number of towns, with very little concern being given to rural areas (who cares who controls the desert?). Often these \"kindoms\" would overlap.\n \n Going by the logic that palestine did not exist until it was created after WWII, how can you possibly say israel has any territorial soverigenty? It was created at the same time.\n \n I think it is difficult for Americans to understand the Arab viewpoint on these issues. That is because there was an Arab culture, with libraries and public services, and even lighted streets, back when Britons were still putting orange mud in theri hair and filing their teeth. \n \n I think it was a mistake to grant the jews a homeland following WWII, or at least to grant them Israel as a homeland. I have trouble understanding how the international community could have possible thought this would be anything but a fiasco right from the start. \n \n I realise that the zionists feel that they have a perfect right to Israel due to their historical ties to the area. The jews were exiled from Israel around 2000 years ago, after destruction of the holy Temple. I personally fail to see how this gives them some kind of claim to a homeland in the 1940's. Israel was a gift from the UN to the zionists. They should be happy with their gift and leave the rest of the region alone. \n \n Personally, I think if they withdrew from the occupied territories, theri Arab neiborghs would leave them alone. I could be wrong. I think we should try it my way, then we can see. First, lets withdraw, then, lets try NOT building apartheid walls, then, lets try NOT practicing discrimination against non-jewish citizens. As a final step, we could try NOT using our military against civilians. \n \n Even if it doesn't work and the neiborghing states hate and resent israel, they will not attack them. If israel would stop doing the things on the above list that follow the word NOT, maybe complaints to the international community would actually be taken seriously. As things stand now, I don't think that most of the world could really give a rats back end about the harships the Palestenians are inflicting on israel. I know that as things stand now, I am rooting for the Palestenians. If the situation can be resolved peacefully, I hope that it is done. If it cannot, I hope the Palestenians win not only control of their homeland back, but take control of israel as well. Until then, they are at war, and it is the duty of ever citizen of a conqured nation (IMHO) to strike at the occupying force using every means available.\n \n I am sure that the polish citizens who resisted the nazis, and the memebrs of the french resistance, and all the other little pockets of resistance all over europe during WWII were viewed by the Nazis as terrorists.",

   "Congratulations on articulating your views in a manner that shows some knowledge and understanding of the conflict.\n \n \nIsrael did not \"own\" Palestine until they illegally invaded it.\nActually, Israeli sovereignty doesn't derive from an 'illegal invasion' but rather from the world community's decision to partition the remainder of the Palestine Mandate into two states: one Jewish, one Arab. The UN vote may not be to your liking, but that doesn't make it illegal.\n \n Israeli sovereignty in western Palestine is every bit as 'legal' as Jordanian sovereignty in eastern Palestine. However, if you consider Israel's occupation of (roughly) 20% of the Palestine Mandate to be illegal, then for the sake of consistency I must assume you likewise consider Jordan's occupation of (roughly) 80% of the Palestine Mandate to be illegal as well. If you do not agree that this assumption is consistent, then please provide your legal basis for recognizing the Hashemite kingdom's sovereignty in Palestine while denying it to the Jewish state.\n \n Regardless of your personal 'legal' opinion, it is an undisputable fact that the UN recognizes both Israeli and Jordanian sovereignty in their respective parts of Palestine. It is also a fact that the balance of the territory that comprised the Palestine Mandate has no recognized sovereign. There is of course an expectation that in the not-too-distant future the Arabs may be granted a second sovereign state in Palestine alongside Jordan and Israel, but that day is yet to arrive.\n \n \n \nWhetehr you want to call it \"Arab\" territory or not, it was Palestine, and was a seperate state from Israel... only now it is illegally conqured seperate state.\nIn a moment I will address your insistence that Palestine is (or ever was) a separate state, but first I want to briefly comment on your opinion that Israel's military presence outside it's sovereign borders is 'illegal.' International law, including Article 51 of the UN Charter, recognizes that a sovereign state may exercise the \"right of self-defence\" in response to an armed attack. Thus, the charge that Israel acted illegally is apparently a matter of dispute in international law. If you wish to build a 'legal' case against Israel, then please point to specific laws so that we have something definite and concrete to consider in addition to your opinion.\n \n Turning now to the first part of your statement -- that Palestine is (or was) a separate state -- it appears you have outreached your grasp. Neither the UN nor the U.S. has ever recognized \"Palestine\" as a state. Nor has the EU, Russia, China, or anyone else for that matter, so what is your basis for making such assertion.\n \n I assume of course you are not playing some sort of word jugglery game with the meaning of the word 'state.' In international law and international relations, a state is a political entity possessing sovereignty, i.e. not being subject to any higher political authority. With that in mind, please show where, in your view, that Palestine has ever been a 'separate state.'",

   "Palestine is mentioned in the bible.\nIf what you claim is true, then you should have no problem citing chapter and verse where you find the name Palestine in the Bible. I await your evidence.\n \n Meanwhile, let it be noted that the subject of the Bible is not something I introduced to this thread, or any thread for that matter. My case for Israel's legitimate right to exist as an independent sovereign state at peace with its neighbors has never been dependent on the Bible. Any biblical references I do make are simply in reply to others like yourself who call upon the Bible to make your points.\n \n \n \nPalestine is also mentioned in several crusade era texts. It is marked on a map I have that shows Afric, the middle east and part of Asia that was draw circa 1700.\n You neglect to explain the relevance of any of this. No one is disputing that the name Syria Palaestina was introduced used by the Romans in response to the Bar Kochba Rebellion 1,870 years ago. Why even bother making the point that 1,000 years later the Crusaders understood that Palestine referred to the Holy Land.\n \n What is glaringly omitted in your historical references is any evidence that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine ever called themselves Palestinians before Jews resettled the land. Can you find any reference from the Ottoman or British Mandate period where the term \"Palestinians\" is used as a noun to refer to the Arabs of Palestine? Well if you can't, then don't be surprised that the view of 'Palestinians' as a separate Arab identity is a relatively recent development that arose only in conjunction with Jewish nationalism and the founding of Israel.\n \n \n \nI think part of the problem people have is that they look at it from a European viewpoint. In Europe, borders have been well defined and defended for a long time. In the middle east, they weren't quite so anal about such things.\nYou make a valid point regarding borders, despite exaggerating the circumstances. Europe's borders have undergone dramatic changes in the past century. Also, the ill-defined borders in traditional Arab lands did not spare them from frequent territorial disputes among themselves.\n Regarding the contrasting world views of Arabs and Westerners, there was also the idea of privately-owned real estate to consider in addition to the concept of national sovereignty.\n \n \n \nGoing by the logic that palestine did not exist until it was created after WWII,... \nWhose logic is that? I look back in the thread and find no one making the argument that Palestine did not exist. Palestine is one of many names that is used to refer to the territory at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean. The land didn't just appear at the end of WW2.\n \n \n..., how can you possibly say israel has any territorial soverigenty? It was created at the same time.\nNot really. Israel's sovereignty is based on the acceptance of the Partition Plan. On the day the British Mandate ended, the Palestinian Jews declared their independence and founded the State of Israel, which was immediately recognized by the U.S., Soviet Union and other countries.\n In contrast, the Palestinian Arabs refused to declare an independent Arab state alongside the Jewish state. Thus, you are incorrect to argue that they did. Rather, in defiance of the UN Partition Plan, and in the first major breach of the UN Charter, five neighboring Arab states invaded Israel on the day it was founded. The Arab intent was to first annihilate the Jewish state and then declare an independent sovereign state over all the land west of the Jordan River.\n \n Read the Declaration of Israel's Independence here. Now show me the Arab declaration of independence at the same time. You did say \"at the same time.\" I await your evidence that the Palestinian Arabs declared their independence in accord with the UN plan.\n \n On the contrary, I think you will rather find that when the armistice lines were drawn, the West Bank territory was held by Jordan and the Gaza Strip was held by Egypt, and that neither of those two Arab states was willing to let the Palestinian Arabs declare independence. For 20 years from 1948-1967 when Israel posed no barrier to the creation of an independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza, the Arab states of Jordan and Egypt refused to allow the Arab refugees to leave their miserable refugee camps and live as a sovereign and independent people. Is that any way for the Arabs to treat their own brethren?\n \n \n \nI think it is difficult for Americans to understand the Arab viewpoint on these issues. That is because there was an Arab culture, with libraries and public services, and even lighted streets, back when Britons were still putting orange mud in theri hair and filing their teeth.\nWhat are you saying here... that the Arab view today is rooted in the fact that 1,000 years ago the sophisticated Arab culture was considerably more advanced than that of Europe, and that now with the centuries of subsequent decline in Arab science and culture, that the Arabs are somehow justified in their belligerence? Just asking for clarification, since I'm unclear what connection you're making between the Arab illustrious past and the contemporary circumstances of Arab states.\n \n Have you ever considered that it may not be entirely Israel's fault that not one of the 22 members in the Arab League is a democracy?\n \n \n \nThe jews were exiled from Israel around 2000 years ago, after destruction of the holy Temple. I personally fail to see how this gives them some kind of claim to a homeland in the 1940's.\nThe historical connection to the land simply explains why Jews have always been attracted to Palestine. It's not the sole (nor even the most important) basis for their claim to a share of Palestine.\n \n Furthermore, despite the expulsions and Diaspora, Jews continued to live in Palestine regardless of Roman, Christian, or Muslim rule. The Ottoman census of Jerusalem in 1844 shows that Jews outnumbered Christians or Muslims there at least a century before your \"1940's\" mark in time.\n \n \n \nIsrael should be happy with their gift and leave the rest of the region alone.\nYou rather have it backwards. Israel accepted the UN 'gift.' It's Israel's neighbors who didn't leave well enough alone when they sparked the first (and subsequent) Arab-Israeli wars.\n \n \n \nPersonally, I think if they withdrew from the occupied territories, theri Arab neiborghs would leave them alone. I could be wrong. I think we should try it my way, then we can see.\nBeen there, done that. Your way was tried and didn't work.\n \n As long as the Arab leadership refuses to dismantle militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who are publicly vocal in their determination to wipe Israel out of existence, the people of Israel are not about to return the arbitrary ceasefire lines that existed before 1967. Nor does UN resolution 242 even call for the return of \"all\" territories, because it would leave the bulk of Israel's population and industrial capacity in a narrow corridor of land that at one point is a mere 9 miles wide. Unless the Arabs sincerely agree to accept Israel's right to exist, the conflict will not likely resolve anytime soon.",

   "I don't have a bible here, so can't quote chapter and verse. Look for \"Canaan\", as that was the name of palestine during biblical periods. It was later conqured by the Romans and named Palastina. Later the the turks took control then the british were handed the state by the league of nations. It is unclear exactly how they ended up renaming the area to Palestine. I never rely on the bible to make my points. In this case, I used it as a historical refernce (like...uh...the best known refrence to that time period in the middle east).\n \n You are right, the arabs of the region did not call themselves palesteninas until after the region was divided, before that they were, uh, maybe ottomans? Dunno. What is the point here?\n \n While borders in Europe have changed drastically over the years, I don't think that even compares to the lax international border situation in the middle east. The cannanites had no border at all, and for all intents and purposes never even bothered to form a cohesive government. Right up until after WWII, the Beduins considered themselves to be a kindom. They even had a king, but they lived a nomatic lifestyle, moving at will through the region. Territorial disputes pre-1850 in the middle east were generally about the ownership of a town for taxation purposes as opposed to fighting for land.\n \n As afr as whether the palestenians had a declaration of independance.....show me Frances declaration of independance, or Irans. They don't exist, beacuse they were not needed. Palestine didn't need a decleration of independace. If you really want to see one, though, go ind the letter written by the Palestnian National Conference to the Paris peace conference in 1919 which call for an independant state.\n \n As far as I know, there was no call for an independat state while Egypt and Jordan had posession of the west bank and the gaza strip.

And still do to this day. Blaming Israel for the Palestinians anti-Semitism is laughable. Palestinians are to blame for not accepting the offer. Additionally, 'terrorism' commited by Palestinians is not a a legitimate course of action by them.\n \n Israel could have 'occupied' MORE than the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights. The Arabs attempted to extinguish the Jewish state on two occassions. At one point, they occupied the entire Sinai pennisula, but withdrew after international pressure. The Israelis rightfully occupy the Golan Heights because of the strategic importance of them. In the past Syrians(?) and terrorists would launch attacks upon Israelis via artillery and rockets.\n \n Somebody is in desperate need of a history lesson.

Is that any way for the Arabs to treat their own brethren?\n \n \n What are you saying here... that the Arab view today is rooted in the fact that 1,000 years ago the sophisticated Arab culture was considerably more advanced than that of Europe, and that now with the centuries of subsequent decline in Arab science and culture, that the Arabs are somehow justified in their belligerence? Just asking for clarification, since I'm unclear what connection you're making between the Arab illustrious past and the contemporary circumstances of Arab states.\n \n Have you ever considered that it may not be entirely Israel's fault that not one of the 22 members in the Arab League is a democracy?\n \n \n The historical connection to the land simply explains why Jews have always been attracted to Palestine. It's not the sole (nor even the most important) basis for their claim to a share of Palestine.\n \n Furthermore, despite the expulsions and Diaspora, Jews continued to live in Palestine regardless of Roman, Christian, or Muslim rule. The Ottoman census of Jerusalem in 1844 shows that Jews outnumbered Christians or Muslims there at least a century before your \"1940's\" mark in time.\n \n \n You rather have it backwards. Israel accepted the UN 'gift.' It's Israel's neighbors who didn't leave well enough alone when they sparked the first (and subsequent) Arab-Israeli wars.\n \n \n Been there, done that. Your way was tried and didn't work.\n \n As long as the Arab leadership refuses to dismantle militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who are publicly vocal in their determination to wipe Israel out of existence, the people of Israel are not about to return the arbitrary ceasefire lines that existed before 1967. Nor does UN resolution 242 even call for the return of \"all\" territories, because it would leave the bulk of Israel's population and industrial capacity in a narrow corridor of land that at one point is a mere 9 miles wide. Unless the Arabs sincerely agree to accept Israel's right to exist, the conflict will not likely resolve anytime soon.\n\n I hate to burst your bubble, but the term Philistine is the direct, etymological root of the word Palestinian. Thus in arabic, the word is Fillistinian. \n The people who inhabited that controversial area have a distinct culture from other arabs <as each nationality does< and a direct historical legacy. At least the Palestinians have a homogenous culture, unlike Israel which is a state founded on a religion, not a nationality.",

   "I hate to burst your bubble...\nWhat 'bubble' might that be? Oddly enough, you neglected to even identify a bubble, much less burst one. In a quite peculiar manner, you quoted nearly a thousand words of scattered excerpts from my prior posting. Then you added your own brief comment that failed to refute (or even directly address) anything I had written. Perhaps your 'hate' in bursting a bubble explains your delinquency in identifying one.\n \n \n \n...but the term Philistine is the direct, etymological root of the word Palestinian..\nYes, this one part you got right. It's widely known that the word Philistine is the etymological predecessor of the word Palestine.\n \n However, your conclusion in message #115 that \"the Palestinians are descended from the Philestines\" is way, WAY wrong. Why do you make such an extravagant claim for which there is no scholarly support? The tie between Philistines and Palestinian Arabs is in name only. To argue that this linguistic tie is evidence that Palestinians are descended from Philistines is as preposterous as arguing that Lee Harvey Oswald is descended from ancient pot plants because the Arabic word hashish is the etymological root of the word assassin.\n \n Furthermore, you seem unaware that the Philistines were a sea-faring people from the Aegean, not an indigenous or Semitic people of Canaan, which is one more reason why even modern-day Palestinians do not claim a cultural or hereditary connection to the Philistines. The historical records shows not only that the Philistines came from the west but also that Palestine is a Western name, both in its ancient origin and in its modern revival.\n \n \n \nThe people who inhabited that controversial area have a distinct culture from other arabs\nYou have made the claim, yet you have offered no evidence. The historical record shows that the idea that Palestinian Arabs form a distinct people is relatively recent. Since you seem to think otherwise, please be specific in identifying the 'distinct' characteristics of Palestinian Arab culture during the Ottoman period (or indeed ANY period) prior to the British Mandate.\n \n Please don't clutter your reply with references to the distinct Palestinian identity that arose in the 20th century in response to Zionism and the establishment of Israel. You implied that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine in earlier times had a \"distinct culture from other Arabs,\" so I'm asking you to address that specific assertion, if you can.\n \n In the early 20th century the Arabs of Palestine mostly considered themselves as southern Syrians. After Israel was established, Arabs in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and east Jerusalem were ruled by Egypt and Jordan who encouraged them to think of themselves as Egyptians and Jordanians. Twenty years later, the idea of a distinct Palestinian nationality got a great boost from the 1967 Six Day War. After the Arab defeat, the Palestinian Arabs were no longer ruled by neighboring Arab states, and their new Israeli rulers had no interest in encouraging them to think of themselves as Israelis.\n \n Furthermore, the Arab inhabitants of the disputed territories now shared interests and problems in common with each other that they did not share with neighboring Arab states. As a result, the many Arabs who had earlier denied (in the interest of pan-Arabism) that there was any distinction between the Arabs of Palestine and other Arabs in the region were compelled to back off, and few Arabs now deny the distinctiveness of the Palestinians. Even most Israelis today recognize that a distinct Palestinian identity or nationality exists.\n \n \n \nAt least the Palestinians have a homogenous culture, unlike Israel which is a state founded on a religion, not a nationality.\nEven if it were true that Israel is founded on a religion, what has that to do with whether Israeli culture is homogeneous or heterogeneous? Your thinking appear jumbled when you utter such confusion and mix together concepts that have no inherent bearing on one another. What makes you think that a state founded on religion can't be homogeneous? Consider that the smallest country in the world--the Vatican City-State--is not only founded on a religion [Roman Catholicism] but is considerably more homogeneous than Palestinian culture.\n \n Besides, the Palestinians do not appear as homogeneous as you suggest. Else, why do religious groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad fight secular groups like Arafat's PLO. Even the PLO is itself an umbrella group comprised of numerous organizations, though dominated by Fatah, the group founded by Arafat. If the homogeneity that you imagine truly exists, then why do Palestinians skirmish among themselves when they're not fighting Jews? Why is the number of Christians living in Israel increasing slowly but steadily, while the Palestinian Christian population dwindles at an alarming pace? Where is the uniformity between the nomadic Bedouin and the Arab agriculturalists who settle in towns and villages? Why is it in the 19th century that travellers to Palestine identified at least 15 Arab nationalities in Jaffa alone--Egyptian, Sudanese, Syrian, and Lebanese migrants; Algerian refugees escaping the French conquest; Circassian refugees fleeing Russian oppression; Muslims from Bosnia; Tukomans; Yemenite Arabs; Bedouin tribes from Jordan escaping famine, and so on. It appears that the diversification of Arabs living in Palestine escaped your attention. \n \n Furthermore, when you say that the Palestinians at least have an homogenous culture, it appears you believe that homogeneity is more desirable than diversity. Is that really what you mean to convey? Did you pause to consider that an homogenous society driven by consensus could make it difficult to develop a cultural atmosphere conducive to the free exchange of ideas? Might that possibly be a factor in why there are no democracies among the the 22 members of the Arab League?\n \n In any event, Israel was founded as a parliamentary democracy, not a theocracy. If you're going to use words in a manner that departs from the standardized meaning, I suggest you start defining them in order to make your meaning clear. If you want theocracy, look to Iran or the Vatican City-State. Israel is a multi-party democracy where govn't functions are based not on Torah or religious law but on the laws of the Knesset, which is an elected body. If you were better informed about Israeli politics you would have known that secular Jews, not religious Jews, were the impetus for the creation of Israel. Indeed, parties on the left (like the Labour Party) dominated Israeli politics for decades following the War of Independence. Even the Likud, which is the largest conservative party and the one to which Sharon belongs, is secular. Perhaps you hate to burst a bubble because it's your bubble that generally bursts.",

   "I mean legal as in regards to international law. The UN was the entity which split up Palestine between Isreal and a Palestinian state.\n\n \n The only solution to this conflict is to base it on the original UN partition of the area referred to as Palestine in UN resolution 181. That's where the problem began. It's a real estate and compensation deal, nothing else.\n \n I argue this issue within my Jewish family on a constant basis and the only rationalization used by conservative Jews is ancient historical and emotional in nature, with blinders on for every current fact. \n \n Without rehashing the property lines discussed countless times on this and other forums, when Israel declared for statehood it violated the UN partition boundries and offered no compensation to Arabs occupying those additional lands. That's the reason, for the sake of discussion, not to get into who are Palestinians, that Palestine refused to accept Jewish Statehood from day one. The 1967 War and other conflicts added land to Israel's claimed borders, with the US paying billions to Egypt and other favored nations to drop their claims of territorial loss to Israel. \n \n So now we have a greatly expanded Israel, complete with capital investment made by private and public entities to settle and improve those new properties. Israel, like the US, is a system of government largely controlled by special interests who are not going to abandon those capital investments and can put enough pressure on the government to use military force under the guise of internal security to protect and allow them to develop their investments. Anyone remember the Native Americans? The US largely foots the bill for that military power, adding the shadow of leaning over Israel by being the most powerful country in the world for intimidation purposes. \n \n So you have a real estate problem, never solved by anything but litigation or war, with one of the main players, Israel, having the highest rate of UN resolution violations in the world and being fully supported by the world's most powerful nation in sustaining those violations. That means forget international law as a solution. \n \n Until alternate sources of energy are developed and the US no longer needs constant turmoil in the Mideast to avoid those oil producers from unifying in a manner that disturbs our control in supplying that addiction, nothing will change. Well, maybe get worse, but not better. \n \n Or, if China is able to sustain and increase current rates of economic growth by utilizing the new pipeline to former USSR States oil reserves, much of it in Muslim territory with unknown reserves thought to be larger than those in the Mideast, we may not need all that oil. And China didn't fire a shot to get the pipeline, it was done on a trade basis. Unique, huh?",

THe UN security council called an emergency session that afternoon to deal with it. The American representative was not able to show up until october the 8th. By october 8th, the Israeli army was doing just fine against the invaders, and had actually managed to push them back to the borders in most cases. THe US blocked any action in the security council. Israel began pushing into Syria, then Egypt. By the 26'th of october, Israel had lost 2400 men and over 5 billion dollars worth of equipment, including over 1 billion dollars worth of equipment which was airlifted by the US, since the israelis were dangerously low on ammunition and equipment. The Soviet Union threatened to interfere witht he US's abilty to resupply Israel. The US finally drafted a security council resolution calling for a cease fire.\n \n The Cease fire was not designed to stop Israel from getting more land, it was introduced by the US, and supported by Israel, because without US resupply, the Israeli army was doomed and an invasion of Israel was only a matter of time. In Jauary, 1975, Chief Justice Shimon Agranat, president of the Israeli Supreme Court, finished a report outlining why the performance of the Israeli army had been so dismal. The report showed deficincies in intelligence gathering, discipline within the ranks, and the mobilization of reserves.\n \n The war was not stopped by anti-sematic folks who wanted to see Israel pushed back in its borders, it was stopped by the US, and over the objections of 2 other UNSC members, because the Israeli military was on the verge of collapse.\n \n I know that your version is what they teach in Israeli schools in order to bolster the myth of the great israeli military, but the report by Agranat is in the public domain.",

   "I no longer have the links, but as memory serves me, over the years we've already paid over $70 billion in discretionary funds to Egypt to dismiss land claims against Israel. The problem with tracking discretionary funding, any administration's slush fund, is that they're accounted for after the fact, never see daylight as a budget line item and only the interest shows up in the following year's budget. That means attempting to go into interest budgets and backtracking line items. With government accounting being a maze of never-never land, discretionary funding is allocated to a variety of agencies, most with zero rhyme or reason. The footnotes alone would confuse any CPA. \n \n To associate that statement with the latest thread posting, all of Israel's military 'victories' over their neighbors have been US engineered and consisted primarily of air superiority followed by armored excursions to secure real estate, normally over-extending themselves until we could again bail them out. Arabic air force equipment sold by the USSR to Arabic countries other than Saudi Arabia during that era were front-line fighter and fighter/bomber pieces, but without the USSR's latest air-to-air missiles, which made them hash for US supplied (not sold) Israeli aircraft using the latest in US missile technology. In virtually every case the US Military sells weaponry licensing to Israel, including all military equipment, provides the finished products under discretionary military aid and covers operating expenses under budgeted military aid. Israel supplies personnel. \n \n Whenever I used to read of underdog Israeli victories over their neighbors during that era, I would watch official US press releases tout the superiority of the Israeli underdogs in the face of overwhelming superiority.

It was simply a war against Israel's existence. There's really no need to speculate on the matter, since the Arabs went public in stating their reasons for rejecting the partition and resorting to war.\n \n Though the Arab leadership was divided between the Arab Higher Committee [led by Haj Amin al-Husseini] and the newly created Arab League, both organizations agreed that the partition should be rejected. In September 1947 shortly before the UN vote, the Secretary-General of the Arab League [Azzam Pasha] told the Jewish Agency representatives [Abba Eban and David Horowitz]: \"The Arab world is not in a compromising mood... We shall try to defeat you. I am not sure we'll succeed, but we'll try. We were able to drive out the Crusaders, but on the other hand we lost Spain and Persia. It may be that we shall lose Palestine. But it's too late to talk of peaceful solutions.\"\n \n Do you have evidence of any Arab leadership in 1947 that did not hold an uncompromising position in rejecting partition?\n \n Do you find any reference to \"terrorism\" in the Arab League statement which itemizes the \"considerations and objectives\" for which the Arabs intervened in Palestine in defiance of resolution 181?\n \n As to your question above, even if you should find a basis to argue that the Arab invasion was a war on terror, it still does not \"legitimize\" terrorist methods, whether perpetrated by sovereign states, dissident groups, or other non-state actors.",

Is not the U.S. entitled to more than one hired gun? Why isn't NATO, for example, a hired gun? The U.S. provides for 65% of NATO's defense expenditures but only 25% of Israel's. Why isn't Pakistan a hired gun based on the $300,000,000 of military aid we earmarked for them in the new fiscal year? Why isn't Colombia a hired gun based on the $109,000,000 in military aid this year to fight rebels and drugs? Why doesn't $66,000,000 of military aid to Poland make that country our hired gun in Iraq?\n \n \n \nSaudi Arabia, currently under Islamic extremist pressure for their association with us, does pay cash for their armaments.\nIt's so nice of the Saud family to give some of our cash back in exchange for the weapons systems we give them. The Saudi oligarchy--you know, the 3000 or so cousins that own that country's wealth as their personal domain--is not threatened by their association with the U.S. but by Wahhabism, the virulent strain of Islam that King Abd al Aziz's descendants foisted on an unwary world, hoping that extreme intolerance might be appeased indefinitely. If it were true that associating with America is the reason the kingdom is feeling pressure, then why not save themselves by dissociating from America? Their problem isn't America but is something rather domestic and homegrown. When the dynasty's founder died in 1953, he left behind 44 sons (and countless daughters) by 17 wives, so that today the highest echelons of government are exclusively populated by roughly 100 princes related by blood and accountable to no one but themselves, yet they rule over 20 million people in cities teeming with poverty and street beggars.\n \n Perhaps nothing can save the oligarchs now, but now that you've alluded to the nearly $50 billion in U.S. arms sales to the Saudis (just since 1990), you may want to think twice before applauding the fact that they pay with cash.",

   "Sorry my bad. Here`s the correct URL:\n http://members.fortunecity.com/911/...h-terrorism.htm\n \n \"November 6, 1944. Zionist terrorists of the Stern Gang assassinated the British Minister Resident in the Middle East, Lord Moyne, in Cairo.\"\n\n \n Thanks for your effort. If I had known that you were referring to the Mandatory Period, then I wouldn't have bothered to ask for a reference. You said, \"Israel has used terrorist methods in the past against the UK...\" That's what I was curious to see. However, Israel wasn't founded until 1948, so it's unreasonable to think that the 1944 murder of Lord Moyne examples a terrorist act by Israel. \n \n Regarding Jewish para-military groups during the British occupation, if you're interested in good information on that subject, don't rely only on anti-Zionist links like the one above. The excerpt you posted is accurate enough, but how will you know what you're missing unless you also use sources that help put it all into context. For example, your source doesn't say anything as to why Lord Moyne was a target, especially since he lived in Cairo, not Palestine. It wasn't simply that he was British.\n \n Getting back to your original comment about Israel, if you find something that shows the State of Israel engaged in terror against the U.K., I'd be interested to hear it.\n \n \n \nJust because the US have decided that terror can be declared war upon and used as an excuse to invade soverign nations doesn`t mean that it should be adopted globally. In that case we would have a truly problematic situation...\nAre you distinguishing between the Afghan invasion and the one in Iraq? Probably a good number of Americans feel that 9/11 justfies the former, while the latter is excessive and unwarranted. It does appear the U.S. walks a slippery slope. Barely a week after 9/11, Bush told the nation-indeed, the world-that 'either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.' It seems the nations of the world are given just two choices. The conspicuous absence of a third option-one suitable for neutrals-leads one to wonder if this 'war' perhaps doesn't have any room for a nation to declare its neutrality.\n \n Few, if any, wars unfold exactly as planned or imagined, and in that regard, this war is no different. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the Bush administration's doctrine is the language of 'preemption.' I think it's a mistaken and confusing choice of words to use in the war against terror. After 9/11, the U.S. was already at war against terrorist groups and the international regimes that harbor them. With sanctions against Syria soon to be imposed, the doctrine of 'preemption' deserves a closer examination. For a long time Syria has been on the State Dept list of countries that sponsor terrorism. If Syria doesn't act to disarm these groups, then surely they're complicit with providing them safe haven. Luckily for Syria we running low on troops and money.",
