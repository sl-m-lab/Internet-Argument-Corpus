The general impression one gets is that many European countries treat their average workers better than the US, but their economies do not reward high achievers as highly. I knew someone who immigrated from Sweden to the US just for this reason - i.e. he was an entepreneur who thought that the US economy was more rewarding. \n \n Also, there seems to be a wider range of socially acceptable lifestyles in the US and more genuine intermingling of races than there is in Europe - partly because of the US being made up of a mingling on non-homogenous peoples. In this way, the ancient cultures of Europe form a disadvantage to many people. \n \n On the positive side for Europe, though, the longer stretch of history has yielded typically more beautiful cities (at least the city centers) and small towns and villages than one generally finds in the US.\n \n So, there are advantages and disadvantages for both regions and the region one would prefer to live really depends on ones place in society and ones priorities and lifestyle preferences.\n \n Either way, most of us have attachments to our own country (most or all of our friends and family live there, we are most familiar with it having grown up there, etc.).

   "Poor Afghan police. They have to fight not only against inner criminal bandits but also against so-called peacemakers, and jovial neighbors like Uzbekistan, and other weapon and drug smugglers.\n Right recently they've done away with militants' band on the North of Afghanistan. And they've found casegoods with 'US military property'. Earlier coalition command announced them stolen from one of military bases.\n Those policemen opened found casegoods and guess what. There've been the largest load of weed those poor Afghans have ever seen. It turned out that this band was just express couriers between American command and Uzbek frontier guards in Termez. The last ones had to deliver those 'goods' to Karimov's people. And Mr. Democratic President of Central Asia would transport weed into Europe.\n And how should poor Afghan police get rid of this pest while everything has been decided instead of them? They can't exile peacemakers' contingent from the country peacefully (sorry for tautology). And reclamations towards Uzbekistan are equal to casus belli. That's not the fairiest Afghan dream either.\n In fact Afghanistan isn't state anymore. It is just territory Americans use as their criminal business base.",
