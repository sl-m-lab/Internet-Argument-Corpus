   "On July 10th 2005, Julian Bond, Chairman of the NAACP, ripped into conservatives and reiterated his belief in conspiracy theories. During the 96th Annual NAACP National Convention in Milwaukee, he spoke of a \"new racist ideology\" and was also quoted saying \"They have successfully promoted deeply flawed economic and foreign policies. They have passed tax cuts that were not only unfair but unaffordable.\" Hmm, I wonder to whom Mr. Bond is referring. Let's see, tax cuts and economic/foreign policy. Ding-Ding-Ding! How about Republicans and especially George W. Bush. Yes, that's correct. Tell him what he's won, Johnny. You would think that a Democrat Mouthpiece that gave us Jimmy Carter would not be so critical of foreign or domestic policy considering Carter ran the country into the ground and let Iran slip into the hands of Muslim Fanatics during his 4 years of glory. The Chairman went further saying conservative lawmakers have \"restricted access to the courts, capped damages for even the most egregious practices, eviscerated class action lawsuits, and not coincidentally, shielded industry after industry from legal scrutiny.\" Does anyone on this planet think we have too few class action lawsuits? Transcript of Julian Bond's Speech\n \n As for the conspiracy theory part, Mr. Bond said, \"Anyone who claims that voting rights for minority Americans are now secure need only look to Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004...\" These statements are simply misleading, implying that there is somehow a conspiracy against blacks by Republicans. It is irresponsible to make such claims. The 2000 election recount and voting procedures in Florida were examined by two independent agencies and several news agencies including The New York Times. George Bush won the recount and there was no Republican conspiracy against blacks. The best the Liberal Media and The NAACP can do is keep mentioning a Republican Conspiracy and hope it sticks.\n \n Earlier in the event, Bond remarked that The President had not spoken to the NAACP for five years. Bond also directed a statement towards President Bush saying, \"We want to see you and we want you to see us - we want to know you think you're our president too.\" This is laughable, considering NAACP officials have referred to Bush as an illegal president as recently as 2004. Some of his extreme comments include these gems: According to 2004 article by Mary Jacoby of Salon.com, NAACP head Julian Bond says the GOP is going all out to suppress the black vote. During the NAACP 94th Annual Convention, Bond quipped that Republicans appeal \"to the dark underside of American culture, to that minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.\" He also said, \"Their idea of equal rights is the American flag and Confederate swastika flying side by side.\" In a 2001 speech, Bond compared conservatives to the Taliban. Why would Bush attend an NAACP event when they are so hostile towards him? The Washington Times Article\n \n Former Secretary of Education, Rod Paige had this to say about the NAACP in his Op-ed piece from July 15, 2004: \"In particular, Mr. Bond and Mr. Mfume have done a great disservice to our organization, and to the founders of the civil-rights movement, with their hateful and untruthful rhetoric about Republicans and President Bush. How ironic that they would direct this vitriol at a president who has appointed more African Americans to high-profile posts, has committed more funds to fight AIDS in Africa, has championed minority homeownership, and has supported more trade and aid for African and Caribbean nations than any other administration.\" Mr. Paige is the first African-American appointed Secretary of Education. Op-ed by Rod Paige\n \n I think Julian Bond is wrong about Bush and wrong about Republicans. His ilk make a living being divisive and exaggerating racism to further their cause, which is staying in power and drumming up support for Democrats. He ignores the solid history of Republicans regarding Civil Rights. He claims to be non-partisan but remember, The NAACP funded the 2000 Election commercial trying to link Bush to the dragging death of James Byrd, a black man. \n \n The NAACP web site probably says it best: Making Democracy Work Since 1909. You see, they don't \"Allow Democracy to Work,\" they \"Make It Work,\" and they do it with an Iron Fist. NAACP Web Site\n \n \n \n \n \n __________________________________________\n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n http://www.carnellknowledge.com/ \n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n __________________________________________",

After an extensive study was completed in 1998, under the Clinton administration hundreds of millions of dollars were appropriated and much was spent to shore up the levees. Over 200 million was spent by the Clinton Administration alone. The Bush Administration cut the funding for that project by over 60% in 2004 alone. See the Feb. 16, 2004, article, in New Orleans CityBusiness. Also see the Times-Picayune series of articles published in 2004.\n \n \"The Bush administration's policy of turning over wetlands to developers almost certainly also contributed to the heightened level of the storm surge. In 1990, a federal task force began restoring lost wetlands surrounding New Orleans. Every two miles of wetland between the Crescent City and the Gulf reduces a surge by half a foot. Bush had promised \"no net loss\" of wetlands, a policy launched by his father's administration and bolstered by President Clinton. But he reversed his approach in 2003, unleashing the developers. The Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency then announced they could no longer protect wetlands unless they were somehow related to interstate commerce.\"\n \n \"I't appears that the money has been moved in the president's budget to handle homeland security and the war in Iraq, and I suppose that's the price we pay. Nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished, and we are doing everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us.\" Walter Maestri, emergency management chief for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; New Orleans Times-Picayune, June 8, 2004.\n \n \"Over the next 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers, tasked with carrying out SELA, spent $430 million on shoring up levees and building pumping stations, with $50 million in local aid. But at least $250 million in crucial projects remained, even as hurricane activity in the Atlantic Basin increased dramatically and the levees surrounding New Orleans continued to subside.\n \n Yet after 2003, the flow of federal dollars toward SELA dropped to a trickle. The Corps never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq, as well as homeland security -- coming at the same time as federal tax cuts -- was the reason for the strain. At least nine articles in the Times-Picayune from 2004 and 2005 specifically cite the cost of Iraq as a reason for the lack of hurricane- and flood-control dollars. (Much of the research here is from Nexis, which is why some articles aren't linked.)\"\n New York Daily News Sept 7, 2005",

   "another claim with no backing.\n \n Don't people realize it is up to local authorities to do most things in this kind of situation. I would say the Major of New Orleans and the Gov. of La are the ones that screwed up the most. The only thing Bush coulda done differently would be to declare martial law (which I think he shoulda done) and gone in on his own without waiting for the Governors premission.\n\n Here, here. Hey Steeeeve, why isn't the \"mainstream media\" covering the relief efforts in Miss. or Alabama? And Didn't President Bush plead with LA officials to get their people out the Sunday before the storm hit?",
