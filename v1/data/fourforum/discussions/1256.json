The vast majority of mutations are actually neutral.\n \n \nAnother impasse for neo-Darwinists came from the fossil record. Even in Darwin's time, fossils were already posing an important obstacle to the theory. While Darwin himself accepted the lack of fossils of \"intermediate species,\" he also predicted that further research would provide evidence of these lost transitional forms.

I was arguing that people &#8216;recognize&#8217; this &#8216;godliness&#8217; and that is evidence of a God in my opinion. \n \n \nOr elese they were jsut good people to begin with. Does one need to believe in god to be a good person? \n\n \n Nope, as I said, I was talking about what people recognize in those men, not that they were good.\n \n \nThe more we learn from science the less we need of religion. The Church at one time had tried to use science to prove the existence of god and when it was found out that it couldn't be used for that then that is when many Christians developed a distrust of science itself.. \n\n \n Why is this pertinent to my statements? \n \n \nWhy not. It could be that one's empathy or love is so strong that they think of others before themselves. Does one need god to do this? \n\n \n Didn&#8217;t I say that I understand there were some psychological explanations but that I didn&#8217;t agree with them. You just stated one of the psychological arguments that I don&#8217;t agree with.\n \n \nThat is tautologic. \n\n \n Fine then what caused it?\n \n \nWhy does it need to be a god? \n\n \n I never said there needed to be a God, I said I believed there was a God. I guess you don&#8217;t believe in a God. My belief is just as good as yours.\n \n \nPeople for many centuries believed in fairies and the like until their religions were destroyed by Christianity. Many pagan religions held these things as real as you do in your god. They had just as much \"reason\" to believe in them as you do in yours and just as much evidence as well. \n\n \n I said there was no evidence. I have a reason for believing there is a God whether you agree with it or not. And for that reason, I believe there is a soul. You may not like it but you don&#8217;t have any evidence that I&#8217;m wrong either.",

   "Didn't say that it wasn't. Engergy and matter are basically the same thing. All have an energy signature of somekind and can be measured. \n\n \n You said &#8220;Energy is \"immaterial\". &#8220;. Sure looked to me that you said energy is not matter.\n \n \nYou're the one who is making an extra-ordinary claim. The existence of a soul. \n\n \n I did not make that claim. I only claimed that I believed that. And that claim is true because I do believe that. However you made this claim \n \n &#8220;You're belief is incorrect. You only base that on belief, I base it on facts. \n \n You claimed in black and white that deeph&#8217;s belief was incorrect and that you based that on facts. I&#8217;m still waiting for those facts that you claimed makes deeph&#8217;s beliefs incorrect.\n \n \nHow is unknown, but it is easy enough to see the results. Where do I look to see a soul? \n\n \n You can't see the supernatural with natural means. It's a belief.\n \n \nThey've been looking for centuries, even thousands of years and nothing.\n \n Prove that the supernatural exists in the first place. All that exists is part of nature. You think that nature is only to do with the wild.\n \n Nature:\n \n 2. A causal agent creating and controlling things in the universe\n \n\n \n I can&#8217;t prove that the supernatural exist any more than you can prove that it doesn&#8217;t exist. And you can&#8217;t prove that &#8216;all that exists is part of nature&#8217;. \n \n What does &#8216;you think that nature is only to do with the wild&#8217; mean?\n \n \n \nIf you believe in the supernatural than you must also believe in everything said to be supernatural since by your definition you can't disprove, or prove it. So ghosts, werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural things that go bump in the night must exist as well. \n\n \n You don&#8217;t determine what I must believe, I determine what I believe. \n \n \nIf it is a part of god in us than how can we sin if we're a part of god?\n\n \n If you want to debate how we can sin, you&#8217;ll have to talk to a theist that believes we sin.",
