The government should never run a deficit (raising taxes to meet spending), but that does not mean increased government is to be allowed as long as the influx meets the outflow. All that accomplishes is an uncompetitive workforce and economy, due to the higher costs incurred by a highly Socialist (or Federalist) national government.\n \n There should be 2 real amendments to the Constitution:\n \n 1) Balanced Budget Amendment. Government could never enact a budget that outpaces tax revenue. Government would either have to be pared back or tax %s increased.\n \n 2) Federal tax % increases could only occur after a national vote. A majority of 'no' means no increase in federal spending. If the majority of citizens want the government programs' increased, they most vote in the affirmative for the increase.",
