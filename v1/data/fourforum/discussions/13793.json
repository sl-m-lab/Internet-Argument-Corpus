LOLOL... from both men...\n \n Caller: Well, Pat, we're still looking for change, that's why we're voting for Scott. The change we got from Obama was nothing like what he promised during his campaign. We're worried about this healthcare program he's pushing and since he doesn't care that so many Americans are against it, then we just can't trust him or the majority to represent our interests anymore.\n \n Pat: Thanks for calling in sir and see you at the polls on tuesday.\n This was just one of many calls which asserted the same basic message. I'm starting to believe that no amount of ballot tampering by ACORN and SEIU can overcome the opposition to Martha Coakley. And may reality hit Yobama like a ton of bricks as he realizes his perceived mandate is as imaginary as his desire to honestly serve the peoples interest rather than impose his agenda upon us.",

   "As exit polls in the very strong Democratic districts in boston polling stations show loyal Democrats voting for Scott Brown, and as the harsh reality of a Republican victory settles in, even though the blame game has already started within the Democratic ranks, All of their complaints show that they are still missing the boat on why the voters are standing so strongly against a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic State. \n \n Here's an excerpt from the link:\n Politico: Finger-pointing begins for Democratic \n By MANU RAJU & JONATHAN MARTIN AND JOHN BRESNAHAN\n Politico.com \n 47 minutes ago\n \n CAMBRIDGE, MASS. - As voters head to the polls in Massachusetts, nervous Democrats have already begun to blame one another for putting at risk the Senate seat Ted Kennedy held for more than 40 years.\n \n Many angry Democrats blame their candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, for running a sluggish campaign that let Republican Scott Brown set the contours of the race.\n \n Some Democratic strategists lay the fault at the feet of President Barack Obama, saying he should have done more to sell the party's agenda.\n \n And in private conversations, Hill sources say White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel has blamed Coakley, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake for failing to see Brown's surge in time to stop it.\n \n \"With the legislative and political stakes so high, it's unbelievable that the Senate committee and White House let this race get so out of hand,\" said one senior Washington Democrat. \"There's a lot of blame to go around. Martha Coakley is only one of the problems here.\"\n \n Coakley is at the center of the criticism. Democrats complain that her campaign was caught napping after last month's primary - and that Brown was able to use the pause to shape the race.\n \n \"A malaise set in, and there was a failure to take advantage of the opportunity to define yourself the next day\" after the primary, said longtime Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.). \"You thank people for the primary and then begin to define the next six weeks.\"\n \n Added Neal: \"Going dark was not a great idea.\"\n \n Although DSCC Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) was still predicting victory Monday, even he conceded that it would have been \"better\" if Coakley had laid out the differences between the candidates earlier. He said Democrats have learned a crucial lesson: that even in very blue states, Democrats should expect a \"volatile\" environment with a \"tough\" electorate - and \"you can't afford not to be aggressive.\"\n \n \"You have to define your opponent before they define themselves,\" Menendez said. \"In Brown's case, he's working hard to try to disguise himself.\"\n \n Menendez learned that the race was tightening about a week and a half ago, when independent pollsters returned results showing the race much tighter than Democratic polls had been portraying. He acted quickly - unleashing more than $2.5 million into the race, including $1.4 million in television ads in the past week alone, according to sources familiar with the effort.\n Politico: Finger-pointing begins for Democratic insiders - Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2010\n \n With all of their excuses for losing, they still don't get that this loss is the result of a national revolt against this socialized medicine take over Yobama and his cronies are so committed to. ;)",
