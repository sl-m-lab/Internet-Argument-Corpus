But if we are talking about some form of \"objective\" quality of life in terms of populations, I think the Human Development Report serves a good purpose. Its administered by UN and tries to measure the \"well-being\" of the populace in different nations by looking at several indexes that weighs a number of factors\n \n HDI (Human Development Index)\n life expectancy, \n education attainment \n standard of living (GDP/capita), \n \n HPI (Human Poverty Index)\n Infant mortality, \n Availability to forms of comunications \n Standard of living (an economic overview)\n Social inclussion (measures of inclusion and exclusion from society)\n \n GDI (Gender Development Index)\n Measures the statistical differences between men and women in regards of:\n life expectancy \n educational attainment \n income\n \n GEM (Gender Empowerment Index)\n Measures the statistical differences between men and women in regards of:\n economic participation and decision-making \n political participation and decision-making \n power over economic resources \n \n Sometimes HDI is used alone as an indicator of \"well-being\" but I would argue that at least the HPI and one of the gender indexes serves an important purpose.",

Why stop there? Why should some people have to drive 7-year-old cars? 3 year limit on age of car, that's quality of life. I also think rich people should have to give most of their money to other people. Heck with capitalism, communism is the way to go, equal share for everyone. Of course I'm being sarcastic. I think people in this country have begun to get their 'needs' confused with their 'wants.' Believe it or not, there is a difference.

That's why I goto Scarborough Country, no passport required and no PC Police.\n\n \n Ok, lets try to sort out your arguments. \n \n First you complain that no one living in this country should even try to define or talk about quality of life because we have it so good, then you toot capitalism's horn. So do you appreciate the benefits of America's prosperous economy enough to scold those who enjoy it? \n \n Then you jump the fence again and make an argument that poor people (or in PC demon language - lower in the economic strata) don't \"need\" to buy candy and things that make them happy with the foodstamps given to them by the government. Would you like the government to regulate what these people buy with their foodstamps? How about only bread, since most people only \"need\" bread to survive. Imagine the breadlines. Oh wait, we're back in Communist Russia. Didn't you previously make a witty quip about how Communism pales in comparison to capitalism? Choose a side please.\n \n And finally, I'm glad you enjoy Scarborough Country so much. If it's anything like Marlborough Country or Flavor Country (which is located somewhere on the border of Marlborough Country) it's probably smooth, mild and right wing Republican. Is it anything like being in the No-Spin Zone? I hope he isn't shaping your ideaology because, although I dislike many of the PCness of the previous few years, quality of life is a basic human quality that is worth discussing and has come up in more debates than one can name.\n \n PS: That show might garner more viewers if it was called Scarborough Fair, and instead of a television show, it was a song by Simon & Garfunkle.",
