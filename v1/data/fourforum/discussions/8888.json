Recommend the mothers and fathers stay home and bring up their little hoodlums in the ways of the Lord. Then you'll have nicer neighborhoods.\n\n \n Actually, most of my neighbors are awesome. It's a very small segment of the population (5% I think) that are the problem. And a lot of the problems are the results of gangsters out of Cook County, IL (I live in Mpls) coming into town to do business. And fewer cops made it easier.\n \n And frankly - how \"nice\" my neighbors are isn't the problem. An 11 year old girl shot to death while doing homework in her living room, a 14 year killed for his jersey, a 15 year shot in the head in front of my house because some gang banger thought he was somebody else, a one year old spending six moths in the hospital nursing a stomach wound caused by a bullet, MY child hitting the pavement to avoid being hit in a drive by shooting. These are real things that have happened where I live. To children who did nothing. If a little girl from your church was shot while doing her homework would this be your response? The callous assumption that somebody wasn't religious enough and that these deaths are deserved? Is this a sample of the compassion of Christ EZ? Where anything is justifiable if done by the politicians who pander to your faith?\n \n \nIsn't it the liberal left who wants drugs legalized? That ought to bring a lot of blessings to your \"hood\". LOL!\n\n \n Actually - it probably would. 90% of the crime is due to the illegal drug tade. Make drugs legal and take their business away. I am sick of having my son's safety jeapordized bacause of junkies. I don't give a damn if they do their smack. Legalize it, control it, tax the hell out of it.\n \n \nNuts. Bush's tax cuts (like JFK's and Reagan's before him) actually helped produce higher tax revenues for the government, and all classes of tax payers got tax breaks. Many of the \"cuts\" you talk about in Federal programs are actually reductions in the GROWTH of those programs, from a positive 6% down to a positive 4%, for example.\n\n \n I am talking about 150 fewer policeman in my city. I am talking about crimes not getting investigated due to a shortage in police. I am not talking about programs. And don't \"nuts\" me - I live in my neighborhood. You do not.\n \n \nAnd even though I think Bush spends too much money, most of his social spending bills have a good number of Democratic supporters, whom I suppose you helped elect. I've seldom seen a tax a democrat doesn't like or support.\n\n \n I am not a democrat. Nor was I condemning Bush. My stupid governer did this.",

As, to a much lesser extent, do the US military, the CIA and the FBI. In the world of bureaucracy under current administration drug enforcement carries great political and financial benefits for politicians, never known for their logic or reasoning when it comes to expanding or financing their power bases. Our system of government has obviously become morally corrupt. \n \n How many politicians do you see on the street where drugs are openly sold? You can't even protest that without a permit and confinement in a police guarded area removed from the presence of public officials. The current US definition of what seems to be Christian morality without alternatives is an extremely effective means of control when public funds are readily available for enforcement.",
