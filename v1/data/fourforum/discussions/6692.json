   "I agree with Simone, I did find your post a little rambling and hard to follow. But I'd like to take up the following points:\n \n The Commandments. I have no problem with them being displayed in the name of Religious Education, as I would not have a problem with the ideals of any religion being displayed in such a capacity. Out of State schools, well I guess religious schools can display what they wish, but I don't approve of it...\n \n Of course while many of the commandments are sensible, are they the right way in teaching our children these values? Personally I'd prefer my children lived morally through their own desire to do what is right, not through fear of some alleged higher power. \n \n 'Under God' and all that. Well I have no problem with it. It means little today, it is from an earlier time. I don't see that it actually harms anyone.\n \n What do you mean 'why do they accept money for his name'? People need money to live, of course they are going to use it no matter what was written on it.\n \n Obviously we would not destroy laws just because they happen to say the same thing as one of the commandments.\n \n In the end, it is a question of freedom to practice, but not enforce on others. The problem is the likes of certain people in this world who feel insecure in their own belief so they feel the need to force others to think the same to validate it. If they didn't exist then there would be no problem with people putting up whatever they believe in. Unfortunatly they do...",

My meaning can be explained better with an example. If you asked 100 people what \"Shrove Tuesday\" meant, at a guess 50 would say \"dunno\", 49 would say \"its the posh name for pancake day\" and 1 would say \"it is the day before Lent.\n \n Despite there being no pagan origins to Shrove Tuesday, Lent itself (that prior to the 10th century used to be a period of fasting - it has dwindled ever since) possibly derives from the fasting practiced in Greco-Roman mystery religions or even from the Jewish Omer event. Of course it also could be a genuine Christian-origin event in which one physically suffered in order to better appreciate the suffer that Jesus had undertaken as Lent finishes on Good Friday (I think).\n \n (http://www.answers.com/topic/lent?method=6)",
