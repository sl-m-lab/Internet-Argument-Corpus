He has received more than $1 million from the Bradley foundation over the past decade, enabling him to write two important conservative books, Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980 (1984), in which he argued that social programs designed to help the poor actually hurt them, and The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (1994), in which he argued that Black people are genetically intellectually inferior to white people. Both books were roundly criticized by reviewers and social scientists, but had broad impacts in the popular press and, in the 1980s, in the Reagan and Bush administrations.\n \n One good critique of Murray isThe Bell Curve: Roadmap to the \"Ideal\" Society, a full chapter from The Feeding Trough, and is available on this web site in its entirety.\n \n A full debunking of The Bell Curve by Nicolas Lemann is available at Slate.com, or by clicking here. It reveals mathematical errors, logical errors, and the misuse of statistics (i.e. the purported \"IQ\" test actually has questions on subjects as involved as Trigonometry, thus measuring educational attainment, not innate intelligence).\n \n Stephen Jay Gould, author of the 1981 bestseller \"The Mismeasure of Man,\" added a chapter in the 1996 reprinting of his book, specifically dedicated to critiquing The Bell Curve. Anyone seriously interested in Murray should read this book. To get a flavor of what Gould has to say, take a look at the outline of his critique:\n THE BELL CURVE\n \n * Disingenuousness of content\n * Disingenuousness of argument\n * Disingenuousness of program\n * GHOSTS OF BELL CURVES PAST\n \n This critique puts The Bell Curve in its proper perspective as one in a long line of attempts by whites of European descent trying to find a genetic basis for their supposed superiority over other races and peoples.",

   "The Bell Curve, by Charles Murray, is not a very reliable source of information.\n \n http://www.mediatransparency.org/personprofile.php?personID=3\n \n Murray, Charles\n 4 institutional roles for $564,431\n Charles Murray, one of the chief ideologues of the right, is a Bradley Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and has close connections to the Manhattan Institute, where he was a Bradley Fellow from 1981 to 1990. He has received more than $1 million from the Bradley foundation over the past decade, enabling him to write two important conservative books, Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980 (1984), in which he argued that social programs designed to help the poor actually hurt them, and The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (1994), in which he argued that Black people are genetically intellectually inferior to white people. Both books were roundly criticized by reviewers and social scientists, but had broad impacts in the popular press and, in the 1980s, in the Reagan and Bush administrations.\n \n One good critique of Murray isThe Bell Curve: Roadmap to the \"Ideal\" Society, a full chapter from The Feeding Trough, and is available on this web site in its entirety.\n \n A full debunking of The Bell Curve by Nicolas Lemann is available at Slate.com, or by clicking here. It reveals mathematical errors, logical errors, and the misuse of statistics (i.e. the purported \"IQ\" test actually has questions on subjects as involved as Trigonometry, thus measuring educational attainment, not innate intelligence).\n \n Stephen Jay Gould, author of the 1981 bestseller \"The Mismeasure of Man,\" added a chapter in the 1996 reprinting of his book, specifically dedicated to critiquing The Bell Curve. Anyone seriously interested in Murray should read this book. To get a flavor of what Gould has to say, take a look at the outline of his critique:\n THE BELL CURVE\n \n * Disingenuousness of content\n * Disingenuousness of argument\n * Disingenuousness of program\n * GHOSTS OF BELL CURVES PAST\n \n This critique puts The Bell Curve in its proper perspective as one in a long line of attempts by whites of European descent trying to find a genetic basis for their supposed superiority over other races and peoples.\n\n \n \n I realized that I never responded to your attempt to discredit the Bell Curve by painting Murray as a right wing hack. In actuality, the principle author of The Bell Curve was Richard J. Herrnstein , the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and worked with B.F. Skinner while at Harvard. He is the the discoverer of the \"matching Law\" of animal behavior and founding member of Quaniatative Analysis of Behavior. You'd be hard-pressed to denounce his credentials. The only reason that Charles Murray was the main spokesman for the book was because Herrnstein died before the book was released. \n \n Even the APA, in its efforts to defuse controversy, had to admit that the 1 SD difference in intelligence test scores between blacks and whites wasn't due to the test or its administration. They were careful not to go further, however. \n \n\n Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\n Ulric Neisser (Chair) Emory University\n Gwyneth Boodoo Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey\n Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis\n A. Wade Boykin Howard University\n Nathan Brody Wesleyan University\n Stephen J. Ceci Cornell University\n Diane F. Halpern California State University, San Bernardino\n John C. Loehlin University of Texas, Austin\n Robert Perloff University of Pittsburgh\n Robert J. Sternberg Yale University\n Susana Urbina University of North Florida\n \n .....\n Reviewing the intelligence debate at its meeting of November 1994, the Board of Scientific Aflairs (BSA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) concluded that there was urgent need for an authoritative report on\n these issues-one that all sides could use as a basis for discussion. Acting by unanimous vote, BSA established a Task Force charged with preparing such a report. Ulric Neisser, Professor of Psychology at Emory University and a member of BSA, was appointed Chair. The APA Board on the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, which was consulted extensively during this process, nominated one member of the Task Force; the Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment nominated another; a third was dominated by the Council of Representatives.\n Other members were chosen by an extended consultative process, with the aim of representing a broad range of expertise and opinion.\n The Task Force met twice, in January and March of 1995. Between and after these meetings, drafts of the various sections were circulated, revised, and revised yet again. Disputes were resolved by discussion. As a result, the report presented here has the unanimous support of the entire Task Force,\n .......\n It is customary to conclude surveys like this one with a summary of what has been established. Indeed,\n much is now known about intelligence. A near-century of research, most of it based on psychometric methods,\n has produced an impressive body of findings. Although we have tried to do justice to those findings in this report,\n it seems appropriate to conclude on a different note. In this contentious arena, our most useful role may be to\n remind our readers that many of the critical questions about intelligence are still unanswered. Here are a few of\n those questions:\n 1. Differences in genetic endowment contribute substantially to individual differences in (psychometric) intelligence,\n but the pathway by which genes produce their effects is still unknown. The impact of genetic differences\n appears to increase with age, but we do not know why. \n 2. Environmental factors also contribute substantially to the development of intelligence, but we do not\n clearly understand what those factors are or how they work. Attendance at school is certainly important, for\n example, but we do not know what aspects of schoolingare critical.\n 3. The role of nutrition in intelligence remains obscure. Severe childhood malnutrition has clear negative\n effects, but the hypothesis that particular \"micronutrients\" may affect intelligence in otherwise adequately-\n fed populations has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. \n 4. There are significant correlations between measures of information-processing speed and psychometric\n intelligence, but the overall pattern of these findings yields no easy theoretical interpretation.\n 5. Mean scores on intelligence tests are rising steadily. They have gone up a full standard deviation in the last\n 50 years or so, and the rate of gain may be increasing. No one is sure why these gains are happening or what\n they mean.\n 6. The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of Blacks and Whites (about one standard deviation), although it may be diminishing, does not result from many obvious biases in test construction and administration, nor does it simply reflect differences in socioeconomic status. Explanations based on factors of caste and culture may be appropriate, but so far have little direct\n empirical support. There is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation. At present, no one knows what\n causes this differential.7. It is widely agreed that standardized tests do not sample all forms of intelligence. Obvious examples include\n creativity, wisdom, practical sense, and social sensitivity; there are surely others. Despite the importance\n of these abilities we know very little about them: how they develop, what factors influence that development,\n how they are related to more traditional measures. \n \n In a field where so many issues are unresolved and so many questions unanswered, the confident tone that\n has characterized most of the debate on these topics is clearly oyr;of place. The study of intelligence does not\n need politicized assertions and recriminations; it needs self-restraint, reflection, and a great deal more research.\n The questions that remain are socially as well as scientifically important. There is no reason to think them unanswerable,\n but finding the answers will require a shared and sustained effort as well as the commitment of substantial\n scientific resources. Just such a commitment is what we strongly recommend.\n http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/Correlation/Intelligence.pdf\n \n",

   "From the opening post:\n \n \nIn a recent study conducted at Ohio State University's Center for Human Resource Research, author Jay Zagorsky stated \"Intelligence is not a factor for explaining wealth.\" Therefore, one may draw the conclusion that most business and political leaders are not intelligent. They did not earn their way into powerful positions but rather were manipulated into them because of birthright.\n\n \n Thats not the correct conclusion. The correct conclusion is that intelligence and wealth are not correlated. If indeed business and political leaders were less intelligent than the general population AND they were wealthier THEN the finding of independence of the two variables would NOT BE TRUE in the first place. The correct conclusion is that the wealthy are no more and no less intelligent on average than the population as a whole - in other words wealth and intelligence are not correlated.\n \n Then of course one has to ask how the wealth of business and political leaders compares to the wealth of the population as a whole! Take the case of Paris Hilton - she is neither a political or business leader yet she is clearly wealthy.\n \n Then we have to deal with the issue of what it means when you say \"earn their way into powerful positions\" !! A very slippery concept and extremely difficult to define when you think about it. For example many of the characteristics you describe under \"birthright\" do seem to be in the nature of qualifications or merit - education and background do count for a lot in certain jobs which are based on knowledge etc. More later",
