And frankly, 'respect for authority' is by no means the most important value to give your child. Respect for other people is a good start, and this sort of action, even if made with the best intentions, may make a child or adolescent feel victimised and unrespected, which is not constructive.\n \n And if they are going to go through it they should do it only after taliking in depth to the kid, which it sounds like this mother didn't, and preferably having the kid understand. Sneaking around doesn't help.\n \n Having said that, it's probably best to assume your parents are acting in what they see as your best interests, and there's no point aggravating them.

Many parent go on the idea that \"when you're 18 you can do what you please, but not until then and not in my house\". When parents take this position, I believe they are doing a big injustice to the parent-child relationship. \n \n We learn all our lives, you being 14 on the verge of adulthood, (time really does fly) THIS is the time and the next four years where your parents need for you to have input into the rules of the house, privacy issue etc. and when these \"rules\" are in place, then you and you're parents should be \"fairly punished\" if rules are broken. Just because parents \"own\" the house, they don't \"own\" you. Parents need to teach, kids need to learn and we all learn by doing. I'm sure YOU did learn from this stealing episode, and I'm sure you won't steal again...let's hope not. But in any event you did \"learn\" something whatever that may have been and how you deal with future problems will be up to you but at some point your parents need to have faith in your decisions. If you did learn a positive lesson from this experience then tell your mom, let her know that in her mind she may think she is doing the best by seperating you and your bestfriend but in actuality she is undermining your judgment (that you can't pick good friends) and that you would appreciate it if she would give you one more chance, to trust your actions and your judgment in friends. \n \n Good luck.

   "ok, here's my take on the whole thing.\n \n Was the \"hat taking\" just playing around and it escelated or did you really intend to keep it and not give it back and it was stealing? If you really did steal it you should probably have expected suspension.\n \n I think everyone has been clear that your parents CAN search through anything they want, but in my opinion they shouldn't unless given a cause. Of course I don't know what you keep in your backpack, the school pretty much makes it clear that they don't need much reason to search your backpack or your locker, so if I've got something I don't want people seeing, I wouldn't put it in my backpack.\n \n I'm not sure what the notes said, but I would guess your mom's reasoning was a bit like this (assuming she trusted you completely to be good):\n \n \"How could he do such a thing. He didn't learn that behavior here, I wonder who influenced him to do something like that\". She probably took it out of proportion, but she is probably doing it out of fear that you'll go down the \"wrong path\" and hang out with the \"wrong people\".\n \n Just remember, that once you violate trust, it's very hard to earn it back, but if you refrain from stealing or doing anything else wrong, soon your mom will realize that you made a mistake, and have paid the price for it.",

A choice of behavior was made. There are consequences to our choices. If parents constantly make up excuses for their childrens' behaviors they are not fulfilling their own responsibilities. Worse than that they are ENABLING their children to continue to make the wrong decisions. The best thing a parent can do is to teach their children, while they're safe at home, that all behaviors have consequences, good or bad. Cause, when children grow up and become 'responsible' adults, they're gonna know, if they were taught, simply that there are always consequences. Regardless of how badly it makes us feel.",

From what you've said it seems like you were playing around and it just happened to turn out bad, in which case I'd say a warning and maybe a short detention would be suitable.

   "I have learned that parents are right in searching though...even with you not there. It sounds bad but in time you will understand.\n\n \n Right, as I have grown older I have realized that my parents are not complete XXXXXX and that most of the time they act in my best interest. Oh yeah, that's right. They don't search my backpack without cause.\n \n If the incident involved marijuana, or something else of that nature, she would be justified in searching it (although I'm sure the school would first). I'm sure this was just a case of \"how could my sweet little _______ (sorry, don't know your name :)) go so wrong, someone must have corrupted her. I'll find out\". This is trying to act in her best interest, but ultimately failing in my opinion. Now legally, that's just my opinion and the only thing that matters is the opinion of the parents. And if you're going to search through a bag, at least let the person defend themselves. We even do that in court where someone could have murdered someone else!!!\n \n and back to the \"adults are always right, you'll understand when you're older\". That is the biggest pile of bull**** I've heard in a while. If there's one thing I've learned as I grew up (no I'm not all grown up yet, I realize that) is that parents aren't perfect. They do second-guess themselves, but ultimately they want what's best for their child. I used to think my parents were perfect. They knew where everything was in the house, what to do in any situation, what medicines to use when I was sick, etc. Now as I grow up and get to make more and more decisions for myself, I realize that parents aren't perfect, they make mistakes, and they second-guess themselves. For example my mom admitted to me that she thought about letting my little brother quit piano lessons when he screamed that he hated it, even just for her sake of not having to listen to it anymore and forcing him to play the piano. But she said she thought that in the future, he would thank her. Obviously this is a case of \"you don't understand\", but it can be explained. There's a difference between, \"here's the reason, but you won't like it\" and \"we're older and you'll understand how we're always right when you're older\".\n \n In my opinion, the parents of the original poster made a mistake. They over-reacted and thought it must have been her choice of friends. The problem though is, you're stuck, for better or worse, with the parents you have. This can't be changed, and unless they are abusing you, you have to put up with them for 4 more years (well maybe 3 plus however many months). And guess what? At that point you'll probably still need to depend on them for some things. I don't know what your plans are for after high school, but college is quite a bit of money (private colleges I've been looking at seem to be from $30,000 - $35,000. In-state state-funded colleges are a little under $10,000 a year). So unless you can come up with $40,000, you'll probably need a little help from your parents.\n \n So basically the lesson is that you should try to get along with your parents if you don't want to have several years of living hell. I don't know what your relationship is like but I would try to talk with them. Talk about how it started as a joke, but you got a little carried away (I assume that was the case). Explain how it was you who took the hat, not your friend, and you don't see why you are separated from a friend for an action that you did. See what happens, the worst thing that can happen is that she says \"that's my final word, no arguing\". Now hopefully you don't have that kind of mom, but if you do you can't really do anything about it, that's the way it is. At least she seems to let you go on the internet on your own, so that hints that maybe she's a bit understanding. Don't go complaining, go as a person and ask her to talk.\n \n \n And don't let her give you that bull**** about \"you'll understand when you're older\". I already gave you my theory, and I may be way off. But adults aren't THAT much different from kids. Yes there's a difference, but not so much that kids aren't able to understand adults. Ask her to explain why, and hopefully you can change her mind. But the real advice, is next time you think you're just playing around, think about what it must feel like to be in the other person's shoes. Would you like it if someone walked up to you and took your hat? I would think you were a bully if you did that to me, unless we were good friends. Most bullying is thought of as playing around by the person doing it, but that's not how the victim feels. I understand that you weren't thinking about that when you did it, and it just felt like harmless fun. But next time stop and think about what your actions do to other people.

And you still don't realize that you CAN'T take full responsibility. Sadly the law still remains clear that your parents are responsible for any stupid things you might do. Lets suppose this hat was signed by a world famous baseball player and was valued at $2,000. Who do you think would be paying for it had you destroyed it? Who do you think has to pay any fines had you been given a police violation? Your parents should be allowed to search your backpack for no reason whatsoever. I doubt its a good idea to make an abusive habit of this but it seems they have no reason to trust you now.",
