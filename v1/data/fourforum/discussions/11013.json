   "Is the new Clinton add, entitled \"Children\", fearmongering right out of the Rovian playbook? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M70emIFxETs I think so. \n\n \n I don't care for this Clinton commercial, but I don't think the Obama campaign is in a position to speak about Rovian plays. They've done themselves in on healthcare and who swings the punches at Hillary with them. Not to mention that the ad team doesn't equate with the coalitions a candidate builds in Congress and elsewhere. Or their record. Including record on accountability.\n \n \n\n Also unfortunately for Hillary, in a conference call today, none of her staff could come up with much of an answer to the question: \"What foreign policy moment would you point to in Hillary's career where she's been tested by crisis?\" http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/amateur_hour.php#comments \n\n \n Instead of campaign managers, they should have asked the military persons or those who've worked with her in Washington for so many years, instead. Including those who were really there, and, voted against the Iraq war (are not just talking about what they would have done if they could have). And are supporting Clinton, not Obama. I think, because they know she can deliver on the goods.\n \n Remember, too, Mr. Kerry, who supports Obama, voted for the war. I didn't see Obama dishing him on it. Nor do I see the Obama \"anti-war\" people having too many complaints about that, either. Why is Mrs. Clinton so evil, but Mr. Kerry and other Iraq War voters who endorse Obama, not?\n \n \n\n This campaign is getting painful to watch. I hope it's all over by the end of next Tuesday, with Hillary retiring graciously.\n\n \n If there's a grand slam, that may indeed be the case. Hillary has certainly demonstrated how gracious she can be. However, I hope not. I think Hillary Rodham Clinton, by far, would be a better president than Barack Hussein Obama. And would more likely defeat John Sidney McCain in November.\n \n Of course, you can see who's routing you and your candidate on, here. A McCain supporter, a long-time Clinton hater, a believer in a vast left-wing conspiracy, and an advocate for overturning R V W (with all due respect, Archangel). I hope Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, among others, see too. Good girl, JLW. Excellent post. (pat pat)\n \n That long-standing coalition alone, in this campaign, is one important reason why myself and many others won't be supporting Obama if he wins the nomination.\n \n Another 4 years in Iraq, I can live with. Along with the appointments to the Supreme Court a John Sidney McCain III would make. \n \n As I guess, for many Obama supporters, who've logged day after day, for many months, dishing Hillary Rodham Clinton again and again and again ... (and having much more to say about that, and anyone who supported Clinton, than their candidate) ... could, too.",

The fact is that these two are both Democrats with very similar positions and ideology in general. Each had to do what they could to differentiate themselves from the other in this campaign. Obama's anti-Iraq war stance is one that apparently resonates with a lot of people and is a legitimate instance of his ability to size up a situation. There were a lot of war drums beating when he made that speech, not least of which by the press. Personally, Clinton's senate vote is not that big a deal to me since as you point out, she had a lot of company.",

I think Obama has some real crossover appeal that Clinton would never have, as yes, there are a lot of long-time Republican Clinton haters around.

He simply doesn't support my views very well, in some important respects. His campaign has shown me that. Although I am in agreement with some of his presently stated positions. But there shall be other candidates who support my views better than Barack, even if they aren't as electable. In addition, I will be watching JSM further, since in some respects, as a candidate, I think he is better qualified than BHO. Although I would prefer he move on his R V W stance.\n \n It's interesting, though, because even though I knew Hillary best at the beginning -- and had likings towards John Edwards -- I initially joined the Barackian star struck and was ready to support the 1961 born Illinois senator with John Fauvian written speeches and good vocal chords. \n \n But ... the booze affect wore off quickly ... I'm a bit older and more cynical ... and have had to learn how to hold well a shot of whiskey or two in my time.\n \n Hold well ... even for a woman, that is ...\n \n Thus ....

I suspect that you're not alone in this opinion among her supporters. I was dismayed myself, because although Obama is my first choice, I will be voting for her in the general election if she is the Democratic nominee. \n\n \n I didn't care for the Obama commercial either. It's like his speeches; spin without substance. A shot of whiskey for those who don't know how to hold their liquor. Or are still learning.\n \n I understood the message Clinton's commercial was trying to get out, though. Even if it went off the roadside, technically speaking. At least, the version you shared with the music pumped up all the way.\n \n But I'm not supporting, at this point, who hired Madison Ave. (\"we have Coca Cola on our resume\") and who hired folks in such-and-such midwestern city instead. Hillary is known for sticking by her people through thick and thin, to a fault. For her, it's ever about believing in others. From the everyday average American who needs health care, child or the child's parent, to the folks who make commercials for her in hoochy-coochy land, U.S.A.\n \n The Obama campaign really played off the She Devil stereotype with her Iraq vote. But they were completely willing to overlook such flaws in those Senate persons who supported Barack, but dropped the same glass.\n \n The point is that Hillary is well supported by Congressional representatives who were there to vote against it -- and DID -- and now think she's the best candidate to get us out. Charles Rangel, Patty Murphy, Maxine Waters, are just a few examples. Stephanie Tubbs Jones ... Anti-Iraq-war, long histories on veterans' and women's issues, civil rights. Long time reps. Lots of real-time experience. These people have records and know what they're doing. They've had to work with these candidates in Congress. \n \n Obama's congressional support looks like a who's who of newcomers and those who got where they are by -- not doing their homework and years of hard work -- but just playing by the old club rules. Newcomer Claire McCaskill with her ####-eating grin behind Barack (when Barack showed his immaturity in the Senate by not shaking Hillary's hand), Watson, who can't name one legislative accomplishment .. wimpy Kerry who voted for the war and graciously and rapidly conceded in a few minutes in Ohio to Bush after black voters stood in line for 10 hours ... ready to jump on any latest bandwagon to revive his own failing popularlity ... a drunken song in Spanish by Ted Kennedy, who can no longer see the trees from the forest ... Jesse Jackson, who lost it long ago when he went to pray with Terri Shiavo's parents ... what's his name with Nation of Islam, with all walking lock step and barrel in suits to the same tune -- and the white devil finally gone, and women finally in their places ... yes quite a collection there.\n \n So let's just say, for me, personally, it's also about certain values and experience that I see as a high priority in a presidency. Perhaps even enough to vote for a McCain. I certainly don't think he's too old, like some of his other supporters, though his age will influence the emphasis on his VP choice. So we'll see how the tale unfolds ...\n \n Anyway, I try to keep hope alive. Perhaps this conversation will be moot anyway, as Hillary could still win the nomination, and then, you'll have a chance to live up to what you say and support her wholeheartedly!\n \n Sing praise to her accountability. Which any woman involved in the women's movement for so many years, well knows about. See N.O.W. endorsement as just one small example there. Or how about those old ladies? (Or did you think they were just senile? Haven't actually known Hillary for a lot of years?)\n \n BTW, this (if you missed it on another thread) is my favorite Hillary Clinton commercial:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq7k6TBgI7A\n \n From America's inheritors, without the right to vote. 10-1, at least one of those individuals has a dad who's an Iraq veteran. I heard another was covered for health care down south, through their grandmother, by way of Hillary's work. (That is, the work that Barack doesn't think belongs on a woman's resume.) Well, that's who I'm supporting. And that's what I'm supporting. Not Barack, and certainly not a campaign that tears that kind of thing down, and has, day after day for months now.\n \n Oh -- and women have been told for many, many years at the polls -- you have no choice but to take this.\n \n Well, guess what, BHO campaign.",

And Hillary is not strong there.\n\n \n I am seeing, from some posts, that you are not in the U.S. But a U.K. person. Believe me, Obama will not win nationally. And the right knows it. His campaign has been too superficially conceived, and too much in league with the further flung conservative elements (along with some of the kookier left elements, Farakhan being only one example, there).\n \n Clinton was well in front, among all candidates, Republican and Democrat when this started. That reflected more upon the public's real sentiments.\n \n But the right, and the right controlled media, have been focusing on getting rid of Clinton first, for some time -- and with the support of the more naive Obamite elements -- or just those who were never Democrats -- because they've known for some time that she is the toughest to beat. McCain himself said so, that he was the only one who could beat her, which is one major reason why so many Republicans are sending him in, even though they're not crazy about him (too close to Bush, too liberal on immigration).\n \n Nationally, though, Obama is going to get minced to pieces as a liberal. As he moves further to the right appealing to religious off-beats and sells out women, maintains \"business as usual\" on health care, etc. Thus ostracizing other key elements in the Democratic base. His political identity is just too fluid. Who is Obama, really? Sorry, but he is just a soda commercial, an image, really. Yes, he has some legitimate points in his record, but it's not enough. And this campaign has already shown it.\n \n If he had maintained a different tenor throughout, like the Clinton campaign, we might be able to say -- at this point -- if he were ahead -- he could also make it nationally. But you obviously have not lived on American soil through too many elections.\n \n For when a Democrat goes door to door, telling Ohio and Texans \"Clinton will take away your wages for socialized medicine\" -- the way the NRA went door to door down south telling Democrats \"Al Gore will take away your guns\", you've got someone who won't win, nationally. (Not to mention, shouldn't.) And especially when there are other electability issues.\n \n From the beginning, all Clinton has asked is that you take a look at her record and experience on the issues. \n \n JSM will say something quite similar. And Americans, of record and experience themselves, will be listening.\n \n They will not subscribe to a candidate who is asking them to have a psychological gestalt, to \"rid themselves of their cynicism\", or accuses people who don't walk to the same drummer, of being unwilling to be \"unified\" as Americans. Among other tactics...\n \n There aren't that many twenty-somethings Americans whose parents already have a decent health care plan, paid for, by an employer. And who are tired about hearing about JFK, want to really LIVE IT.\n \n Well, guess what ...",

   "CUNxTime,\n \n (1) You act as if Hillary Clinton has no political identity of her own, and separate from her husband;\n\n \n No, that is not what I'm saying. In fact, according to some things I've read, Bill's people and Hill's people don't get along. I don't think she's got anything to do with her husband's affairs/assaults. However, I do believe that she's help cover up for Bill and destroy some of his accusers. It's another aspect of her personality that scares me. She doesn't care what her husband does, except for the damage it can do to her. It shows a blatant lack of emotion and a totality of ambition. Scary. That's her PERSONALITY.\n Her political views are even scarier. She's a socialist, determined to start a class war to further her political aims. She wants to seize control of business to add to her power and turn the lower classes of the country into wards of the state who will perpetually vote her and her cronies into office.\n \n \n \n(2) The Ken Starr business, to me, reflects more upon abuse of power in government, and, the lengths to which Republicans were willing go in fighting what was one of our better administrations;\n\n \n I don't care about his BJ and I didn't care then. However, he did purger himself, but what the Reps did seemed a bit desperate and self-serving. Have they done illegal things? Yes, and they got away with it. I think that is why the Reps went after him so hard on the BJ (no pun) I didn't really agree with it then, and don't now. I do understand where it came from though and he did commit perjury which is an offense that can potentially lead to impeachment. It did show him for a lier and a manipulator (what is is?)\n \n \n(3) Corruption is rampant in the publishing industry, and just because someone makes a million dollars saying that Bill Clinton grabbed them, doesn't mean it happened. Especially when you consider the lengths to which Republicans have been wiling to go. And how much money the tale-teller is being paid to tell it.\n\n \n Again, where there's smoke there's fire, and where there's FIRE there damn well is FIRE! He did use the state police to hustle his women. He is a womanizer (his own supporters even joke about it, but Hillary doesn't care, as long as she gets her power) and he's damaged countless women's lives. He doesn't care because he's a narcissist. Did any one of the accusers lie about Clinton? Perhaps. Did they ALL? Hell, no!\n \n \n \n \n(4) Do you think McCain had an affair with that lobbyist?\n\n \n No, I don't think he did. Could he have? Yes. But I trust his integrity a bit more than 'slick Willy' who's slept with more black women than Obama! \n \n \n \n(5) Are you concerned about real cases of sexual harassment, such as Republicans going after underage male interns?\n\n \n I think sexual harassment by ANYONE is wrong and they should be chased out of the party and their office. Like the Reps do. The Dems, you can run a gay escort service out of your apartment and Rape a page and get a standing ovation. Do I care what people do on their own time? Not at all Dem or Rep, gay or straight. I never cared about the BJ either, like I said earlier.\n \n \n(6) Did you hear about that madam's list of clients in Washington politics ... and what they use their tax-payer based salaries on?\n\n \n Again, I don't care what consenting adults, Dem or Pub, gay or straight do. I do care about a power hungry megalomaniac. I can't believe you don't see ANY of this. It's beyond me, how you purposely blind yourself to these things. I don't think you can believe anything Hillary says other than in as much as it can increase her power and glory.\n \n \n \n(7) Did you ever read the Salon article about Ted Kennedy's exploits? The man supporting Obama, that is.\n\n \n Yes, I think he's a nut, a drunk, and possible a manslaughter (I don't think he killed her on purpose, but he did run and who knows if she could have been saved). Also, I don't like Obama's Preacher (racist) and Farrakhan or the guy who bombed the pentagon!\n \n \n\n (8) Do you really think we should believe everything we read about anyone?\n\n \n Not at all. But when its the same thing over and over, what then? Also, if you listen to Dick Morris and others who knew/know her, you her what kind of a CUNxTime she is!\n \n \n \n(9) Even if we believe anything, how important is it ... given the magnitude of certain issues facing the United States and the rest of the world?\n\n Again, even if I agreed with the things she pays lip service to, I maintain that she'll do or say anything for power's sake and not because she's a sweet, caring person. This I know!\n \n \n \n(10) Even if we believe it, do politicians have Constitutional rights to privacy?\n[/QUOTE]\n \n I think, again, people (politicians or other wise) should do whatever they want unless it hurts someone else. They should probably attempt to be a good role model but even that's not their job. I'm SUPER liberal on social issues, so a lot of that stuff doesn't matter to me. Have a good time, see if I care. Still, rape is rape. Hillary's famous temper tantrums are a window into her soul. Don't trust her, she doesn't love you. She thinks you are a 'useful idiot'.",

Do you know how much money she takes from the pharmaceuticals, health and defense industries?\n\n \n Again, I think she'd say or not say anything or take or not take money (Chi-coms) or do or not do anything in order to further her power. Her talk of nationalizing health care, 'doing something about' the credit card companies, seize profits all sound rather socialist to me. And these are just what she says out loud.\n \n \nThat's simply not true. People make money telling these stories\n. \n \n I don't think the ALL made money (especially the earlier ones) certainly Monica didn't do it for the money and she was a 21 year old girl. You can't tell me that a 50 year old man, in the ultimate position of power, should be taking advantage of their position with 21 year old interns!

Again, I don't care much about who he has or hasn't boinked. I've dated black girls (2), I'm married to a Mexican, and I was married to a Moroccan Muslim. I don't care about interracial relationships, or Gay ones (no I haven't) or really even about an affair (no I haven't) in as much as it effects my views on someone's politics. But it does allow us to make some value judgments about both Bill and Hill.\n \n \nThen why do you keep referencing it? And particularly to disparage others?\n\n \n You mentioned the Gay page stuff, not me. Again, what consenting adults do, Dem or Pub, doesn't bother me. I don't care if they did drugs, inhaled or not, or if they are gay or straight. Its what someone believes and what they want for the country that's important.

I'm the polar opposite (on govt. issues, tho I'm sure not with Social issues) of Clinton, regardless of anything else. The 'anything elses' though, are numerous and I don't see how anyone could really trust her. Especially if you listen to what the people from the Clinton admn. say. You're free to do as you please, of course. I just think that you are purposely tricking yourself when it comes to her. If you think you agree with her VIEWS, that's fine.

They were clearly both consenting adults, even if she was young.\n \n \n\n Neither do I, I'll never believe (and I wouldn't even if the Clintons were my best friends) that he didn't fool around with SOME of them and furthermore, I think at least some of the incidents were forced. \n\n \n Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he had \"a problem\" there. As to forcing people, I don't know. It's possible. The problem with these stories, as ever, is that it's just one person's word, there's no other evidence, and, the lengths to which Republicans were willing to go to find them -- I mean, 40 million dollars of taxpayer money to dig up Monica's souvenir dress? And then, get Bill to lie about it under oath? C'mon. Clearly these are folks willing to say anything themselves!\n \n Ken Starr's unbridled bible-beating power was a mistake the Democrats made coming back to haunt them. \n \n But we don't need sexual witch hunts anywhere in America, let alone in Washington. \n \n \nI don't care about interracial relationships, or Gay ones (no I haven't) or really even about an affair (no I haven't) in as much as it effects my views on someone's politics. But it does allow us to make some value judgments about both Bill and Hill. \n\n \n Such as what? If you were working with someone and thought they did an excellent job, and then, found out they were having an extra-marital affair, would it suddenly change the quality of their excellent work? \n \n What if you were working with someone, and then found out their spouse was having an extra-marital affair? Would that suddenly change the quality of their excellent work? Why should it even be any of your business?\n \n \n It's almost like your sticking your fingers in your ears anytime something comes up about the Clintons, which is often, and saying, \"I can't hear you I can't hear you!\" You have no problem with the things people say about the Pubs (which are probably true as well) but every time someone says something about your people, they're \"just in it for the money.\" You say it over and over, do you really believe that, still? \n\n \n Of course I believe it. Look, people will do all kinds of things for money. Especially lie about famous people -- like President Clinton -- telling them he's been watching them from afar, and has been waiting for months for this moment alone between the two of them! Just can't stop himself because she is so attractive! At the same time, obviously the man has some issues. So I don't know what you think I'm putting my fingers in my ears about. I just have better things to do with my time than sit down and read some of these books. Life is short, CU. And there is so much better literature out there. Also, I certainly do have a similar attitude when people say stories about Republicans. For example, I said earlier that I don't simply accept the story about John McCain, either. Politics is a dirty business. Perhaps it is you who needs to take your fingers out of your ears -- and hear that. Sexual witch hunts are an old thing among human beings. Ever read \"The Scarlet Letter\"?\n \n \nI'm just saying that you should really ask yourself if you REALLY know what those views are. \n\n \n My reservations about Hillary are more towards the amount of money candidates these days take from various industries. That, of course, was part of John Edwards' war cry. At the same time, she has an excellent record, and, she is an extremely intelligent and creative politician. Perhaps Hillary will make those contributions work to the advantage of the American people and what they want, instead. \n \n \n\n You know we disagree on who to support for president, but the TRUST thing is important. How do you know what you're really supporting?\n\n \n Well, how do you know that about anyone, unless you have a personal relationship with them yourself? That's why I just focus on the record and past behavior, in order to make predictions about their future behavior under various sets of circumstances. And I try to avoid flawed conclusions drawn from questionable stories about behavior unrelated to job performance.\n \n You know, there is a beautiful old story from the Muslim holy book, the Qu'ran, actually. About a group of people who made up a lie about two other persons having an affair. The point of the parable is that it is sin -- not just to have an affair -- but to tell tales about others doing so. That is why, the story concludes that you must have 3 or 4 direct witnesses to the sinful act between the man and the woman before even beginning to talk about. Of course, it's virtually impossible to find two people doing the hoochy coochy with 3 or 4 others watching. So the tale, in a sense, is saying, let's mind our business and get on with our own lives, then.\n \n I think our nation should be looking more at ourselves in that regard, than pointing the finger so easily, at others. That is, why are we so interested in what is going on in the bedrooms of others?\n \n Unless it's underage persons, or there is evidence of sexual harassment -- and this requires making a formal record and report -- going through certain channels of authority -- not signing a book contract -- and then being paid by a Republican host to talk about it on the air -- well, then, I don't think there's anything to go on.\n \n Let's say I'm fine living in the healthy world of skepticism, where we don't have all the answers we'd sometimes like.",

That is one area the Obama campaign in their zeal cannot legitimately take away from her.\n \n If you are at all familiar with Hillary Rodham Clinton's 35 years of experience, you would be quite clear that she would NOT have been confused about the issues, and would have unhesitatingly voted so that that one doesn't have to apologize for it, later. \n \n Not to mention that, when it comes to judicial appointments, she is far more qualified than Barack Hussein Obama.

   "Well, I have already explained why I won't be supporting Obama. He simply doesn't support my views very well, in some important respects. His campaign has shown me that. Although I am in agreement with some of his presently stated positions. But there shall be other candidates who support my views better than Barack, even if they aren't as electable. In addition, I will be watching JSM further, since in some respects, as a candidate, I think he is better qualified than BHO. Although I would prefer he move on his R V W stance.\n \n It's interesting, though, because even though I knew Hillary best at the beginning -- and had likings towards John Edwards -- I initially joined the Barackian star struck and was ready to support the 1961 born Illinois senator with John Fauvian written speeches and good vocal chords. \n\n \n Hmm...sounds like you're the fickle type. I started out the campaign thinking the top 3 were all good candidates and since my state (MI) saw fit to disenfranchise us, I didn't feel like I had to make up my mind. Obama winning lily-white Iowa got my attention and then Clinton winning N.H. certainly made it interesting. I decided on Obama after S. Carolina. \n \n \nThus .... I returned to the tried and true. Although I was still, at that point, willing to support Barack if he won the nomination.\n \n But I've been watching this show every day, for months now, on the internet, and I don't think the BHO fan club gave one hoot about women's rights, 4 more years in Iraq, or Republican nominees to the Supreme Court.\n \n So I say, may you (and perhaps not you, personally) all live and learn. Take note of the history behind you. Maybe live some of it for yourselves with our new court. And fight for it now on your own.\n \n See who you were tearing apart in the Obama Mania campaign.\n \n Good luck! Have fun with the far right your leader managed to unify you with!\n ;)\n\n \n I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why anyone who cares about the Democratic vs Republican ISSUES would be content with sitting back and not voting in such a negative stance of \"Hey, you made your bed, now lie in it\" because it's not all about us and \"our\" candidate. It really is about the direction of the country, imo. I have my reasons for preferring Obama, but since Hillary and his positions on all the issues are so similar, I also don't have a problem with supporting Clinton if she becomes the nominee. Your attitude sounds more like the \"cult of personality\" that the press is fond of pushing about Obama than a fully reasoned position, as if Hillary had been entitled to the nomination and Obama thwarted her rightful place. Politics doesn't work like that. He's been talking to the people and getting more votes. It's that simple.",

Carolina. \n \n \n \n I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why anyone who cares about the Democratic vs Republican ISSUES would be content with sitting back and not voting in such a negative stance of \"Hey, you made your bed, now lie in it\" because it's not all about us and \"our\" candidate. It really is about the direction of the country, imo. I have my reasons for preferring Obama, but since Hillary and his positions on all the issues are so similar, I also don't have a problem with supporting Clinton if she becomes the nominee. Your attitude sounds more like the \"cult of personality\" that the press is fond of pushing about Obama than a fully reasoned position, as if Hillary had been entitled to the nomination and Obama thwarted her rightful place. Politics doesn't work like that. He's been talking to the people and getting more votes. It's that simple.\n\n \n Who said I wasn't voting? You seem to think I don't have much choice.

He is in favor of repealing it completely, unlike Mrs. Clinton who would only repeal part.\n \n Obama: I am a strong supporter of full civil unions that give same-sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married couples, including the right to assist their loved ones in times of emergency as well as equal health insurance, employment benefits and property and adoption rights. I also believe we need to fully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and enact legislation that would ensure that the more than 1,100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same-sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions.  http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/5581823.html\n \n Also unlike Hillary, who to my knowledge is not known for supporting gay rights in front of audiences who may not be receptive to them, Obama has spoken up when he didn't need to. His speech for MLK Jr Day at the Ebenezeer Baptist Church, for instance. \n \n \"And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved community. \n \n We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them.

   "Clinton's long time commitment to health care is quite clear. Along with her deep familiarity with the issue and her ability to get so many children covered through spearheading children's health programs at many levels. So, the fact that other Democrats weren't brave enough to stand beside her when the issue wasn't as popular is no discredit to her, but to them, instead. And only speaks more loudly to her courage and record as a groundbreaker. To state otherwise, as a Democratic voter, is simply disingenuous, and, an attack on the effort to bring about health care reform itself. In addition, as discussed by Paul Krugman, economist and professor at Princeton University, her health care proposal, virtually the same as John Edwards', is vastly superior to Obama's (see articles in other threads here). With Obama, who also supports mandates -- but for children -- and in a context that will drive costs up higher -- it shall be business as usual for Americans as the rolls of the non-insured and non-cared-for continue to rise. Including, for the parents of the children who need to be cared by their family members. Barack Obama is out-of-touch with the lives of everyday Americans. And out of his league on this issue. Hillary Clinton is not.\n \n National Organization for Women has endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton, who's position on not only health care, but women's right to choose, has been unfailing for 35 years. Obama's position on choice, and understanding of the Constitutional issues, is indeed questionable, as demonstrated by his disgraceful Republican vote on Terri Shiavo, his campaign's willingness to join hands with the far right in support of the fanatical anti-Constitutional Ken Starr, and his series of absences or simply \"present\" votes, but not a straightforward \"no\", to anti-choice bills in Illinois. Not to mention his campaign's underhanded tactics against women voters, parents, and their rights as American citizens to show up and cast ballots, and at caucuses across this country. \n \n Mrs. Clinton is supported by many reputable long-time Senators who have worked with her for years in Congress and even back to her days in Arkansas as First Lady. Their roster includes long time Civil Rights champions, women and children's right's champions, environmental activists, human rights activists, anti-Iraq war voters, and voices for veterans, among others. They know Hillary Rodham Clinton, her commitment and her ability to build coalitions, work with others, and get the job done. Mrs. Clinton's commitment to the Jewish community has also been unfailing and unblemished.\n \n On gay rights. Here is what one Illinois person said about BHO's position on DOMA, and, Mr. Obama's series of absences and otherwise \"present\" votes:\n \n I appreciate your thoughtful approach in supporting Senator Obama. That said, for many gay men and lesbians who live in Illinois, his \"conversion\" to a ardent supporter of gay and lesbian rights is just that. Yes, he opposed DOMA, but initally declared when he ran for the U.S. Senate that he wasn't in favor of repealing it. More important, Illinois became only the 13th state to amend its Human Rights law to protect gays, lesbians and transgendered people. Although state senator Obama signed on to many attempts to amend the law, the main roadblock for years was conservative black pastors who kept the black caucus from voting in favor of the amendment (with their votes, it would have passed in even the once republican controlled senate). Senator Obama played no role in reaching out to those pastors to try to change their opinions. Indeed, the law was amended AFTER Senator Obama left the Illinois Senate, and it was Jesse Jackson, Jr., who played the key role in neutralizing the opposition of conservative black pastors.\n \n As with his record of \"present\" and absent votes on other progressive issues in the Illinois legislature, Senator Obama's history of words not matching actions can be troubling.\n \n http://citizenchris.typepad.com/citizenchris/2007/11/the-obama-hilla.html\n \n Here's some discussion from 6/07 (when the Human Rights Campaign questionnaires were released) on Hillary's position, including a key discussion with Jo Solmonese (HRC President), who \"credited Mrs. Clinton as a strategic force for defeating\" the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2006:\n \n http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/06/19/1\n \n And here was your 104th Congress, 2nd Session, in action in 1996:\n \n http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&session=2&vote=00280",

He is an unknown. \n \n I think many voters have projected onto Obama what they want him to be, precisely because his rhetoric is inspiring but vague. People can imagine him to be the ideal President. But no one can live up to those unrealistic expectations. How is he going to bring together people who fundamentally disagree on significant issues? He is going to have to take positions on divisive isses, and people are bound to be disappointed whatever he does. John Kennedy was young and inexperienced, and he made a lot of mistakes and was not a very effective President. Bill Clinton was young, and while he had experience as a governor, he still made youthful mistakes as President. The Bill Clinton White House was something of a disorganized disaster that first year. \n \n I will vote for Obama reluctantly if he gets the nomination. I will do so with concern about his inexperience. I hope Hillary Clinton gets the nomination. She will be the more effective leader, in my view. I will certainly vote for the Democratic nominee over John McCain, whoever that nominee is, because I disagree strongly with McCain on many significant issues.",

   " Obama is okay, but he lacks experience. I don't trust that he has the wisdom to be a great President, to make hard decisions. He makes nice flowery speeches that lack substance, and I don't see any proven track record there. \n\n \n I'm really disappointed to see you make that tired charge that he \"makes flowery speeches that lack substance\". Haven't you heard? ;) He got the message of the press demanding specifics and he started providing specifics. They even reported about it. It's not that hard to rattle off a list of \"what I will dos\". Personally, I am not swayed by \"what I will dos\" so much. Their health care plans, for instance, are unlikely to be passed in any semblance of their originals so I think the debate about such details of how-to-enforce universal mandates versus partial mandates isn't very significant. \n \n What investigation have you done of Senator Obama to conclude that he doesn't have \"any proven track record\"? Have you looked him up on http://votesmart.org/index.htm for instance? It's pretty thorough. His astrological sign is Leo and one of his favorite books is the Autobiography of Malcom X ... oh, and yes, there are also position papers, votes and legislation to review, as well. \n \n Then there's http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400629.\n \n Statistics: Barack Obama has sponsored 129 bills since Jan 4, 2005, of which 120 haven't made it out of committee (Poor) and 1 were successfully enacted (Average, relative to peers). Obama has co-sponsored 551 bills during the same time period (Average, relative to peers). \n \n Senator Obama is categorized as a \"rank and file\" Democrat by that site's analysis. \n \n Statistics: Hillary Clinton has sponsored 354 bills since Jan 22, 2001, of which 307 haven't made it out of committee (Extremely Poor) and 2 were successfully enacted (Average, relative to peers). Clinton has co-sponsored 1728 bills during the same time period (Average, relative to peers). \n \n Senator Clinton is categorized as a \"radical\" Democrat.\n \n What were the \"successfully enacted\" bills by Mrs. Clinton? \n \n Also, see the entries in Wikipedia, which I assume have been vetted if not written by the campaigns, and you'll see primarily a list of Hillary's votes on various issues. \n \n An excerpt from Obama's:\n \n \"Partnering first with Sen. Dick Lugar (R-IN), and then with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), Obama successfully introduced two initiatives bearing his name. \"Lugar-Obama\" expands the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons, including shoulder-fired missiles and anti-personnel mines.[61] The \"Coburn-Obama Transparency Act\" provides for the web site USAspending.gov, managed by the Office of Management and Budget. The site lists all organizations receiving Federal funds from 2007 onward and provides breakdowns by the agency allocating the funds, the dollar amount given, and the purpose of the grant or contract.[62] In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the \"Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act,\" marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[63]\" \n \n I don't know jack about the Congo, but the other two bills reflect issues that I think are important and I'm pleased that he teamed up with Republicans on them, substantiating his ability to work cooperatively. \n \n By contrast, I already knew that Mrs. Clinton co-sponsored an anti-flat burning bill - which I don't agree with -- and her Wikipedia entry says, \"Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games.\" Another free speech issue apparently. It doesn't say if it passed or not. \n \n If she has more substantive accomplishments, I'm surprised they're not on her Wikipedia entry. \n \n But just how important are their Senate records? (McCain beats them both hands down with 12 bills succesfully enacted). It's very difficult to get anything through Congress obviously. Sometimes bills morph from one thing to another so it's extremely difficult, I've found, to track this information in a meaningful fashion. \n \n But I am satisified with what Senator Obama has accomplished in the U.S. under the circumstances. (After reading some of this stuff, I came away with an appreciation for the complexity of the process and how hard it would be for a single junior senator to make a major impact.) \n \n This column by a former state senator discusses his appreciation of some of Senator Obama's state senate accomplishments, and more importantly, how he went about it. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303303.html\n \n Even Republicans came to respect him. One Republican state senator, Kirk Dillard, has said that \"Barack had a way both intellectually and in demeanor that defused skeptics.\" \n \n That's one reason why I support him -- because I think he has an effective personality type and the people skills to move things along with the opposition. I found it fascinating, for instance, to read of a description of how he operated as President of The Harvard Law Review. \n \n He proved deft at navigating an institution scorched with ideological battles, many of which revolved around race. He developed a leadership style based more on furthering consensus than on imposing his own ideas. Surrounded by students who enjoyed the sound of their own voices, Mr. Obama cast himself as an eager listener, sometimes giving warring classmates the impression that he agreed with all of them at once. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/us/politics/28obama.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/H/Harvard%20University\n \n I think a style like that is just what we need right now and I believe he does have the experience, wisdom, substance and proven track record necessary to be President. I believe he also represents an opportunity to turn a much needed corner on the past and its partisan awfulness. Your perception varies obviously and I'm not trying to win you over -- just pointing out that there is plenty of \"there\" there for some of us who have looked. We don't need to \"wake up\" to Hillary Clinton's brilliance as a potential president.",

If he's not fit to be president, should he be vice-president on her own ticket?\n \n What hard questions that haven't been already been asked of Senator Obama would you like to see? \n \n Here's a Q&A: http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/5581823.html, He and Senator Clinton's answers are fairly comparable. \n \n Here's another Q&A, this time on executive power. http://boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/22/candidates_on_executive_power_a_full_spectrum/ Again, their answers are similar, except that Mrs. Clinton won't say who her legal advisors are but Obama does.\n \n Senator Obama also sat down with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which did then endorse him, saying: \n \n The Obama campaign has been derisively and incorrectly described as more rock tour than political campaign and his supporters as more starry-eyed groupies than thoughtful voters.\n \n If detractors in either party want to continue characterizing the Obama campaign this way, they will have seriously underestimated both the electorate's hunger for meaningful change in how the nation is governed and the candidate himself.\n \n In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Editorial Board on Wednesday, the first-term senator proved himself adept at detail and vision. They are not mutually exclusive.\n \n Maybe you can find your question here: http://video.ap.org/v/Legacy.aspx?partner=en-ap&t=m1202927630341&ns=WIMIL_Gallery&p=barack_obama&f=WIMIL They asked him about Iraq, trade, affirmative action, race, school choice, his record. I would invite anyone who thinks he's a lightweight and not a serious, thoughtful man conversant with those issues, to view those videos. \n \n \n Hillary Clinton has been subjected to sexism that is just offensive. No one dares to make racist comments about Obama, but apparently many white men think it's open season on Hillary Clinton, and no one calls them on their sexism. It's time for women, and men of good conscience, to say no more of that. (Barack Obama has never done this, to his credit. He has always been respectful toward his opponent.) \n\n \n I agree that the sexism Mrs. Clinton has been subjected to has been offensive. But \"no one calls them on it\"? I'd have to disagree on that. Plenty of people have been calling them on it, which has been good to see. Chris Matthews was even pressured into apologizing, was he not? (I don't get the news cable channels myself.)\n \n I'm sure that there are men who won't vote for Clinton just as there are racists who won't vote for a black man. In fact, The Nation ran a piece recently quoting some Ohioans who said they wouldn't vote for \"the nigger\". http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080317/wypijewski Revolting, isn't it. I guess I'm \"ageist\" myself, because I think McCain is too old.\n \n I am disappointed that Obama didn't win more last night, not least of which because this campaign has turned me into a political junkie! emoticon_frazzled My stupid state is one of the \"disenfranchised ones\". The most exciting primary in my voting lifetime -- which started with George McGovern, incidentally -- and we had a sham of a primary. Which is another peeve I have with Hillary Clinton: \n \n In an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio last fall, Clinton explained why she was the only candidate who did not agree to New Hampshire's request that she take her name off the ballot in Michigan. \n \n \"It's clear: This election they're having is not going to count for anything. I personally did not think it made any difference whether or not my name was on the ballot,\" she said. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19188859\n \n But NOW she wants the votes to count. \n \n If she's the nominee, I will vote for her like the concerned Democrat I am, even if I have to hold my nose like I did for her husband, UNLESS she gets the nomination by getting my own damn state's \"not going to count\" primary votes, which I consider dirty pool. I'd rather we are disenfranchised, which is what we were told we were when the primary was held without Obama or Edward's name on the ballot.  And yet, she thinks the people have spoken? I'd like to meet that fellow named \"Uncommitted\". Now there's some potential for an SNL skit.",

I personally did not think it made any difference whether or not my name was on the ballot,\" she said. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19188859\n \n But NOW she wants the votes to count. \n \n If she's the nominee, I will vote for her like the concerned Democrat I am, even if I have to hold my nose like I did for her husband, UNLESS she gets the nomination by getting my own damn state's \"not going to count\" primary votes, which I consider dirty pool. I'd rather we are disenfranchised, which is what we were told we were when the primary was held without Obama or Edward's name on the ballot.  And yet, she thinks the people have spoken? I'd like to meet that fellow named \"Uncommitted\". Now there's some potential for an SNL skit.\n\n \n There's a lot in your post, and I don't have the time tonight to respond to most of it. I will say that I'm sorry you are in a state where your votes don't count. I heard an interview with Howard Dean this evening, and he was explaining the situation. He said the rules cannot and will not be changed in the middle of the game, because that would not be fair. And that seems right. The interviewer asked him if there is a chance that Florida and Michigan could still come up with a new way to choose delegates, and he said yes, that's possible and it is within the rules. Whether that will happen, though, is not at all clear.",

I saw how much such a win could mean for so many women in the United States and elsewhere around the world.\n \n Here is an interesting commercial that appears to be from the Obama camp, but frankly, I am rather stunned that they'd put such a piece on the air about another Democrat.

   "After Obama's strong showing on Super Tuesday, which was supposed to be the day that Clinton wrapped things up following the media's dutifully reporting of her self-proclaimed inevitable status for months, they pounced on Obama. Suddenly his followers were part of a cult and not just any old cult either, but a \"Helter Skelterish cult\" according to ABC's Jake Tapper. As if he's Charles Manson!! What did Tina Fey make of that particular bit of media coddling, do you suppose. \n \n I think Senator Clinton has been treated with a lot of respect and has been taken extremely seriously, especially compared to previous women running for President.

My state has a female governor and I don't know a damn thing about her husband, which is the point.

I won't support a candidate whose campaign has shut so many people up, including women, and, is crying like the right wing, \"socialized medicine!\", \"Stalin!\", or, so many versions of the n word and stereotyping for women, or, is attacking this:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/03/01/us/0301-CAMPAIGN_7.html\n \n Which side are you on, bhbcu64?",

   "It's actually conservatives who think of government as a separate entity, that's why they're so scared of it. In a democratic society the government is simply the exercise of the collective will of the people.\n \n \n In theory perhaps. Benjamin Franklin offers an instructive lesson on reality:\n \"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\" \n When the majority discover that they can levy taxes upon the minority as a means to achieve money or services you have a gubment that should rightly be feared. \n In a 2004 paper presented to the American Statistical Association, IRS economists Michael Strudler and Tom Petska calculated percentiles data that included both income taxes and Social Security taxes. In 1999, the top 1 percent paid 23.3 percent of combined payroll and income taxes, the top 10 percent paid 52.2 percent, and the top 20 percent paid 68.2 percent.\n \n In recent years, a number of foreign countries have also started publishing tax-share data. They show the same trend of higher and higher burdens on the wealthy even when tax rates are cut sharply.\n \n For example, according to Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs, the share of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers was 11 percent in the United Kingdom in 1979, when the top income-tax rate was 83 percent. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cut that rate to 60 percent and by 1987 the share of income taxes paid by the top 1 percent had risen to 14 percent. The top rate was cut again to 40 percent, where it still stands, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 1 percent continued rising to a current level of 21 percent.\n Source: http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200512070900.asp\n \n Or as Wikipedia, that flawless source of stats notes:\n According to a 2007 report by the Statistics of Income division of the Internal Revenue Service,[6] in 2006 the Internal Revenue Service received 134,372,678 individual income tax returns, of which 90,593,081 (67.42%) showed that they paid or owed federal income tax for 2005. That is, 32.58% of those Americans who filed income tax returns did not owe any federal income tax at all for 2005.\n In 2001, U.S. Representative (now Senator) Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) told The New Yorker:\n \"I think we've got a major crisis in democracy... We assume that voters will restrain the growth of government because it becomes burdensome to them personally. But today fewer and fewer people pay taxes, and more and more are dependent on government, so the politician who promises the most from government is likely to win. Every day, the Republican Party is losing constituents, because every day more people can vote themselves more benefits without paying for it. The tax code will destroy democracy, by putting us in a position where most voters don't pay for government.\"",

   "CUNxTime, could you define the following terms:\n \n Equal Opportunity\n\n \n Forgive me if I am being obtuse, but what is the point of the question? Even if ye grant that all human beings are born equal so what? Would that not be rather like saying all runners are equal before the start of the race? \n \n If by equal ye mean some even predisposition, I believe that this is not genetically the case. I can prove this theory by going to the beach and getting a sun burn wheras your melanin savings account may allow ye free rein in the sun. There are any number of genetic tests which would this unequality. The midget will never dunk on Karl Malone, I'm sorry to tell ye.\n \n If by equal ye mean some infinite strand of probablilities for success based on environment, random chance, etc, you would be hard pressed to guarantee environmental equality. \n \n Once a child moves from the amniotic environment and is placed on mum's lap, the inequality begins. The parents of one child are PhDs, while the parents of the other are fascinated by shiny objects. It does not take Adam Smith to determine an unbalanced equation. \n \n I hesitate to mention also the ramifications abortion brings to the equation. We really have no way of knowing if the next Einstein met a rather premature fate due to an unfortunate roll of the parental dice. So we have determined that not all pregnancies are equal, viz a viz abortion, mortality rates, etc...\n \n And yet, traveling back, and taking stock of the genetic material the parents bring we find that even conception is unequal. If your ancestors were rather slow and dimwitted, chances are they became Sabre tooth lunch before having the opportunity to develop the unique genetic pattern that would someday become ye. That being said, there are a number of people I have met in my travels who suggest that perhaps the sabre tooth's were not perfect hunters after all as apparently some rather slow dim-witted proto-folks survived. \n \n Fast forward through the ages and we find ourselves with no natural predation with the attendant increased survival rates of genetic traits that would normally be disposed by predation. As the gene pool broadens, there are progressively larger deviations from the standard. These standard deviants are, by nature, by definition, unequal. There is nothing unnatural about it. \n \n But the question remains: Should all people, regardless of ability be treated equally? This question has been answered for generations on the playgrounds of America by the adherents of the game Dodge Ball. Whether the predator is a sabre tooth or a round rubber ball, nature is a cruel judge of equality.\n \n So then, equality is not genetic, it is not mathematical, it is not natural. In theory, the only place we observe attempted equality is in society. But not all societies are equal. Society itself is replete with examples of inequality. The male teenager pays higher insurance rates than the mother of 2. The person with the low credit score receives a different interest rate than the high score holder. Inequality is just as easily self assigned as it is conferred by the society. The individual's decision making process has wide ranging implications on how that individual is adjudged by society. Is the fool and the wise man judged equally? Should they be?\n \n Equality as a societal value would appear to be a rather recent invention. The pyramids, the Great Wall of China, the American railroads; these enterprises were not constructed by a group of peers. As our own notions of equality evolve, we find ourselves in continual conflict over what constitutes equality. Why should A equal B? What is the logic? What is the value? In large part this discussion involves two parties, the one - an actual or professed lesser, the other - an actual or professed greater. The former has a natural desire to elevate where the latter sees only denegration of the self in according equality to another. \n \n As a society, we profess to value equality. At the same time, the profusion of media offerings on the \"top 100\" this or \"Worlds most___\" that, testify that in reality, it is a natural inclination to rank and to assign position to ones self and one's peers. It is not enough to know our credit score, we want to know where that score ranks in society. What percentage of the population has a higher IQ? How does the MAJORITY feel about X issue. As a social animal, it is in our nature to determine our place in society, to not settle for equality but rather strive to be the alpha. To be perfectly cynical, I believe that it is best for the individual to APPEAR to care about equality, while in reality, working to strengthen and advance one's position. Who among you when asking for a raise has ever asked the boss to ensure that the raise is the same as the one for everyone else?\n \n Equality then appears to be nothing more than some unreachable ideal, like pi calculated out to infinity. We may not reach equality, but we can try to shrink the bell curve.\n \n Now that should get someone upset.",

Being forced to play russian roulette in order to get an education is not equality of opportunity by any measure.\n\n \n He wasn't saying that was the ONLY way, just that it's always A way. There's always scholarships (which are weighted to be more available to the 'less fortunate'), grants, loans, work/study, and other jobs that pay for school. Generally, anyone who really works their but off and stays out of trouble can get a good education. There will always be people who start off with more, but again, that doesn't matter. Just because someone else has more money than you doesn't mean you can't attain what you want. It's up to each of us to do the best with what we have. Some people start with nothing and end up on top, others start on top and lose it all. It's what you do that counts.",

Yes, there are some exceptions, like McCain, and like Prince Harry in the UK, who join up for reasons of tradition, but the vast majority of the US armed forces are drawn from the ranks of those who have to choose between a McDonald's uniform and a marine uniform - 2/3 of recruits come from families with incomes below the median.

Don't they have so folks over there? \n \n But anyway, our Army has been all volunteer since the 1970's. Nobody is there that didn't choose to go. Also, the demographics of our military are far above the 'average' citizen. They're not a bunch of bullet hoses anymore. (Not that I agree totally with NCLB, education was my major at SSU, and I don't 100% think learning to test= good education). Recruiters don't kidnap kids in the night, the parents have to agree and I think you'd find many reenlist thus calling into question your theory that there isn't real choice.\n \n Check out the link which I found after I wrote this, it confirms you are wrong about the makeup of the Military.\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/NationalSecurity/cda05-08.cfm\n In summary, we found that, on average, 1999 recruits were more highly educated than the equiv#alent general population, more rural and less urban in origin, and of similar income status. We did not find evidence of minority racial exploitation (by race or by race-weighted ZIP code areas). We did find evidence of a ?Southern military tradition? in that some states, notably in the South and West, provide a much higher proportion of enlisted troops by population.",

Jimmy Carter was a volunteer who served on a nuclear submarine. Again your generalizations are stupefying. Your assertion that the military service of all Congressmen was due to conscription is absurd, patently false, and laughable:\n Daniel Patrick Inouye (D) Hawaii. ENLISTED. WWII Medal of Honor\n Chuck Hagel (R) Nebraska. ENLISTED. Served as a squad leader, Vietnam. \n Ron Paul (R). Flight Surgeon (Were flight surgeons poor draftees?)\n Fritz Hollings (D) Graduate of the SC Military Academy. People are not drafted into the military academies.\n John Kerry (D) ENLISTED, Naval Reserve. Graduate of Yale (!)\n Patrick Murphy, D-PA - ENLISTED U.S. Army from 1993-2004; earned Bronze Star\n \n Etc etc, literally, etc.....\n \nthe vast majority of the US armed forces are drawn from the ranks of those who have to choose between a McDonald's uniform and a marine uniform - 2/3 of recruits come from families with incomes below the median.\n\n \n Perhaps you are referring to the Washington Post article. You didn't quite get it right. I quote: \n \"Many of today's recruits are financially strapped, with nearly half coming from lower-middle-class to poor households, according to new Pentagon data based on Zip codes and census estimates of mean household income.\" \n Well gee whiz! If NEARLY half of US Military recruits are lower to middle class it would follow that the other half are NOT lower to middle class, ergo, middle class and above.\n \n But let the Los Angeles Times argue this point further:\n \n But recent studies of military demographics suggest that today's military is neither uneducated nor poor. Statistically, the enlisted ranks of the military are drawn mainly from neighborhoods that are slightly more affluent than the norm. The very poor are actually underrepresented in the military, relative to the number of very poor people in the population. \n \n That's mainly because the military won't accept the lowest academic achievers. The Army limits recruits without high school degrees to 3 1/2 % of the pool, for instance, while the Marines won't accept recruits without high school degrees. Poverty correlates strongly with high school dropout rates, so these rules significantly limit the access of the very poor to military service. \n \n At the same time, they ensure that enlisted members of the military are more likely than members of the general population to have high school degrees. The same pattern holds for commissioned officers. In 2004, for instance, only 4.2% of officers lacked college degrees, and a whopping 37% held an advanced degree of some sort, compared to only 10% of adults nationwide.\n \n \nThere is a parallel between russian roulette and military service, it's just the gun is a bit further away and has more barrels. Several thousand US service personnel have been killed, and 10s of thousands seriously injured fighting your illegal war.\n\n \n Nut nuts nuts. You are a squirrel's best friend. You are a mathematician. Come along with me on a statistical journey.\n \n There are approximately 3,000,000 service members in the US military to include the active and reserve components. In approximately six years of conflict the US military has had just under 4,000 killed in action. That would translate to a KIA rate of 667 per year out of 3,000,000 individuals.\n \n In 2006, the city of Baltimore logged 987 murders out of a population of 640,000. \n \n The odds of dying at Russian Roulette: 17%\n Odds of Dying of Baltimore Roulette: .15%\n Odds of Dying at Military Roulette: .13%\n \n You are better off being drafted by the Army than drafted by the Baltimore Orioles.\n \n Not even REMOTELY parallel to Russian Roulette.",
