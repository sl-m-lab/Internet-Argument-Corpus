Everyone in the world but Americans understand AQ is waging an economic war against the US, not a conventional military engagement. Periodic $500k cost to AQ attacks, considering the untold trillions of dollars of economic damage they achieve, will eventually get the full attention of the voters and our government's inability to stop them. \n \n To me, the stock market never recovered from the dot.com fiasco. Some day traders do well with specific issues while brokerage agents and fund managers keep churning that same 500 point band up and down.

If (God-forbid) we do have another at some point, then time may show you were right. For now though, it seems you are wrong. \n\n \n True enoguh, ther ehave been no attacks. Teh question we should be asking is why? One theory that seems to be gainin popularity is that AQ membership has been increasing so rapidly that they are focused right now on internal organization and simply do not have the resources to organise a new attack while dealing with getting their new members lined up and all their new money counted and hidden (their memebrship has more than tripled and their assets have multiplied 4 fold). \n \n Absence of an attack does not mean that we are any safer, it merely means they haven't decided to attack us yet. If I hold loaded gun to your head but don't shoot you right away, that does not mean you are safe, merely that I have not pulled the trigger.\n \n We don't seem to have really foiled any attacks that we are aware of, though there is some conjecture that we may have. the reports to the contrary seem to be based on information that an attack may have been considered as opposed to actually disrupting plans that had operational details worked out. I am farily certain that, int he event we DID manage to foil an operational plot, that our government would be quick to hold it up to the Aemrican people as an example of how well they are being protected.\n \n Did you not catch the Scheuer interview where he said he considered the possibilty of AQ using some kind of nuclear wepon against america as nearly inevitable? This is the guy who was incharge of tracking BL for several years. The CIA has now reported that a dirty bomb is well within AQ's capabilities. You really think you are safer because we have mroe airport screeners?\n \n You should really take a look at the way AQ is structured and the way they operate. The structure was developed by our own intellignce people. They are a series of independant cells, each composed of a few members. Each cell operated independantly, but two or more cells can band together for major operations. Their strategy (as it was taught to them by members of our own CIA) is to hit soft targets, and as the enemy hardens previous targets, move on to new ones. Shoot and scoot is the name of the game.\n \n \n \nAnd let's face it, the only reason we're having to frisk everybody at airports such as old women is because of the bellyaching from the far left over racial profiling. We're the only nation that worries about that, BTW. I fly internationally once a year and every airport I've been to I've seen people stopped at searched because they possibly fit the profile of a high risk traveller.\n\n \n If we develop a profile, they will simply fashion their operatives to not fit the profile. It is worth rememebring that the majority of the worlds muslims are NOT from the middle east. As we have moved this from a war over former policy into the realm of a war of civilizations, we are driving non middle eastern muslims to Al Quedas ranks. All that developing a workable profile will do is aid the enemy in getting past it. We have helped them enough, they don't need any more, thank you.\n \n \nThe profiling is as silly and useless as people being surprised to discover there are a large number of fair haired and skinned people of Mediterranean and S.

To imagine we are safe when the enemy is stronger, we are weaker, and the conditions which led to the original attacks are not only still in exisatnce, but aggrevated, is just plain rediculous, as is the thought that they would use the same emthedology twice. \n \n Now, with several hundred million extra dollars to play with, tens of thousands of extra people, and permission to use nuclear weapons, as well as an arguable case to the international community now that we have embarked on a pat of foreign agression, AQ can take off the kiddy golves and get down to business.\n \n I don't think people realise (American, at least) that we CAN loose this war, and we are well on the way to doing it. We are spending ourselves to death. This is how we brought down the Soviet Union. We forced them to spend so much on defense that their economy could not handle it. Not only is AQ doing the same to us, they have done one further and shown every anti american group in the world that it CAN be done, you CAN hit America and make it hurt, and with a relatively low cost in manpower and money.",

I notice Bush is again publicly courting Mexico and, with revised trade agreements removing some of the flak he gave them for not joining the 'coalition', Canada. The next round of nations accepted by the EU will further broaden the mix of their economic base and provide lower cost manufacturing labor.",

I've stated many times that my financial concerns are personally selfish and I don't mind paying reasonable taxes to keep the great unwashed at bay while labor costs seek a market level from supply and demand determined by 'legal' Americans, undocumented workers or off-shore labor pools. I dislike like government expansion at record rates and a 'volunteer' military raised by wages and benefits far exceeding those of entry level private industry with masses of contractors employed to keep 'military' numbers at politically acceptable levels. If we're going to use aggression as a foreign policy tool, use a draft supported or not supported by the voters to accomplish it, not deception. Your government promoted fear and blind adherence to their policies seems to have skewed your definitions of traditional political ideology. \n \n As to defining actual dates of detrimental financial 'events' tied to our economy, I've also stated many times that there are outside factors such as China's development time line, AQ and other undefined factors that make determination of specific dates, or years, impossible. I will restate that continuing to incur debt and maintaining trade imbalances that literally flog the dollar in a time of declining tax revenues is at the mercy of other nations who currently value our consumer markets and that will end when those markets are replaced by stronger economies such as China, India and other nations who will thrive using their realistic labor costs and positive cash flows. \n \n When Greenspan/The Fed, a political tool if there ever was one, sounds the alarm about debt and trade imbalance and the public doesn't even have a hiccup, it doesn't take many brain cells to understand that the public has been focused on fear using their God and a flag to survive.

In general the normal Russians suffered greatly during the 90's which is also when the USD was basically the currency of choice in Russia, black markets used the dollar almost exclusively. I remember the new articles about the rush Russians had to change over their USD $20 note ( I believe this was the note) when the US changed it due to counterfitting.\n \n \n I expect that many Russians associate the US dollar with this period and prefer the Euro as a reaction to that.\n \n As for the government, I expect both. Much of Russia's trade is with Europe, and holding Euros as a reserve makes this trade easier. Then their is Putin's concern over the growing US presence in the Central Asian republics. As it stands the US has opened up a few bases in Kazakstan(sp) and is in fact sharing a base with Russia in one of those countries. Given the large projected amount of oil and gas in that region (not to mention the large and growing muslim population) I am sure Putin does not want the US to increase its influence in what I assume Putin feels is Russia backyard.

   "\n The Petro Dollar will finally see the end when China delinks to the dollar.

The original topic of this thread, religion, will weight heavily in US efforts to pursue spreading democracy using a 'moral' platform acceptable to a majority of 51% or so, a pretty rickety platform without our former financial clout to keep the natives happy. China has no such restrictions. \n \n As I recall, China's plans include a goal of raising their annual per-capita income to $10k US, which is generally accepted as the point where China's domestic consumer products market can replace exports to the US with minimal production losses. \n \n I know Argentina's inflation was at 50% in 2002, but haven't followed their monetary policies since then.

Only the ME countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and of course Iraq will now maintain the petro dollar system into the future\n\n \n Whether Iraq will maintain the petro dollar is yet to be seen. There have already been rumblings from both the Sauds and Kuwait about accepting the Euro for payment. The economics of this are simple. They currently accept the dollar for payment, but are forced to pay most of their expenses in Euros. \n \n I think more likely than a split payment system, the new standard for payments will most likely be set by OPEC, probably in the next 2 or 3 years, and almost certainly they will drop the dollar as their payment currency of choice. The dollar was originally selected becasue it was a stable, high value currency. With it dropping like a rock, they have no need to stick with it. Most of those who make up OPEC are concerned more with making money than with fostering brownie points with a faltering economic giant.\n \n \nThe Petro Dollar will finally see the end when China delinks to the dollar. Now when that will happen is anyones guess.\n\n \n Absolutly, if it has not already. China will not delink from the dollar until their annual income is high enough that their own consumer market can support their manufacturing base. Estimates seem to range from 2-5 years. Until then, I think we can expect to see both china and japan carry out cyclic grabs of the dollar in order to bouy up our economy, keeping their consumer market alive until it can be replaced. \n \n \nWhat some people who are not sure of what is coming for the US due to trade deficiets and excess debt in general need to look at Argentina of just a few years ago. While I doubt it will get as severe as that but the reasons behind it are similar to the economic situation in the US.\n\n \n I am not sure you are right about it not being as severe. For one thing, I don't believe that argentenians carried the massive private debt that Americans do. Once our currenc is seperated from oil, and our consumer market is replaced, I think it is anybodies game, and how bad things get will largely depend on how gullible the American people are (which is not promising). \n \n I think a crash and burn of the real estate market is almost a sure thing, as interest rates rise, driving down the new home market, and a large percentage (likely the majority) of Americans discover that theya re upside down in their houses. As our national wealth evaporates the large industries that are left here, like the auto industry, will die off quickly as very few folks will have the resources available to spend $25,000+ on a new car or other high end consumer goods. \n \n The other major factor here is the people. While the people aof argentenia do not find living a third world lifestyle completely foreign to them, yuppie americans DO, and making the transition is likely to be incredibly difficult for them. As the middle class shrinks, and the vast majority of former middle class end up in the lower class (we don't have to wait to see this, it is already happening), there does seem to be the possibility of backlash against both our government and the wealthy. Americans are not used to having to dig through the trash, or pull their dinner out of a stream lest they and their families startve slowly.\n \n For those who have managed to put their money into investments not tied to faltering real estate or general equity markets, I recommend the Uzi. Small, maneuverable, and with enough heft to keep you on target, or use as a club after you have expended your magazine against the starving former yuppie scum who blame you, instead of their idiotic spending habits, for their demise.",

   "The only reason I see SA and Iraq maintaining the petro dollar is 140 000 US troops in the immediate vicinity with relatively cordial ( puppet for Iraq) governments.\n \n \n Now for Argentina, \n \n There are a couple of important differences that I feel come out in the USA's favor. \n 1. Most debt in the US is in USD. As the USD falls the debtors in the US will generally only have to pay back in lower USD.

   "The only reason I see SA and Iraq maintaining the petro dollar is 140 000 US troops in the immediate vicinity with relatively cordial ( puppet for Iraq) governments.\n\n \n Assuming we can keep our troops there, you probably have a point. SA has already expelled themajority of our troops, and I personally don't see a war against the sauds being sucessful. They are the only ally we have in the ME with any real weight in the region (israel, but everybody hates them, a kind word form israel on our behalf pretty much gaurantees doom). \n \n I don't htink we would be willing to risk armed opposiotn in Saudi Arabia. Of ocurse, as we become more desperate to justify our massive military expenditures in order to polish our GDP numbers and keep some sembelance of a domestic economy going, who knows what kind of lu acy we may embark on?\n \n \n \nNow for Argentina, \n \n There are a couple of important differences that I feel come out in the USA's favor. \n 1. Most debt in the US is in USD. As the USD falls the debtors in the US will generally only have to pay back in lower USD. Argentina has to find a way to pay back USD that were taken as loans at say 10 pesos to the dollar now they are at (not a real number) say 20 pesos to the dollar. The US will not have to face this level of debt payback\n\n \n This is true and is a huge difference. I think the big question willll be whether it is enough of the a difference to offset the trillions in private debt that Americans are holding. I think we willl just have to wait and see on this one. \n \n \n2. A more stable government and financial system combined with alot more influence on the international scene. World's most powerfull armed forces can mitigate some of the negative impact, who wants to **** off that.\n\n \n This is another big difference, but it also begs a pretty serious question. While Argentina doesn't have nearly the international influence that America does, they also don't have the PR problem that we do. I think our PR problem is likely to intensify as we try ever more desperate measures to keep our economy moving. Using our military to mitigate negative impact from our poor spending habits is likely to be very unpopular. We are not the economic superpower we once were. We need the rest of the world a lot more than they need us. \n \n I think that with Europe consolidating into the EU, and asia and russia (and even canada to some extent) falling into line with the EU, it does not require much imagination to envision a scenario where the rest of the world, tired of the rumblings of a failing superpower, simply declare sanctions against the US and watch our population slowly starve to death. \n \n this is another of those wait and see things. If contries continue to jump on the EU bandwagon, and china continues their growth (which seems almost certian, as they are currently taking steps to restrain it), it will not be long before the US is a sidenote in economic discussions. This could be dangerous to the rest of the world. We have seen what happens when a nation with a huge military is not given the consideration they feel they deserve and their economy fails miserably (remember WWII??).\n \n \nNow for the important question,\n \n Can you somehow get me an Uzi up here in Canada? Government of Canada doest like these types of weapons.\n\n \n While I would personally NEVER do anything which violated the weapons laws of any country, I do know a guy I could let you talk to. \n \n There are two ways to look at something like that. The canadian government does not like such weapons (truth be known, neither does the US government). Assault weapons and machine guns are very unpopular with the ruling class for obvious reasons. The question is, do laws against such things really discourage ownership?\n \n When I was in college, my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had an 11:00 curfew on weeknights. Every night from 11:00 to 3:00 somebody sat at the front door and took the names of everybody who came in, and apparently those who got caught breaking curfeww got into some kind of trouble (never bothered to read the book to see what happens to such folks). Now, there were two ways to look at this:\n \n 1. They wanted you in by 11:00\n 2. They wanted you to stay out past 3:00\n \n I generally saw the second interpetation as the logical one.\n \n Laws banning high cap weapons and machine guns (what I generally refer to as \"fun guns\") can be viewed the same way. Obviously if you get caught with one, you are punished. And, again, obviously it should be fairly easy to catch people if they are out playing with their toy (a machine gun makes a distinctive noise, and whats the point of having a fun toy like that if you don't get to play with it?). So, there are 2 ways to look at this:\n \n 1. They are discouraging the use and ownership of machine guns/assault weapons/fun guns\n 2. They are encouraging the use of silencers.\n \n I will not tell you which interpetation I personally like better. You may be able to guess. \n \n I live in the US, where I can buy as many machine guns as I want, as long as I don't mind paying the $200 tax for them, and I can make them as long as I don't mind doing the licensing dance. \n \n The easiest way to do an Uzi in canda is probably to order a parts kit ($200) and have it mailed a few pieces at a time in a n unmarked package. I happen to know this will make it through customs. Then build your own reciever. They are easy to build. Then you have an unmarked throwdown toy to play with!",

   "I am not seeing where this is at all prevelant in geroges previous posts. Maybe you could point a few of them out. True, he is enough of a realist to know that bad foreign policy for years has gotten us into the mess we are in today, but that shoudl hardly be news to anybody. \n \n Increased domestic spending? Increased taxes? Redistrobution of wealth? Are you nuts? george may be one of the most fiscally conservative people I have ever had the privelage of debating. He just moved states on the basis of controlled spending at the state and local level. \n \n \n \n Yes, like the president, who 10 years ago would have been considered a southern democrat. It is amazing to me how many \"conservatives\" are running around witht he false impression that Bush is a conservative and they somehow won something in the last election. I've got bad news for you, Clinton was more conservative than bush. \n \n Uncontrolled spending, huge deficits, and record increases in the size of governement are certianly a funny way to practice the supposed core values of the conservative party, which are fiscal responsibility and small government. \n \n If GW is what conservatives are now, what do you call folks like me and george, who advocate individual liberty, limited government, constitutional restraint fiscal responsibility and the minimal number of social programs required to keep starving, unwashed mobs from climing the wall in front of the house? I certainly don't think that \"far left\" fits the bill. \n \n Lets do a little test here. Classify the following people as either conservative or liberal:\n \n Pat Buchanan\n John Kerry\n George Bush\n \n Hint...there is only one conservative listed, the other 2 are hard core liberals\n\n \n Am I on crack? Am I nuts? And then you tell me Clinton was more conservative than Bush? :) \n \n What we have here seems to be an attempt to re-define conservatism. You seem to think that it's all about spending - whoever spends the least is the conservative. In dictionary definations of the two words, (conservative, liberal) the word spending does not appear. Does that surprise you? \n \n Conservativism is about TRADITION. To preserve what is established. (And that does not include the spending programs of Bill Clinton, or FDR, by the way.) It includes Christianity, and traditional freedoms that are often questioned by safety and environmental \"experts\". But conservatism has long been for a strong national defence. Liberals are often defined by their attempts to CUT defence spending.\n \n Liberalism is about NOT being bound by tradition, and not having moral restraint. Welcoming abrupt change when believed to be for the common good. There are other honeyed phrases to describe liberalism. But the bottom line is, it simply doesn't work. It fails everywhere it's tried. \n \n What you're doing is lumping all spending together, foriegn and domestic, in your critisizm of Bush. If Kerry would have won the election, and immediately discontinued our action in Iraq, at the savings of...what $58 billion, then spent.....$40 billion more at home on additonal environmental programs, and government health care, I suppose you'd consider him more conservative than Bush. If you advocate individual liberty, limited government, and minimal social programs, how can you say Clinton was more conservative than Bush? Do you know anything about Clinton's administration?\n \n I'm sure in your little test, you claim that Buchanan is the most conservative, and thats right. He's run for president before - he can't even come close. So if true conservatism can't win, you favor todays Democrat over Bush, in your pursuit of individual liberty, and minimal number of social programs?

   "And who would you blame for unilateral intervention that, after invasion and occupation, had no basis and has turned into a financial sinkhole and alienated the US to all nations we haven't bought with aid and loan guarantees? Or foreign policy continuing to fully support Israel's purge of Palestine and expansionist policy that invites another 9/11? Or continued expansion of conventional military power using crushing public debt when faced with an unconventional enemy constructed by our foreign policy? And the largest expansion of US federal government in our history using public debt during a time of reduced tax revenues, who's fault is that? Exploding state and municipal debt as the federal government reduces tax revenue sharing to polish federal numbers but pushes federal programs down the line complete with federal compliance measures and no funding? Gasoline prices that have doubled primarily due to our attempt to instill democracy in Iraq? If you can blame anyone but ourselves, I suggest a fresh look at reality without the rose colored glasses or getting a new god, maybe one that doesn't use fear of not being 'right' as defined by politicians as a motivator.\n\n \n Do you have any solutions at all, or just critisism?

If you advocate individual liberty, limited government, and minimal social programs, how can you say Clinton was more conservative than Bush? Do you know anything about Clinton's administration?\n\n \n I know a LOT about clintons presidence. I know he spent FAR LESS on social programs than bush has. Of course, he was not stuck in a situation where he had to buy votes from seniors in order to win because he had embarked on an alleged humanitarian war. Bush promised another 3 trillion in additional social spending during his campaign for second term. I hope to god he reneges on those promises. We just don't have the money.\n \n \nI'm sure in your little test, you claim that Buchanan is the most conservative, and thats right. He's run for president before - he can't even come close. So if true conservatism can't win, you favor todays Democrat over Bush, in your pursuit of individual liberty, and minimal number of social programs? Did you listen to Kerry during his campaign at all?\n\n \n Yes, I did, and I added up the projected costs of his programs (2 trillion) and Bushs (just over 3 trillion). Do I favor todays democrats over bush? No, bush IS ONE OF todays democrats. Again,m core values of teh republican party:\n \n Individual liberty.......Passed the aptriot act, tried to suspend habeas corpus. Nope, bush fails this one\n \n Fiscal Responsibility......Huge deficit...Huge social programs....Country so far in debt and incurrng debt so rapidly that the dollar is sinking like a rock. Bush fails this one as well\n \n Smaller government.....This must be a joke. Bush has increased the size of government mroe than any president in recent history\n \n Defense.....the majority of our combat troops are off fighting a war, and blowing up all our stockpiled bombs and ammo, which are supposed ot be used in defense of this country, in a war that has nothing to do with defending this country. Bush fails here as well.\n \n Maybe you could point out some of bushs conservative qualities, beyond the lip service he gives the evangelicals. He is sure looking like a liberal from where I am sitting.\n \n \nWe'll keep it confined to this thread, okay? In post #7, \"or why we attacked Iraq, who had no relationship with AQ or WMD's......\" Positive assertions that Iraq never had WMD's is a big liberal talking point. Did you listen to any of the debate during the presidential campaign? Do you ever watch debate on television between liberal congressmen, and conservative congressmen? \n \n \n Yes, and the conswervatives really, really want the liberals to stop talking about it, BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. You are 100% correct, Bush and company, who run and hide like cowardly dogs anytime somebody puts forth the concept of accountability, would certainly like for the entire world to forget that htere WERE NO WMDs. The UN inspectors confirmed it. OUR OWN inspectors confirmed it. The 150,000+ troops we have in coutry haven't found any. It is safe to say that THERE ARE NONE.\n \n Certainly those who support bush would like for us to foget that trillion dollar \"oops\". Only an IDIOT would put something like that out of their mind.\n \n \nIn addition to defeating our military and bleeding us financially, AQ's equal, if not most important goal is to see the U.S. demoralize from within. Debate Girl never came back to let us know if she bought that shovel full she got in post #7. If she did, SHE WAS DEMORALIZED! Conservatives don't help the enemy.\n\n \n If she was demoralised, it is because whe was backing a rediculous position that couldn't eb backed up with fact. I suppsoe that the truth is sometimes demoralizing. Personally I will take an ugly truth over a beautiful lie any day. That is the conservative in me (conservatives have long considered themselves realists, and considered liberals idealists, and it si not without merit). Bush has done more to help AQ than any liberal in the coutry. By pursuing a war of agression aginst a middle eastern coutry with no provable ties to Al Queda and in absence of an immediate threat, he hgas driven AQ's membership and resouces through the roof. They have over 3x as many members now, and 4x the money they did prior to the war in Iraq. \n \n \n*Post #17, \"UN inspectors verified WMD's were destroyed\". This kind of confidence in the UN over the U.S. government is classic liberalism. The UN flew it's flag at half staff for Arafat, but not for Ronald Reagan. The UN constantly demonstrates that it's no friend of U.S. conservatives.\n\n \n Those were inspectors that WE PICKED and WE SUPERVISED and WE PROVIDED WITH INTEL. There is a damn good reason that we put faith in those inspectors. They spent 6 YEARS inspecting Iraq, using intellignece that WE PROVIDED. By the end they were literally inspecting 4'x4' GRADEN SHEDS because they had run out of places to look and the US was just certina that, despite the fcat they had visited EVERY suspected site, there were still hundreds of tons of WMD's laying around. \n \n As far as flying the flag at half mast, that is because Arafat was a sitting head of state, Reagan was not. US embasies in the ME and Africa flew THEIR flags at half mast when Arafat died, but not when Reagan did. This is a matter of diplomacy. I thought nitpicking was kind of a liberal trait......\n \n \n*Post #19. This post points fingers at the \"current administration\", and talks about Iraq as a country we \"continue to destroy\". Extreme left talking points again. During the campaign, did you ever see, or hear on the radio, a \"democrat stratigest\" say these exact same words? If not, you just weren't paying attention.\n\n \n So, what are you saying here? That the current administration was not responsible for informing the American public that they had absolute proof of hundreds of tons of WMD's, and that democracy would be met with open arms, or that we are not continuing to destroy Iraq? We did, after all, just LEVEL FALLUJAH. \n \n Sorry, I can't do any more. I finally understand your definition of a Copnservative. sOnbody who believes whatever teh conservative mouthpiece of the moment says, no matter how rediculous. I would have to add that this apparently includes believing things that are directly contradicted by commonly available facts, and often things that are directly contradicted by things previously stated by that same individual.\n \n If that is what your modern conservative is, I think I will pass and stick with fiscal restraint, small government, individual liberties, etc....\n \n There is too much self deception doing it your way. Too much work.",

Dictionary definitions define words as they are used in MY country, taking into consideration MY country's history, political changes, and beliefs. If you choose to re-define terms, going to other country's usages of them, with their own different historys and political persuasions, would be a good way to do it, I suppose. A \"liberal\" in a Moslem country, or atheist country, could be considered a good thing to a Christian. Since liberal Democrats haven't been winning too many elections in AMERICA lately, maybe ignoring our dictionary and trying to redefine terms would benefit them.

If he doesn't, it's political suicide for him. He would get the blame for the failing of the program. I wish there never had been social security. I'd rather have my money invested privately. But it's not, the government has it, and I can't get it. Though I don't like the system, I sure don't want to see it fail, and lose all my money. Our government is too big. There are no easy answers. Abandoning foreign relations isn't one of them. \n \n \n \n \nYes, and Bush, who tried to suspend habeas corpus, in fact arguing in the supreme court that the governemtn had the right to hold anybody, US citizen or not, without charges, trial, or access to the courts, SECRETLY if the administration had reason to believe they were terrorists, or somhow involved int terrorism.

He stays out of the news so much, I don't even know his name. Carol Browner, Bill Clinton's little tyrant, struck fear into the hearts of many property and business owners.\n \n \n \n \nI know a LOT about clintons presidence. I know he spent FAR LESS on social programs than bush has. \n \n \n An amount of money spent does not perfectly correspond with an amount of liberty destroyed. A lot can be spent with the sacrifice of just a little liberty, or a little can be spent, with a lot of liberty being jepordised. Clinton was pretty good at that. Anti smoking fanatics, anti gun fanatics, global warming fanatics, they all loved him. They weren't quite as keen on personal liberty as you are. \n \n \n Do I favor todays democrats over bush? No, bush IS ONE OF todays democrats. \n \n \n That's a cop out. By critisizing him, you really do support his political enemies. It's a \"lesser of the two evils\" thing. I've got a feeling you voted, and it wasn't for Bush.\n \n \nIndividual liberty.......Passed the aptriot act, tried to suspend habeas corpus. Nope, bush fails this one\n \n Fiscal Responsibility......Huge deficit...Huge social programs....Country so far in debt and incurrng debt so rapidly that the dollar is sinking like a rock.

Bush has increased the size of government mroe than any president in recent history\n \n Defense.....the majority of our combat troops are off fighting a war, and blowing up all our stockpiled bombs and ammo, which are supposed ot be used in defense of this country, in a war that has nothing to do with defending this country. Bush fails here as well.\n \n Maybe you could point out some of bushs conservative qualities, beyond the lip service he gives the evangelicals. He is sure looking like a liberal from where I am sitting. \n\n \n As a conservative, emoticon_xclown what do you think of tort reform? Or the line item veto?\n \n \n \n \nYes, and the conswervatives really, really want the liberals to stop talking about it, BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. \n\n \n Oh, is this one of those rare cases where you, as a conservative, actually side with liberals? emoticon_confused \n \n \nIf she was demoralised, it is because whe was backing a rediculous position that couldn't eb backed up with fact. I suppsoe that the truth is sometimes demoralizing. Personally I will take an ugly truth over a beautiful lie any day. That is the conservative in me (conservatives have long considered themselves realists, and considered liberals idealists, and it si not without merit). Bush has done more to help AQ than any liberal in the coutry. By pursuing a war of agression aginst a middle eastern coutry with no provable ties to Al Queda and in absence of an immediate threat, he hgas driven AQ's membership and resouces through the roof. They have over 3x as many members now, and 4x the money they did prior to the war in Iraq. \n\n \n Truth and political opinion are two different things. If she was demoralized, it was by political opinion. \"Bush has done more to help AQ\" - political opinion, nothing more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo, what are you saying here? That the current administration was not responsible for informing the American public that they had absolute proof of hundreds of tons of WMD's, and that democracy would be met with open arms, or that we are not continuing to destroy Iraq? We did, after all, just LEVEL FALLUJAH. \n\n \n \"Open arms\"? Is that a quote, or emotional liberal talking points? Fallujah is \"level\"?\n \n \nSorry, I can't do any more. Too much work.\n\n \n Hey we agree on something. emoticon_xclown",

   "Since I'm not a liberal, I prefer not to check with other countries. Dictionary definitions define words as they are used in MY country, taking into consideration MY country's history, political changes, and beliefs. If you choose to re-define terms, going to other country's usages of them, with their own different historys and political persuasions, would be a good way to do it, I suppose. A \"liberal\" in a Moslem country, or atheist country, could be considered a good thing to a Christian. Since liberal Democrats haven't been winning too many elections in AMERICA lately, maybe ignoring our dictionary and trying to redefine terms would benefit them. As the \"conservative\" you claim to be, do you feel comfortable being in complete agreement with them in that regard? emoticon_confused \n\n \n No, they don't. Dictionary definitions do not laways convey general usage. By your defintion, conservatives just wanting to keep things the same, would imply that we are anti-technology, and we should be pushing to outlaw automobiles and go back to the horse and buggy days.\n \n Liberals, in a strictly literal sense of the word, are those who support liberty and personal freedom. Certainly NOT the definition of the liberal party in the US.\n \n \n \n \nMost of Bush's domestic spending goes to prop up failing liberal programs. If he doesn't, it's political suicide for him. He would get the blame for the failing of the program. I wish there never had been social security. I'd rather have my money invested privately. But it's not, the government has it, and I can't get it. Though I don't like the system, I sure don't want to see it fail, and lose all my money. Our government is too big. There are no easy answers. Abandoning foreign relations isn't one of them. \n \n \n \n Bull. the biggest chunk of social program spanding was on the prescription drug benefit program, which was ALL GW. It was pathetic vote buying.\n \n As far as privitization of social security, I can see both sides of that. While the governemtn is certainly not doing a very good job with it, it is a poorly concieved concept ot begin with. I can understand the reluctance of some to take the leap as far as privitization goes. Since most experts agree that our stock market is overvalued, governemet imposed long term investment right now, while providing a short term boost to the market, there is a very definate risk of people loosing big, then where does that leave you? it leaves you with a bunch of starving retired people who want a governemtn handout to make up for their idiocy.\n \n If the proposed social security reform included mroe freedom to decide where your money was invested, I would support it more. It also needs to include some kind of financing scheme for those currently getting social security. The transition to a privatized social securty will leave a HUGE shortage in the current system. Before we move to a privitized system, we nee dot figure out how to fund the oblicgation to the folks RIGHT NOW and in the near future for whom it is too late to take advantage of the new program structure.\n \n This is the problem I have seen with current republican plans to privitize social security. They focus ont eh benfits for those who will enter the system in the future, but I have yet to see a plan that addresses the issue of how we fund the fully public program until the privitization can take place and catch up.\n \n This is an example of the fiscal irresponsibility I have been talking about. Traditional conservatives DO NOT do things like try to pass modifications to programs without considering multi trillion dollar funding problems. These guyw ho are claiming to be conservatives now are doing what liberals traditionally do. They come up with a new idea and push for its adoption without ever bothering to fully consider how it will be paid for.\n \n It is only the new breed of conservatives, those like yourself, who don't bother to question such things, that are turning the conservative party into a prty of pedal stomping hamsters. \n \n \nIt has to do with foreigners, and terrorism. It's the governments job. I trust them with that, and would appreciate it if they would trust me with my safety, cleanliness, and personal investments. (personal liberty) \n \n \n NO, IT WASN'T JUST FOREIGNERS. John Ashcroft, acting under orders of the Bush administration, argued that AMERICAN CITIZENS could be held WITHOUT CHARGES, WIHTOUT BAIL, AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE COURTS, SECRETLY on US military bases. These were not FOREIGNERs. These were AMERICANS, and all it took to classify somebody as a possible terrorist was a SINGLE person in the DOJ writing a MEMO. THAT, my firend, is NOT the governemnt job. The governments primary job is to protect its people and our freedom. The governemnt JOB, is to ensure that things like that DO NOT HAPPEN to american citizens. In the past, we have risked WAR, even NUCLEAR war to ensure that things like that DO NOT happen to US citizens abroad, and here our OWN PRESIDENT is trying to do it to us right here at home. And you don't see a problem with this? I am not seeign here anything to suggest that my original ascertaion (that you ar obviously high on crack) is wrong.\n \n \nHis EPA administrator seems to mind his own business pretty well. He stays out of the news so much, I don't even know his name. Carol Browner, Bill Clinton's little tyrant, struck fear into the hearts of many property and business owners.\n\n \n What in the name of god does this have to do with \"moral restraint\". I would like to see what kind of controtions you have to do in order to somehow tie EPA regulations to \"moral restraint\".\n \n \n \nAn amount of money spent does not perfectly correspond with an amount of liberty destroyed. A lot can be spent with the sacrifice of just a little liberty, or a little can be spent, with a lot of liberty being jepordised. Clinton was pretty good at that. Anti smoking fanatics, anti gun fanatics, global warming fanatics, they all loved him. They weren't quite as keen on personal liberty as you are\n\n \n This has nothing to do with liberty destroyed. this has to do with how much of our tax dollars are being redistributed to the lower class in poorly run, high margin federal social programs. This is something else conservatives have traditionally been against, government mandated re-distrobution of wealth. Bush, not being a conservative, has no problem with the idea. He has taken trillions from the taxpayers and handed it out to the lower classes in the form of feel good educational programs and prescription drug benefits.\n \n \nThat's a cop out. By critisizing him, you really do support his political enemies. It's a \"lesser of the two evils\" thing. I've got a feeling you voted, and it wasn't for Bush.\n\n \n No, that is not a cop out. That is an observation of the guys political ideals. you are 100% correct. I voted, but not for a liberal like Bush or Kerry. I voted for the libertarian canidate, since he was a conservative, instead of a closet liberal like the republicans were running. \n \n \n \nAs a conservative, emoticon_xclown what do you think of tort reform? Of the line item veto?\n\n \n Tort reform, good idea. \n \n Line item veto, also a good idea, and an idea that was advanced by the CONSERVATIVES. The idea behind the line itewm veto was that the president did not have to pass or fail a spending bill as a whole, he could remove parts of it in order to cut spending. It gave the executive branch (president) an extra check on congress.\n \n Since you are displaying some ignorance here in apparently somehow attaching the line itme veto to the liberals (and I know why, and we will touch on it in a minute), lets step into the wayback machine and step back to the days of reacga, when the idea of the line item veto really became an issue.\n \n The line item veto was orignally pushed as a way for the president to cut pork from spending bills. This was largely becasue back in the day when reagan was president, they needed support of the democrats in congress, who kept attaching pork to everything that came along. The bills wouldn't pass congress without all the pork attached. The idea was for the prsident to be able to edit out the pork, thus negating some of the deal making and soul selling that had to go on in order to get a bill through congress. Most presidents in the history of the United States have approved of the line item veto.\n \n Thhey could net get it passed under Reagan, becasue republicans could not get enough control over the congress to do so and the democrats certainly didn't want their pork cut out of every bill that came along.\n \n They couldn't get it passed under Bush 1 either.\n \n Finally, it passed during the clinton administration. At this point, the Republicans, who for the last 12 years had been pushing for the line item veto, decided that since a democrat was in power, this was a BAD idea, since it was \"their\" pork that would be cut instead of democrats pork. Froma realist standpoint, it probably never would have passed except that there were so many republicans running around who for so many years had heard what a great thing the line item veto was, that they failed to relaise that they were not supposed to support it (we are talking at the street level here). \n \n The whole mess is a mute point now anyway, since the courts have declared the line item veto unconstitutional. \n \n Originally, and still today, traditional conservatives largely support the theory, even if we can't practice it, because conservatives, being for fiscal responsibility, have always opposed pork barrel spending, at least in theory.\n \n \n \nOh, is this one of those rare cases where you, as a conservative, actually side with liberals? emoticon_confused \n \n \n No, not unless in order to be a conservative requires that you completely depart from reality. If I look in a box, and the box is empty, I will always say \"the box is empty\" even if the president himself tries to convince me that it is full of $100 bills, I know an empty box when I see one.\n \n you seem to be confused in what conservatism is. It is a system of ideals, not just a matter of who you side with. \n \n \n \nTruth and political opinion are two different things. If she was demoralized, it was by political opinion. \"Bush has done more to help AQ\" - political opinion, nothing more. \n \n \n Wrong answer on the first, correct on the second. It is certainly an opinion that bush ahs done a lot to help AQ. I believe you will find it impossible, when considering the fact in the case, like the boost to their funding and recruitment caused by our war of agression in Iraq, to refute the opinion, buthey, you are apparently a new breed of unthinking conservative. You are told what to think and what to believe and form your opinions not by analyzing evidence, but by listening to sound bytes by people you like.\n \n Moral restraint. You may not know what it means, but you sure like the way it sounds!! YES.....YES.....moral restraint.....that sounds like a good thing.....family values....yes, we like that too......\n \n Don't actually have to write a speech, just read of a list of meaningless buzz terms and you are happy. Don't have to HAVE any moral restraint. don't have to actually do anything to SUPPORT family values. Don't actually have to take any real steps to DEFEND the country. You just seem to like phrases like \"Moral restraint\", \"Family Values\" and \"strong defense\". \n \n \n\"Open arms\"? Is that a quote, or emotional liberal talking points? Fallujah is \"level\"?\n\n \n Yes, you are correct on both counts. It is a partial quote, and it is fuzzy liberal talking points. It coms from Rumsfeld, who said on multiple occasions that \"Us troops will be met in the cities of Iraq with flowers and they will greet democracy with open arms\". \n \n \n With ovewr 80% of the cities int eh building either destroyed or uninhabitable due to damage incured during our bombing raids and \"liberation\". I would say we have done a damn fine job of leveling the city. Of course, it won't truly be level until next month when we bring in the bulldozers to knock down the remnants of the buildings (right now it is not level, there are piles of rubble all over the place). \n \n After the bulldozers, of course, will come the hundreds of millions of US taxpayer money to rebuild the buildings we blew up (or 1.2 billion, depending on how technical you want ot get). \n \n \n \nHey we agree on something. emoticon_xclown\n\n \n Yes, but for different reasons. I find answering your posts kind of boring and tedius because you fail to present any kind of argument at all to back up your stance. You just spout rediculous, unsupported (and in many cases unsupportable) rhetoric.",

   "I just wanted to throw in something about Bush's EPA administrator.\n \n First of all, to say that \"we haven't heard a peep\" is wrong.\n \n When he was sworn in, a lot of people were PO'd and were screaming cronyism and saying that Leavitt (the EPA admin) would do things to wreck the environment.\n \n All I can provide here are some quick google results:\n \n http://www.inc.com/magazine/20040101/controversy.html\n \nThe commotion began in April when Leavitt negotiated with Interior Secretary Gale Norton to drop a layer of wilderness protection from almost 6 million acres of backcountry Utah land. The move offended not only the usual suspects like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, but also the state's outdoor recreation industry. Its leaders argue that mountain climbers come to Utah specifically for its pristine red rock canyons.\n\n \n http://www.oldamericancentury.org/cronyism.htm\n \nAs Utah governor he allowed US Magnesium to emit over 42 million tons of Chlorine per year-nine times the Chlorine emissions from all other states. Despite intense local pressure from citizen groups, Leavitt's Department of Environmental Quality failed to bring the polluter under control. The EPA was forced to step in, filing a $900 million lawsuit against MagCorp for alleged environmental violations. He is now head of that very same EPA source 1 source 2 (.pdf formet)\n Leavitt downplayed the toxic releases of the mining industry - including the releases of the potent neurotoxin Mercury -by saying \"in reality it is not pollution.\"\n\n \n I've heard of the US Mag case. People for miles around the plant complain of burning eyes and throats, etc. since the plant releases so much chlorine and HCl gas. I read somewhere that Utah is in the top 10 states for pollution, but when you take out the US Mag plant it is in the bottom 10.\n \n http://environment.about.com/cs/politics/a/mikeleavitt.htm\n \n# U.S. Magnesium\n \n U.S. Magnesium (formerly MagCorp), a magnesium ore plant located 50 miles west of Salt Lake City on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, has been listed as on of the nation's top polluters. According to the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), US Magnesium is responsible for emitting over 42 million tons of Chlorine per year-nine times the Chlorine emissions from all other states.4\n \n Despite intense local pressure from citizen groups, Leavitt's Department of Environmental Quality failed to bring the polluter under control. The EPA was forced to step in, filing a $900 million lawsuit against MagCorp for alleged environmental violations.5\n \n # Kennecott Utah Copper Mine\n \n Kennecott is the largest copper mine in the US, and ranked as the largest toxic polluter in the nation.6 As reported in The Deseret News in June 1999, Leavitt downplayed the toxic releases of the mining industry - including the releases of the potent neurotoxin Mercury -by saying \"in reality it is not pollution.\"7\n \n Leavitt sponsored policy resolutions of the Western Governors' Association in 2000 and 2002 to oppose environmental regulation of the mining industry and to limit public access to information about the industry's toxic pollution.8\n \n Kennecott has one of the world's largest ground water contamination problems as a result of its mining operations.

   "We made it work during WW2 didn't we? :)\n\n \n No, we sure didn't. WWII brought us out of the depression. There was still plenty of money in the country, it was just heald in the hands of a relative few. Prior to WWII, we were even running a positive trade balance\n \n When we geared up for war production and increased the size of our military to fight the war, taxes went up and the government issued a bunch of bonds. Most of the bonds were purchased by the wealthy, and the increase in taxes was primarily for the wealthy (nobody else had any money to pay taxes anyway). \n \n Waht happeneed during WWII was basically a redistrobution of wealth through taxation and government job creation. \n \n What we are seeing now is a nation that is running out of money. Big difference. While there are still (obviously) a realtively few number of people controlling the lins share of the wealth in America, there is simply not as much wealth as there once was, because it is going overseas. Our money si going to the chinese, which they use to buy television sets and radios and diaper. It is going to the Japanese who use it to buy new cell phones and apartments and hondas. It is going to Eurpoe where they use it to buy anti bush protest signs.\n \n Perhaps worst of all, it is going to Iraq to rebuild buildings in falluja that we just spend over a billion dollars blowing up.\n \n For the majority of this nations history, our net worth grew. First it grew throught he exportation of natural resources, then it grew through the development of a first rate industrial infrastructure. Then it leveled off, now it is shrinking. Our first rate industiral infrastructure is GONE. We produce next to nothing here. Our easily exploitable natural resources are gone, and what is left we can't export becuase they are cheaper on the international market.\n \n So, every year, instead of the US gaining money, we are loosing it. It might help to think of the US as a really big company. The company isn't making money. the company is not even making enough to pay its expenses (not even close) so we are basically living off of our savings.\n \n Living off you rsavings has a down side. They will eventually run out. Our savigns are running out. As they run out, we borrow more and more money to try to stay afloat. The more money we borrow, the less the dollar is worth, effectively depleting our savings further (though the dollar figure stays the same, the dollars are worth less). \n \n Now the dollar is dropping quickly enough that we are having trouble getting anybody to finance our debt, so we are going to have to raise interest rates to keep our offering attractive. The higher interest rates will hurt the home market, driving down real estate values and putting a lot of people upside down in their homes. It will also hurt the automobile market, and just about anything else that people generally finance. \n \n Is any of this getting through to you?",

But if I page around some, I can still find a little substance. \n \n On WW2, it's easy to do an analyzation of any of our past problems since we can now see the whole picture. Things are scary now because we can't see the future. There have been equally scary times in the past, )1862, 1929, 1941, late 60's. And there was much doom and gloom predicted then by people like you, who said it was going to be a train wreck, and there's nothing we can do. \n \n I like the \"think of the US as a really big company\" idea. So what you're saying is that in all our past problems, we had money, we weren't living on savings, so THIS is the biggest problem the US has ever faced? Maybe because before, we were really the only \"company\" in the world, and now we finally have other \"companies\" that are outperforming us?\n \n And you don't know what to do?

Wouldn't you say the very first priority would be to make money? You said we produce next to nothing here. A little silly, we produce a lot of food. We may not have the industrial sweat shops that we used to have. Maybe some of them were sued out of existance? Maybe some were closed down by the EPA? Maybe it's time to take a look at some of our \"employees\". Could it be that other companies, (the China company for example) don't have our do nothing government bureaucracies dragging them down. Maybe our EPA could pack up their chemistry sets and head to China and clean up their environment for them? That company wouldn't hire them, that's the problem. I wonder if Chinese school buses cost twice what they're worth to finance safety features that are never used? I wonder if the Chinese president has the line item veto? \n \n So the line item veto has been declared unconstitutional? I hadn't heard, but it's not surprising. I'd say the courts were pressured into that by the same congress that won't allow us to impose much needed term limits on them. The Democrats wouldn't, and the Republicans won't. It's probably going to take a recession or a depression to get these things done. Some h*ll raising by the general public could get it done. Too bad we're too busy squalking about the Iraq war, something we don't know as much about as we think. The general public isn't going to notice our financial situation if we're spending.....whatever it is, millions or billions on the rock and roll hall of fame. Am I getting through to you yet? Our company has some employees in Iraq right now. It has to do with oil, and terrorists. They're earning their paychecks. The interior of our country has a lot of do-nothing employees that need to be fired. A depression may do it. It won't be a train wreck.\n \n I suppose you're brimming with confidence at our competition around the world. I hear China is building six cities the size of New York City. The price of US steel has really gone up lately. (whoooops - I forgot, we don't produce anything) I guess you probably believe that the Chinese are all walking aroung with their pockets overflowing with Euros, and they're paying cash for everything. I wonder how much they're financing - who is really taking the risks. \n \n What easily exploitable US natural recources are gone? I can think of some recources that are shrinking - morals, values, work ethic, appreciation of freedom, patriotism, and other things. Oh yes, FAMILY VALUES!!! You made fun of me before I said it, do you have ESP?? :p \n \n It took decades for the US to get in this financial condition, and it's going to take time to get it out. Why do you furiously blame only the current administration? If we didn't invade Iraq, would everything suddenly be fixed? Or would it just prolong the bleeding before the train wreck? If it would, then why not get it over with NOW? Let's assume the Iraq war CAUSES the train wreck that terrifies you. Wouldn't it be best to get it over with before our \"savings\" get depleted further? \n \n A Canadian guy called Rush Limbaugh today. Seems that \"company\" is having some problems. $25,000 mini vans cost $40,000 in Canada. A national 15% sales tax. He waited 15 hours in the emergency room with a piece of copper imbeded in his hand. That \"employee\" wants to get a job in this country. But since he was on Limbaugh's show, you disregard anything he has to say right? You'd probably be surprised at what goes on in a lot of other \"companies\" all around the world. \n \n You said you voted for a third party candidate. Was there something you thought he could do to avert this \"train wreck\"? You said you drew a blank yourself, did he give you any ideas of what HE would do? Do you think you could share them with me without smarting off, or are you too bored?\n \n Now it you have something of substance to say, we'll debate further. If it emotionally warms you to insult, then have at it. I'll read it, but I won't respond to it.",

   "On WW2, it's easy to do an analyzation of any of our past problems since we can now see the whole picture. Things are scary now because we can't see the future. There have been equally scary times in the past, )1862, 1929, 1941, late 60's. And there was much doom and gloom predicted then by people like you, who said it was going to be a train wreck, and there's nothing we can do. \n\n \n You don't have to see the future. We can see, right now, that even running at current maximum industrial capacity, we can't even get close to leveling out our trade imbalance. \n \n There is a major difference between the doom and gloom predicted in the past and the unpleasantness facing us today. The gloom and doom in the past was primarily hypethetical. Todays unpleasantness is not. It is ehre, right now, staring us in the face. Do you know where the dollar is trading today? Take a look at the trend in the dollar for the last few years as opposed to other major currencies.\n \n \nI like the \"think of the US as a really big company\" idea. So what you're saying is that in all our past problems, we had money, we weren't living on savings, so THIS is the biggest problem the US has ever faced? Maybe because before, we were really the only \"company\" in the world, and now we finally have other \"companies\" that are outperforming us?\n\n \n Yep, this is pretty much the biggest problem we have ever faced. In the past we have faced civil discord, wars, depressions, you name it. We came thoguh all those things primarily because we could afford them. we could afford to fight WWI and WWII. We could afford to beat the Sovients int eh cold wa. We could afford to put up social programs to pacify the hyper liberals. Without money, you cannot afford to fight wars, you cannot afford social programs, you cannot afford to feed your people. This is the direction we are headed in. Look at the numbers (you obviously haven't). Any 10th grader with a calculater should be able to see which way this thing is going. Without money, a country is pretty much sunk.\n \n \nAnd you don't know what to do? So you wouldn't make a very good company president? But you seem to be very confident on what NOT to do. emoticon_confused (invade Iraq). Wouldn't you say the very first priority would be to make money? You said we produce next to nothing here. A little silly, we produce a lot of food. We may not have the industrial sweat shops that we used to have. Maybe some of them were sued out of existance? Maybe some were closed down by the EPA? Maybe it's time to take a look at some of our \"employees\". Could it be that other companies, (the China company for example) don't have our do nothing government bureaucracies dragging them down. Maybe our EPA could pack up their chemistry sets and head to China and clean up their environment for them? That company wouldn't hire them, that's the problem. I wonder if Chinese school buses cost twice what they're worth to finance safety features that are never used? I wonder if the Chinese president has the line item veto? \n \n \n I know that when you are facing a huge deficit, a huge trade imablance, and a currency dropping like a rock, you shouldn't be spedning hundreds of billions of dollars invading, destroying, and rebuilding foreign countries.\n \n We do produce a lot of food, for all the good it does us. The problem is that our food is expensive. It is cheap at the counter because the government subsidizes it, but over all, the cost of US agriculture is high. Theoretically we could crank out more food, but htat would only hasten our demise as the government scrables to susidize ag products for export, effectively ensuring that we provide cheap grain to the rest of the world.\n \n The EPA and government regulations had very little with the demise of American business. What has killed American business is mostly the result of American labor prices, thoguh there ae other factors as well (we would need a whole new thread for that).\n \n \nSo the line item veto has been declared unconstitutional? I hadn't heard, but it's not surprising. I'd say the courts were pressured into that by the same congress that won't allow us to impose much needed term limits on them. \n \n \n This happened back in '98. How can you possibly be making political commentary, especially regarding the economy, when you missed something this major??\n \n If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? If you are young, I suppose that expecting you to remember something of a political nature that happened 6 years ago may be asking a little much. If you are not young, and you profess to have some kind of insight into economics and federal spending, this is nigh inexcusable. \n \n \nThe Democrats wouldn't, and the Republicans won't. It's probably going to take a recession or a depression to get these things done. Some h*ll raising by the general public could get it done. \n \n \n The line item veto was overturned becasue it was ruled unconstitutional. You will likely need a constitutional amendment for the other changes you suggest here, too, assunming that in talking term limits for judges you are talking supreme court as well. \n \n If what e need is a recession or a depression, we are in luck, because an economic crash is pretty much looming on the horizon.\n \n \n \nToo bad we're too busy squalking about the Iraq war, something we don't know as much about as we think. The general public isn't going to notice our financial situation if we're spending.....whatever it is, millions or billions on the rock and roll hall of fame. Am I getting through to you yet? Our company has some employees in Iraq right now. It has to do with oil, and terrorists. They're earning their paychecks. The interior of our country has a lot of do-nothing employees that need to be fired. A depression may do it. It won't be a train wreck.\n\n \n Ok, so we frie tehse employees, and then what? As far as building a rock and roll hall of fame, that doens't make a bit of difference as far as national economic condition, and may even help. The enemy is NOt domestic spending. Domestic spending provides jobs for americans and helps the economy along. The problem is with foreign spending, trade imbalances, and deficit spending. If you can seriously look at the figures and come to another conclusion, I would like you to please explain how.\n \n \nI suppose you're brimming with confidence at our competition around the world. I hear China is building six cities the size of New York City. The price of US steel has really gone up lately. (whoooops - I forgot, we don't produce anything) I guess you probably believe that the Chinese are all walking aroung with their pockets overflowing with Euros, and they're paying cash for everything. I wonder how much they're financing - who is really taking the risks. \n \n \n Yes. The chinese are paying cash for everything. They just took some pretty serious measures to slow theri economic growth, as their first quarter growth was 9.7% and they were shooting for 8% this year. Even taking the measures that tey have, they are not going to make 8%, it will be closer to 8.3%. China is responsible for 15% of worldwide economic expansion last year. If only we had their problems. They are financing about 2-3 percent internationally, but have more than enough cash reserves to pay what htey have financed. In fact, they are grabbing up US currency by the fistfull right now in an attempt to bring it up in value a little. Now that christmas imports are in, and they have been paid in low value dollars, they are trying to drive the dollar up a bit so they can convert it to a high value currency slowly. The upside to this is that the dollar will rise, or at least decline a little mroe slowly, over the next few months. The down side to this is that it will undoubtedly reach a new low as they convert it to euros or yen. Teh thing you might want to take note of, in case all that was over your head, is that hte chinese have enough extra cash laying around to make major manipulations in the value of the dollar. \n \n Unfortunatly, US steel is up because scrap prices are up. Scrap prices are up because of international demand (mostly the chinese and the russians). As long as scrap stays up, so will US steel. International demand for US steel just fell off a cliff the last week or two as several south American reprocessing plants came back online simultaneously. \n \n \nWhat easily exploitable US natural recources are gone? I can think of some recources that are shrinking - morals, values, work ethic, appreciation of freedom, patriotism, and other things. Oh yes, FAMILY VALUES!!! You made fun of me before I said it, do you have ESP?? :p \n \n \n Copper, gold, silver, lumber, coal, Iron. We haven't found a new surface deposit, or near surface deposit of any size of any of these for a lot of years. New, in order to get any of these at profitably exploitable quatities requires deep penetration mining.\n \n \nIt took decades for the US to get in this financial condition, and it's going to take time to get it out. Why do you furiously blame only the current administration? If we didn't invade Iraq, would everything suddenly be fixed? Or would it just prolong the bleeding before the train wreck? If it would, then why not get it over with NOW? Let's assume the Iraq war CAUSES the train wreck that terrifies you. Wouldn't it be best to get it over with before our \"savings\" get depleted further? \n \n \n It is not prolonging the bleeding before the train wreck, it is hasteneing the eventual wreck. Lets say you loose your job tommorow and can't find a new one. You have $10,000 in savings, would you really send $2000 to starving orphansd in Africa? That is essentially what we are doing with the war and subsequent rebuilding in Iraq. We are hastening the depletion of our economic resources. \n \n \nA Canadian guy called Rush Limbaugh today. Seems that \"company\" is having some problems. $25,000 mini vans cost $40,000 in Canada. A national 15% sales tax. He waited 15 hours in the emergency room with a piece of copper imbeded in his hand. That \"employee\" wants to get a job in this country. But since he was on Limbaugh's show, you disregard anything he has to say right? You'd probably be surprised at what goes on in a lot of other \"companies\" all around the world. \n \n \n No, they are not having the same problem. They are running a positive trade balance. All their spending is being done in house, which means that it is contributing to the flow of money in their economy. Our spending is not being done in house. Back to the company example....What they are doing is effectively transferring money between departments in the same company (raising their GDP in the process). What we are doing is loosing money to the company down the road. BIG DIFFERENCE.\n \n \nYou said you voted for a third party candidate. Was there something you thought he could do to avert this \"train wreck\"? You said you drew a blank yourself, did he give you any ideas of what HE would do? Do you think you could share them with me without smarting off, or are you too bored?\n\n \n The problem is that there is really nothign we CAN do. The problem has been going on too long. the only question now is how bad it will become and how long it will have to stay bad before it improves. Most of the projections and statistics I have seen regarding US production of real value goods are pretty distressing. The problem is that if you look at where US production is as opposed to where it should be, and factor in expansion costs, ther eis simply not enough money left in the country to bring our industrial capablitly up to where it needs to be.\n \n From a realistic standpoint,the guy who we need in office is the one who will never get elected. we need aguy who is willing to cut foreign aid. Es simply cannot afford it. We need a guy who is ready and willing to cut social programs like the prescription drug benifits. We cannot afford them. We need a guy who will cut back on governement services and benifits. We cannot afford them. We need a guy who will make a drastic change to foreign policy, not only to get our enemies off our back (beacause we can't afford to fight them) but because we can no longer afford the price in aid and military equipment that it takes to keep evil regimes afloat and kkep nations that cannot live without routinely bombing their neiborgs afloat (sorry, israel). \n \n We also need a guy who will slash and burn when it comes to the military budget. I agree that we need a strong defense, but our military is not currently geared towards defense. We are operating an offensive military. We need to let the rest of the world deal with their problems for a few years while we put our own house back in order. Pare the military down to the point that we still have strong defense for our borders and oru nation, but not such an excessive force that we are tempted to run all over the world playing policeman. \n \n THEN, after we have cut foreign spending (which is the real enemy) and domestic social spending, we need a serous round of tax cuts and growth incentive packages. Not for individuals (at least not right awy) but for businesses to encourage industrial expansion. We need to quite telling the \"service economy is a good thing\" lie and tell the truth \"every service economy in history has failed miserably\". We need to once again become the industrial giant that we once were. \n \n From a practical standpoint, that still would not provide enough money to build our industrial infrastructure to the point where it should be. As I said, there is simply not enough money left in the country to do that. It would, however, certainly help soften the blow. \n \n The problem is that a canidate that ran on such a platform would never win. The liberals wouldn never vote for him because he would slash their precious social programs and international aid. The conservatives would not vote for him because he would slash military spending.\n \n Both groups are wrong. The libs are wrong because without cutting those programs now so we can encourage industrial growth, they are ensuring that there will be more poor people who need such programs in the future, but there will be no money to pay for them.\n \n the conservatves are wrong because without an industrial infrastructure to support your military, you HAVE no defense. It was ONLY the fact that America had an excellent industrial infrastructure that allowed us to gear up production to meet demand for war materials during WWI and WWII. Evne now, the war in Iraq had drained our reserves (military equipment and armament) to a dangerously low level, and we do not have enough industry left to replace them at the needed rate. An attack on the continental United states right now could very possibly suceed because it will take 2 or more years to produce enough bombs and bullets and tanks and hummers to replace those destroyed or damaged beyond reasonable use in Iraq. How could anybody who claims to be pro defense allow this to be?",

   "Overall it has taken little more then two decades for the US to go from the worlds biggest creditor nation, to being the worlds biggest debtor nation. When I first heard that during the Reagan Admin that the US now owed more to foreign countries then the basket case of Brazil I was shocked.\n \n Since then what has been the ongoing trend in the US, lower personal savings, higher trade deficiets, higher governmental deficiets and a general loss in manufaturing. A recent article that I read indicated that tradeable goods make up 25% of the US economy, so roughly 2.5 Trillion dollars. Of this 2.5 trillion dollars 500-600 billion of it is accounting for the trade deficiet. A simple reduction in EPA regulations, allowing for more polution of your rivers and lakes ( Love Canal, Lake Erie) is not going to correct it.\n \n As for the Chinese, they have their own problems but because of a strong government who cares nothing about foreign companies and barely about it own individual people will be able to work through them. In 6 years or so the Asian economies will be able to live without the US. Domestic demand their will be more then enough to make up for the US.\n \n The US no longer has the influence that it had even 10 years ago. Europe, barely cares about the US other then for a trading partner, new US allies are finding that special trade agreement and military agreements are not worth the hassle. As seen by Poland and its complaint about funding for its troops in Iraq. \n \n As for Canada, our problems are domestic. We are now paying for our excess of the 80' and 90's by paying down our government debts. Made easier by the lower US dollar by the way. This is slowing down our economy. Since we started this earlier in the economic cylce then the US the after effects for Canada will be less harsh. Also that we are basically a resource based economy a surging China and India, will help our economy greatly. China is on the verge of buying one of Canadas largest oil companies for about $18 billion (Husky Oil).\n \n South/Central America is pulling away from the US politically and economically, Asia is pulling away towards China economically, Europe excluding the UK is also gravitating towards Russian and China. China especially economically, polilitcally and militarilly. The EU is very likely to end the export ban on military equipment to China in the next couple of years. France is very keen on this.\n \n You have the muslim world which by all accounts hates the US even more then they did just 5 years ago. Iran is making special deals with China, China is making economic deals with the Central asian republics in order to gain access to the expected large quantities of oil and gas there.\n \n What is the US response. To place military bases in those countries or right on the boarder when possible. Spending billions of dollars on the military when it would be cheaper just to buy the oil on the open market. \n \n Overall the US government and most of its major companies have been very short sighted, looking at 1 or 2 years down the road or even the next quarter and forgetting about 5 years or 10 years down the road. Well five years down the road, I expect the US to be in worse shape economically for the average american then during the Carter admin, much worse.",

I agree that we need a strong defense, but our military is not currently geared towards defense. We are operating an offensive military. We need to let the rest of the world deal with their problems for a few years while we put our own house back in order. Pare the military down to the point that we still have strong defense for our borders and oru nation, but not such an excessive force that we are tempted to run all over the world playing policeman. \n \n THEN, after we have cut foreign spending (which is the real enemy) and domestic social spending, we need a serous round of tax cuts and growth incentive packages. Not for individuals (at least not right awy) but for businesses to encourage industrial expansion. We need to quite telling the \"service economy is a good thing\" lie and tell the truth \"every service economy in history has failed miserably\". We need to once again become the industrial giant that we once were. \n \n From a practical standpoint, that still would not provide enough money to build our industrial infrastructure to the point where it should be. As I said, there is simply not enough money left in the country to do that. It would, however, certainly help soften the blow. \n \n The problem is that a canidate that ran on such a platform would never win. The liberals wouldn never vote for him because he would slash their precious social programs and international aid. The conservatives would not vote for him because he would slash military spending.\n \n Both groups are wrong. The libs are wrong because without cutting those programs now so we can encourage industrial growth, they are ensuring that there will be more poor people who need such programs in the future, but there will be no money to pay for them.\n \n the conservatves are wrong because without an industrial infrastructure to support your military, you HAVE no defense. It was ONLY the fact that America had an excellent industrial infrastructure that allowed us to gear up production to meet demand for war materials during WWI and WWII. Evne now, the war in Iraq had drained our reserves (military equipment and armament) to a dangerously low level, and we do not have enough industry left to replace them at the needed rate. An attack on the continental United states right now could very possibly suceed because it will take 2 or more years to produce enough bombs and bullets and tanks and hummers to replace those destroyed or damaged beyond reasonable use in Iraq. How could anybody who claims to be pro defense allow this to be?\n\n \n How could those in the MAJORITY allow this to be? They don't have the same political opinions as you concerning how humans will react as these things unfold. It's about more than numbers. It's about a lot of everyday activity that you, as one person, don't always see.",

   "We can see NOW that it was hypethetical. The people who actually experienced it back then, without your view of their entire picture, couldn't see it. Would you rather have been alive in 1862, or 1941, than today? I'll take today, thank you.\n\n \n We knew then that a lot fo the dangers were hypothetical The danger of nuclear was was always hypothetical, as were many of the other percieved dangers. It was well known that it was hypothetical.\n \n You can get a spreadsheet which shows US trade numbers, deficit numbers, and spending trends. These are not hypothetical.\n \n \n \nDifferent people can look at the same numbers and see different things, and different sources show different numbers. As I said, some economists look at the numbers and say, \"We can't cut taxes!!\" Others look at the exact same numbers and say \"We need to cut taxes!!\" It's so much political opinion.\n\n \n There are two schools of thought on the whole tax cut issue, and it is a little tought to tell which is correct (though now we have a little more insight since we tried the tax cuts).\n \n On the one side, you have the \"we need to cut taxes\" guys. Their argument was that tax cuts would spur the economy and help pull us out of the recession. It did spur the economy, but did little to pull us out of rescession, though it did help polish our GDP (which is basically just acount of transactions in a given nation). It also raised our trade deficit, as people had extra money, and they used it to purchase foreign goods. This is the down side.\n \n Those who claim that we can't cut taxes generally do so on the premise that since the government is running such a large deficit, cutting taxes only raises the deficit higer, which results in inflation, which means that even though we have more money individually, our money is worth less. \n \n I think we should lower taxes, but for a different reason. I care little about polishing GDP numbers to help get people re-elected. I think we should lower taxes because that is my money, and I don't think the government needs it. They just waste what we give them anyway, so why bother giving it to them? I think we need tax cuts and we need to slash and burn the federal governemtns spending programs. \n \n \n \nLOL - copper, gold, silver, lumber, coal, iron, all heavily answerable to government regulations and our legal system.\n\n \n Which has what to do with the fact that there are no surface deposits left? the problem is that it just isn't there anymore. It is cheaper to pick it up off the ground or out of shallow mines than it is to dig a few thousand feet for it. No amount of government regulation changes this. \n \n \n \nWe all miss things. I've noticed a few that you've missed. It's why our government is set up the way it is. We don't allow only elite economists make our decisions for us. I'm 50, a high school graduate who doesn't take much interest in economics. I take an interest in a few things that you don't, and see a few things that you don't. A coincidence that you ask - after reading your post #64, I was wondering how old YOU are.\n\n \n I am sorry about that. I just couldn't resist. \n \n \nI was noticing one sided economics posting going on here with little opposition. I've seen oposition from economists at other places on the net, but I'm not going to attemp to pick and choose what they say and bring it here. You'd shoot me down on pure economics savvy. I like seeing what you say knowing that you're just talking to an average joe. I'm trying to determine if you have any respect at all for someone whose mind is not constantly filled with nothing but numbers.\n \n \n \n Bring them on. There used to be a lot of opposition here. We shook thm like rag dolls and sent them on their way to places where there were easier pickings. At the end of the day, when you consider all the numbers and the international factors, there is really only one conclusion you can come to, and that is that America is in some deep trouble. I debate on a couple of other boards, and if you keep the debate strictly to the numbers and factual interpeetation of economic indicators, the opposition does not last long.\n \n \nThen we need to get those constitutional amendments done. It has to do with DOMESTIC spending and politics, not foreign affairs.\n\n \n Domestic spendign stays right here in the country. It is not really the enemy, foreign spendign is. I agree that we need to make some changes t teh constitution, but don't think it is going to get done in my life time.\n \n \nWe fire the employees, and let them find PRODUCTIVE jobs, ones that actually make money. So you say as long as we have jobs, even if they produce no useful product, it helps the economy? I don't have to look at the numbers to see that's liberal thinking. It won't work in the \"company\" analogy you made.\n \n \n \n There are already not enough jobs to go around. What are these guys going to do once they are fired? Having people working and spending money creates economic momentum. If you have a large number of people with money in their pockets, somebody will create things to sell them, which creates more jobs and more potential customers. \n \n Who exactly are you thinking we should fire? Us corporate interestes have always been good at cutting employees who are not productive. \n \n \nYes it was all over my head. I haven't been to China. Did you enjoy your trip? What events that happened in the US did you miss while you were there?\n\n \n Sorry, it is somehow difficult to tell how much technical information is too much. Yes, I enjoyed china, though I am not real fond of the food. Didn't really miss anything while I was there. Stayed at a very nice luxury hotel and rode around in a limo. The chinese really know how to do their tourism industry right!\n \n \nSomething the EPA won't let us do.\n\n \n It is not a question of the EPA letting us find them. They are simply not there. We used them all up. theya re gone. Now in order to get these resources, we have to dig deep into the earth.\n \n \n \nThe starving orphan in Africa is not a threat to me, or the source of some of my energy.\n\n \n Apparently Saddam was not a threat to you either, since he had no WMD's, and even if he did, he had no delivery system capable of getting them here, nor did he have any operational links to AQ, so they weren't going to be hand delivering them. \n \n You cannot eat oil. The ME is sitting on the biggest oil reserve on the planet, but they have little or nothing as far as other resources go. They HAVE to sell their oil in order to feed their people, lest those people revolt and killl off their leaders. Whether we are spendign hundreds of billions per year on parking our military there or not, they have to sell their oil. They really have no choice.\n \n \nThey have a 10,000 troop military, about 2/3 the size of New York City's police force alone. They exist under the umbrella of OUR military. They also make and sell us drugs at a nice profit, while letting US do all the research and development for free. A lot of countries exist under the protection of OUR military.\n\n \n Why do they need our military umbrella? Everybody likes canadians. If you travel abroad, you can avoid a lot fo anti-american hostility by telling people that you are a canadian. Whereas we have decided that we need a massive military in order to carry out interventionist policies around the world, the canadians decided long ago that interventionism was for XXXXXX. It appears that they were right when you look at how much we have spent playing police man to the rest of the world. \n \n \nSo our enemies will go away if we refuse to fight them? Very liberal thinking. \n \n \n No, they willl go away if we quite ticking them off by supporting tyrants.\n \n \nHow could those in the MAJORITY allow this to be? They don't have the same political opinions as you concerning how humans will react as these things unfold. It's about more than numbers. It's about a lot of everyday activity that you, as one person, don't always see.\n\n \n Mostly because the public stays placated through consuption of polished GDP numbers. Americans are not renowned for their intelligence (I know, it is a big surprise for a lot of americans, most of the world thinks you are an idiot). I think it was peter arnet who said \"Americans will put up with everything so long as it does not block traffic\". He was right. Americans don't bother to pay attention to what is going on. As long as we can hop in our SUV and swing though wally world and buy a bunch of cheap garbage, then grab a whopper on the way home, we don't care what is going on.\n \n This is not a case where how humans react really makes a difference (it does, but not as far as the problem goes).

I don't think coal is much deeper than it ever was either. Government regulation goes deep. The US company pays the bill. But it stays in the US so it's okay, right? Let's pretend the US food company has a company store for it's employees. 33% of the US employees screw off all day and produce nothing. But they get a paycheck. They go to the company store and buy as much food as the other 67%. The 67% worked hard for the food for 100% of the people. They only got 67% of what they earned, so they're a little hungry. Suppose next month, 67% screwed off, and this time 33% of the workers did all the work. They'd be really hungry. But the money all stayed in the company didn't it? The more people that screwed off, the worse things got, even though the money all stayed in house. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBring them on. \n\n \n Hey I thought I was George Bush, that's my line. emoticon_xclown \n \n \n \n There used to be a lot of opposition here.

Maybe we are getting close to circles now, but there's a little more ground to cover. You've got at least one stumbling block before you get the rag doll feeling with me. You asked me how old I was, and I answered right away, along with the fact that I was not college educated. I said I wondered how old you were, and have heard nothing yet. I also wonder what university you attended. Georged commented about the bias of radio, TV, and print media. That they are biased to target audiences. He claimed he judges only the actions of politicians. I asked what his information source was, wondering if I could point out to him who their \"target audience\" might be.

About 15 full pages of jobs in every Sunday paper. \n \n \nWho exactly are you thinking we should fire? Us corporate interestes have always been good at cutting employees who are not productive. \n\n \n Thanks for asking! Probably HALF of all do nothing government jobs, most of which were created only recently by bureaucracies whose main objective is to sustain themselves, and grow at taxpayers expense. The EPA and the IRS would be a good start, though there are plenty more. It wouldn't take long to go above and beyond the temporary extra expense of Iraq. With tort reform, we could lose a lot of lawyers, and insurance companies, and they could then go to work producing food. (making actual money for the company)There are private companies that are spawned by the EPA. They're private, so it skews your numbers since they produce nothing. They could get real jobs too. (for an example of that, see \"the cost of environmentalism\" in the environmental forum.) \n \n \n \n \nSorry, it is somehow difficult to tell how much technical information is too much. Yes, I enjoyed china, though I am not real fond of the food. Didn't really miss anything while I was there. Stayed at a very nice luxury hotel and rode around in a limo. The chinese really know how to do their tourism industry right! \n\n \n From what I've seen and heard from others, all countries with US tourists do.

We used them all up. theya re gone. Now in order to get these resources, we have to dig deep into the earth. \n\n \n The EPA will monitor each shovelful.

You think there's absolutely no chance that Saddam didn't have a surprise for us? \n \n \nYou cannot eat oil. The ME is sitting on the biggest oil reserve on the planet, but they have little or nothing as far as other resources go. They HAVE to sell their oil in order to feed their people, lest those people revolt and killl off their leaders. \n\n \n It's tough for oppressed people to revolt. (Hungary, 1956)\n \n \n Whether we are spendign hundreds of billions per year on parking our military there or not, they have to sell their oil.

I'm sure the latter will be the first to go.\n \n www.townhall.com/columnists/jackkemp/jk20041129.shtml\n\n \n \n First here are a couple of links to websites that have the US government debt per year since 1940 upt to 2000 which after wards are just estimates (wrong ones by the way 2004 US government debt is now 7.8 trillion\n \n http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/fed-debt.shtml\n \n The second one is the current account deficit from 1960 to present.\n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/crisis/2003/curracctab.htm\n \n From looking at this data, you can determine that the US government deficit in 1963 was 6 billion dollars. The US government deficit for 2004 is likely to be 440 billion dollars. While I dont know the inflation adjustment for that time frame, I will compare it to cars. I believe a typical car cost about $2000 usd in 1960 a typical car in 2004 is going for $24000 about 12 times. Going by that number the US debt of 63 would be about equal to 70 billion 2004 dollars. \n \n The current account for the US from 1960 untill 1983 has generally been positive except during oil crunches. From 1983 to present there has only been one year with a positive current account number and that was 1991.\n \n This means that their is more money leaving the US in the form of debt then there is coming in. Generally this is something that has to be paid off at some point in time. If the current account deficit was created by purchasing wealth creating equipement like factories or machinery the problems would be mitigated by the growing economic activity. See South Korea during the 90's South Korea had a trade deficit but that deficit was used to build up South Korea's now impressive industrial capacity. Not to fund daily consumable purchases. South Korea is now one of the industrial powers, in the world. Hyundia now builds cars that are just as good as the japanese in initial qualtiy.\n \n The US in general has used its current account deficit to buy consumer goods from Japan and now China. A none productive use of debt, as it doesnt help pay back the debt like a house or a new factory would.\n \n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/crisis/2004/0108imfwarnsus.htm\n \n \nWith its rising budget deficit and ballooning trade imbalance, the United States is running up a foreign debt of such record-breaking proportions that it threatens the financial stability of the global economy, according to a report released Wednesday by the International Monetary Fund. Prepared by a team of I.M.F. economists, the report sounded a loud alarm about the shaky fiscal foundation of the United States, questioning the wisdom of the Bush administration's tax cuts and warning that large budget deficits pose \"significant risks\" not just for the United States but for the rest of the world. \n \n The report warns that the United States' net financial obligations to the rest of the world could be equal to 40 percent of its total economy within a few years - \"an unprecedented level of external debt for a large industrial country,\" according to the fund, that could play havoc with the value of the dollar and international exchange rates. The danger, according to the report, is that the United States' voracious appetite for borrowing could push up global interest rates and thus slow global investment and economic growth. \"Higher borrowing costs abroad would mean that the adverse effects of U.S. fiscal deficits would spill over into global investment and output,\" the report said. \n \n Though the International Monetary Fund has criticized the United States on its budget and trade deficits repeatedly in the last few years, this report was unusually lengthy and pointed. And the I.M.F. went to lengths to publicize the report and seemed intent on getting American attention. \"I think it's encouraging that these are issues that are now at play in the presidential campaign that's just now getting under way,\" said Charles Collyns, deputy director of the I.M.F.'s Western Hemisphere department. \"We're trying to contribute to persuade the climate of public opinion that this is an important issue that has to be dealt with, and political capital will need to be expended.\" \n \n The I.M.F. has often been accused of being an adjunct of the United States, its largest shareholder. But in the report, fund economists warned that the long-term fiscal outlook was far grimmer, predicting that underfunding for Social Security and Medicare will lead to shortages as high as $47 trillion over the next 70 years or nearly 500 percent of the current gross domestic product in the coming decades. \n \n \n\n \n The above snipit for the link indicates that the IMF believes that the US trade deficit and government deficit are likely to become problems. Now before you accuse this being some liberal socialist bull, the IMF and the Worldbank are probably the most hated institutions by anti globalists and by socialists in general.",

   "Sorry, don't have time for a point by point here. I have meetings all mornign then have to be in Pennsylvania this afternoon.\n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/crisis/tables.htm\n \n Has some interesting charts regarding US trade and budget deficits.\n \n Generally, info prior to 1960 is a little hard to come by on the net because there wasn't a problem, so it isn't studied much. \n \n As far as th aarticle by Kemp goes (I have to wonder whether taking economic advice from a football player is really a good idea), it contains several fallacies.\n \n The first is in his argument that interest rates are not tied to the deficit. He is right, they are not. He fronts the ascertation that somwhere along the lines policymakers and the public at large are making poor decisions because they believe they are. This is untrue. Everybody knows they are not. We are not making estimates and policy decisions based on that idiotic fallacy. \n \n Interest rates have always been primarily based on the demand for expansion capitol. this is how the fed manipulates the economy. During tiems of high demand for expansion capitol, interest rates rise, keeping growth in check. During ties of decline in demand for investment capitol, they fall, making borrowing more attractive, thus spurring the economy.\n \n The problem is that we are now raising interest rates, though the demand for expansion capitol is virtually non existant. Our current rate hike and the ones that we have already been warned are coming are the result of poor sales of our bonds. We can no longer talk foreign invesators into financing our debt becuase the dollar is dropping so quickly that to pick up a short term bond issues becaue the rate of inflation is higher than the interest rate. You buy a short term bond today, and you LOOSE money.\n \n The second fallacy presented is that the value of the dollar is tied only to avalable supply. This is untrue. When speculating in currency, the value of any particular currency (since they are no longer backed by gold or silver as a rule) is determined by what you believe the economic condition of the nation issuing the currency is. While supply of greenbacks is certainly an issue, nations generally avoid printing excess currency, so it is usually not really a problem.\n \n Lacking a true standard for the dollar (I.E gold), the only thing really backing the dollar is what is percieved to be the value of the US. \n \n The days are gone when you can lower inflation simply by printing less money. Less than half of the \"money\" we have floating around even actually exists. The majority of our \"money\" is just ones and zeros floating through a computer network somewhere. If everybody went today to withdraw every penny they have, both individuals and corportations, they would be soorely disapointed to find that there are not nearly enough greenbacks to cover all the \"money\" that is out there. \n \n You can certainly RAISE inflation by printing more money, and for all intents and purposes, we are cranking up the printing presses and have been for a while. The last major issuance of US debt was purchased primarily by the Us government, because nobody else was willing to buy it. This is why interest rates are, and will be, going up.\n \n We have NEVER had to do this before. Interest rates have never before been raised simply to make our bonds look more appealing. Our debt has always been finaced on the strenght of the dollar and the relative strenght of the American economy. Now, with the dollar falling and the economy falling in the toilet, foreign investors (and even American investors) are unwilling to buy our bonds. \n \n What kemp is doing is applying 30 yr old economic models to todays economy and they don't work. He even goes so far as to argue that the current deficit, which is one of the things that has primarily driven the dollar through the floor, is unproblematic and that if maintained, will be taken care of by economic growth. What economic growth? He is simply looking at growth in GDP as economic growth overall. Thsi si rediculous. Our GDP has increased primarily due to increased governemtn spending. Production is DOWN. If you look at true economic growth (production and expeditures), the US is experiencing negative growth. For years we used GDP as an indicator of growth (GDO is mostly just a measure of transactions). This doesn't work once you get into a situation where your GDP is primarily driven by the incursion of debt and government spending.\n \n We were talkign about Argentina and their problems earlier in the thread. Go back and look at their GDP for the years in question. It was GREAT. By the old \"High GDP=good economic growth\" formula, they were growing faster than any other nation on the planet. Look at where they are now. The old formula breaks down when your GDP is artificially manipulated (the result of governement spending and debt).",

   "Good post! Using GDP as an indicator of economic health has a lot of people deluding themselves. I recall an article that described the GDP as a \"great adding machine that only adds and does not subtract\".\n\n \n And that is exactly what it is. \n \n The old model of looking primarily at GDP in determining the growth or decline of a nations economy has fallen. It used to be that when nations failed economically despite fairly high GDP numbers, it was considered an abberation. The thing is, these \"abberations\" when viewed together all have common traits such as high personal and public debt, low industrial output, high government spending, a large trade deficit and a currency that falls despite the fact that GDP is up. It is the high governement spending and the high level of debt that floats the GDP numbers. This is how America is floating our GDP right now. \n \n If you take a look at Argentina from 1994-1998, growth was a steady 4%. Inflations was an agreeable 1.8%.\n \n Within 3 years, unemployment was at 25%, inflation was in the triple digits, prices were jumping 10% per month, and theri stock market was declining at a rate of nearly 75% per year.\n \n In 2001, there wa a period of debt refinancing, which they were forced to do at higher interest rates (gee, this sound familiar) in an attempt to keep enoguh cash flowing to keep their people fed and in line. Many economic experts thought that 2001 would be the end of their problems as we saw their GDP begin to struggle out of the pit it was in. This is because they were working the old economic models. Instead, in 2002, the economy finally really crashed. Hyperinflation took over as the Governemtn started buying their own debt since the world would not finanace them anymore at affordable rates. Finally they defaulted on their international debt alltogether. \n \n Unfortunatly if you take an honest look at todays economy in America, you will see that there are definatly some starteling parralels between the economy in Argentina in the late 90's and America today, such as debt rate (public and private), trade deficits, refinancing of debt at higher rates, etc...",

   "Here is another important historical lesson\n \n http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3445928\n \n \nIn 1913, at the height of its empire, Britain was the world's biggest creditor. Within 40 years, after two costly world wars and economic mismanagement, it became a net debtor and the dollar usurped sterling's role. Dislodging an incumbent currency can take years. Sterling maintained a central international role for at least half a century after America's GDP overtook Britain's at the end of the 19th century. But it did eventually lose that status.\n If America continues on its current profligate path, the dollar is likely to suffer a similar fate. But in future no one currency, such as the euro, is likely to take over. Instead, the world might drift towards a multiple reserve-currency system shared among the dollar, the euro and the yen (or indeed the yuan at some time in the future). That still implies a big drop in the long-term share of dollar assets in central banks' vaults and private portfolios. A slow, steady shift out of dollars could perhaps be handled. But if America continues to show such neglect of its own currency, then a fast-falling dollar and rising American interest rates would result. It will be how far and how fast the dollar falls that determines the future for America's economy and the world's. Not even Mr Greenspan can forecast that.\n \n \n\n \n I have previously refered to Britian as an example of what might befall the US. Overall the comparisons are quite similar. The US has/is fought/fighting two major wars in the last 20 years ( cold war, war on terror). The US used to be a creditor nation, like Britain back then, Britain lost its manufacturing lead to the US and partially to Germany, the US lost it to East Asia in particular.",

   "First here are a couple of links to websites that have the US government debt per year since 1940 upt to 2000 which after wards are just estimates (wrong ones by the way 2004 US government debt is now 7.8 trillion\n \n http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/fed-debt.shtml\n \n The second one is the current account deficit from 1960 to present.\n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/crisis/2003/curracctab.htm\n\n \n Good links - the second one with the chart really starting to fall in about 1992. But that wasn't during the current Bush administration. I'm not convinced that our problems are caused by defence spending.\n \n \nFrom looking at this data, you can determine that the US government deficit in 1963 was 6 billion dollars. The US government deficit for 2004 is likely to be 440 billion dollars. While I dont know the inflation adjustment for that time frame, I will compare it to cars. I believe a typical car cost about $2000 usd in 1960 a typical car in 2004 is going for $24000 about 12 times. Going by that number the US debt of 63 would be about equal to 70 billion 2004 dollars. \n\n \n Inflation adjustment probably depends on who is doing the adjusting. I agree that car prices are a good basic way to do it. I'd say you're right on with the $2000 average price for a 1960 car. But I'd bet there are a lot of things that haven't multiplied by 12 since 1960. Car tires and lumber immediately come to my mind. I'm just guessing they haven't gone up that much. What must be remembered is that products go up faster than inflation when there is government meddling involved. Auto pollution mandates, and safety mandates, (mainly airbags) have greatly increased the price of new cars only recently. With the many children who have been decapitated by airbags, and all the resulting legal action and new research and development for better airbags, the newest car prices have increased much more than other products.\n \n \nThe current account for the US from 1960 untill 1983 has generally been positive except during oil crunches. From 1983 to present there has only been one year with a positive current account number and that was 1991.\n\n \n The year that many liberals were screaming that we couldn't afford to remove Saddam Hussien from Kuwait. \n \n \nThis means that their is more money leaving the US in the form of debt then there is coming in. Generally this is something that has to be paid off at some point in time.

South Korea is now one of the industrial powers, in the world. Hyundia now builds cars that are just as good as the japanese in initial qualtiy. \n\n \n This reminds me of a local news report last night. I-75 has a bridge crossing the Ohio river in Cincinnati. 40+ years old - running way over capacity for years - it will become dangerous if not replaced. There has been a lot of hand wringing over it for years. Very costly, I think it was earlier estimated it would take 10 years to do. After a few years of proposals on new configurations etc, the report last night stated that a 5 year, $18 million \"environmental impact study\" will now begin. With this kind of waste and stupidity, we have NO CHANCE of immitating the progress of South Korea, Argentina, or China. Am I blaming America first? No, I'm blaming LIBERALISM first. \n \n \nThe US in general has used its current account deficit to buy consumer goods from Japan and now China.

While a large protion of the world certainly thought they were a bad thing, I don't think that anybody was really surprised to see America hit by a terrorist attack.

No, I'm blaming LIBERALISM first. \n \n I agree with it. But we're stifiled domestically, not by our foriegn policy.\n\n \n Let's consider the fact that Ike initiated the national highway system. The public selling point was WW11 mentality of being at war (fear), legislative reality that our exploding economy would utilize it to produce national wealth. A national fuel tax trust fund, with contributions from a per gallon fuel tax, was established to maintain that system. Including many state owned bridges used to connect main, national arteries under state revenue sharing programs. \n \n Politicians discovered they could raid not only the SS trust, but also the fuel tax trust to cover revenue shortfalls without commiting political suicide by raising taxes. \n \n IMO you're still using political affiliation to rationalize governing errors as the fault of a political party you don't support when all politicians are at fault, not just one party, in bringing us to our current state of economic decline. Following WW11 we were so fat that as a populace we didn't care what they did to get elected or re-elected. Blame is always a personal option?",

   "It seems we are fated for the same kind of \"shocking surprise\" when it comes to our economy and it is a damn shame. The indicators are all there. With the situation the economy is currently in, problems are not a possibility, they are a certainty. It is just a matter of when and how bad.

   "That's a problem with the numbers game. If we have financial problems, and can't compare today's information of failure to yesterdays information of sucess, then it's harder to know what we're doing wrong. \n\n \n While we certainly can't look at numbers from Americas past, there have been antions that had similar figures as far as overall government spending, military spending, debt load, etc.... The closest is pre-WWII germany (before hyperinflation set in). The second closest, in terms of debt and government spending (not so much the military spendging ) is probably argentina from the above examples.\n \n This has never happened in America before, which is why it is so hard to make timeline based projections. This kind of thing has never happened on such a big scale.\n \n \n \n \nWhat do YOU do for a living? Kemp has had more than one job. Have you? I have. I'm currently a - Basic Resource Transfer Specialist :p (I run a dump truck). The hoops I have to jump through to keep it registered and insured would probably boggle the mind of a Chinese basic resource transfer specialist. He would probably be amazed at a couple of environmental stories I could tell also. But he's busy - it takes a lot of basic resources to build six cities the size of NYC.\n\n \n I own a small business that specializes in short run manufaturing and prototyping. I work 80-100 hours per week. I don't have time for more than one job.\n \n I understand what you are saying about government regulations, and particularly the EPA (BELIEVE ME, I would LOVE ot toss those guys up against the wall and shoot them).\n \n \n \nSo he has traditional ways of figuring it, and you have new, progressive ways? And you're a conservative? emoticon_confused \n \n \n No, not new progressive ways. What I am saying is that you can't use 30 yr old economic models to make assumptions about todays economy because the data has changed so drastically. \n \n If you were to decide to apply for a loan today and were trying to decide whether you could afford it or not, you probably would noy pull out financial records from 5 years ago to do your calculations. If you were a Basic Resource Transfer Specialist 5 years ago and were making a salary in the same ballpark as you are today, it wouldn't be so bad. If you were the CEO of Enron 5 years ago, and are a Basic Resource Transfer Specialist today, your figures are going to be WAY off.\n \n This is effectively what a lot of people are doing. They are looking at old economic models to decide how much we can affrod to borrow and what the impact is likely to be on the economy as a whole. We know that back when the US was the worlds top producer and the top creditor nation on the planet, we could borrow x percent of our GDP and the economy would be fine. We knew that it was a sign of expansion int the economy. If we borrow that same percentage of GDP today, when we are running a huge trade deficit and our GDP is driven primarily by massive government spending and debt, it is a whole new ballgame. \n \n \nI can't argue for Kemp. But I have never claimed that we don't have a problem. Your entire argument, and your numbers, show so much economical activity that involves ALL U.S. trade. Our involvement in Iraq is paid for by nothing but TAX dollars. I'd like to see figures on the activity of tax dollars only. How much the US government spends to run itself. You claimed that it doesn't matter how much is spent domestically - it stays in the country. \"It's not really the enemy, foriegn spending is. So in my recent post #73 which you seem to have forgotten about, in my company store example, you say it doesn't matter what percentage of company employees screw off? They get their paychecks and spend their money, that's all that matters? emoticon_confused\n\n \n Sorry, I am not understaing exactly what you are after here. \n \n What I am saying about domestic spending not mattering much is in regards to bankrupting America, which is effectively what is happening with our trade deficits and foreign spending.\n \n It seems that you are alluding more to production figures here. Production figures are important, and failure in production is largely why we are in this mess, as are draconian governement regulation. Companies could no longer afford to keep up with the cost of government regulation and lazy american workers who demanded ever increasing compensation for their time. As a result, they either moved offshore or closed their doors. \n \n I certainly understand what you are saying as far as these things being a problem. I would even agree that these things were the drivng force behind our economic decline. Where is disagree is in that you seem to think that fixing these problems now will solve the problem overall. I think it is too late for that. There is simply too much damage and not enough money left to fix it. \n \n My prediction at this point would be that we are likely to see a major economic downturn in America in the next 3-7 years. I think it will likely be bad enough to make the great depression look like a bad recession. I would say we are likely to see both equity and real estate markets crash, or come close enough that the difference doesn't matter.\n \n I DO think that following this (and we will certainly pull out of it eventually), there will likely be something of a social revolution here. I think we are likely to see a major downturn in the liberal ideals. Hopefully people will learn that your companies cannot run if it costs trillions (nationally) per year to conform to feel good governemtn regulations. While I count myself as an environmentalist, I think our environmental policies need a major overhaul. While workplace safety is very important, I think we need to accept the fact that if you are going to have guys working in an industrial setting, some people are going to get hurt.\n \n The problem, from my point of view, is that our government has reached the point where they feel they need to stick their noses into everything. Everything is regulated, there are rules for evrything you can possibly think of. \n \n I think it was Eisenhower who said:\n \n \"If you want total security, go to prison. There you're fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only thing lacking... is freedom.\" \n \n I don't know if you have ever traveled abroad, but if you do you might note that most places on the planet, the rulesa re a little more relaxed than they ae here. Tehre is not a regulation for everything. The cops are friendly, they don't particularly care to bust you for anything, they are just as likely to start a conversation with you because they think you look interesting. Speeding tickets in many countries are almost unheard of. \n \n This si not true in all countries, but it is in most I have visited and enjoyed. You spend a little time abroad then come back to the states and look around, and can't help asking yourself \"This is freedom?\"\n \n IMHO, the problem is not just public regulation, or regulation of corporate entities, the problem is individual regulation as well. I am starting to wonder if maybe it isn't time to pull out the guns (which we should all have) and toss some politicians against the wall and shoot them, simply so they understand that we REALLY want to be in charge and are more than a little tired of being dictated to. This is something I really have been wrestling with lately. I make a good living under the current system. But I hate the current system and really think it needs to be changed. I really thought that maybe Bush would be tossed out on his posterior NOT because the country is going more liberal, but becuase I really thought that maybe conservatives would be willing to send the message to the republican party that we are not willing to settle for a closet liberal. I thought that maybe enough conservatives were fed up with multi trillion dollar social programs and out of control federal spending and eroding personal freedom that we would be willing to endure 4 years of John Kerry to send the message that we WANT A DAMN CONSERVATIVE. \n \n Instead, we got 4 more years of Bush. So sad.\n \n \nYou still haven't made the case that ONLY foriegn spending is the problem. That we can't afford the Iraq war.\n\n \n The US has finite resources. We are loosing money every year. By spendign billions on an unneeded war, not to mention the billions in bribes and trade concession we gave to form our coalition of the \"willing\", we sent more of our limited, finite money out of the country.",

As has been pointed out before (I think by you), every quarter point that interest goes up, a not insignificant portion of the marlet gets priced out of the game.

Lord T's reference to England's economic decline is well taken.\n\n \n My father and \"the boys\" (myself and 2 brothers) bought a gulfstream a couple years ago. It was an asset of a corporation we purchased jointly and liquidated. It is very nice to be able to fly from point A to point B without having to go through the whole security mess. You walk out to the plane, get in and go. There are generally no metal detectors, body cavity searches, or restrictions on the number of books of matches you can bring on board. Nobody asks to see your papers, and as far as I know, it doesn't matter whether we are on the \"no fly\" list or not (I doubt any of us are on it).\n \n That does bring up a curious question in regards to security. What exactly is keeping us from loading the plane with explosives and flying it into a building? Unless there is some pretty serious security going on that I have never noticed, nothing is keeping us from becoming terrorists and going out in a blaze of glory (except for sommon sense, of course). We have been known to deviate from our flight plan by 3 states and nobody ever says anything.",

   "I'm saying how rapidly any of those scenarios develop, and they will all develop, is what will determine the speed of our continued economic demise. We've antagonized the international community to such an extent that the only assistance we're going to receive from other countries is continued purchase of our treasury issues to keep the government afloat until we're no longer needed as an end market for their production capacity. Even with the collapse of the real estate bubble we're a huge economy and a great number of people will retain their wealth to continue providing a negative trade balance. An AQ attack is a different scenario. That would be an opportunity for the government to expand the military effort, which would replace the transactions lost to commerce from an attack with additional public debt. How long we can keep our public facade of financial well-being, regardless of how and when detrimental events occur, is the only real question. \n \n I left the Corporate world as an officer in 1986. At that time the company I was with had a Canadair Challenger (CEO's aircraft), A Falcon 50 and two Lear 35s at the corporate level. As a cost example, I financed the Challenger for $20.5-million. Operating cost, pilot, fuel and maintenance without debt service, was $800/hr. Not too many companies could afford that, even in that era, but anyone who has ever experienced the convenience of general aviation travel would do it again without cost justification. As our general counsel stated on the side when offering the legal opinion for board approval of the debt (few people realize even a CEO has a somewhat low spending approval number, that most large expenditures require a corporate resolution blessed by the board), if the company flourishes no one will notice. If it fails, so what? In this era of commercial airport security nonsense, I'd think any corporate officer worth his/her salt has private aircraft.",

Spending a few million of someone else's money for the studies instead of shelling out billions they don't have. Up until about 1995, states and counties all over the US were using tax breaks, normally in the form of waived property and infra-structure taxes, to attract new industry.

To me, how we arrived at having enemies is the issue. Our constitution states defense. Our gunboat diplomacy has always been there, but we've really strayed far from that use of 'defense' funds over the past 50-years and it all adds up. \n \n AQ is simple, our unrestricted support of Israel being the only real issue. We continue supporting Israel's policies equals increased hatred and probable attacks from AQ. Iraq is self-explanatory, colonization for purposes of a ME military presence and controlling their natural resource. Do we want those enemies? That seems to be the foreign policy we've followed for decades, turning up the heat to direct intervention with Iraq. What are the gains versus the expense of incurring those enemies? None that I can see. We can buy oil at market prices for far less money than 'spreading democracy'. Why not declare Israel a state or let them go and get everything out in the open?

Our gunboat diplomacy has always been there, but we've really strayed far from that use of 'defense' funds over the past 50-years and it all adds up. \n \n AQ is simple, our unrestricted support of Israel being the only real issue. We continue supporting Israel's policies equals increased hatred and probable attacks from AQ. Iraq is self-explanatory, colonization for purposes of a ME military presence and controlling their natural resource. Do we want those enemies? That seems to be the foreign policy we've followed for decades, turning up the heat to direct intervention with Iraq. What are the gains versus the expense of incurring those enemies? None that I can see. We can buy oil at market prices for far less money than 'spreading democracy'. Why not declare Israel a state or let them go and get everything out in the open? Too many interested parties throwing money at US administration has created a powerful, silent, behind the scenes government.\n\n \n Defence is more than just waiting to be attacked. Nothing but predictable reaction from us helps the enemy to plan. Supporting Israel, encouraging democracy is conservatism. Maintaining that certain cultures are better off without democracy, is liberalism. \n \n \n \n \nI don't see any solutions other than our economic demise. If you have solutions, please share them.\n\n \n Positive waves!! emoticon_idea",

   "Even with the collapse of the real estate bubble we're a huge economy and a great number of people will retain their wealth to continue providing a negative trade balance. An AQ attack is a different scenario. That would be an opportunity for the government to expand the military effort, which would replace the transactions lost to commerce from an attack with additional public debt. How long we can keep our public facade of financial well-being, regardless of how and when detrimental events occur, is the only real question. \n\n \n Evwen following the assumed demise of the real estate market, I would certyianly agree that many will manage to keep their wealth. I think a 30% dip in the market, though, would sunbstantially reduce the amount of assumed nationnal wealth available. Real estate has long been pushed as a \"safe\" investment, and a lot of people have tied their entire savings up in it. \n \n \nI left the Corporate world as an officer in 1986. At that time the company I was with had a Canadair Challenger (CEO's aircraft), A Falcon 50 and two Lear 35s at the corporate level. As a cost example, I financed the Challenger for $20.5-million. Operating cost, pilot, fuel and maintenance without debt service, was $800/hr. Not too many companies could afford that, even in that era, but anyone who has ever experienced the convenience of general aviation travel would do it again without cost justification. As our general counsel stated on the side when offering the legal opinion for board approval of the debt (few people realize even a CEO has a somewhat low spending approval number, that most large expenditures require a corporate resolution blessed by the board), if the company flourishes no one will notice. If it fails, so what? In this era of commercial airport security nonsense, I'd think any corporate officer worth his/her salt has private aircraft.\n\n \n \n We likely would not have the plane if we had to pay cash for it. We bought a bankrupt company that had a LOT in the assets column and realistically not a lot on the liability end. We liquidated the company, tripled our money, and there was still a gulfstream sitting on the runway. \n \n You are entirely correct about the rediculous commercial air travel security nonsense. I don't think people realise how much time this stuff burns. I know when I am running all over the country (something I try to avoid), I certainly don't have time to show up 2 hours early so they can look in my shoes and search through my dirty underwear for explosive devices.",

   "Why can't we look at numbers from America's past? Records weren't kept? How can we be sure that we're getting accurate numbers concerning foreign countries' pasts? I'd rather compare America's current problems to America's past when it did not have those problems and see what we're doing differently. We've fought wars before, more costly and severe than this one.\n\n \n Sure, the numbers are available, the pattern just doesn't fit anymore. \n \n \n \nProbably right, domestic spending may not matter much compared to deficits and foreign spending, but domestic spending and waste can CAUSE trade deficits and foreign spending.\n\n \n Domestic spending is not going to cause trade deficits. We spend 18 million on some idiotic environmental study, that money goes primarily to pay researchers to carry out the study. They take that money and use it to buy stuff. In theory the money should end up in the poscket of manufacturers, who use it to pay their employees, who buy more stuff. It is a big cycle.\n \n The problem with the trade deficit is that Aemrican manufaturing is all but dead. Now people buy stuff and it ends up in some chinese manufacturers pocket.\n \n \n \nThank you, and THAT is what causes trade deficits and foreign spending. The links you have put up show that it's gone up steadily over a number of years, just as our governments size has gone up steadily over a number of years. \n \n \n Yep, thats pretty much it.\n \n \n \nWell wouldn't an effort to fix it maybe soften the blow? Something besides running from our enemies? Some things like term limits for congress, and a line-item veto for the president? Forseeing, and stopping the two big industrial killers - safety and environment special interests? \n \n \n Yes and no. It is really too late for these things. It is only massive government spending, mostly debt drvien, that is keeping our economy running at all. Without it, at this point, we are sunk. The money needs to stay IN THE US, though. \n \n \n \nYes, agreed. I'd never count myself as an environmentalist though. It's hard to separate an environmentalist from an elitist. \n \n \n I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman. It is almost impossible to be a hunter and not an environmentalist to some extent. I want for there to be something left for my kids to enjoy. Unfortunatly a lot of the current environmental polices are the result of fanatics screeching very loundly as opposed to common sense environmental protection measures. \n \n \nAs I said, I believe Americans are somewhat shielded as tourists. If it was all that great in other countries, there would be a noticable exodus from this country. It ain't happinin. Have you ever been to Israel? Wondering if you've ever experienced our type of airport security, only in a lot more places, like banks and shopping centers. No, I haven't traveled to speak of. Briefly to Canada once.\n\n \n Americans visit the tourist traps generally. If you get past the tourist traps, there is a lot out there worth seeing. Americans, as a rule, do not travel. This is unfortuante as there is a lot out there worth seeing.\n \n Yes, I have been to israel. Nasty little racist, fascist country. I would suggest staying away unless you happen to be jewish, in which case you should probably move there and live the rest of your life on the US taxpayers dime.\n \n I am going to jump to another post real quick.\n \n \nDefence is more than just waiting to be attacked. Nothing but predictable reaction from us helps the enemy to plan. Supporting Israel, encouraging democracy is conservatism. Maintaining that certain cultures are better off without democracy, is liberalism. \n \n \n Israel is the biggest welfare state on the planet. Without massive amounts of US aid, israel would collapse in less than 3 months. They have no real industrial infrastructure, nobody on the planet is willing to do business with them, and they survive only by leaching onto the US and pulling billions per year in aid from us.\n \n How is supporting this \"conservative\"? Conservatives traditionally are not big fans of welfare. How is supporting an entire nation conservative?\n \n \n \nI've heard that the U.S. NEVER DID have the natural resources of Africa, or South America. IMHO America didn't become great because of natural resources. A good constitutional foundation and good, diverse people made it great.\n\n \n If not for the lumber, light mining and fur markets, America wouldn't have survived throught he first year. \n \n While it is certainly possible that S America and Africa have more by way of natural resources than America, we had more usefull resources, and resources that were more easily exploitable. While there are certianly vast stands of timber in S America, they are generally not the traditional hardwoods and straight pine that were big sellers on the european market. They have no furbearers that reach prime (becuase it never gets cold) and their mineral deposits are generally more difficult to mine. If you look at some of the early exports from america, I ron ore was a big one. Unlike in S America or Africa where it must be mined, in America we were literally just picking it up off the ground. \n \n There are also overland transport problems when it comes to Africa or S America. Cutting a road through the jungle was certainly not a simple matter. It was not until the french, Germans, and British drive railroads through Africa that the natural resources there had any real value at all.",

   "Too vague. A Whole section of the pie says \"human recources\". I assume social security payments, and welfare payments are all in there. I'd like to see all that broken down. But I'd like to see what that pie looked like 40 years ago.\n \n I'd like to see things like ratios of government employees to population - federal and for each state. For today, and 40 years ago. Government income for nothing but gasoline tax, today and 40 years ago - federal and for each state. The cost of one mile of interstate today and 40 years ago. Federal spending for pork (museums, halls of fame, municipal swimming pools, etc.) today and 40 years ago. A breakdown of federal and state spending for education, today and 40 years ago. \n \n Simple comparisons of federal spending of the past, with today's spending, that a human can understand.

What most people are unable, or unwilling to accept is that they don't apply to our circumstances over the past 15-20 years. From post WW11 until the '70s we literally controlled most world markets and were king of the industrial mountain. That provided a constant influx of new wealth into our country and contributed to our current dilemma, a standard of living that became so high, accompanied by shoddy product quality, that our products were eventually unable to compete in world markets. One could compare 2004 to 1964 all day long and still have apples to oranges. \n \n In the past few years, due to our migration from industrial to service economy, our tax revenue has dropped while our expenses keep going up at a far faster rate than we can afford, so we keep borrowing money to bridge the difference. Forget political loyalties, both parties have been equally fond of spending public money in their quests for popularity. To place our problems on either of the two main, very similar political parties is like a schoolboy blaming everyone else for bad grades. Voters keep approving our government policies, which lays the blame directly at our feet. \n \n The question asked by our creditor nations, the rest of the developed world and myself, is why the US continues to live like a plantation owner after the civil war in that our lifestyle continues at a pre-war level while the plantation decays at a rapid rate. We all know the answer, the US system of government is such that our politicians use borrowed public money to convince the voters that everything is fine, we're just going through a rough patch, and we're still the mightiest nation on the face of the earth. If you don't accept that and continue to finance our drunken spending, we'll use our high priced, low casualty, humanitarian military to ruin your day by putting that exercise on the national credit card. \n \n Blaming liberal or conservative administrations for our problems has no basis. We now have a questionably conservative administration in place, and under that label we're spending, borrowing and expanding government more than any democratic administration ever dreamed of. The fact of the matter is that the general US public is dumb as a post in that like our government, they live their personal lives in a similar manner with no reserves and debt beyond their capability to retire. With an economy bordering on 85% of GDP based on consumer and public spending from debt, with national wealth leaving the country as fast as we can consume imported goods, circumstances have reached the point of a Satchel Page statement, 'Don't look back because something bad might be gaining on you'. In this case, it is. \n \n Until something very nasty happens, and in one form or another it will, things will continue on the same complacent course in our desire for self-denial.",

A variety of political opinion there. \n\n \n No, she was certainly not an obscure nobody. She was commenting outside her field, though, and they just let her ramble on as if she had some kind of idea what she was talking about. Cavuto is a sharp guy, he knows better. He knew she was talking out her back end, and should have said something. She was telling the story that people wanted to hear, though, so they let it go. \n \n Cavuto is not on CNN. He is on fox. I don't watch CNN, too far left. I generally prefer not to watch fox....too far right. I think that MSNBC is pretty good. They tend to cover a little of both sides, but then if you want more perspectiv eont he fascist viewpoint you can change to fox, and if you want to seee what the commies think, you can check out CNN.\n \n I do like to watch Hannity anc Combs sometimes, just becuase I love to hate Sean Hannity. He is an arrogant jerk. I think he actually believes that he is somehow \"beating\" the people who come on the show that disagree with him. In reality he just yells over them and doesn't allow them to say anything.\n \n I liked the one where he was talking to Wesely Clark and Clark pretty much shook him like a rag doll and pulled his stuffing out. \n \n I also like O'reilley. He is another arrogant jerk, but he has interesting stroies and many times, I think, an excellent viewpoint. What bothers me about O'reilley is he has this really nasty tendancy to believe he is speaking for all americans.

   "IMO O'Reilly thinks he speaks for \"all\" Americans, because his experiences and research tells him that's how they ALREADY feel, not that he has influenced them that way.\n\n \n I disagree. It seems like often his views go against the mainstream. There was one particularly annoying time he did this while discussing US soldiers defecting to canda. He told the canadian lady that was his guest on the show that \"If the canadian government does not return these guys, I am telling you there WILL BE a boycott on canadian good in this country\".\n \n From a practical standpoint that is, of course, rediculous. Maybe he is just counting ont he fact that Americans have the attention span of a gerbil and that the minute events stop being reported on the mainstream news, they cease to exist. \n \n \nNot one word tonight from him about the Maryland ecoterrorism. There is simply no excuse for it. That was a bigger current political domestic event than ANYTHING ELSE he had on tonight. \n \n \n I didn't see anything about it on MSNBC or FOX tonight either. Both stations covered the stupid steroids in baseball controversy, though. It seems that we currently are trying to focus the attention of Americans at external enemies instead of drawing attention to fringe movements right here at home. I guess I can kind of understand this, with so many Americans disenfranchised by their government. \n \n There was a series of reports on MSNBC a while back about American militia groups. It was (IIRC) 3 nights. In the 2 weeks following these reports, membership in such groups increased by 30%. They were certianly not portrayed in a flattering light on the news, but it seems that there are plenty of Americans out there who feel that some pretty serious changes need to be made in regards to our government. To put this in perspective, using 2000 numbers, that is 9 million new militia members in the course of 2 weeks.-\n \n \nNo, they're watching Fox. :)\n\n \n If you look at foxes numbers, though, they are not. News stations int eh US enjoy pretty pathetic ratings compared to other countries.

It has been declining since the 60's, except for the 2004 election - the best turnout since 1968.\n\n \n The voter turnout in the last election had little to do with voter knowledge and a lot to do with the strategies of the canidates. Both sides workd VERY hard to send the message that if the other guy was elected, it would be the end of the free world. People actualyl bought this. \n \n From a practical standpoint,t he 2 canidates were running on identical platforms. For months I challenged folks here to explain to me the major differences between the 2 platforms, and nobody was able to. While there were definate small differences between the two, there was no decisive difference big enough to win votes or ignite passions.\n \n I can only imagine that most people picked their canidates name from a hat, or based on party loyalty. The election itself was little more than a smear campaign based almost entirely m y misinformation about the opposing cnaidates viewpoints. It was amazing to me how many rabid Bush supporters were anti kerry because he \"was going to raise taxes for the middle class\". No, he wasn't. In fact, if one bothred to visit his web page, they would find that he planned to LOWER taxes for the middle class. This is just one of many examples.\n \n I still have trouble believeing that people are paying attention when less than a year ago, 40% of the coutnry thought that Osama Bin Laden was the president of Iraq, and Saddam was an active member of Al Queda.

   "I think this is just another symptom of desperation displayed by one of a multitude of groups to regain some semblance of public control from the now professionalized federal government by using legal means. \n\n \n I think this is the exact opposite, a small group using the federal governemnt and the courts as a hammer against the will of a small population. The city seal issue was in a town of less than 2000 people, and they had been using that same seal for over 100 years. It wasn't hurting anybody, and when the city did a poll on the issue (when you have few than 2000 people you can put up a sheet in the grocery store and poll evewrybody), there was not a single local who was for changing the seal. The ACLU, with a history of getting federal court rulings against anything even remotely connected to God in any government was simply fighting an idealogical battle simply for the sake of fighting it. they used the federal court system as a weapon to advance their ideals and force them upon an unsuspecting group of small town folks.\n \n \nUsing those same tactics, two Florida lawyers made a tour of the entire state of Florida by car, photographing every business that didn't comply with handicap access (ramps) to their buildings, federal legislation.

Over 90% of the liability insurance carriers for those businesses settled with the lawyers, opting to avoid substantially greater loss in the courtroom. Who can afford to fight federal legislation? \n \n \n This is the problem. NOBODY can afford to fight federal legislation. Even corporations don't try anymore. When legislation gets passed that they find distasteful or inconvenient, it is cheaper for them to buy their own congressmen and get it changed than it is to actually fight it. \n \n Long gone are the days when we could expect any form of justice. Even if you go to court and win, it is likely to cost you tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to do so, and God help you if you have to pay for appeals. \n \n Personally, I find this extremely troublesome. When you effectively tie your legal system into such knots that a man cannot walk into court, tell his story, and expect justice, there is no justice. When you have activists judges who serve not based on the law, but based on loyalty to their particular political party, thre is certainly no justice there. \n \n \nWhile both actions can be viewed as distasteful and perhaps unnecessary, any public that approves political decisions such as Iraq being accomplished as God's Will, as we're currently being spoon fed, allows both to be viewed as retaliation to a federal government that is shredding our constitutional rights using god and country as a rationale for greater control over the public and for purposes of nation building.

   "I still think it's retaliation using federal legislation and the constitution to achieve personal freedom, though admittedly at some expense to others. Philosophically, not unlike Native Americans using gambling under the sovereignty clause to recover some of their physical property taken by the government (government being the US public voting majority that, like Iraq, approved of geographical expansion using aggression). \n \n Aside from the Native American issue, I'm not condoning either example, just pointing out that people are using the legal system to satisfy individual desires, which means the system as a whole is morally corrupt and not serving the individual with justice.\n\n \n I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. I thought your position was along the lines of \"This is the way justice is supposed to work, with everybody using the system for entirely selfish means\".\n \n I can see now that I was mistaken. Sorry.",

Sorry.\n\n \n No problem, at times I type with my brain semi-engaged and while I understand it, clarity is often lacking in the product. \n \n I think this is an important aspect of morality commonly accepted by the US public. The invasion/occupation of Iraq is now routinely referred to as a humanitarian gesture with religious overtones by including it in the 'War on Terror' image and 'The Will of God' crusader talk. To me, I can't see much difference between that rationalization and our courts awarding someone millions of dollars for spilling hot coffeee in their own lap. We have some real problems with government taking on the role of determining morality and acceptance of same by the general public that will cost us dearly down the road.",
