That lesson has been lost to the left for ages. If JFK were alive he'd have to run as a Republican. He knew the deal with a half dead economy. He cut taxes and got the economy going. All you get with higher taxes is corporations moving jobs and factories off shore. Then there is the problem of all those tax cheats in his administration. You can talk a good game but sooner or later the public will realize the warm stuff running down their leg is not rain despite promises to the contrary.",
