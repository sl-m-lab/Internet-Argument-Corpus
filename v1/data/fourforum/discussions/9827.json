   "I found this article very sadly telling about the views of some toward gays.\n \n Here is the article: School newespaper editorial prompts teacher transfer.\n \n Here is a snip of the article: \nSorrell, who had been an English and journalism instructor at Woodlan Junior-Senior High School, was placed on paid leave March 19, two months after an editorial advocating tolerance of homosexuals ran in Woodlan's student newspaper, The Tomahawk. Sorrell had been the newspaper's adviser.\n \n School officials in the conservative northern Indiana community about 10 miles east of Fort Wayne said Sorrell did not comply with an agreement to alert the principal about controversial articles.\n \n\n \n I finf it very sad that these people consider something advocating tolerance of homosexuals to be \"controversial\". I think it really shows everyone what their biased, fearful views are (possibly even bigoted, from what I know about many of these \"conservative communities\", but I won't make a judgement unless I talk to these people).",

   "I wonder if the editorial had been about the tolerance of any of the other minorities, would the response have been the same? NOT! Just shows us that HATE is still one of the family values taught in all too many Christian Churches. The main reason I have abandoned Christianity for the Pagan way, \n much more tolerance. It was an editorial for the Gods sake, not an article,\n one individuals opinion. The principal should be the one transferred to China or some other Communist country.",

   "Actually IMO, all this shows is that the power these groups have is declining. Arizona voted down a anti-gay marriage bill. The federal laws are going nowhere. The ability of these groups to stop the advance of gays is slowing down. If all they can really do is stop editorials in schools, I don't think there is that much to worry about.",

   ":xbanghead I still think it is wrong to censor school paper editorials, they are nothing but the opinions of the writer. They should not be censored, possibly augmented or adjusted to meet school criteria, but not censored. The principal and school board are way out of line. Not to mention paranoid.",
