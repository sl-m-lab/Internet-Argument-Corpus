   "personally, I have a problem with the manifestation of God's power, or should I say the lack of manifestation. \n \n all the Gospels as well as the book of Acts, not to mention the Old Testament, are saturated with stories of miraculous deeds that are obviously supernatural, provide that they did indeed happen. Specifically in the New Testament, Jesus granted to his disciples the ability to perform the miracles that he did. numerous times he also promised that the same (and even greater) power would be given to everyone that believed on him.\n \n the lifestyle Jesus modelled is very humanly possible, and anyone can follow it: \"love God with all your heart, love others as yourself\". I know I have the discipline within me to do that for the rest of my life. the trade-off of course would be the power to do miracles, just like Jesus did. What troubles me is, if I live that way for the rest of my life, am I guaranteed to obtain the power of God? if living the way Jesus did was so easy, how come nobody else is doing it? and if they are, how come they are not getting the results Jesus got?\n \n Every promise in the Bible is conditional. It got to a point in my mind where I said \"if I hold my end of the bargain, will God hold His?\" In a world where there are so many God-believing Jesus-following people, why isnt there one single miracle being performed, like those in the Bible? why arent whither hands being outstretched? why arent scales falling off blind peoples' eyes? why aren't mountains being moved and storms being calmed?\n \n my problem is this: if the works of Jesus were really possible, why isnt it being done today? if you do what Jesus did, you should get what Jesus got, right? either that or a) nobody is really doing what Jesus did, b) even if you do what Jesus did, you wont get his results, c) Jesus didnt do what the Bible said he did\n \n if a) is true, then Jesus' model of living is not attainable at all, which means that noone is truly a christian. if b) is true, then the works of Jesus may be true, but the conditional promises in the Bible are not. if c) is true, then the Bible contains lies\n \n the thing is, I'm not even that concerned about personally attaining supernatural power. for me its a matter of faith. not all the works Jesus did were physical miracles. but why is it that nobody has supernatural power? not even the people that believe in God for the right reasons have the power to do miracles. is this power attainable at all? is it real?",

   "Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.",

No where does the bible say that God is omnibenevolent in any way. Or even describe Him that way. It is true that God is love. But He is also Just.

But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.\n\n \n \nYou can't avoid the Problem of Evil with semantics. \n\n \n Then why are you playing a game of semantics Matthew? Do you even know what Omnibenevolence means? It is the act of being unconditionally benevolent, or as it applies to humanity, forgiving without any conditions. And we all know that God requires that a price be paid for sin. Either by us, or by receiving what Christ accomplished as propitiation for our sins on the Cross. The word can't be found in any theological studies what so ever. So why do you keep referring to it with the concept of evil? It isn't about evil, it's about forgiveness.\n \n \nIt's a substantive theological problem, which is why theologians have wrestled with it from the beginning. So substitute \"perfectly loving\" for \"omnibenevolent\" if that's a clearer expression of the idea.\n\n \n This is an inaccurate use of an incorrect word, and you SHOULD be aware of that. God is perfectly loving, that's obvious. And His forgiveness is even unconditional once the problem of justice is accounted for. Forgiveness of sin is a universal blanket covering only after we accept it by an act of our individual will. This shows an incredible respect for us by God as He wont force Himself on us at all. We must actively and consciously accept what Christ did on the Cross for us. If God made that decision for us He would be usurping our free will, and God wouldn't do that. \n \n We will either stand before Him and attempt to enter His kingdom by our own merits which all unsaved people will inevitably do, and they will be judged accordingly, or we will stand before Him covered by the blood of Christ in which case we are accepted as unconditionally forgiven for our sins because they are covered, or nullified by the acceptable sacrifice of perfect lamb of God. It's called propitiation of sin. Here's more:\n \n The Gospel is a simple truth. It is the simple truth that Paul preached as recorded in\n 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.\n \n \" Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.\"\n The significance of Christ's death, burial and resurrection is seen in what it accomplished for mankind. The death of anyone is not thought of a \"Good News\" which is literally what the Greek word \"Gospel\" means. Death is the enemy of life and ends our earth existence. Yet, the death of Jesus Christ was unique in the Universe because unlike mortal man, He was God incarnate in Man. In other words, God loved His creation man. Yet man had rebelled against God and sinned against Him. Man being guilty of his sin, is under the sentence or penalty of that sin. Man could not redeem himself, because his sins condemned him. Yet, God in the supreme act of love, came to earth, took the form of a man, and lived on earth a perfect life. At the appointed time, he allowed sinful men, to condemn Him and put Him to death by crucixion. But His death and suffering was not simply physical. His suffering was for the sins of all the world. Mel Gibson, in his movie portrayed Christ's death as horrible and it was. The movie missed the point. His suffering was so much more than just physical suffering. We cannot even imagine was it was like to take the sins of the world on Himself. He was paying the price of our sins, every one of us and for every man that every lived. He did it so that we could receive forgiveness for our sins and eternal life. He did is that we could become, but believing in Him, the children of god.\n No man could die and pay his own sin debt because all men are sinners as Romans 3:10, 23 clearly states: \" As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: . . .For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\"\n \n Only our holy and righteous God and Creator could do that...and He did.\n \n In John 3:18, 26 God says \"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. . . . He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\"\n \n If it were not for Christ's death and atonement, mankind would be in a dilemma. He is under the condemnation of sin, and responsible to God who created him and gave him life. But man, apart from Jesus Christ, has no way for that sin to be atoned for. No forgiveness, no redemption, no hope, no one to turn too, no Savior.\n \n Man has invented other gods, other gospels, and even perverted God's word refusing to accept it. Yet, there is still no other way to have one's sins forgiven and receive eternal life, but God's way.\n \n One important truth is that all the religions and false churches man has devised all have one thing in common. They all have man earning his salvation, by joining a particular church, doing sacraments, rituals, or some act or work. Yet, God's way is simple and is unique in that only biblical Christianity, as learned from God's word has God, giving man salvation freely and God Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ doing what is necessary for to atone from man's sins.Christ Our Propitiation For Sin - 1 John 2:1-2\n \n So to claim that God is omnibenevolent is a false and misleading claim no matter how you cut it. The word isn't dealing with evil, it's dealing with the concept of unconditional forgiveness which is a misrepresentation of Gods complete plan for the redemption of fallen Man. In other words, If God is unconditionally forgiving toward all of humanity, then why did we need a savior to die for our sins in the first place? Jesus reason for coming and His death on the Cross becomes a completely wasted effort and an unnecessary sacrificial act if God is unconditionally forgiving anyway.\n \n So rather than responding by insisting that omnibenevolence has any place in describing Gods character or plan for us, how about you post this imaginary evidence of it being discussed and debated for millennia from any valid theological source at all. I submit that you will only find it in atheist or secular humanist sources which are looking for blanket salvation as a theological buffer zone if you will, in case their rejection of God turns out to be the mistake it is in the end, and He really does exist.",

So for you to have even asked the question in that form was revealing about your depth of understanding of the simple GOSPEL OF SALVATION. That is the point I was and am making regarding the fallacy and use of that word from the get go. You give it validity by using it and it has no place in a serious discussion about the issue of evil in this world because it has no place in Gods solution for the problem of evil. \n \n \n\"If God is omnipotent, then he must be able to prevent evil. If He is perfectly loving, then he must want to do something about evil. Why, then, is there any evil?\"\n\n \n That's simple, and the reason is as obvious and apparent in the human condition today as it was in the garden when we fell from grace through Adam and Eves disobedience. You are doing exactly what the natural man must do and blaming God for the sins of man. The atheist will boldly ask, If there be a God, why is their death, suffering and evil in this world?\n \n But look at the original plan God had for us. He created Man in His image with free will which even Angels don't have; that man was created with the intelligence to name all of the creatures on Earth. God gave him a helpmate and placed them in a Garden where all their physical needs were met. They never would have died in that sinless state and neither would they or their offspring have suffered at all. \n \n But what did they do with that free will? They disobeyed God and ate from the one tree that He disobeyed them to eat from. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil. so our fall was twofold. First, because they disobeyed Him, but secondly, because they now had within them the knowledge of evil, which is why God warned them not to eat of it. And our perfect and Holy God cannot be in the presence of sin so He could no longer walk among us in that state of sin.\n \n But being a loving Father, He created a way to reunite us back to Himself spiritually and undo the separation which was caused by our disobedience to Him. Now, the atheist will ask about now if God really loves us, why did He place that tree in the garden? Why tempt Adam and Eve with such a choice? \n \n The answer is again simple. How will humanity know they have free will if they have no challenges or possible free will choices to make? Oh how cruel God is, He gave them ONE WHOLE CHOICE TO MAKE. ONE THING THEY NEEDED TO OBEY HIM ON IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE FOREVER IN A PARADISE FOR THEM AND ALL OF THEIR OFFSPRING TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LIVING AND LOVING FATHER WHO CREATED THEM FOR FELLOWSHIP. \n \n So God gave to us everything that people believe a good God should have given us and we squandered it selfishly. So what this process is all about for God is to separate the wheat from the Chafe with humanity. Because of our free will, we must consciously choose to have a personal relationship with Him by our own volition. Just as God didn't force Adam and Eve to obey Him, and He allowed them to suffer the consequences of their choice, so is He allowing us the same opportunity in a world which we alone have created with all of the good and evil which is reflected in the hearts and souls of human beings. So stop blaming God!\n \n \nEven if I concede your point about omnibenevolence -- which I am more than happy to do, as it happens -- the Problem of Evil doesn't go away. This is why, as I said, you can't dispel it with semantics.\n \n I mean, do you understand what the Problem of Evil is about? In an admittedly over-simplified nutshell, it's about why God would allow bad things to happen to good people.\n\n \n Because of our free will and because we exist in a fallen world. Are you unaware that satan is the god of this world? He and his minions are dedicated to destroying you and all of humanity in order to prevent God from claiming His loving prize of all the children of humanity who are a reflection of Him because we were made in His awesome image? The only members of His whole creation with free will? We, the children of the King live like beggars in a ghetto of our own making as we act like prodigal sons who prefer to hide from our Father and blame others for our disobedience just as Adam and Eve blamed each other after disobeying Him in the Garden.\n Rev 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\n \n It's about why a loving and omnipotent God allows earthquakes to crush innocent children, or why He allows a man to walk into a church and shoot worshippers to death.\n\n \n The god of this world has power over the elements and would utterly destroy this Earth if he wasn't restrained by God. But that is why I warn this crowd so fervently, because the bible also warns that the day will come when God will withdraw His hand grace and protection from this world when He can no longer take the sin and open rebellion which is crying out to Him more each day. And on that day, evil will run its toll unrestrained, and then God will come and pour out His wrath on evil; in that order. This will occur at the end of the Age. \n \n \nI don't think, as many an atheist has thought, that the problem is necessarily unanswerable. But I also don't think that any answer is easy or obvious or unproblematic. \n\n \n The problem is that God gave man a spiritual handbook as a history of Creation and atheists are such stubborn and sanctimonious pseudo intellectuals that they will and have said since you've been here that Gods book is just mythical nonsense written by Bronze Age sheep herders. So how will they learn the truth if they never seek it. And how will they know the truth ever if you, who claims to know it, sees no reason to defend God against their lies? \n \n Are you getting a glimpse of where I'm coming from Matt? Jesus said \"YOU'RE EITHER FOR ME OR AGAINST ME, YOU EITHER LOVE ME OR YOU HATE ME.\" There are no sidelines in this spiritual battle over mens souls and eternal life. And you are on the wrong side of that battle as it stands today, and I love you enough to tell you the hard truth. \n \n \nDoes the fact that I see it as a legitimate theological problem make me a bad Christian?\n[QUOTE]\n \n No. Asking questions and seeking to learn the truth with an open heart and mind is never wrong. The problem lies in people formulating beliefs based on their own comfort zones and then calling those beliefs \"TRUTH\".\n The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance -- it is the illusion of knowledge.\n DANIEL BOORSTIN\n \nIndeed, Archie.

In short, you are dead wrong and are corrupting the actual truth with your very generalized attack as you make these claims out of context, both actual and historical. You call God a misogynist when it was the Jews who's women had more civil and human rights than any other civilization in the Ancient World. \n \n The bible is clear that God hates divorce, but He instituted it in Israel because men were putting women out of their homes with nothing. No other civilizations had rights like that for women for hundreds of years. You will say how barbaric it was to stone a prostitute by LAW in Israel. How terrible and misogynistic of God. But that's just because you have no moral center to speak of. \n \n You see foundit, in the neighboring countries, prostitution was rampant, but thousands of them were killed each year by savage men who raped and beat them and killed them for sport. After all foundit, prostitutes, much less any women had no rights of protection by law in those barbaric countries. Meanwhile, back in Israel, women were protected, respected and honored as valued citizens who contributed to their Society. And they knew the Law so the thought of demeaning themselves in such a filthy way was beyond comprehension to them. \n \n So you feel free to focus on the law in Israel rather than focus on the reality for the women in other countries where no such laws existed to protect women from ever being forced into such a life of quiet desperation and ultimate futility. So let's talk about true misogyny and then you tell me why you support and promote prostitution when women had no rights of protection at all in those countries? \n \n Also, in the ancient world every king in every kingdom in the known world had private armies which served them only. When those armies traveled the countryside, they had their way with any citizen for any reason they could dream up. If they needed food or money, they just took it from who ever was unfortunate enough to cross their paths. If they didn't like how someone looked at them they could kill them with no concern about legal retribution.\n \n But not in Israel. The very first civilian based police force was founded by God in Israel a thousand years before the concept was accepted anywhere else on Earth. And these weren't just cops. They were boys chosen at birth and raised in the Law their whole lives as they were taught righteous understanding in full knowledge that they were representing Yahweh as a protector and defender of the innocent. Israel had a compassionate and intricate legal system which sought to find the truth rather than just convict the most available suspect while all other countries were tyrannical kingdoms which lacked all civil laws which protected regular citizens. And remember foundit, I'm talking about 1500 BC. Europe was still barbaric during the Dark Ages between 900 and 1400 AD.\n \n As for your claim of slavery, if you bothered seeking the truth of what the bible say's about it, you would see that God opposed slavery. But being the incredible God that He is, who understood that Israel was surrounded by Countries which all practiced this barbaric trade, God instituted Laws for how Jews were to treat slaves and had mandatory freedom clauses built in so slaves of jews knew going in that their eventual freedom was assured during their lifetime. No other Country ever offered this promise to slaves. Jewish slaves were treated as member of the family and could even inherit property like a child would. \n \n Now name for me the other countries which treated their slaves like equals foundit? And why don't you ever complain about all of the other slavery in the Ancient world as you attempt to condemn Israel so absolutely blindly and unfairly as you do? \n \n Now for the so called Genocide: I realize that you refuse to place any biblical historical event in its proper context considering the time in history these events took place, but that is what's required if someone wants to find the truth. The reality is that the land God was leading Moses to was occupied by barbarians who worshiped the Sun and Moon and carved idols out of wood and stone to pray to them. These people were violent and blood thirst kingdoms who usually wouldn't even allow strange tribes to cross their land. \n \n So God ordered Israel to wipe out their enemies before their enemies wiped them out. Also, there was another reason for such complete annihilation, that was in order to prevent the cultures of these heathen Nations from infecting Israel with their heathen and godless customs, and to protect the traditions and Laws which God had given the Jews. I know that concept of wiping the enemy out offends your modern sensibilities, but it was necessary for survival and so they wouldn't live under constant threats of invasion or cultural infection as Israel does today with their neighbors who hate them so passionately. I could go on, but I'm sure none of this will pierce the mill stone which is rolled over the door of your heart. So why bother.",

   "The question remains, and which you are now evading is that the concept or doctrine of omnibenevolence has nothing to do with Gods solution for evil.\n\n \n And I didn't say it did.

I'm not interested in discussing that tangential issue.\n \n \nThat is the point I was and am making regarding the fallacy and use of that word from the get go.

And then you comment only on my statement that it's simple, and misinterpret that simple statement. What's with you Matthew? Are you stroking me? You claim to want to discuss this yet you respond only to the minutia? \n \n \nIn the first place, why would a loving God punish every single human being who would ever live for the sins of one man? Hardly seems fair. But of course, the meaning of the Fall is no less complicated than any other Biblical issue.\n\n \n It's called the sin NATURE Matt. It's a part of our inherited nature since we came from Adam and Eve. Again, God didn't do it and He isn't punishing us. Remember that guy Jesus, the Messiah who died for all of our combined sins once and for all time because He is the perfect lamb of God? A sacrificial lamb if you will; but one who's worthy to die for our sins. Now wrap this around your brain. He is the word of God who called all that is into being according to John 1:1-4. Look it up. He is God who took on flesh, lived among us and then died for our sins in order to redeem us. Does that sound like He's here to punish us, to you? \n \n \nAnd your answer only addresses the moral dimension of the problem. \n\n \n Really? Because I thought I answered the specifics of what and why God has dealt with us as He has, and what we specifically did to get ourselves into this fix. I showed the cause, the effect and the sollution. You got none of that?\n \n \nThere is also what the theologians call \"natural evil\": the suffering uncaused by any human agent. What of the earthquake example? When the rooves of the cathedrals in Lisbon collapsed, they crushed many a babe who had not yet the chance to exercise free will and repent. Why would a loving God allow such suffering?\n\n \n I answered this directly Matt. Are you sure you even read my response? Here, first I described the source of evil in the natural world, I said this:\n \n Because of our free will and because we exist in a fallen world. Are you unaware that satan is the god of this world? He and his minions are dedicated to destroying you and all of humanity in order to prevent God from claiming His loving prize of all the children of humanity who are a reflection of Him because we were made in His awesome image? The only members of His whole creation with free will?

And on that day, evil (satan) will run its toll unrestrained, and then God will pour out His wrath on evil; in that order. This will occur at the end of the Age. \n \n To be more specific and to simplify it, sin is the cause of death, sickness, disease, handicaps, mutations, and every malady which afflicts humanity. The father of lies, or satan is the cause of many natural disasters, pestilence, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and all manner of disasters. I'm not saying that some of them aren't naturally occurring also, but only God knows which is which. \n \n The relevant point is they occur because of sin and a world which is out of spiritual balance and is in rebellion against a holy God. I have told you at least twice now that our war is not between flesh and blood, but between the powers of darkness and light. Our battle in life is a spiritual one. Here's a passage that might give you a bigger picture of what is occurring right now in the world, since we believe that according to prophecy, we are in the end times.\n Mat 24:3 As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will these things happen, and what {will be} the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?\"\n \n Mat 24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, \"See to it that no one misleads you.\n \n Mat 24:5 \"For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.\n \n Mat 24:6 \"You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for {those things} must take place, but {that} is not yet the end.\n \n Mat 24:7 \"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.\n \n Mat 24:8 \"But all these things are {merely} the beginning of birth pangs.\n \n Mat 24:9 \"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\n \n Mat 24:10 \"At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another.\n \n Mat 24:11 \"Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.\n \n Mat 24:12 \"Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold.\n \n Mat 24:13 \"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.\n \n Mat 24:14 \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\n \n Mat 24:15 \"Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),\n \n Mat 24:16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.\n \n Mat 24:17 \"Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house.\n \n Mat 24:18 \"Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.\n \n Mat 24:19 \"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!\n \n Mat 24:20 \"But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath.\n \n Mat 24:21 \"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.\n \n Mat 24:22 \"Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.\n \n Mat 24:23 \"Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There {He is,}' do not believe {him.}\n \n Mat 24:24 \"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.\n \n Mat 24:25 \"Behold, I have told you in advance.\n \n Mat 24:26 \"So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out, {or,} 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe {them.}\n \n Mat 24:27 \"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.\n \n Mat 24:28 \"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\n \n Mat 24:29 \"But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.\n \n Mat 24:30 \"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.\n \n Mat 24:31 \"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n \n Mat 24:32 \"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;\n \n Mat 24:33 so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, {right} at the door.\n \nYou can declare the problem \"simple\" and the answer \"obvious.\" But your declarations don't make it so. You're just stopping the investigation too soon.\n\n \n Like I said above, it was the answer which was simple to give to you. I understand that where people are concerned, nothing is simple or cut and dry. And regarding the investigation, you stopped it by ignoring the meat of my response to you.",

If God wished to give us some hypothetical free-will, and if he were omniscient and omnipotent, he would be smart enough and powerful enough to figure out some way to accomplish that goal without permitting evil to exist. \n \n I will add that Kurt G\u00f6del's discovery of the incompleteness of all systems of knowledge, and the impossibility of onmiscience, in the long run will be more significant in human history than Jesus Christ or all the religions put together.\n \n -",

   "Care to actually support this claim with a rational argument? Specifically, how does Gods omnipotence affect our choice to make individual choices no matter where in time we exist. Let me give you an example to further confuse you and trebor. If you witness a criminal committing a violent crime like shooting someone for example, is your viewing that action changing the outcome of his decision, or his action at all? Of course not. So why do you say that because God sees all, that He is affecting our free will at all? \n\n \n First : I can not prevent a crime, God can\n Second: I don't know the outcome of the crime, maybe the victim defends herself and shoots the criminal dead. \n Third: God knew in advance a crime was going to be committed and did nothing to prevent it. That is criminal\n God knows what we are going to do so we don't have free will, we have an illusion of choicing when in reality the choice has been made already by God, otherwise She wouldn't know until the instant we made a choice, whereas She knows since the beginning of time what choices would we make.\n \n \n \n \nThat's an excellent example of God not interfering with our free will. God surely did know in advance that Eve would sin, but did He decide then, why bother creating this creature in my image? Why bother giving them free will? With all the time and pain I will receive by being rejected by so many of them who will carve false gods out of wood rather than acknowledge me, is it worth it? \n\n \n Where does Evil come from? Not from Adam and Eve for sure. If God created everything and She is Good, where does Evil come from ?\n \n How do you know you have free will, being aware that a choice has been made it is not the same as choosing. You are aware that something in you has decided to go left instead of right. But did you make the decision or being aware of it it seems to you that you made it?\n \n \n \n \nNo, He went forward in spite of people like you deniers of Him ! In spite of the mess we made of this world, and in spite of our current spiritual state as a race, He created us and still loves us so much that He took flesh upon Himself and gave His own life as propitiation for our sins in order to undo what our parents did to cause this separation from Him in the Garden. \n \n How sad that you take every good thing Yahweh has done and pervert it in order to twist it into your personal lie to slander Him with. :xdonno\n\n \n GOD made me do it emoticon_xangel",

Rather than hear my prior response you just ignore it and move on with your blaming God for our actions. You originally said this:\n \n \nWinston Smith \n If God is outside time, in the sense that She knows present, past and future, then free will is an illusion.\n\n \n And I responded with this question which stated that free will is an allusion:\n \n \nCare to actually support this claim with a rational argument? Specifically, how does Gods omnipotence affect our choice to make individual choices no matter where in time we exist. Let me give you an example to further confuse you and trebor. If you witness a criminal committing a violent crime like shooting someone for example, is your viewing that action changing the outcome of his decision, or his action at all? Of course not. So why do you say that because God sees all, that He is affecting our free will at all? \n\n \n I responded by showing that because God can see all doesn't mean He is affecting our free will at all, nor is He obligated to since it was Him who gave us free will to begin with. But now you change the goal post above by showing that you neither understand or appreciate the concept that we have free will and that God wont interfere with that right. But He does warn us that we will reap what we sow. He warns us that there are repercussions for our choices which deny others their rights. But For God to be consistent, He wont deny you the right to commit evil if that is your choice. That doesn't make God evil, that makes you evil. Why can't you grasp that winston? \n \n \nWhere does Evil come from? Not from Adam and Eve for sure. If God created everything and She is Good, where does Evil come from ?\n\n \n Evil existed before creation in the character of satan and his minions who fell from grace when they rebelled against God. So evil is a real energy which existed before we did. But God didn't create humanity with the knowledge of it as is shown in Genesis. God warned Adam and Eve to not eat of that fruit or else they would die (spiritually). But satan didn't understand that aspect of His warning and believed that if he could just get them to eat of that tree, he could destroy humanity through our parents alone thereby preventing Gods plan for a race of children who were created in His image from ever existing. \n \n And your statement that evil didn't come from Adam and Eve is false. We inherited our fallen/sinful nature directly from them who took it upon themselves when they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by an act of their own will. Also, if you truly define evil, it isn't an act, but is a knowledge which lies within us. Only when we act on that knowledge of evil does it become a source of energy which is felt not only by its victim but by those who witness its result.\n \n \nHow do you know you have free will, being aware that a choice has been made it is not the same as choosing. You are aware that something in you has decided to go left instead of right. But did you make the decision or being aware of it it seems to you that you made it?\n\n \n I know I have free will because I have the choice to do what's right or what's wrong, just as you do. Nobody makes us do wrong except us. Just because God is omnipotent and omniscient and omnipresent, it doesn't mean God is obligated to intervene unless He is asked to by us which is what we christians call an answer to prayer. I have had God intervene in my life in times of immediate crisis which resulted in saving my life on at least 3 occasions which I'm aware of. I can't wait to know the actual number of proverbial bullets I've dodged because of His intervention which I was unaware of at the time.\n \n \nGOD made me do it emoticon_xangel\n\n \n Only you made you do it which is why you feel the guilt and conviction for the wrongs you have done. You only blame God in your conscious mind in order to relieve yourself of the responsibility which is yours alone due to your acting upon your own free will. What you MUST grasp is that your denials of Gods spiritual laws don't relieve you of the responsibility which those spiritual laws represent.",

   "So how come some good Angels created by Good God became evil Angels ?\n \n If God is Good where does Evil come from? Simple question Archie\n\n \n If It's such a simple question winny, then why ask it? It's actually a very difficult and complex question and can even vary depending on whose perspective you view it from. In other words, first define what evil is. How do we determine good from evil from our human perspective, and then, how does God define evil? Let me answer the second question first regarding how God defines Lucifers nature of rebellion as evil. Isaiah Said it best:\n \n Isa 14:12 \"How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, [fn] son of the morning! [How] you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations!\n \n Isa 14:13 For you have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north;\n \n Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.'\n \n Isa 14:15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.\n Isn't this passage describing pride? And placing ones self interest above God who is worthy of our praise, respect and honor? Isn't that the sin that leads to the fall of not only Lucifer but of men who deny God the honor He rightfully deserves as the Creator of all that is? \n \n So from our perspective, evil is an action which hurts someone else for the selfish purpose of benefitting the evil doer. This is why dictators, despots, tyrants and those who commit violence against the innocent for selfish purposes are considered evil people. But all those people are actually doing is placing their personal self interests above the welfare of others for selfish reasons. And they are becoming judges over life and death of others in order to accomplish their goal of personal enrichment and to secure or maintain their own hold on personal power. \n \n They fail to understand that all good things come from God, and that their positions of power can only last and benefit others if they take their positions of authority over the lives of others as opportunities to serve the greater good rather than with a sense of entitlement in order to assure their own personal status or security.\n \n As for why good Angels would become evil? It is incomprehensible for me to understand how Angels could exist in Heaven for I don't know how many millions of years before Man was created, and then decide to follow this creature named Lucifer who openly rebelled against the Creator. But here's the rub; it will happen again among the human race before Gods final cleansing of this human condition is accomplished. Let me explain.\n \n After the end of this Age and the coming Tribulation period when Lucifer and his minions along with those who followed him are cast into the lake of fire by the Lord and His army, there will be 1000 years of peace on Earth when the lion will once again lay with the lamb. Jerusalem will be the Center of the Earth and those who survived the tribulation will have children who never personally knew sin or this spiritual battle which we have suffered through. This new generation of people will live in a perfect world of peace where God will once again walk with Man in the cool of the day. \n \n The bible speaks of each believers book of life which tells the stories of our victories and failures in this Age, just as it speaks of the strengths, weaknesses, victories and failures of the great men of the bible. These books of life will be available for study for this generation which will know no death or suffering at all for that millennium of peace.\n \n At the end of this thousand years, Lucifer and his minions will be once again released from the pit in order to tempt humanity for a period of time. Incredibly, a remnant of this humanity which has lived for a thousand years in peace and in the light of Gods love will once again be deceived and will follow satan in one final battle which will result in a final purging of evil and rebellion against God, which as you can see will only require an opportunity in which to show itself once again to become a reality.\n \n But once again, this doesn't reflect on Gods holiness as much as it does on the fickleness of Man as he submits to evil and rebellion when Gods goodness is all around them. Here's how this event is described in Revelation:\n Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.\n \n Rev 20:2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;\n \n Rev 20:3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut {it} and sealed {it} over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.\n \n Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I {saw} the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.\n \n Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,\n \n Rev 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.\n \n Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.\n \n Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n \n Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.\n \n Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one {of them} according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.\n \n Rev 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\n \nGod intervened in human affairs countless of times as told in the Bible so much for free will and bearing the consequences of our decisions.\n\n \n Sure He has. According to His perfect will, and because He is God He has every right to intervene as He sees fit. But this doesn't mean He has prevented us from exercising our individual free will as human beings.\n \n \nIf God knows the future then all your choices are already predetermined and there is no free will, only the appearance of it. You can not seem to grasp this concept at all. You are confusing free will with conscience.\n\n \n I can't grasp it because it just isn't true. The fact that God sees all, plays no part at all in your ability to make free will choices at all. To claim otherwise is evidence that you can't grasp the concept of either omnipotence or free will.\n \n \n Judas was a pawn in God's plan he and as a pawn he was sacrificed and sent to Hell. Oh yes God intervened in human affairs by sending the Son, so much for free will.\n \n Just like Judas whatever I do is what God makes me do.\n\n \n WOW, you speak the exact opposite of what is true in reality. We know that Jesus knew prior to His betrayal that it was Judas who would betray Him. He so much as announced it at the last supper that one of the Apostles would. And being God incarnate He surely had the power to stop Judas from exercising his free will and carrying out his plan to betray Messiah. But what did Jesus say to him? Go and do what you must do. Is that what you call making him a pawn? Or did He, consistent with His nature NOT interfere with Judas plan which would have interfered with his free will? \n \n \nFunny that the Jews don't accept your Messiah, Archie. I wonder why? emoticon_xangel\n\n \n I've explained this spiritual dilemma to you already winny, and it would require too much time and bandwidth to explain it again here. \n \n \nPeople who think are agnostics, those who don't are believers.\n\n \n Does it really sound like I have not thought or have not been thinking based on these answers to your questions I have given here? Why is it that all you have are questions but no rational answers with which to justify your personal beliefs? That's because your personal beliefs are based only in what your own mind and imagination is able to conceive. Where as nothing I have said is my own creation but represent truths which are much greater than me and much deeper than the natural mind can conceive of or even appreciate/grasp. Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.",

This is the first resurrection.\n \n Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,\n \n Rev 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.\n \n Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.\n \n Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n \n Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.\n \n Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one {of them} according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.\n \n Rev 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\n \nGod intervened in human affairs countless of times as told in the Bible so much for free will and bearing the consequences of our decisions.\n\n \n Sure He has. According to His perfect will, and because He is God He has every right to intervene as He sees fit. But this doesn't mean He has prevented us from exercising our individual free will as human beings.\n \n \nIf God knows the future then all your choices are already predetermined and there is no free will, only the appearance of it. You can not seem to grasp this concept at all. You are confusing free will with conscience.\n\n \n I can't grasp it because it just isn't true. The fact that God sees all, plays no part at all in your ability to make free will choices at all. To claim otherwise is evidence that you can't grasp the concept of either omnipotence or free will.\n \n \n Judas was a pawn in God's plan he and as a pawn he was sacrificed and sent to Hell. Oh yes God intervened in human affairs by sending the Son, so much for free will.\n \n Just like Judas whatever I do is what God makes me do.\n\n \n WOW, you speak the exact opposite of what is true in reality. We know that Jesus knew prior to His betrayal that it was Judas who would betray Him. He so much as announced it at the last supper that one of the Apostles would. And being God incarnate He surely had the power to stop Judas from exercising his free will and carrying out his plan to betray Messiah. But what did Jesus say to him? Go and do what you must do. Is that what you call making him a pawn? Or did He, consistent with His nature NOT interfere with Judas plan which would have interfered with his free will? \n \n \nFunny that the Jews don't accept your Messiah, Archie. I wonder why? emoticon_xangel\n\n \n I've explained this spiritual dilemma to you already winny, and it would require too much time and bandwidth to explain it again here. \n \n \nPeople who think are agnostics, those who don't are believers.\n\n \n Does it really sound like I have not thought or have not been thinking based on these answers to your questions I have given here? Why is it that all you have are questions but no rational answers with which to justify your personal beliefs? That's because your personal beliefs are based only in what your own mind and imagination is able to conceive. Where as nothing I have said is my own creation but represent truths which are much greater than me and much deeper than the natural mind can conceive of or even appreciate/grasp. Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.",

   "Originally Posted by Archangel FPRIVATE \"TYPE=PICT;ALT=View Post\" \n I did answer it winston. God gave us free will and Adam and Eve chose disobedience over obedience when by an act of their own free will they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In other words they willingly gave up the innocence He created them with and took on the KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL.\n \n \n Anthony321\n You say they \"willingly\" gave up their innocence and took on the knowledge of evil. To begin with, these \"innocent\" beings were deceived by an evil being. Innocent children would have no concept of evil, no way to sense or detect it either. I do not recall god warning them about a talking serpent who would attempt to deceive them. The evil already existed in the serpent. Had god informed them of how evil talking serpents operate they would have known the serpent was intentionally trying to fool them. But what would that mean to Adam and Eve? After all they only knew innocence. The serpent took advantage of their innocence, but they did not eat of the tree to take advantage of god. God told them one thing and the talking serpent told them another. Without warning innocent children will believe whatever they are told. What kind of parent and/or guardian would leave innocent children unattended? Especially with the knowledge that they will be confronted and deceived by a talking serpent? A serpent who convinces them to eat from the forbidden tree which causes god's perfect creation to fall. I don't know about you but I don't think innocent children should be punished for behaving in the only way their innocence would permit them to behave. They trusted the serpent, for they knew nothing of lies. Lying is evil. God is the bad guy in this story, no way around it. Leaving his children unattended and with no way to defend themselves against what he already knew would bring death upon them.\n \n \n Archangel\n But even then, we as children of Adam must choose to do evil according to our own free will just as they did when they acted in disobedience to Gods very stern warning to avoid only that tree in the garden or they will surely die (spiritually speaking). \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n If they had acted in disobedience KNOWING they were doing the wrong thing you might have a case. But they didn't and you don't.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel\n So evil isn't something to be created, it is something to be known. It stands to reason that where good exists there is also the potential for the opposite of good, which is evil. But God didn't create us evil. He created us in perfect innocence. We chose that route according to our free will.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Along the same lines how would one know if goodness was \"good\" unless they had evil in contrast so as to draw the comparison between the two? If you are god and you create this man and woman in \"perfect innocence\" then their environment must be perfectly innocent as well. Innocence cannot protect itself against this \"evil\" that it has no knowledge of. That would mean killing the serpent before you left your \"perfectly innocent' children unattended in the garden.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel\n And you ignore that it was only God who was capable of undoing that separation that resulted from our fall which He accomplished by Himself becoming man and dying for our sins.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n The separation you speak of is the result of a parent \"asleep\" on the job. And how noble of god to \"undo\" the very problem that he is responsible for.\n \n \n \n Archangel\n You continue to blame Him for our rebellion as you ignore that He has personally sacrificed Himself for our redemption.\n \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Can you call it sacrifice when you rise from the dead and ascend to heaven where you've always been anyway? Where is the sacrifice? Mankind still suffers through hunger, disease, war, etc.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel\n So go ahead and blame God for your sins which only you have chosen to commit, and refuse His offer to save you according to His own sacrifice which paid the price for your sins unconditionally. See how far it gets you.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n God's hand are to blame if you must insist on blame. He is the perfect one, who created the perfect world, that somehow became so imperfect. When a chef has a failure in the kitchen he has only himself to blame. The milk and the eggs are what they are. If they become spoiled during the cooking process, it is still the chef who should have been able to see and remedy that problem. But without an occasional failure, success would have no meaning.................... would it? That is the way I see the creation/redemption story. The fact that you don't is what makes us all unique individuals.",

   "Anthony, here are all of my responses in regard to the question of evil. Read them for my opinion. I see no reason to continue to answer the same question over and over again. There is such a thing as agreeing to disagree on a debate forum and I neither require nor expect unbelievers to comprehend or accept the spiritual answers I give. All I can do is answer the question and allow you to do with it what you will. if you click on the arrow by our names in each quote, it will take you back to the post so you can read the prior post and the complete response in context. Have fun. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nSo how come some good Angels created by Good God became evil Angels ?\n \n If God is Good where does Evil come from? Simple question Archie\n \n \n God intervened in human affairs countless of times as told in the Bible so much for free will and bearing the consequences of our decisions.\n \n \n If God knows the future then all your choices are already predetermined and there is no free will, only the appearance of it. You can not seem to grasp this concept at all. You are confusing free will with conscience. \n \n Judas was a pawn in God's plan he and as a pawn he was sacrificed and sent to Hell. Oh yes God intervened in human affairs by sending the Son, so much for free will.\n \n Just like Judas whatever I do is what God makes me do.\n \n Funny that the Jews don't accept your Messiah, Archie. I wonder why? emoticon_xangel\n \n People who think are agnostics, those who don't are believers.\n\n \n \nIf It's such a simple question winny, then why ask it? It's actually a very difficult and complex question and can even vary depending on whose perspective you view it from. In other words, first define what evil is. How do we determine good from evil from our human perspective, and then, how does God define evil? Let me answer the second question first regarding how God defines Lucifers nature of rebellion as evil. Isaiah Said it best:\n \n Isa 14:12 \"How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, [fn] son of the morning! [How] you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations!\n \n Isa 14:13 For you have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north;\n \n Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.'\n \n Isa 14:15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.\n Isn't this passage describing pride? And placing ones self interest above God who is worthy of our praise, respect and honor? Isn't that the sin that leads to the fall of not only Lucifer but of men who deny God the honor He rightfully deserves as the Creator of all that is? \n \n So from our perspective, evil is an action which hurts someone else for the selfish purpose of benefitting the evil doer. This is why dictators, despots, tyrants and those who commit violence against the innocent for selfish purposes are considered evil people. But all those people are actually doing is placing their personal self interests above the welfare of others for selfish reasons. And they are becoming judges over life and death of others in order to accomplish their goal of personal enrichment and to secure or maintain their own hold on personal power. \n \n They fail to understand that all good things come from God, and that their positions of power can only last and benefit others if they take their positions of authority over the lives of others as opportunities to serve the greater good rather than with a sense of entitlement in order to assure their own personal status or security.\n \n As for why good Angels would become evil? It is incomprehensible for me to understand how Angels could exist in Heaven for I don't know how many millions of years before Man was created, and then decide to follow this creature named Lucifer who openly rebelled against the Creator. But here's the rub; it will happen again among the human race before Gods final cleansing of this human condition is accomplished. Let me explain.\n \n After the end of this Age and the coming Tribulation period when Lucifer and his minions along with those who followed him are cast into the lake of fire by the Lord and His army, there will be 1000 years of peace on Earth when the lion will once again lay with the lamb. Jerusalem will be the Center of the Earth and those who survived the tribulation will have children who never personally knew sin or this spiritual battle which we have suffered through. This new generation of people will live in a perfect world of peace where God will once again walk with Man in the cool of the day. \n \n The bible speaks of each believers book of life which tells the stories of our victories and failures in this Age, just as it speaks of the strengths, weaknesses, victories and failures of the great men of the bible. These books of life will be available for study for this generation which will know no death or suffering at all for that millennium of peace.\n \n At the end of this thousand years, Lucifer and his minions will be once again released from the pit in order to tempt humanity for a period of time. Incredibly, a remnant of this humanity which has lived for a thousand years in peace and in the light of Gods love will once again be deceived and will follow satan in one final battle which will result in a final purging of evil and rebellion against God, which as you can see will only require an opportunity in which to show itself once again to become a reality.\n \n But once again, this doesn't reflect on Gods holiness as much as it does on the fickleness of Man as he submits to evil and rebellion when Gods goodness is all around them. Here's how this event is described in Revelation:\n Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.\n \n Rev 20:2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;\n \n Rev 20:3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut {it} and sealed {it} over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.\n \n Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I {saw} the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.\n \n Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,\n \n Rev 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.\n \n Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.\n \n Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n \n Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.\n \n Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one {of them} according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.\n \n Rev 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\n \n \n Sure He has. According to His perfect will, and because He is God He has every right to intervene as He sees fit. But this doesn't mean He has prevented us from exercising our individual free will as human beings.\n \n \n \n I can't grasp it because it just isn't true. The fact that God sees all, plays no part at all in your ability to make free will choices at all. To claim otherwise is evidence that you can't grasp the concept of either omnipotence or free will.\n \n \n \n WOW, you speak the exact opposite of what is true in reality. We know that Jesus knew prior to His betrayal that it was Judas who would betray Him. He so much as announced it at the last supper that one of the Apostles would. And being God incarnate He surely had the power to stop Judas from exercising his free will and carrying out his plan to betray Messiah. But what did Jesus say to him? Go and do what you must do. Is that what you call making him a pawn? Or did He, consistent with His nature NOT interfere with Judas plan which would have interfered with his free will? \n \n \n \n I've explained this spiritual dilemma to you already winny, and it would require too much time and bandwidth to explain it again here. \n \n \n \n Does it really sound like I have not thought or have not been thinking based on these answers to your questions I have given here? Why is it that all you have are questions but no rational answers with which to justify your personal beliefs? That's because your personal beliefs are based only in what your own mind and imagination is able to conceive. Where as nothing I have said is my own creation but represent truths which are much greater than me and much deeper than the natural mind can conceive of or even appreciate/grasp. Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.\n\n \n \nI asked you a simple question because I thought you could at least answer a simple one. You couldn't .\n All your verbosity and Biblical quotes can't disguise the fact that Evil, pride and it doesn't matter how you define Evil it has to come from God for God created everything and every creature in Heaven and Earth.\n \n So how do you explain Evil in God?\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n If you play with a loaded dice you may think that the outcome of every throw is random but is not.\n \n If God knows all events in advance then there is no free will. You may ponder your choices but you can only make the one He already made for you.\n He controls everything, namely there is no free will\n \n Of course, He is only your God, what your imagination think He is from those books you read, are dragons in the Bible also? I know there is a race of giants in it. \n \n I don't have imagination :)\n\n \n \nOnly the truly uninformed would consider the question of evil to be a simple question winny, which explains your post that ignores everything I wrote. Sorry I wasted my time on you.\n \n \n \n If It's such a simple question winny, then why ask it? It's actually a very difficult and complex question and can even vary depending on whose perspective you view it from. In other words, first define what evil is. How do we determine good from evil from our human perspective, and then, how does God define evil? Let me answer the second question first regarding how God defines Lucifers nature of rebellion as evil. Isaiah Said it best:\n \n Isa 14:12 \"How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, [fn] son of the morning! [How] you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations!\n \n Isa 14:13 For you have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north;\n \n Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.'\n \n Isa 14:15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.\n Isn't this passage describing pride? And placing ones self interest above God who is worthy of our praise, respect and honor? Isn't that the sin that leads to the fall of not only Lucifer but of men who deny God the honor He rightfully deserves as the Creator of all that is? \n \n So from our perspective, evil is an action which hurts someone else for the selfish purpose of benefitting the evil doer. This is why dictators, despots, tyrants and those who commit violence against the innocent for selfish purposes are considered evil people. But all those people are actually doing is placing their personal self interests above the welfare of others for selfish reasons. And they are becoming judges over life and death of others in order to accomplish their goal of personal enrichment and to secure or maintain their own hold on personal power. \n \n They fail to understand that all good things come from God, and that their positions of power can only last and benefit others if they take their positions of authority over the lives of others as opportunities to serve the greater good rather than with a sense of entitlement in order to assure their own personal status or security.\n \n As for why good Angels would become evil? It is incomprehensible for me to understand how Angels could exist in Heaven for I don't know how many millions of years before Man was created, and then decide to follow this creature named Lucifer who openly rebelled against the Creator. But here's the rub; it will happen again among the human race before Gods final cleansing of this human condition is accomplished. Let me explain.\n \n After the end of this Age and the coming Tribulation period when Lucifer and his minions along with those who followed him are cast into the lake of fire by the Lord and His army, there will be 1000 years of peace on Earth when the lion will once again lay with the lamb. Jerusalem will be the Center of the Earth and those who survived the tribulation will have children who never personally knew sin or this spiritual battle which we have suffered through. This new generation of people will live in a perfect world of peace where God will once again walk with Man in the cool of the day. \n \n The bible speaks of each believers book of life which tells the stories of our victories and failures in this Age, just as it speaks of the strengths, weaknesses, victories and failures of the great men of the bible. These books of life will be available for study for this generation which will know no death or suffering at all for that millennium of peace.\n \n At the end of this thousand years, Lucifer and his minions will be once again released from the pit in order to tempt humanity for a period of time. Incredibly, a remnant of this humanity which has lived for a thousand years in peace and in the light of Gods love will once again be deceived and will follow satan in one final battle which will result in a final purging of evil and rebellion against God, which as you can see will only require an opportunity in which to show itself once again to become a reality.\n \n But once again, this doesn't reflect on Gods holiness as much as it does on the fickleness of Man as he submits to evil and rebellion when Gods goodness is all around them. Here's how this event is described in Revelation:\n Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.\n \n Rev 20:2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;\n \n Rev 20:3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut {it} and sealed {it} over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.\n \n Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I {saw} the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.\n \n Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,\n \n Rev 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.\n \n Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.\n \n Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n \n Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.\n \n Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one {of them} according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.

Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.\n\n \n \nI did answer it. You just don't like the answer so in typical fashion you reject it as unanswered.\n \n \n \n It comes from those who do it winston. It's just easier for you to blame God than those who actually commit it by their own free will.\n \n \n \n We will both die one day winston, and you will learn then the true nature of good and evil. Just as your hope for the annihilation of the soul is proven to be as bogus as your understanding of who God is and the holiness which He represents.\n\n \n \nI did answer it winston. God gave us free will and Adam and Eve chose disobedience over obedience when by an act of their own free will they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In other words they willingly gave up the innocence He created them with and took on the KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL. But even then, we as children of Adam must choose to do evil according to our own free will just as they did when they acted in disobedience to Gods very stern warning to avoid only that tree in the garden or they will surely die (spiritually speaking). \n \n So evil isn't something to be created, it is something to be known. It stands to reason that where good exists there is also the potential for the opposite of good, which is evil. But God didn't create us evil. He created us in perfect innocence. We chose that route according to our free will. \n \n And you ignore that it was only God who was capable of undoing that separation that resulted from our fall which He accomplished by Himself becoming man and dying for our sins. You continue to blame Him for our rebellion as you ignore that He has personally sacrificed Himself for our redemption. So go ahead and blame God for your sins which only you have chosen to commit, and refuse His offer to save you according to His own sacrifice which paid the price for your sins unconditionally. See how far it gets you.\n\n \n \nHere; let's try this one more time. Rather than allow your redacted version of what I said to stand, let me just repost my complete post which very clearly explains the scriptural perspective. If it's beyond you to comprehend or accept it then that's fine with me. But please don't attempt to quote sections which break up a full thought that was originally clearly stated. It just exposes your dishonest attempt to ignore what I'm actually saying.\n\n \n \nI've answered it 3 times now. Sorry it's beyond you to comprehend.\n\n \n \nAsked and answered already. Read my multiple answers again, but this time for comprehension.\n",

   "It is my understanding God was the one who created good and evil.\n\n \n What do you base that understanding on charlie? What source of information, what ever it is, or they are that tells you that evil can be either created or destroyed? Doesn't Genesis clearly say that God placed the tree of the KNOWLEDGE of good and evil in the garden? Doesn't that imply that evil is a knowledge to be acted upon rather than a thing to be created? If evil was created, doesn't that imply that it can also be destroyed? Here we see the first references to evil in the bible.\n Gen 2:9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the \"knowledge\" of good and evil.\n \n Gen 2:17 but from the tree of the \"knowledge\" of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.\"If these verses say anything at all, they say that evil is a knowledge to be acted upon, not a thing to be created or destroyed. At that point, Adam and Eve had done nothing evil. All they had was the knowledge of it and that knowledge alone was enough to separate them from God.\n Gen 3:22 Then the LORD God said, \"Behold, the \"man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil\"; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever\"--\n Now, the bible makes clear that God abhors evil, yet here He clearly states that Man has become like Him knowing good and evil. This also implies that although evil is something to be known, it doesn't follow that it must be acted upon since God cannot do evil. Here are the 507 uses of the word evil in the bible so you can see how many times it is referenced and warned against practicing according to Gods holy standards: Blue Letter Bible - Search Results for NASB\n \n \n Here is the last mention of the devil who is the practitioner and promoter of evil in the bible.Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n Notice that even then, God doesn't destroy him but merely separates him and the doers of evil for all time.\n \n \n That is, you had a choice of either choosing the first or latter. That choice was not available when Adam and Eve had no knowledge of it (they were innocent after all so they couldn't know right from wrong). \n\n This is the precise opposite of what was true and happened in reality. Just because A&E were totally innocent prior to eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that in no way nullified their ability to make the choice to eat from it. That is proven in that God warned them not to eat of it or they would surely die. What neither them nor satan understood was that the death would be spiritual, not physical. \n \n \nThere would be no point in his (Gods)\"plan\" if Adam and Eve did NOT eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n \n True. Had we not fallen from grace there would be no need for the salvation which was accomplished when Jesus died on the Cross for our sins. But don't forget that had God not placed at least one free will choice for A&E to have in the garden then the concept that we possessed the power to choose would have been nothing more than lip service on Gods part. He had to offer them the ability to disobey Him in even one place in order to make free will a real and tangible right. \n \n \n Besides who created Satan? If God is an omnipotent being, why couldn't he just kill Satan than and there when he was trying to deceive A & E? \n\n \n Obviously He could have as far as His power is concerned. But this is one of the great theological questions of the Age and all we can do is deduce opinions and theories based on what we know of Gods character. It is my belief based on my knowledge of the bible that God has an everlasting commitment to all created beings never to destroy their essence, for lack of a better word. \n \n I also believe that Gods relationship with the angelic hosts goes beyond human understanding and is based on concepts which we wont appreciate until we get to the other side. But it's evident that no matter what satan does, he will never be destroyed but only restrained from doing any harm at that future judgement. Remember also that the bible clearly say's that hell was created for the devil and his angels, not for human beings.Mat 25:41 \"Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;\n So where as satan and his minions know that their fate is sealed, we have a choice. That is why the bible also gives this warning:1Pe 5:8 Be of sober {spirit,} be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.\n Do you understand the depth of this warning? Let me give you the scriptural interpretation of this. How does a young healthy lion hunt its prey? It stalks them silently and finally pounces on them for a quick and sudden kill. But only old and toothless lions roar fiercely so as to scare and intimidate those they can no longer stand against. That is who satan is today since he was totally defeated and his power over men was neutralized by Jesus death on the Cross which undid the curse of our fallen natures through A&E. Only when we submit to evil by rebelling against God do we fall into the traps and snares of the devil, thereby allowing ourselves to be devoured by him in this spiritual battle.\n \n What does this mean? That we have total victory over this toothless lion who can do nothing more to us than we allow him the power to do. All one need do is receive and accept what Jesus did for us on the Cross.\n \n \nIt's obvious, that God planned it all. After all he knows everything. Not that it makes a difference to me, I'm not really religious anyways.;)\n\n \n What's obvious is that God foresaw it all. And what speaks to His unconditional love for us His creation, is that in spite of all of the heartache, rejection and pain we have caused Him, that He decided to go through with creating Adam and Eve at all. If anything charlie, you should be humbled and appreciative that Gods love for us is so complete that He would stick with us through such a spiritual battle when for the most part so many of us abandoned Him and even reject Him when He Himself paid the ultimate price to redeem us from our own freely chosen fallen nature. Have you responded to Gods unconditional acts of love, mercy and grace for you charlie? \n \n This is why I say that I am not worthy of the grace and mercy which has been shown to me by a perfect and holy God whom I'm not worthy of standing before on my best of days.",

So you can think that you're letting me off of some proverbial hook if you like, but that doesn't let you off of it by any means. Because winny, you must still deal with its affect on the human condition as we all must, or fall victim to the result of it.\n \n Here are my numerous responses to your questions. They reveal very well which one of us has been open and sincere in our exchange regarding the origin and nature of evil.\n \n \nIf God is outside time, in the sense that She knows present, past and future, then free will is an illusion.\n \n If free will is an illusion then God knew that Eve would fail the test and drag poor Adam down with her. And that is one of many examples.\n \n God is devilish then. emoticon_mad\n\n \n \nCare to actually support this claim with a rational argument? Specifically, how does Gods omnipotence affect our choice to make individual choices no matter where in time we exist. Let me give you an example to further confuse you and trebor. If you witness a criminal committing a violent crime like shooting someone for example, is your viewing that action changing the outcome of his decision, or his action at all? Of course not. So why do you say that because God sees all, that He is affecting our free will at all? \n \n \n \n That's an excellent example of God not interfering with our free will. God surely did know in advance that Eve would sin, but did He decide then, why bother creating this creature in my image? Why bother giving them free will? With all the time and pain I will receive by being rejected by so many of them who will carve false gods out of wood rather than acknowledge me, is it worth it? No, He went forward in spite of people like you deniers of Him ! In spite of the mess we made of this world, and in spite of our current spiritual state as a race, He created us and still loves us so much that He took flesh upon Himself and gave His own life as propitiation for our sins in order to undo what our parents did to cause this separation from Him in the Garden. \n \n How sad that you take every good thing Yahweh has done and pervert it in order to twist it into your personal lie to slander Him with. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \nSo, rather than stay on point, you again expand the goal post from God seeing all to now interfering with our free will choices. Rather than hear my prior response you just ignore it and move on with your blaming God for our actions. You originally said this:\n \n \n \n And I responded with this question which stated that free will is an allusion:\n \n \n \n I responded by showing that because God can see all doesn't mean He is affecting our free will at all, nor is He obligated to since it was Him who gave us free will to begin with. But now you change the goal post above by showing that you neither understand or appreciate the concept that we have free will and that God wont interfere with that right. But He does warn us that we will reap what we sow. He warns us that there are repercussions for our choices which deny others their rights. But For God to be consistent, He wont deny you the right to commit evil if that is your choice. That doesn't make God evil, that makes you evil. Why can't you grasp that winston? \n \n \n \n Evil existed before creation in the character of satan and his minions who fell from grace when they rebelled against God. So evil is a real energy which existed before we did. But God didn't create humanity with the knowledge of it as is shown in Genesis. God warned Adam and Eve to not eat of that fruit or else they would die (spiritually). But satan didn't understand that aspect of His warning and believed that if he could just get them to eat of that tree, he could destroy humanity through our parents alone thereby preventing Gods plan for a race of children who were created in His image from ever existing. \n \n And your statement that evil didn't come from Adam and Eve is false. We inherited our fallen/sinful nature directly from them who took it upon themselves when they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by an act of their own will. Also, if you truly define evil, it isn't an act, but is a knowledge which lies within us. Only when we act on that knowledge of evil does it become a source of energy which is felt not only by its victim but by those who witness its result.\n \n \n \n I know I have free will because I have the choice to do what's right or what's wrong, just as you do. Nobody makes us do wrong except us. Just because God is omnipotent and omniscient and omnipresent, it doesn't mean God is obligated to intervene unless He is asked to by us which is what we christians call an answer to prayer. I have had God intervene in my life in times of immediate crisis which resulted in saving my life on at least 3 occasions which I'm aware of. I can't wait to know the actual number of proverbial bullets I've dodged because of His intervention which I was unaware of at the time.\n \n \n \n Only you made you do it which is why you feel the guilt and conviction for the wrongs you have done. You only blame God in your conscious mind in order to relieve yourself of the responsibility which is yours alone due to your acting upon your own free will. What you MUST grasp is that your denials of Gods spiritual laws don't relieve you of the responsibility which those spiritual laws represent.\n\n \n \nIf It's such a simple question winny, then why ask it? It's actually a very difficult and complex question and can even vary depending on whose perspective you view it from. In other words, first define what evil is. How do we determine good from evil from our human perspective, and then, how does God define evil? Let me answer the second question first regarding how God defines Lucifers nature of rebellion as evil. Isaiah Said it best:\n \n Isa 14:12 \"How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, [fn] son of the morning! [How] you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations!\n \n Isa 14:13 For you have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north;\n \n Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.'\n \n Isa 14:15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.\n Isn't this passage describing pride? And placing ones self interest above God who is worthy of our praise, respect and honor? Isn't that the sin that leads to the fall of not only Lucifer but of men who deny God the honor He rightfully deserves as the Creator of all that is? \n \n So from our perspective, evil is an action which hurts someone else for the selfish purpose of benefitting the evil doer. This is why dictators, despots, tyrants and those who commit violence against the innocent for selfish purposes are considered evil people. But all those people are actually doing is placing their personal self interests above the welfare of others for selfish reasons. And they are becoming judges over life and death of others in order to accomplish their goal of personal enrichment and to secure or maintain their own hold on personal power. \n \n They fail to understand that all good things come from God, and that their positions of power can only last and benefit others if they take their positions of authority over the lives of others as opportunities to serve the greater good rather than with a sense of entitlement in order to assure their own personal status or security.\n \n As for why good Angels would become evil? It is incomprehensible for me to understand how Angels could exist in Heaven for I don't know how many millions of years before Man was created, and then decide to follow this creature named Lucifer who openly rebelled against the Creator. But here's the rub; it will happen again among the human race before Gods final cleansing of this human condition is accomplished. Let me explain.\n \n After the end of this Age and the coming Tribulation period when Lucifer and his minions along with those who followed him are cast into the lake of fire by the Lord and His army, there will be 1000 years of peace on Earth when the lion will once again lay with the lamb. Jerusalem will be the Center of the Earth and those who survived the tribulation will have children who never personally knew sin or this spiritual battle which we have suffered through. This new generation of people will live in a perfect world of peace where God will once again walk with Man in the cool of the day. \n \n The bible speaks of each believers book of life which tells the stories of our victories and failures in this Age, just as it speaks of the strengths, weaknesses, victories and failures of the great men of the bible. These books of life will be available for study for this generation which will know no death or suffering at all for that millennium of peace.\n \n At the end of this thousand years, Lucifer and his minions will be once again released from the pit in order to tempt humanity for a period of time. Incredibly, a remnant of this humanity which has lived for a thousand years in peace and in the light of Gods love will once again be deceived and will follow satan in one final battle which will result in a final purging of evil and rebellion against God, which as you can see will only require an opportunity in which to show itself once again to become a reality.\n \n But once again, this doesn't reflect on Gods holiness as much as it does on the fickleness of Man as he submits to evil and rebellion when Gods goodness is all around them. Here's how this event is described in Revelation:\n Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.\n \n Rev 20:2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;\n \n Rev 20:3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut {it} and sealed {it} over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.\n \n Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I {saw} the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.\n \n Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.\n \n Rev 20:7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,\n \n Rev 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.\n \n Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.\n \n Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n \n Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.\n \n Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one {of them} according to their deeds.\n \n Rev 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.\n \n Rev 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\n \n \n Sure He has. According to His perfect will, and because He is God He has every right to intervene as He sees fit. But this doesn't mean He has prevented us from exercising our individual free will as human beings.\n \n \n \n I can't grasp it because it just isn't true. The fact that God sees all, plays no part at all in your ability to make free will choices at all. To claim otherwise is evidence that you can't grasp the concept of either omnipotence or free will.\n \n \n \n WOW, you speak the exact opposite of what is true in reality. We know that Jesus knew prior to His betrayal that it was Judas who would betray Him. He so much as announced it at the last supper that one of the Apostles would. And being God incarnate He surely had the power to stop Judas from exercising his free will and carrying out his plan to betray Messiah. But what did Jesus say to him? Go and do what you must do. Is that what you call making him a pawn? Or did He, consistent with His nature NOT interfere with Judas plan which would have interfered with his free will? \n \n \n \n I've explained this spiritual dilemma to you already winny, and it would require too much time and bandwidth to explain it again here. \n \n \n \n Does it really sound like I have not thought or have not been thinking based on these answers to your questions I have given here? Why is it that all you have are questions but no rational answers with which to justify your personal beliefs? That's because your personal beliefs are based only in what your own mind and imagination is able to conceive. Where as nothing I have said is my own creation but represent truths which are much greater than me and much deeper than the natural mind can conceive of or even appreciate/grasp. Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.\n\n \n \nOnly the truly uninformed would consider the question of evil to be a simple question winny, which explains your post that ignores everything I wrote. Sorry I wasted my time on you.\n \n \n \n If It's such a simple question winny, then why ask it? It's actually a very difficult and complex question and can even vary depending on whose perspective you view it from. In other words, first define what evil is.

Or did He, consistent with His nature NOT interfere with Judas plan which would have interfered with his free will? \n \n \n \n I've explained this spiritual dilemma to you already winny, and it would require too much time and bandwidth to explain it again here. \n \n \n \n Does it really sound like I have not thought or have not been thinking based on these answers to your questions I have given here? Why is it that all you have are questions but no rational answers with which to justify your personal beliefs? That's because your personal beliefs are based only in what your own mind and imagination is able to conceive. Where as nothing I have said is my own creation but represent truths which are much greater than me and much deeper than the natural mind can conceive of or even appreciate/grasp. Which is why I will get no substantial response from you that reflects any depth or spiritual insights at all. You cling to the flesh because you can't see past it or beyond it in order to recognize the spiritual man which exists within you.\n\n \n \nI did answer it. You just don't like the answer so in typical fashion you reject it as unanswered.\n \n \n \n It comes from those who do it winston. It's just easier for you to blame God than those who actually commit it by their own free will.\n \n \n \n We will both die one day winston, and you will learn then the true nature of good and evil. Just as your hope for the annihilation of the soul is proven to be as bogus as your understanding of who God is and the holiness which He represents.\n\n \n \nI did answer it winston. God gave us free will and Adam and Eve chose disobedience over obedience when by an act of their own free will they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In other words they willingly gave up the innocence He created them with and took on the KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL. But even then, we as children of Adam must choose to do evil according to our own free will just as they did when they acted in disobedience to Gods very stern warning to avoid only that tree in the garden or they will surely die (spiritually speaking). \n \n So evil isn't something to be created, it is something to be known. It stands to reason that where good exists there is also the potential for the opposite of good, which is evil. But God didn't create us evil. He created us in perfect innocence. We chose that route according to our free will. \n \n And you ignore that it was only God who was capable of undoing that separation that resulted from our fall which He accomplished by Himself becoming man and dying for our sins. You continue to blame Him for our rebellion as you ignore that He has personally sacrificed Himself for our redemption. So go ahead and blame God for your sins which only you have chosen to commit, and refuse His offer to save you according to His own sacrifice which paid the price for your sins unconditionally. See how far it gets you.\n\n \n \nHere; let's try this one more time. Rather than allow your redacted version of what I said to stand, let me just repost my complete post which very clearly explains the scriptural perspective. If it's beyond you to comprehend or accept it then that's fine with me. But please don't attempt to quote sections which break up a full thought that was originally clearly stated. It just exposes your dishonest attempt to ignore what I'm actually saying.\n\n \n \nI've answered it 3 times now. Sorry it's beyond you to comprehend.\n\n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/342264-post98.html\n\n \n \nIt is my understanding God was the one who created good and evil. That is, you had a choice of either choosing the first or latter. That choice was not available when Adam and Eve had no knowledge of it (they were innocent after all so they couldn't know right from wrong). There would be no point in his (Gods)\"plan\" if Adam and Eve did NOT eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Besides who created Satan? If God is an omnipotent being, why couldn't he just kill Satan than and there when he was trying to deceive A & E? It's obvious, that God planned it all. After all he knows everything. Not that it makes a difference to me, I'm not really religious anyways.;)\n\n \n \nWhat do you base that understanding on charlie? What source of information, what ever it is, or they are that tells you that evil can be either created or destroyed? Doesn't Genesis clearly say that God placed the tree of the KNOWLEDGE of good and evil in the garden? Doesn't that imply that evil is a knowledge to be acted upon rather than a thing to be created? If evil was created, doesn't that imply that it can also be destroyed? Here we see the first references to evil in the bible.\n Gen 2:9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the \"knowledge\" of good and evil.\n \n Gen 2:17 but from the tree of the \"knowledge\" of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.\"If these verses say anything at all, they say that evil is a knowledge to be acted upon, not a thing to be created or destroyed. At that point, Adam and Eve had done nothing evil. All they had was the knowledge of it and that knowledge alone was enough to separate them from God.\n Gen 3:22 Then the LORD God said, \"Behold, the \"man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil\"; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever\"--\n Now, the bible makes clear that God abhors evil, yet here He clearly states that Man has become like Him knowing good and evil. This also implies that although evil is something to be known, it doesn't follow that it must be acted upon since God cannot do evil. Here are the 507 uses of the word evil in the bible so you can see how many times it is referenced and warned against practicing according to Gods holy standards: Blue Letter Bible - Search Results for NASB\n \n \n Here is the last mention of the devil who is the practitioner and promoter of evil in the bible.Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n Notice that even then, God doesn't destroy him but merely separates him and the doers of evil for all time.\n \n \n This is the precise opposite of what was true and happened in reality. Just because A&E were totally innocent prior to eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that in no way nullified their ability to make the choice to eat from it. That is proven in that God warned them not to eat of it or they would surely die. What neither them nor satan understood was that the death would be spiritual, not physical. \n \n \n \n True. Had we not fallen from grace there would be no need for the salvation which was accomplished when Jesus died on the Cross for our sins. But don't forget that had God not placed at least one free will choice for A&E to have in the garden then the concept that we possessed the power to choose would have been nothing more than lip service on Gods part. He had to offer them the ability to disobey Him in even one place in order to make free will a real and tangible right. \n \n \n \n Obviously He could have as far as His power is concerned. But this is one of the great theological questions of the Age and all we can do is deduce opinions and theories based on what we know of Gods character. It is my belief based on my knowledge of the bible that God has an everlasting commitment to all created beings never to destroy their essence, for lack of a better word. \n \n I also believe that Gods relationship with the angelic hosts goes beyond human understanding and is based on concepts which we wont appreciate until we get to the other side. But it's evident that no matter what satan does, he will never be destroyed but only restrained from doing any harm at that future judgement. Remember also that the bible clearly say's that hell was created for the devil and his angels, not for human beings.Mat 25:41 \"Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;\n So where as satan and his minions know that their fate is sealed, we have a choice. That is why the bible also gives this warning:1Pe 5:8 Be of sober {spirit,} be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.\n Do you understand the depth of this warning? Let me give you the scriptural interpretation of this. How does a young healthy lion hunt its prey? It stalks them silently and finally pounces on them for a quick and sudden kill. But only old and toothless lions roar fiercely so as to scare and intimidate those they can no longer stand against. That is who satan is today since he was totally defeated and his power over men was neutralized by Jesus death on the Cross which undid the curse of our fallen natures through A&E. Only when we submit to evil by rebelling against God do we fall into the traps and snares of the devil, thereby allowing ourselves to be devoured by him in this spiritual battle.\n \n What does this mean? That we have total victory over this toothless lion who can do nothing more to us than we allow him the power to do. All one need do is receive and accept what Jesus did for us on the Cross.\n \n \n \n What's obvious is that God foresaw it all. And what speaks to His unconditional love for us His creation, is that in spite of all of the heartache, rejection and pain we have caused Him, that He decided to go through with creating Adam and Eve at all. If anything charlie, you should be humbled and appreciative that Gods love for us is so complete that He would stick with us through such a spiritual battle when for the most part so many of us abandoned Him and even reject Him when He Himself paid the ultimate price to redeem us from our own freely chosen fallen nature. Have you responded to Gods unconditional acts of love, mercy and grace for you charlie? \n \n This is why I say that I am not worthy of the grace and mercy which has been shown to me by a perfect and holy God whom I'm not worthy of standing before on my best of days.\n\n \n \nI think what Archie is stating is that evil is NOT a THING but and ACTION.\n \n You don't create an action...you merely lable it as being good or evil.\n \n God pretty much says that doing what he wants you to do is good and not doing it, or doing something he says not to do is evil.\n \n In the end, god is not a god of good or even evil but of dictatorial laws.\n\n \n \nActually, God is holy and perfectly righteous in all ways. And to put this as simply as possible, just as a parent first warns their child not to do what the parent deems dangerous, unhealthy or risky, and then disciplines him for doing it, so will we find out someday that our heavenly father was protecting us in the same exact way and was motivated by the same exact type of love for us as a parent has for his/her child. \n \n To first think, and then express that God has laws for us simply to lord them over us like some sadistic ogre just reveals how clueless you are regarding His true nature.\n \n Mat 7:8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\n \n Mat 7:9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?\n \n Mat 7:10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?\n \n Mat 7:11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!\n He loves us as a parent loves a child, and that love goes much deeper than just giving us good things. It also entails warning us about dangers we are unable to recognize.\n\n \n \nWhy?\n Just cause God (or one of his followers) told you to think that way?\n Your followon quote of the bible demonstrates the answer is \"yes\".\n \n \n \n Yeah.\n So when dad beats you unconscious for being out too late, he's only looking out for your own good! emoticon_xgood\n < end sarcasm <\n \n In the real world with real parents, we realize that parents can go \"too far\" some times. They can do things which actually harm the child, even if the parent has \"good intentions\".\n People evaluate parental actions, and decide if a line has been crossed.\n \n In the theological world, some Christians refuse to think about even the existence of such a line.\n God is assumed to be perfect and good. Examples where he endorsed slavery, misogyny, or genocide are to be ignored, or to be regarded as \"for our own good\". Promises of eternal torture and hellfire are to be regarded as \"God knows best\".\n And if anybody has any doubts on that, a good Christian is supposed to refer back to the original \"God is assumed to be perfect and good\"...\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n \n \n \n You know, a lot of people will treat another person kindly if that \"other person\" sucks up obediently, without question, to the original person.\n That's just a know-brainer.\n There is a proverb about how a man can be judged (at least in some ways) by how he treats his *enemies*.\n \n And since we're all supposed to be God's children, promising eternal torture for those who don't fall in line says something pretty devastating about that theoretical omnipotent entity....\n\n \n \nYou were right the first time, it was God by way of His Holy Spirit which fills me with an indescribable joy which is beyond human understanding. I truly wish you could relate to what I know to be so true.\n \n \n \n My dad never beat me ever, at all. And neither has my heavenly Father. God chastens those whom He loves. And why do you blame God for the actions of sinful men and women who weren't acting according to His perfect will? It makes no sense as you place your blame in all the wrong places. \n \n \n \n We've been through this same line of dishonest and irrational argument before, and you ran away from my answer then also. So here it is again.\n 4Forum Political Debates and Polls\n \n \n \n Talk about<b></b>:\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n Lather, rinse, repeat...\n \n You constantly blame God for the choices men freely make after God has supplied all of the avenues of escape from the danger and harm that those choices lead to. But I've been here long enough to know that you refuse to look inward when you can just as easily blame God for your sins. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \nwhere does sin come from Archie? :)\n\n \n \nLike everything else I've posted in answer to this question, this too is probably too deep for you to comprehend. But hey, nobody can accuse me of not trying to reach you. HERE\n",

Archie doesn't.\n\n \n As you post this single verse out of context and claim some imaginary interpretation as if it proves that God created evil, or does evil. Let's look at it in context to the statement He was making and we'll see if any of you still want to defend it as absolute truth. Also, let me ask you this; If God takes the prosperity that a proud and haughty man, for example, has experienced due to Gods blessing, away from that man, is that not a disaster in that persons life? Are you so hungry to attribute evil to God that you can't see that He uses Disaster as the opposite of prosperity in this passage, and not as the opposite of safety or peace, or some other word which connotes physical safety as opposed to physical harm? So once again you are wrong winny, I'm telling you this verse has nothing at all to do with physical calamities at all as charlie phrased it.\n \n \n 5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; \n apart from me there is no God. \n I will strengthen you, \n though you have not acknowledged me,\n \n 6 so that from the rising of the sun \n to the place of its setting \n men may know there is none besides me. \n I am the LORD, and there is no other.\n \n 7 I form the light and create darkness, \n I bring prosperity and create disaster; \n I, the LORD, do all these things.\n \n 8 \"You heavens above, rain down righteousness; \n let the clouds shower it down. \n Let the earth open wide, \n let salvation spring up, \n let righteousness grow with it; \n I, the LORD, have created it.\n \n 9 \"Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker, \n to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground. \n Does the clay say to the potter, \n 'What are you making?' \n Does your work say, \n 'He has no hands'?\n \n 10 Woe to him who says to his father, \n 'What have you begotten?' \n or to his mother, \n 'What have you brought to birth?'\n \n 11 \"This is what the LORD says- \n the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: \n Concerning things to come, \n do you question me about my children, \n or give me orders about the work of my hands?\n \n 12 It is I who made the earth \n and created mankind upon it. \n My own hands stretched out the heavens; \n I marshaled their starry hosts. \n As God declares that it was Him who made the earth and mankind, the universe and the stars, will you also defend with me the truth in that statement?

He understood that Man would be above the Angelic hosts by their very natures and independence to act apart from Gods specific will. I liken the difference in our relationships to a servant with very specific responsibilities which that servant may never stray from under any circumstances. If he does, he will be fired and never be forgiven for his independent actions or rehired again. This describes the Angels place in Gods hierarchy.\n \n But Man with our free will also has the freedom of self determination. But with the gift of being created in Gods image with free will, we also possess the ability to come before our Father, repent for our rebellion and He will forgive us and accept us back into the fold. So self determination and free will are two very different characteristics since one allows for free thought and independent actions, where as the other holds one eternally responsible for acting independent of Gods will with no avenue for redemption. \n \n Simply put, if the fallen Angels had free will as Man does, then simply refusing to serve this new creation of Gods wouldn't be unforgivable at all but there would an avenue open for God to forgive them and welcome them back into the fold. \n However, no scripture declares that angels have no free will. From the fact of the fall of so many of them, they obviously have some form of self- determination. That is, they have the freedom to remain in that holy estate into which they were placed by creation or to leave their first estate for a lower one. \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day\" (Jude 1:6). Clearly, they are not robots unable to do anything but obey God.\n \n However, their condition is not like that of man. Man can be redeemed from his fallen state by the applied blood of Jesus Christ. The fallen angels have no means by which they can return to their first estate after they leave it. They will all be cast into the \"everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\" (Matthew 25:41). Also, there is no mix of obedience with disobedience in the angels as there often is in regenerate man. The angels in heaven perform the commandments of God with full obedience (Psalm 103:20-21).

   "So you didn't spot the bit where he tries to redefine what free will is.\n \n Let me show you.\n \n \n Yippee! He admits it. Okay, he still can't spell 'says' despite previous corrections, but he does admit that angels have the ability to self determine their actions. That is free will.\n \n But wait\n \n \n See? That bit where he redefines free will as the ability to be forgiven for your actions. That is what is actually called 'grace'.\n \n \n And just to rub it in, we have this bit which states that Lucifer decided to act of his own free will because he was jealous that man would have free will.\n \n \n And here again, where he tries to say that free will and self-determination are two different things.\n \n Spot it this time?\n \n Just as a little addition, let's look at how the Chambers English Dictionary describes free will.\n \n free'-will' freedom of the will from restraint: liberty of choice: the power of self-determination.\n \n Ta'dah! . . . Got it now?\n\n \n The only problem with your distorted interpretation of my post is that mans definition of the words we use don't necessarily line up with Gods application of His eternal principles. What it comes down to, is that if Angels had free will as man does, then the fallen Angels could also be forgiven for their rebellion against God as we can. It's also interesting how you focus your criticism on my opinion while ignoring the link on the subject which confirms what I have said all along about this issue. Now feel free to distort that too.\n \n \nThis link of gansaos is actually very good and explains very well what I have argued here before. It properly say's that Angels DO have the power of self determination, which is evident in their ability to rebel against God when He determined to create Man in His image. What they don't possess is the true evidence of God given free will which is to be redeemed from our fallen state once we rebelled against God. \n \n Lucifer understood very well that when God said let us make Man in our image what that entailed in its entirety, which is why he said he wouldn't serve Man. He understood that Man would be above the Angelic hosts by their very natures and independence to act apart from Gods specific will. I liken the difference in our relationships to a servant with very specific responsibilities which that servant may never stray from under any circumstances. If he does, he will be fired and never be forgiven for his independent actions or rehired again. This describes the Angels place in Gods hierarchy.\n \n But Man with our free will also has the freedom of self determination. But with the gift of being created in Gods image with free will, we also possess the ability to come before our Father, repent for our rebellion and He will forgive us and accept us back into the fold. So self determination and free will are two very different characteristics since one allows for free thought and independent actions, where as the other holds one eternally responsible for acting independent of Gods will with no avenue for redemption. \n \n Simply put, if the fallen Angels had free will as Man does, then simply refusing to serve this new creation of Gods wouldn't be unforgivable at all but there would an avenue open for God to forgive them and welcome them back into the fold. \n However, no scripture declares that angels have no free will. From the fact of the fall of so many of them, they obviously have some form of self- determination. That is, they have the freedom to remain in that holy estate into which they were placed by creation or to leave their first estate for a lower one. \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day\" (Jude 1:6). Clearly, they are not robots unable to do anything but obey God.\n \n However, their condition is not like that of man. Man can be redeemed from his fallen state by the applied blood of Jesus Christ. The fallen angels have no means by which they can return to their first estate after they leave it. They will all be cast into the \"everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\" (Matthew 25:41). Also, there is no mix of obedience with disobedience in the angels as there often is in regenerate man. The angels in heaven perform the commandments of God with full obedience (Psalm 103:20-21). The fallen angels are simply \"the angels that sinned\" (2Peter 2:4). No good is seen in them.\n",

It's also interesting how you focus your criticism on my opinion while ignoring the link on the subject which confirms what I have said all along about this issue. Now feel free to distort that too.\n\n This is brilliant. Apparently god has a dodgy dictionary too.\n \n Seriously though, you accuse me of ignoring the link on the subject. Let's have a look at it in detail.\n \n \nQ: I was always taught that Angels could do nothing on their own. They were created to do God's will and had no free will of their own. Then I hear Satan rebelled against God and 1/3 of the Angels followed him. How can this be if they have no free will?\n \n A: The heavenly angels gladly and completely do the bidding of God. Psalm 103:20-21 states, \"Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.\" Their purpose is to do His commandments, hearken to His voice, and do His pleasure. \n \n However, no scripture declares that angels have no free will. From the fact of the fall of so many of them, they obviously have some form of self- etermination. That is, they have the freedom to remain in that holy estate into which they were placed by creation or to leave their first estate for a lower one. \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day\" (Jude 1:6). Clearly, they are not robots unable to do anything but obey God. \n \n However, their condition is not like that of man. Man can be redeemed from his fallen state by the applied blood of Jesus Christ. The fallen angels have no means by which they can return to their first estate after they leave it. They will all be cast into the \"everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\" (Matthew 25:41). Also, there is no mix of obedience with disobedience in the angels as there often is in regenerate man. The angels in heaven perform the commandments of God with full obedience (Psalm 103:20-21). The fallen angels are simply \"the angels that sinned\" (2Peter 2:4). No good is seen in them. \n \n We will probably never be able to grasp with fullness the reason for the angels to rebel against God and leave their heavenly estate. They saw God in His absolute glory and holiness. They saw the greatness of His power. What could they hope to gain by a rebellion against such a God? However, scripture does reveal the initial motivation of their rebellion. From a study of Satan and his part in leading the rebellion, we know that their rebellion was fueled by willful pride. Isaiah 14:12-15 gives important insight into this matter. In this passage, Satan (as Lucifer) states five times, \"I will.\" Especially revealing is his fifth declaration: \"I will be like the most High\" (Isaiah 14:14). He did not desire to submit to the will and glory of God, but rather wanted to be like God himself. \n \n This was pride. The bishop, or pastor, is not to be \"a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil\" (1Timothy 3:6). The devil fell into condemnation because he was lifted up with pride. He refused to submit to the will of the Father, lost his first estate, and has taken many of the angels with him. His \"tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth\" (Revelation 12:4). \n \n The angels do not have a sin nature. We have one because of our descent from Adam. All angels have been directly created by God and must have been created with a holy nature. Therefore, they never have the mix of good and bad often found in men. However, they were created with the ability and responsibility of self-determination. They can choose to leave the estate of heaven by an act of will. Or, they can choose to stay with God. Those who leave, do so in order to be gods. Satan is the \"the god of this world\" (2Corinthians 4:4). Satan's motivation is further revealed in his temptation of Adam and Eve in the Garden. He told them, \"and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil\" (Genesis 3:5). That is what moved him to rebel and that is what he used on Eve. \n \n Understanding this helps with another verse. 1Corinthians 11:10 states, \"For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.\" The passage in 1Corinthians is dealing with the outward submission of the woman. Her external act of submission is important \"because of the angels.\" I take that to mean that ladies who submit to their husbands, not because he is any better than her but simply because it is God's way, provide an excellent example to the angels in heaven. If she can submit to her husband with all his faults and problems, then certainly the angels should be able to submit to the Holy God. \n \n I hope my comments have been helpful. \n \n Till He comes, \n \n Pastor David Reagan\n\n I have highlighted all the 'will's (though some of them are just from the verb 'to do', like 'I will').\n \n I fully admit that it says that angels have self-determination. I also admit that the passage says that angels either choose to submit to god's will or choose to leave the estate of heaven and be cast into everlasting fire. I also admit that it says that 'their condition is not like that of man', meaning the angels, but nowhere in that passage does it say that there is some special form of 'free will' that is defined by god that happens to have the same meaning as grace. That is purely your dillusion.\n \n It even specifically states . . . \n \n \nHowever, no scripture declares that angels have no free will.\n\n If I have missed something in this passage please point it out to me. Or you can just admit that you're wrong. That would be a miracle in itself.",

I could have taken your post and declared that it made no sense( you left a letter off of a word).\n \n I would say that they had the same free will as a soldier has to leave the battlefield and his friends behind or a father has to leave his family behind just at the moment they need to be defended.\n \n \n I am confused as you think that my respect is missplaced .\n Why should I not respect a man because of your hair splitting?\n Strange....\n\n Then please take my entire post and show me where it makes no sense.\n \n You are correct in that angels (if they existed) would have the same free will as a soldier or father, but both of those example still have free will. The quality you are looking at is that of accepting the consequences for one's action. That is not free will.\n \n As to why I feel your respect is missplaced. I fail to see how you can respect someone who appears incapable of accepting that they may be wrong, someone who twists and squirms every time someone points out their errors, even to the extent of trying to redefine words so that they can declare themselves to be right. If you feel that these qualities are in some way admirable then there is nothing I can do for you.\n \n I will accept that you may respect other qualities that he may possess, but to respect someone as a whole who displays such an extreme level of both ignorance and arrogance is, in my opinion, incredibly misguided.",

   "You were right the first time, it was God by way of His Holy Spirit which fills me with an indescribable joy which is beyond human understanding. I truly wish you could relate to what I know to be so true.\n\n The bible talks about knowing a person by their fruits. (Matthew 7:16)\n Judging by your \"fruits\" of your \"labor\", any \"joy\" you feel would come from a misplaced pretense of superiority.\n Your actions show no real divine \"joy\".\n \n \n \nMy dad never beat me ever, at all. And neither has my heavenly Father. God chastens those whom He loves. And why do you blame God for the actions of sinful men and women who weren't acting according to His perfect will? It makes no sense as you place your blame in all the wrong places.\n\n The real source of my complaint on this issue lies with people who proclaim to be following a philosophy, supposedly laid down by \"God\".\n You fail to recognize the real problem in the analogy I proposed.\n \n Suppose it is an earthly father's \"perfect will\" for his son to \"act according\" to a specified curfew.\n The son misses the curfew.\n The father beats the son unconscious.\n \n While the son's curfew may be for the PURPOSE of a \"good\", the PUNISHMENT for violation is ridiculously extreme and out of touch with what most rational people would recognize as \"love\".\n For the most part, most Christians can follow the logic up to this stage...\n But if we change the analogy and claim it's a \"heavenly\" father, suddenly the analysis on the punishment gets thrown out the window and ignored. Suddenly, the realization that people can question the justness and appropriateness of a punishment is ignored in favor of blindly adhering to what they have been told to think...\n \n So, when the heavenly father promises to TORTURE FOR ETERNITY the people he claims to \"love\", we musn't question him.\n And please note, none of this addresses the \"justness\" of the actual law. None of this questions whether or not the \"perfect will\" is good or bad.\n So, it may be entirely possible that the person involved DESERVES some form of punishment for the transgression at hand.\n But the DEGREE of punishment which God promises? THAT is the issue.\n THAT is the issue you want to ignore while fixating on the person's guilt.\n \n So, by analogy, Archie would be saying that the son should not have broken the curfew, and ignore the physical abuse that the earthly father dishes out against his son...\n \n \n \nWe've been through this same line of dishonest and irrational argument before, and you ran away from my answer then also. So here it is again.\n 4Forum Political Debates and Polls\n\n 1) Archie, there is nothing \"dishonest\" about my statements.\n 2) \"irrational\"? Puh-leaze!\n 3) I did not \"run away\". Considering how many of my post responses to you that you have failed to counter, I don't think you want to establish a practice of blindly labelling that as \"running away\".\n \n But let's insert your \"responses\" here and address them...\n \n \nIn short, you are dead wrong and are corrupting the actual truth with your very generalized attack as you make these claims out of context, both actual and historical. You call God a misogynist when it was the Jews who's women had more civil and human rights than any other civilization in the Ancient World.\n\n So?\n Suppose we lived in a world where most people believed in black slavery, and beat their slaves for sport.\n Along comes \"John\", who owns slaves. He thinks blacks are an inferior group, but he does not beat his slaves, but cares for them like pets.\n John is still a racist.\n \n Furthermore, the Hebrew God is supposed to be unchanging, as are his supposed standards and laws.\n Ergo, what the biblical law commanded in biblical times SHOULD BE POLICY TODAY.\n The same misogynistic ideals that include women forbidden to teach or have authority over men are STILL (supposedly) God's word today.\n \n Finally, I reject the pretense that the Jews women \"had more civil and human rights\".\n If a woman was raped, the rapist could BUY the woman as a wife.\n Name me ANY other civilization which practiced such absurd barbarism towards their women!\n \n \n \nThe bible is clear that God hates divorce, but He instituted it in Israel because men were putting women out of their homes with nothing. No other civilizations had rights like that for women for hundreds of years.\n\n What you're doing is trying to parade people around the slaves' quarters, pointing out how clean their quarters are kept, while ignoring the VERY REAL ABUSES that were going on.\n \n Your God is against divorce. That much is true.\n The rest? I find it hilarious for one such as you who discourages gay marriage as an \"attack on marriage\" to pretend that is the reason for God's policy on divorce. The whole violation of the \"sanctity\" of divorce is okay then? As long as the woman is cared for?\n \n \n \nYou will say how barbaric it was to stone a prostitute by LAW in Israel. How terrible and misogynistic of God. But that's just because you have no moral center to speak of.\n\n And there's a personal attack.\n I have a moral center. One that isn't dictated by what others tell me to think.\n I never brought up stoning a prostitute, but now that you brought it up it is absurd for you to question my \"moral center\" as a defense for such a heinous act.\n \n It would be like an abusive father questioning the justice of a teacher who acknowledges the viciousness of the father's attacks.\n \n \n \nYou see foundit, in the neighboring countries, prostitution was rampant, but thousands of them were killed each year by savage men who raped and beat them and killed them for sport. After all foundit, prostitutes, much less any women had no rights of protection by law in those barbaric countries. Meanwhile, back in Israel, women were protected, respected and honored as valued citizens who contributed to their Society. And they knew the Law so the thought of demeaning themselves in such a filthy way was beyond comprehension to them.\n So you feel free to focus on the law in Israel rather than focus on the reality for the women in other countries where no such laws existed to protect women from ever being forced into such a life of quiet desperation and ultimate futility. So let's talk about true misogyny and then you tell me why you support and promote prostitution when women had no rights of protection at all in those countries?\n\n And there's the deflection.\n Over and OVER and OVER again, Archie ignores any real defense for the barbaric nature of what his \"God\" commanded.\n Instead, he tries to tell us that it is \"better\" than what other people were doing.\n \n Archie, we're talking about what you describe as \"God's perfect will\".\n It is SUPPOSEDLY \"God's perfect will\" that a prostitute be stoned.\n It is SUPPOSEDLY \"God's perfect will\" that a woman not be able to question a man. Not teach a man. Not have authority over a man.\n It is SUPPOSEDLY \"God's perfect will\" that if a woman is raped, the rapist can pay the father a few shekels and the woman is now the man's wife.\n \n Me personally? I recognize that civilizations GREW over time. It was MAN that grew.\n And likewise, if we were to look at Jews AS A PEOPLE and stop with the religious pretense, I could acknowledge their \"justice\" as it should be rated according to their primitive years.\n But the problem is that YOU claim an ETERNAL GOD that supposedly has unchanging laws. Laws that should not be questioned, even as Christians abandon them without the intellectual honesty of admitting to it.\n \n \n \nAlso, in the ancient world every king in every kingdom in the known world had private armies which served them only. When those armies traveled the countryside, they had their way with any citizen for any reason they could dream up. If they needed food or money, they just took it from who ever was unfortunate enough to cross their paths. If they didn't like how someone looked at them they could kill them with no concern about legal retribution.\n\n Moral Relativity\n That's a complaint I often see the religious right try to complain about. Too often, it's mislabelled as it's not truly \"moral relativity\" but rather a disagreement on the validity of a morality, independent of \"relativity\".\n Here, you are trying to use Moral Relativity to excuse the historical unjustness of what YOUR GOD supposedly held as an absolute standard.\n \n I have no doubt as to the barbaric nature of PEOPLE thousands of years ago.\n I personally see the bible as a book written by men, for men, justifying their actions as they desired and condemning other people's actions as their power allowed.\n The Old Testament is a book OF Jews FOR Jews.\n Supposedly, God is the \"father\" who created the ancestor of every man, woman, and child on this planet, correct?\n So when the Jews were killing off other civilizations, slaughtering every man they came across and enslaving women as they saw fit, they were killing and enslaving THEIR BROTHERS (based on the same heavenly father).\n \n A REAL scenario, which involves a rational perspective, would be for an all-knowing God to find a way for all his children to co-exist.\n But instead, the Hebrew God ordered Genocide and Slavery...\n And based on a Moral Relativity, you think that's okay just cause other people were doing that?\n \n \n \nBut not in Israel. The very first civilian based police force was founded by God in Israel a thousand years before the concept was accepted anywhere else on Earth. And these weren't just cops. They were boys chosen at birth and raised in the Law their whole lives as they were taught righteous understanding in full knowledge that they were representing Yahweh as a protector and defender of the innocent. Israel had a compassionate and intricate legal system which sought to find the truth rather than just convict the most available suspect while all other countries were tyrannical kingdoms which lacked all civil laws which protected regular citizens.\n\n Oh cut the MANURE!\n I am talking about how the Hebrew God ordered his \"children\" to SLAUGHTER AN ENTIRE NATION, and you want to change the issue to \"police\"?\n I think Hitler had police also. Does that excuse his treatment of the Jews?\n \n Here are a couple examples you can ignore while you try to praise Jewish \"police\"...\n \"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and XXX, with the edge of the sword. Joshua 6:21 1 \n \"So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded. And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.\" Joshua 10:40-41 1\n Religiously motivated genocides, in biblical times and recently\n \n \n \nAnd remember foundit, I'm talking about 1500 BC. Europe was still barbaric during the Dark Ages between 900 and 1400 AD.\n\n Are you for real?\n Jews GOT CONQUERED. That is why they didn't continue to go around killing entire nations and enslaving people and continue to claim \"God told me to do it\".\n Jews got conquered by the Romans, who made sure the Jews didn't continue their barbarism. The Romans did not kill off the Jewish men, which would have been poetic cause that's what the Jews did for others.\n \n What really happened is that the kids (Jews) kept misbehaving while they were left on their own.\n The \"parents\" (Romans, who in a lot of ways weren't much better) came along and prevented the kids from running amok.",

   "As for your claim of slavery, if you bothered seeking the truth of what the bible say's about it, you would see that God opposed slavery.\n\n I really can't believe you just uttered that utterly ridiculous claim.\n Either you don't know what your own Biblical history says, or you don't have any qualms with lying.\n \n Exodus 21:7: \"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.\"\n Leviticus 25:44-46: \"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.\" (NIV)\n When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)\n When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)\n Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n \n The Hebrew God did not oppose slavery.\n Can you show any bible passage which actually \"opposes\" slavery?\n \n \n \nBut being the incredible God that He is, who understood that Israel was surrounded by Countries which all practiced this barbaric trade, God instituted Laws for how Jews were to treat slaves and had mandatory freedom clauses built in so slaves of jews knew going in that their eventual freedom was assured during their lifetime. No other Country ever offered this promise to slaves. Jewish slaves were treated as member of the family and could even inherit property like a child would. \n Now name for me the other countries which treated their slaves like equals foundit? And why don't you ever complain about all of the other slavery in the Ancient world as you attempt to condemn Israel so absolutely blindly and unfairly as you do?\n\n Slavery is slavery. It is WRONG.\n You provide more moral relativity.\n If the Hebrew god was eternal and his laws were unchanging, he should have given the perfect standard.\n Not just something to be a little better than others.\n \n \n \nNow for the so called Genocide: I realize that you refuse to place any biblical historical event in its proper context considering the time in history these events took place, but that is what's required if someone wants to find the truth. The reality is that the land God was leading Moses to was occupied by barbarians who worshiped the Sun and Moon and carved idols out of wood and stone to pray to them. These people were violent and blood thirst kingdoms who usually wouldn't even allow strange tribes to cross their land. \n So God ordered Israel to wipe out their enemies before their enemies wiped them out.\n\n \"before their enemies wiped them out\" ???\n I thought these people had \"God\" on their side. The same God that supposedly whipped Egypt's but with plagues. The same God that supposedly made the \"sun stand still\" in the sky for the Israelites.\n So you're telling me that this God couldn't protect his \"children\" from enemies, without totally obliterating their enemies?\n Puh-LEAZE!\n \n \n \nAlso, there was another reason for such complete annihilation, that was in order to prevent the cultures of these heathen Nations from infecting Israel with their heathen and godless customs, and to protect the traditions and Laws which God had given the Jews.\n\n Considering this \"infection\" possibility exists even today, what has changed?\n The answer is that what people ARE CLAIMING god says has changed...\n \n \n \nI know that concept of wiping the enemy out offends your modern sensibilities, but it was necessary for survival and so they wouldn't live under constant threats of invasion or cultural infection as Israel does today with their neighbors who hate them so passionately. I could go on, but I'm sure none of this will pierce the mill stone which is rolled over the door of your heart. So why bother.\n\n So you apologetically excuse atrocities from a supposedly \"perfect\" god who has incredible power to create the entire universe...\n The Israelites had to kill their neighbors to the last man, cause otherwise they would have been killed.\n Slavery is okay, cause everybody was doing it and the Jews supposedly did it better.\n Misogyny is okay, cause everybody is doing it an dthe Jews supposedly did it better.\n \n You claim that \"their neighbors\" hated them, but you fail to recognize the hatred present in a pretend message from \"god\" telling his people to kill every man, woman, child, oxen, sheep, donkeys, ...\n I mean how utterly insane is it to KILL THE CATTLE of the people you are wiping out???\n That doesn't show you EXACTLY how crazed the biblical Jews were? Or were the cattle going to invade Israel?\n \n The truth of the matter is that \"Israel\" was a country like any other. Superstitious and intolerant like everybody else of their time.\n When they won a battle, they gave their god credit.\n When they lost battles and got enslaved, they wondered why their god had forsaken them.\n EVERY culture had similar actions in that vein...\n \n \n \nYou constantly blame God for the choices men freely make after God has supplied all of the avenues of escape from the danger and harm that those choices lead to. But I've been here long enough to know that you refuse to look inward when you can just as easily blame God for your sins. emoticon_xdonno\n\n And therein lies the foolishness and the blindness of Archie's approach.\n Using the example laid out above, the son broke curfew. Period.\n THAT was his choice.\n \n What I am talking about is how the FATHER RESPONDED to that transgression, and instead of acknowledging the extreme child abuse, you instead try to focus blame on the child.\n Yes. The son DID break curfew.\n But where is the intelligence in talking about \"the choices the son freely made\" to break curfew, when I am saying that the CHILD ABUSE the father dishes out is unjust?\n The son broke curfew. Does that automatically mean that ANY punishment the father chooses is justified?\n In earthly situations, we recognize such a pretense as figurative insanity.\n In \"religion\" situations, too many people think it's rational and/or \"truth\" to NOT recognize the insanity.",

Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n\n \n Slavery is not prohibited outright due to the surrounding cultures of the time, which I have already made clear. And there are certainly negative aspects to it such as the possibility of limited beating of slaves which, if severe, was punishable by law; such laws didn't exist anywhere else at that time in history. \n Yet Mosaic legislation simultaneously expresses the hopeful goal of eradicating slavery-a theme of Deuteronomy 15-while both diminishing the staying power of slavery in light of the exodus and controlling the institution of slavery in light of the practical fact that misfortune in a subsistence culture could reduce anyone to poverty and indebtedness. Indeed, God's reminder to Israel of her own history exposes the reality of this institution as \"less than ideal\". \n God had redeemed Israel from slavery to become his people (Exod. 20:7), and his redemptive activity was to be a model for Israel's conduct within society-however miserably she happened to fail at this. \"You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt (Exod. 22:21). Even more poignant is Exodus 23:9: \"You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" Indeed, the command to love a stranger as oneself is rooted in the fact that \"you were aliens in the land of Egypt\" (Lev. 19:34). The atheists love to overlook or avoid these strong undertones, which help sow the seeds of slavery's own destruction.\n \n With that said, the three main texts regarding slave legislation (Exod. 21; Lev. 25; Deut. 15) reveal a morally-improved legislation as the text progresses when compared to any form of slavery which existed anywhere else in the ancient world. You refuse to judge Israel in context of the world they existed within at the time. Christopher Wright (in response to Gordon McConville) persuasively contends, however, that we should give the final Pentateuchal editor(s) the benefit of the doubt, who would certainly have been aware of these differences but kept all of these texts in place; this suggests a reconciliation or rationale for doing so. Wright sees Deuteronomy \"modifying, extending, and to some extent reforming earlier laws, with additional explicit theological rationale and motivation.\" He goes so far as to say that while Exodus 21 emphasizes the humanness of slaves, even the ancient Israelite would recognize that Deuteronomy 15 was in tension with earlier legislation. So, to obey Deuteronomy \"necessarily meant no longer complying with Exodus.\" This point serves to illustrate the \"living, historical and contextual nature of the growth of Scripture. \"Reflecting upon the wider canonical framework reminds us that we should not focus on one single text alone. Indeed, Genesis 1-2 remind us of God's creational ideals that were clouded and distorted by human falseness. You seem to have this impression that God was obligated or inclined to intervene into the affairs of the jews in a personal way when what He did was guide them but never restrained them from exercising their own free will as a people or a nation. Just as God deals with believers today. He guides us but never does He force us to do anything. God never over rides mans free will under any circumstances. Then, just as now, it is when we obey him that all of the pieces seem to fall into place. When we rebel, we reap what we sow apart from Gods will or intrusion.\n Is Yahweh a Moral Monster? - Evangelical Philosophical Society",

   "Funny thing foundit, I thought this was a discussion about slavery, but rather than respond to that issue, you must assume I purposely with held the link even though it happens regularly with no condemnation from your side at all. \n \n And just for the record, here is the original post of mine which you are responding to. Interesting how you have ignored responding to the rest of it as you continue to seek to demonize the God of Israel while ignoring the atrocities which occurred in the lawless nations around her at that time in history. emoticon_xdonno\n May I assume your typical and oft repeated anti christian hate speech is directed at me once again? In short, you are dead wrong and are corrupting the actual truth with your very generalized attack as you make these claims out of context, both actual and historical. You call God a misogynist when it was the Jews who's women had more civil and human rights than any other civilization in the Ancient World. \n \n The bible is clear that God hates divorce, but He instituted it in Israel because men were putting women out of their homes with nothing. No other civilizations had rights like that for women for hundreds of years. You will say how barbaric it was to stone a prostitute by LAW in Israel. How terrible and misogynistic of God. But that's just because you have no moral center to speak of. \n \n You see foundit, in the neighboring countries, prostitution was rampant, but thousands of them were killed each year by savage men who raped and beat them and killed them for sport. After all foundit, prostitutes, much less any women had no rights of protection by law in those barbaric countries. Meanwhile, back in Israel, women were protected, respected and honored as valued citizens who contributed to their Society. And they knew the Law so the thought of demeaning themselves in such a filthy way was beyond comprehension to them. \n \n So you feel free to focus on the law in Israel rather than focus on the reality for the women in other countries where no such laws existed to protect women from ever being forced into such a life of quiet desperation and ultimate futility. So let's talk about true misogyny and then you tell me why you support and promote prostitution when women had no rights of protection at all in those countries? \n \n Also, in the ancient world every king in every kingdom in the known world had private armies which served them only. When those armies traveled the countryside, they had their way with any citizen for any reason they could dream up. If they needed food or money, they just took it from who ever was unfortunate enough to cross their paths. If they didn't like how someone looked at them they could kill them with no concern about legal retribution.\n \n But not in Israel. The very first civilian based police force was founded by God in Israel a thousand years before the concept was accepted anywhere else on Earth. And these weren't just cops. They were boys chosen at birth and raised in the Law their whole lives as they were taught righteous understanding in full knowledge that they were representing Yahweh as a protector and defender of the innocent. Israel had a compassionate and intricate legal system which sought to find the truth rather than just convict the most available suspect while all other countries were tyrannical kingdoms which lacked all civil laws which protected regular citizens. And remember foundit, I'm talking about 1500 BC. Europe was still barbaric during the Dark Ages between 900 and 1400 AD.\n \n As for your claim of slavery, if you bothered seeking the truth of what the bible say's about it, you would see that God opposed slavery. But being the incredible God that He is, who understood that Israel was surrounded by Countries which all practiced this barbaric trade, God instituted Laws for how Jews were to treat slaves and had mandatory freedom clauses built in so slaves of jews knew going in that their eventual freedom was assured during their lifetime. No other Country ever offered this promise to slaves. Jewish slaves were treated as member of the family and could even inherit property like a child would. \n \n Now name for me the other countries which treated their slaves like equals foundit? And why don't you ever complain about all of the other slavery in the Ancient world as you attempt to condemn Israel so absolutely blindly and unfairly as you do? \n \n Now for the so called Genocide: I realize that you refuse to place any biblical historical event in its proper context considering the time in history these events took place, but that is what's required if someone wants to find the truth. The reality is that the land God was leading Moses to was occupied by barbarians who worshiped the Sun and Moon and carved idols out of wood and stone to pray to them. These people were violent and blood thirst kingdoms who usually wouldn't even allow strange tribes to cross their land. \n \n So God ordered Israel to wipe out their enemies before their enemies wiped them out. Also, there was another reason for such complete annihilation, that was in order to prevent the cultures of these heathen Nations from infecting Israel with their heathen and godless customs, and to protect the traditions and Laws which God had given the Jews. I know that concept of wiping the enemy out offends your modern sensibilities, but it was necessary for survival and so they wouldn't live under constant threats of invasion or cultural infection as Israel does today with their neighbors who hate them so passionately. I could go on, but I'm sure none of this will pierce the mill stone which is rolled over the door of your heart. So why bother.\n\n \n so much for free will and bear the consequences \n so why doesn't He intervene now and vanquish Hamas?\n Has Jehova retired?",

   "Slavery is not prohibited outright due to the surrounding cultures of the time, which I have already made clear. And there are certainly negative aspects to it such as the possibility of limited beating of slaves which, if severe, was punishable by law; such laws didn't exist anywhere else at that time in history.\n\n And I have already made clear that this is MORAL RELATIVISM.\n All my neighbors are supposedly committing heinous / evil acts, so the divinely inspired Jews, lead by a perfect God, are doing the same.\n \n \n \nYet Mosaic legislation simultaneously expresses the hopeful goal of eradicating slavery-a theme of Deuteronomy 15-while both diminishing the staying power of slavery in light of the exodus and controlling the institution of slavery in light of the practical fact that misfortune in a subsistence culture could reduce anyone to poverty and indebtedness. Indeed, God's reminder to Israel of her own history exposes the reality of this institution as \"less than ideal\". \n\n How can any utter this horse hockey?\n \"hopeful goal of eradicating slavery\" does not exist in Deuteronomy 15.\n It states that HEBREW slaves (no mention of non-hebrew slaves) were to be freed every seventh year. That doesn't mean NEW slaves couldn't be retaken.\n \n And we should be clear that the ancient Hebrews practiced TWO forms of slavery.\n One for their fellow hebrews, which was more polite and civilized.\n Another for NON-hebrews, which would be more akin to the more \"modern\" form of how whites treated blacks during slavery times in the U.S.\n \n And even if we assume that it was a \"goal of eradicating slavery\", then we must assume that god's followers were incredibly thick.\n After all, how many HUNDREDS of years after Deuteronomy did the biblical Hebrews CONTINUE to practice slavery???\n Why is it that modern slavery (before Lincoln) saw the bible as JUSTIFYING their slavery???\n \n \n \nGod had redeemed Israel from slavery to become his people (Exod. 20:7), and his redemptive activity was to be a model for Israel's conduct within society-however miserably she happened to fail at this.\n\n That is thoroughly apologetic nonsense.\n God NEVER ONCE condemned the act of slavery during the \"Israel\" exodus incident.\n He objected to HIS PEOPLE being slaves to another non-hebrew people.\n I challenge Archie to show ANY Exodus chapter where God supposedly condemned slavery in its generic form, practiced by the Hebrews.\n \n One would easily realize that if God supposedly did want his people to not practice slavery, he wouldn't have GIVEN GUIDELINES ON HOW TO DO IT in later passages.\n \n \n \n\"You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt (Exod. 22:21). Even more poignant is Exodus 23:9: \"You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" Indeed, the command to love a stranger as oneself is rooted in the fact that \"you were aliens in the land of Egypt\" (Lev. 19:34).\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Funny how just a few verses away, we can find guidelines from the hebrew god on HOW TO ENSLAVE people, and treat slaves.\n You don't seem to get that these people thought it was OKAY to enslave others.\n And this passage, a chapter later in the bible. Obviously the Hebrew God thought it was \"okay\" to treat a stranger by enslaving them.\n Leviticus 25:44-46: \"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.\" (NIV)\n \n \n \n The atheists love to overlook or avoid these strong undertones, which help sow the seeds of slavery's own destruction.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n How many thousands of years later were people STILL enslaving people in Christ's name, proclaiming it was their God given right????\n These are the MODERN bible verses which people are NO RE-INTERPRETING to be against slavery.\n Even the people who RECEIVED these bible passages didn't think they meant that they should stop owning slaves.\n That should mean something...\n \n \n \nWith that said, the three main texts regarding slave legislation (Exod. 21; Lev. 25; Deut. 15) reveal a morally-improved legislation as the text progresses when compared to any form of slavery which existed anywhere else in the ancient world. You refuse to judge Israel in context of the world they existed within at the time. Christopher Wright (in response to Gordon McConville) persuasively contends, however, that we should give the final Pentateuchal editor(s) the benefit of the doubt, who would certainly have been aware of these differences but kept all of these texts in place; this suggests a reconciliation or rationale for doing so. Wright sees Deuteronomy \"modifying, extending, and to some extent reforming earlier laws, with additional explicit theological rationale and motivation.\" He goes so far as to say that while Exodus 21 emphasizes the humanness of slaves, even the ancient Israelite would recognize that Deuteronomy 15 was in tension with earlier legislation. So, to obey Deuteronomy \"necessarily meant no longer complying with Exodus.\" This point serves to illustrate the \"living, historical and contextual nature of the growth of Scripture. \"Reflecting upon the wider canonical framework reminds us that we should not focus on one single text alone. Indeed, Genesis 1-2 remind us of God's creational ideals that were clouded and distorted by human falseness.\n\n Again, MORAL RELATIVISM.\n The author wants credit for the Jews actions, just cause everybody else was doing it.\n And like I said, if we were talking OUTSIDE of religious terms, I would have no problem judging history in its historical context.\n \n But the point is that these laws were supposedly given by a god that\n 1) Created ALL people.\n 2) Is a \"loving\" God\n 3) Is a \"just\" God.\n 4) Is an \"all knowing\" God.\n \n If a brother picks a fight with a brother, and the brothers are seven-years old, then I can easily judge the situation on the basis of youth and realize the children will develop.\n But here we have a situation where THE FATHER is telling one brother to ENSLAVE the other brother, and that it's okay.\n And for that, I judge the father as being WRONG.\n \n \n \nYou seem to have this impression that God was obligated or inclined to intervene into the affairs of the jews in a personal way when what He did was guide them but never restrained them from exercising their own free will as a people or a nation. Just as God deals with believers today. He guides us but never does He force us to do anything. God never over rides mans free will under any circumstances. Then, just as now, it is when we obey him that all of the pieces seem to fall into place. When we rebel, we reap what we sow apart from Gods will or intrusion.\n Is Yahweh a Moral Monster? - Evangelical Philosophical Society\n\n What is this junk?\n The issue is NOT that God gave \"free will\".\n The issue is that GOD COMMANDED enslaving other people. (along with misogyny and genocide)\n \n The issue is that God COMMANDED the following...\n Deuteronomy 21:10-14: \"When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her [i.e. rape her or engage in consensual sex], and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.\"\n \n Deuteronomy 20:14\" \"But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself\"\n \n Does that sound like a JUST god?\n Does it sound like a God who created ALL people, looking out for all people with love and an all knowing justice?\n \n My point is that the Old TEstament is an example of a barbaric people, setting their own rules and keeping THEMSELVES in line because they proclaimed \"God\" told them to act a certain way.\n If anybody looks at the \"self-described\" nature of God, and COMPARES that to his ACTIONS in the Old Testament, they would realize that the two are not the same.",

That paragraph doesn't describe in any way what it means to be a believer in God through Christ.\n \n I do something my heavenly father doesn't like every day simply because He is perfectly holy and I could never live up to His perfect standards. Yet I have no fear of condemnation since I have received the free gift of salvation through Christ's sacrifice on the Cross which was freely given as propitiation for my sins.\n \n The deeper issue is that God became Man and gave Himself for us because He can't be in the presence of sin, that is why we need to receive that freely offered gift if we want to spend eternity with Him. If you or anyone feels you don't care what eternity brings, or you don't want to spend it with such a God, then you are absolutely free to face Him at the judgment on your own merits. The problem we have is found in one verse in the bible which describes every persons need. It say's; \"For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one.\" Romans 3:23\n \n This passage describes humanity more completely. \n Romans 3:10-18:\n \"There is no one righteous, not even one;\n 11there is no one who understands,\n no one who seeks God.\n 12All have turned away,\n they have together become worthless;\n there is no one who does good,\n not even one.\"\n 13\"Their throats are open graves;\n their tongues practice deceit.\"\n \"The poison of vipers is on their lips.\"\n 14\"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.\"\n 15\"Their feet are swift to shed blood;\n 16ruin and misery mark their ways,\n 17and the way of peace they do not know.\"\n 18\"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"\n What is relevant about our relationship with God is not that He is looking down on us just waiting to through the book at us, no; He lives within us by way of His Holy Spirit so we are never alone again but dwell and live in His presence day by day. This relationship is supernatural and beyond human understanding on a natural level. If you could only see through my eyes and with my mind for a minute, you would never again want to be without what I possess which is God in me and nothing which speaks to my righteousness at all, but Him in me. \n \n \n It might make you behave better, but doing the right things because they are right is better than not doing bad because you'll be punished. Much religion does equal slavery of the mind!\n\n \n The only way to be punished by God for doing bad is to die in the unredeemed state of sin. So people like me are assured protection from such an end due to the blood covering of Jesus sacrifice for us. I seek to be more like Christ because that is the standard my father set for me and all of His children. He said to be holy for I am Holy. I don't follow Him out of any fear of punishment, but out of a sincere love for my savior who though perfect and sinless as an unblemished lamb, gave His life for me so that I might live and live more abundantly. Here's a cute story that say's it very well.\n The Duck & the Devil \n There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm. \n He was given a slingshot to play with out in the woods. \n He practiced in the woods; but he could never hit the target. \n Getting a little discouraged, he headed back for dinner. \n As he was walking back he saw Grandma's pet duck. \n Just out of impulse, he let the slingshot fly, \n hit the duck square inthe head and killed it.\n He was shocked and grieved! \n \n In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood pile;\n only to see his sister watching! Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing. After lunch the next day Grandma said, 'Sally, let's wash the dishes' \n But Sally said, 'Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen.' \n Then she whispered to him, 'Remember the duck?' \n So Johnny did the dishes. \n \n Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing \n and Grandma said, 'I'm sorry but I need Sally to help make supper.' \n Sally just smiled and said, 'Well that's all right because Johnny told me he wanted to help' She whispered again, 'Remember the duck?'\n \n So Sally went fishing and Johnny stayed to help. After several day of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's; he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck. Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug and said, 'Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing, but because I love you, I forgave you. I was just wondering how long you would let Sally make a slave of you.' \n \n Thought for the day and every day thereafter? \n \n Whatever is in your past, whatever you have done... And the devil\n keeps throwing it up in your face (lying, cheating, debt, fear, bad habits, hatred, anger, bitterness, etc.) ..whatever it is...You need to know that God was standing at the window and He saw the whole thing. He has seen your whole life. He wants you to know that He loves you and that you are forgiven. He's just wondering how long you will let the devil make a slave of you. The great thing about God is that when you ask for forgiveness; He not only forgives you, but He forgets. It is by God's grace and mercy that we are saved. Go ahead and make the difference in someone's life today. Share this with a friend and always remember: God is at the window! When Jesus died on the cross; he was thinking of you! ",

Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing. After lunch the next day Grandma said, 'Sally, let's wash the dishes' \n But Sally said, 'Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen.' \n Then she whispered to him, 'Remember the duck?' \n So Johnny did the dishes. \n \n Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing \n and Grandma said, 'I'm sorry but I need Sally to help make supper.' \n Sally just smiled and said, 'Well that's all right because Johnny told me he wanted to help' She whispered again, 'Remember the duck?'\n \n So Sally went fishing and Johnny stayed to help. After several day of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's; he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck. Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug and said, 'Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing, but because I love you, I forgave you. I was just wondering how long you would let Sally make a slave of you.' \n \n Thought for the day and every day thereafter? \n \n Whatever is in your past, whatever you have done... And the devil\n keeps throwing it up in your face (lying, cheating, debt, fear, bad habits, hatred, anger, bitterness, etc.) ..whatever it is...You need to know that God was standing at the window and He saw the whole thing. He has seen your whole life. He wants you to know that He loves you and that you are forgiven. He's just wondering how long you will let the devil make a slave of you. The great thing about God is that when you ask for forgiveness; He not only forgives you, but He forgets. It is by God's grace and mercy that we are saved.

   "Not my biggest beef (that would probably be the separation between the importance of faith and deeds), but this is a good one to go over (and is possibly tenuously linked).\n \n Imagine in your story that Johnny hadn't confessed to his gran. How long would she have stood by, watching Sally force Johnny to do all the work, before she stepped in and either forced Johnny to confess, or let him know that she forgave (note the past tense when this word is used in the story) him anyway? If she knew that Johnny was about to leave home, many years later, but was still being tormented over the duck incident, would she not help him out?\n \n By the story (and all I've seen of Christianity so far) God doesn't forgive because 'He loves us' - at the time of the misdeed, like the grandmother in the story. God forgives us only after we have confessed, because He loves us and we have asked for forgiveness. At least, this asking always seems to be a necessary part. \n \n To clarify: I sin. Does God immediately forgive me?\n 1. If yes: Why must I ask for forgiveness, after it has already been granted? If I don't confess my sin to God, does he automatically take back his forgiving?\n \n 2. If no: Who is more forgiving, God - or the grandmother in the story? Note also that it is within God's power to ease my suffering at any time, but He's just sitting back, 'wondering how long I'll let the devil make a slave of me' - no matter how long that may be for, including (apparently) all eternity.\n \n To summarise the clarification: The idea that God forgives us unconditionally is directly at odds with the condition that 'we must ask for forgiveness'.\n \n Anyone?\n \n EDIT: Please note I haven't read most of the rest of the thread (will do so as soon as I have the time), so apologies if I'm repeating old material. It looked like the previous discussion had mostly exhausted itself, though.\n\n \n I repeat for foundits benefit. Complete forgiveness for our sins was accomplished for all of humanity 2000 years ago on the Cross. It isn't something that becomes real only when sought by a person. It must be accepted in order to be received though. This takes an act of the receivers will by accepting Jesus as ones Lord and Savior. Just asking God to forgive ones sin if one doesn't have a personal relationship with Jesus and possess His Holy Spirit within them is what God calls lip service and means nothing regarding true forgiveness of sins. Iangb said:\n \n [iangb] To clarify: I sin. Does God immediately forgive me?\n \n My response to this is that God forgave that sin 2000 years ago, you just accepted that forgiveness when you accepted Jesus as your savior. And the bible promises that that sin was thrown into the Sea of forgetfulness by God. I personally continually fall short of Gods glory. I commit sins which I'm not even aware of in comparison to Gods perfect holiness, so how can I seek forgiveness for them? What matters is that I am covered by the blood of Christ and forgiven based on the propitiation He accomplished for me 2000 years ago.\n \n \nYour understanding of Gods forgiveness toward us is completely erroneous iangb.

You're all alone on this one. Even iangb who's been on this afternoon hasn't questioned my response to him. And the reason I simply reiterated my original argument with some additional clarification is because I needn't add to the truth as it is self evident to any rational person.\n \n \nI'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.\n \n John is an atheist.\n He has stolen some money.

Remorse without repentance is just a consciousness of guilt which you ignore and bury within yourself every day of your life. Repentance means to turn away from your sin. That leads to submitting ones life to Gods authority and there in lies true and ultimate forgiveness and salvation. \n \n \nThe funny thing here is that in the real world, real people's \"forgiveness\" isn't contingent on \"acceptance\".\n \n I can forgive my brother for being rude to me. Maybe it doesn't matter whether or not he actually feels sorry. It sure as heck wouldn't require him to \"accept\" my forgiveness.\n\n \n And neither would he get any benefit from your forgiveness since he had no change of heart at all. That is how it is with God. Jesus death on the Cross 2000 years ago paid the price for every sin you have ever committed, but you haven't had any change of heart from that sacrifice because you feel no sorrow or need to repent for your rebellion against His holy nature and self sacrifice. Thanks for making my point for me with your own example. :)\n \n \nAnd therein lies the answer to my question above.\n The answer is \"No\".\n The forgiveness is obviously NOT \"unconditional\".\n There IS a condition.\n\n \n Lord, forgive foundit for his closed mind and ignorant stubbornness, please? emoticon_xangel The forgiveness is unconditional. But one must accept that forgiveness in order to take hold of it. It is offered freely with no strings attached, but you must accept it being a free will creature and all. God would never impose Himself on an unwilling soul. \n \n \nAnd you fail to recognize the magnitude of that condition.\n Suppose you had a dictator that has thrown his political dissidents in torture prisons. For eternity.\n Along comes Jack who jaywalks. He is brought before the dictator and told that he can be \"forgiven\" as long as he acknowledges the dictator's \"love\".\n Now a rational person would recognize this situation as sketchy.\n\n \n Talk about ROFLMBO... Now it's my turn :) For you to say that I fail to recognize the magnitude of what it means to submit ones life to Gods authority is just ludicrous to the max. Especially since between the two of us, I'm the only one who has done it. \n \n As for your dictator example, it doesn't apply to my Father in heaven so isn't worth even discussing such an inane analogy.\n \n \nIf a person cuts me off in traffic, I can forgive that person without any real concern.\n If a person cuts in front of me in the checkout line, I can forgive that person without requiring them to have a \"personal relationship\" with me.\n \n What you are talking about is that a person must SUBMIT to your god and essentially swear fealty to your god.\n Then, and ONLY then, is \"forgiveness\" granted.\n \n Forgiveness without a \"personal relationship\" does exist. It is not irrational. It is often expected.\n You have long ago agreed to drink the kool-aid, and for some reason you think it rational to denigrate those who question the demand to drink the kool-aid.\n\n \n You keep thinking with your natural mind and on a human level and keep applying that thinking to God and His perfect standards and see how far it gets you. I needn't defend God here, only attempt to explain His truths from His perspective to you. Attacking me is useless also since nothing I'm saying is my opinion but is what the Gods word requires of us. Your argument is with God, not me.\n \n \nThis is utter and complete malarkey.\n Suppose a father tells his son at infancy \"I forgive you for everything you could possibly do, as long as you recognize me as your master and always acknowledge your loyalty to me.\"\n And then, years later the father and the son have a falling out. The father insists that the son \"already has forgiveness\", but again the son must acknowledge loyalty to the father.\n\n \n See answer directly above:\n \n \nThat isn't \"already forgiving\".\n It's CONDITIONAL forgiveness, and it obviously doesn't really exist until the son submits to the father.\n \n It is absurd to claim that the forgiveness \"already exists\" and was given in the past, when the truth is that the forgiveness depends upon the presence or absence of a PRESENT or FUTURE action.\n\n \n Since God is not limited to time and space but encompasses all of it, Jesus did die for the sins of all humanity once and for all time on Calvary's Cross. That you are unable to appreciate that does nothing at all to change or nullify the truth of it. Not that this will pierce that darkness in your soul, but maybe the bible will help clarify the seriousness of the spiritual condition you are in.\n Rom 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?\n \n Rom 6:2 Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?\n \n Rom 6:3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?\n \n Rom 6:4 Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\n \n Rom 6:5 For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be [in the likeness] of [His] resurrection,\n \n Rom 6:6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [Him], that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.\n \n Rom 6:7 For he who has died has been freed from sin.\n \n Rom 6:8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,\n Rom 6:9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.\n \n Rom 6:10 For [the death] that He died, He died to sin once for all; but [the life] that He lives, He lives to God.[Archangel] You do realize that Jesus died 2000 years ago don't you? So according to this He died once and for all people 2000 years ago just as I have been saying all along. If you choose not to accept that as true, please don't argue with me about it because it's your right to reject it like you reject every other spiritual truth in the bible. \n Rom 6:11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n \n Rom 6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.\n \n Rom 6:13 And do not present your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.\n \n Rom 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\n And there are also these verses which repeat the same message.\n \n Hbr 9:27 And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,\n \n Hbr 9:28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many.

You're all alone on this one.\n\n I was referring to a generic overview, and even on this issue, I am far from alone.\n Quite frankly, YOU are more \"alone\" than I am.\n Who the heck has chimed in to say they agree with you???\n \n \n \nEven iangb who's been on this afternoon hasn't questioned my response to him.\n\n So if somebody doesn't respond to you within 7 hours, you automatically assume they have no problem with what you say?\n Puh-LEAZE!\n \n Plus, iangb has since set the record straight on your assumption.\n \n \n \nAnd the reason I simply reiterated my original argument with some additional clarification is because I needn't add to the truth as it is self evident to any rational person.\n\n If it was \"self evident\" the first time, why repeat it?\n All you're doing is giving the pretense of refutation, when the truth is that you are routinely IGNORING what your detractors say.\n \n \n \nShow me where the bible says remorse is the path to forgiveness. Remorse without repentance is just a consciousness of guilt which you ignore and bury within yourself every day of your life. Repentance means to turn away from your sin. That leads to submitting ones life to Gods authority and there in lies true and ultimate forgiveness and salvation. \n\n 1) I knew you couldn't give me an honest answer.\n I even explicitly explained I wanted an explicit \"yes\" or \"no\" (acknowledging that follow-on elaboration is a given), and you turn around and IGNORE the question entirely.\n THAT is your problem. (Or at least one of many...)\n You can't give people an straight-forward answer when a straight-forward answer is called for.\n \n 2) Your claimed distinction is trivial.\n Anybody who is remorseful will obviously make an effort not to repeat the same error again.\n Your \"remorse without repentance\" line sounds like a bad mental illness.\n Even alcoholics \"repent\" and say they won't drink again.\n \n 3) You aren't even addressing my real point.\n I'll replace \"remorse\" with \"repentant\" and my real point is unchanged.\n \n I'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.\n \n John is an atheist.\n He has stolen some money. He repents his actions.\n Since John is repentant, has your Judeo-Christian God FORGIVEN John?\n \n You can \"blah, blah, blah\" all you want, but a \"yes\" or a \"no\" needs to be given EXPLICITLY in your answer. \n \n \n \nAnd neither would he get any benefit from your forgiveness since he had no change of heart at all.\n\n People get a \"benefit\" from forgiveness, even without a \"change of heart\".\n Suppose the U.S. were to adopt the biblical system of debt forgiveness.\n The person would obviously STILL reap a benefit from the debt forgiveness, without ANY \"change of heart\" on the part of the debtor.\n \n John is mad at his wife Mary for not picking up after herself.\n John can decide Mary's good qualities outweigh the bad, and forgive her. Mary gets the \"benefits\" of forgiveness, without a change of heart.\n \n Your insistence that the person has to have a \"change of heart\" is yet another example of how your adherence to Christianity has skewed your thinking. And I am not saying Christianity has done that, cause I doubt most Christians think like you.\n I am saying that your mind-set of trying to justify everything in the bible (while most simply give some level of recognition of distinction between reality and bible) has caused you to adopt a thoroughly skewed position.\n \n \n \nThat is how it is with God. Jesus death on the Cross 2000 years ago paid the price for every sin you have ever committed, but you haven't had any change of heart from that sacrifice because you feel no sorrow or need to repent for your rebellion against His holy nature and self sacrifice. Thanks for making my point for me with your own example. :)\n\n I understand the dogma.\n You fail to recognize the issue of my contention.\n And you simply repeat your kool-aid speak like it somehow addresses the issue, when it doesn't.\n \n \n \nLord, forgive foundit for his closed mind and ignorant stubbornness, please? emoticon_xangel The forgiveness is unconditional.\n\n Can you give some definition of \"unconditional\" which will explain how, by my current situation, I am not forgiven for my sins?\n If it were unconditional, there would be NO CONDITIONS.\n Ergo, EVERYBODY would be forgiven.\n \n \n \nBut one must accept that forgiveness in order to take hold of it.\n\n See!\n There it is!\n You JUST GAVE the condition.\n But for some reason, you cannot recognize that IS a condition.\n \n \n \nIt is offered freely with no strings attached, but you must accept it being a free will creature and all. God would never impose Himself on an unwilling soul.\n\n Again, you say things that just baffle rationality.\n Forgiveness is IMPOSING???\n \n So if I forgive the person who cut me off on the freeway, or cut in line at the super-market, I am \"imposing\" upon that person by forgiving them?\n \n \n \nTalk about ROFLMBO... Now it's my turn :) For you to say that I fail to recognize the magnitude of what it means to submit ones life to Gods authority is just ludicrous to the max.\n\n Where did I say that?\n I didn't say that.\n I said that you fail to recognize the legitimacy of somebody's reservations in NOT doing that.\n If God were a man who lead people in the way the bible described, we would call him a dictator. A tyrant. A genocidal maniac.\n But you demand worship of him, without question.\n \n \n \nAs for your dictator example, it doesn't apply to my Father in heaven so isn't worth even discussing such an inane analogy.\n\n Again, you fail to question your god, but you demand others automatically believe as you do.\n It's like saying \"You must worship Obama. You say Obama did wrong in that situation? You cannot question it, and I refuse to discuss it, but you are wrong in not recognizing Obama as a messiah\".\n It's your thought process, demanding much from others but providing little in answers, which is inane!\n \n \n \nYou keep thinking with your natural mind and on a human level and keep applying that thinking to God and His perfect standards and see how far it gets you.\n\n I invite the viewing audience to read Archie's reply carefully.\n Archie is essentially ASSUMING God as \"perfect standards\", and thus refusing to apply any common sense evaluation to the situation.\n He BELIEVES God to be perfect, ergo any evidence which may indicate the contrary must be disregarded and ignored.\n \n It's why discussions with fundies is so circular.\n In their head, it always comes back to their mentally unassailable and unquestionable assumption that God said it, and thus it must be so and must be perfect.\n \n \n \nI needn't defend God here, only attempt to explain His truths from His perspective to you.\n\n Archie, you don't need to \"explain\" anything.\n 1) You believe God to be perfect.\n 2) Any apparent contradiction of rule #1, should see rule #1 for validation of rule #1.\n \n You don't need to \"explain\" that. I understand what you're saying.\n Me stating the flaw in your way of thinking is not me misunderstanding it.\n \n \n \nAttacking me is useless also since nothing I'm saying is my opinion but is what the Gods word requires of us. Your argument is with God, not me.\n\n I am not attacking you.\n And my argument is with your representation of God.\n \n \n \nSee answer directly above:\n\n The one where you ignore my analogy and declare it \"inane\"?\n Yeah. I got your method of ignoring the issue...\n \n \n \nSince God is not limited to time and space but encompasses all of it, Jesus did die for the sins of all humanity once and for all time on Calvary's Cross.\n\n Do you realize how close to a Flower Child you sound in your refusal to admit the obvious?\n It is absurd to claim that the forgiveness \"already exists\" and was given in the past, when the truth is that the forgiveness depends upon the presence or absence of a PRESENT or FUTURE action.\n Claiming \"God is not limited to time and space\" to ignore an obvious logic fallacy of your explanation is absurd.\n \n Even more absurd is the fact that the CHRISTIAN position (note, not YOUR position, but rather the CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY position) suffers absolutely NOTHING if the obvious point I have made is recognized.\n It is you and your arrogant pride which has presumed to declare the inaccurate, and insist on its absolute truth to the extent of redefining words and logic.\n \n Christian dogma itself? It suffers NOTHING if it admits that forgiveness is granted after the believing sinner repents.\n Once again, you add your EXTRA interpretation to things, insist that YOU must be right, and try to hide behind your religion which actually suffers nothing if YOUR statement is false.\n \n \n \nThat you are unable to appreciate that does nothing at all to change or nullify the truth of it. Not that this will pierce that darkness in your soul, but maybe the bible will help clarify the seriousness of the spiritual condition you are in.\n [INDENT][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]Rom 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?\n Rom 6:2 Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?\n Rom 6:3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?\n Rom 6:4 Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\n Rom 6:5 For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be [in the likeness] of [His] resurrection,\n Rom 6:6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [Him], that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.\n Rom 6:7 For he who has died has been freed from sin.\n Rom 6:8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,\n Rom 6:9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.\n Rom 6:10 For [the death] that He died, He died to sin once for all; but [the life] that He lives, He lives to God.[Archangel] You do realize that Jesus died 2000 years ago don't you? So according to this He died once and for all people 2000 years ago just as I have been saying all along.\n\n You fail to recognize that my issue is NOT with that philosophical approach.\n It's with the absurd notion that you ADD ON to all of that in YOU (not the bible) refuse to admit to the truth that God's forgiveness has a condition.\n \n \n \nIf you choose not to accept that as true, please don't argue with me about it because it's your right to reject it like you reject every other spiritual truth in the bible. \n\n Archie, it takes two to tango.\n And when you reply to my statements, you are perpetuating the \"argument with you\".\n I will not sit idly by and let this abuse of logic and reason go unrenounced!\n \n \n \nRom 6:11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n Rom 6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.\n Rom 6:13 And do not present your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.\n Rom 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\n And there are also these verses which repeat the same message.Hbr 9:27 And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,\n Hbr 9:28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.\n =\n =\n 1Pe 3:18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us* to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,Oh, and smiley, no need to redefine any words at all. That's your domain.\n\n Your approach defies logic and reason.\n If a person does not believe in your religion, what good is quoting bible verses at them to persuade them that what you say is true?\n \n \n \nAfter I die, who decides whether I go to Heaven or Hell? If you could answer that for me, it might prevent me making some flawed assumptions when I next find the time - both with my reservations about your answer and my other, bigger (and probably related) 'beef with God'.\n\n \n\n 2Cr 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.\n\n Again, Archie refuses to give the simple answer.\n Anybody who READS his biblical quote will realize the answer.\n The JUDGMENT SEAT is \"Christ's\", ergo it is CHRIST's decision on who goes to heaven and who goes to hell.\n \n But dollars to donuts says that Archie will insist that decision is made by us mere mortals!\n Anybody want to bet?",

God delights in repentance, in our acknowledgement of the truth of what we have done wrong, but keeps no count of these things, because he loves us. \nAbsolutely, with regards to the 'here-and-now' - I don't doubt that confession can be liberating for many. What I'm still finding issue with, though, is the 'count of things' that God maintains if we don't repent - regardless of His love for us.",

Come to the wedding banquet.' 5\"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n 8\"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11\"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13\"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14\"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14\n \n If you think you can get to heaven without receiving and believing in Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins, then start calling churches and asking the pastors.",

   "I was going to respond to iangb's post 274 last night but I'm glad I didn't since riders post is so complete and accurate in its explanation. I will only reiterate that those of us who do stand before God in our clothes of righteousness, are not there based on our righteousness but Christ's righteousness in us. We believers have not attained physical perfection or sinlessness in this flesh, but are reckoned by God as righteous based on what Christ accomplished as the perfect lamb of God.\n \n Just as ancient Israel used to make blood sacrifices of unblemished animals for the forgiveness of individual sins (temporary forgiveness which had to be repeated for new sins), God finally sent His only begotten son to die once, for all of us since He was an acceptable sacrifice for the remission of ALL OF MANS SINS. But like any gift which is freely offered by the giver, it must be freely accepted by the receiver. \n \n So iangb, your sins were covered by the shed blood of the perfect lamb of God 2000 years ago on the Cross @ Calvary, once and for all time. The only question which remains is, have you personally received that free gift which His sacrifice represents by accepting Jesus as your personal savior? Remember that our righteousness is in Christ, not ourselves, so apart from Him we stand before God as in filthy rags. \n \n Every deed we perform is unrighteous. \"For there is not a just man on the earth who does good and does not sin\" (Ecclesiastes 7:20). \"There is none who does good, no, not one\" (Psalm 14:3 / Romans 3:12). The Old and New Testament makes it clear that none of us are exempt from this need for salvation. So any and all who attempt to stand before God at the Judgement based on their own righteousness will most assuredly fall short of His Glory and standard for perfect holiness which can only be attained through Christ.\n \n Remember that it's OUR sins being judged, God is not guilty of anything, nor can He be blamed for you not responding to His call to receive what He has so freely offered you in the here and now.",

La da da. isn't that amazing.\n\n \n Did you miss this link to John Stossel Reports by ABC in his link? Here's what his report finds.\n To test what types of people give more, \"20/20\" (A typical Liberal mouthpiece) went to two very different parts of the country, with contrasting populations: Sioux Falls, S.D. and San Francisco, Calif. The Salvation Army set up buckets at the busiest locations in each city -- Macy's in San Francisco and Wal-Mart in Sioux Falls. Which bucket collected more money?\n \n Sioux Falls is rural and religious; half of the population goes to church every week. People in San Francisco make much more money, are predominantly liberal, and just 14 percent of people in San Francisco attend church every week. Liberals are said to care more about helping the poor; so did people in San Francisco give more?\n \n It turns out that this idea that liberals give more...is a myth. Of the top 25 states where people give an above average percent of their income, 24 were red states in the last presidential election.\n \n Arthur Brooks, the author of \"Who Really Cares,\" says that \"when you look at the data, it turns out the conservatives give about 30 percent more.\" He adds, \"And incidentally, conservative-headed families make slightly less money.\"\n \n And he says the differences in giving goes beyond money, pointing out that conservatives are 18 percent more likely to donate blood. He says this difference is not about politics, but about the different way conservatives and liberals view government.\n \n \"You find that people who believe it's the government's job to make incomes more equal, are far less likely to give their money away,\" Brooks says. In fact, people who disagree with the statement, \"The government has a basic responsibility to take care of the people who can't take care of themselves,\" are 27 percent more likely to give to charity.ABC News: Who Gives and Who Doesn't?",
