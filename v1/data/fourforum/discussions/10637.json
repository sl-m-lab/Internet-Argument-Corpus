I'm guessing the economy will go down, unemployment will go up. (Of course governments can skew unemployment by calling their own creation of government jobs beneficial to the economy.)",

And they've committed to substantial tax cuts, similar to those put forward by the liberal party.\n \n Assuming the Primie Minister has good control over policy and the trade union XXXXXX that dream of crushing business aren't allowed much influence, I don't see any real problems.",
