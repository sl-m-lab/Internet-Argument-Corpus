I recall this fellow in the military who performed oral sex on another man (drunk) who proceeded to beat the holy hell out of him. I had no idea. \n \n I never knew that Rock Hudson was homosexual until the news came out about his aids. But it had to be obvious that Liberace was. \n \n Can I look at someone and tell?

It would lead to violence up to and including murder. \n \n I think gays would do themselves a huge favor by keeping their sex lives in the closet where it belongs.

If gaydar exists, I certainly don't have it.\n \n I'm not feminine myself, if that means anything, and few people guess that I'm anything but straight. Maybe if I can find my digital camera, I'll make a special 4forums video to prove this.\n\n \n I didn't make up this story. I was stopping in Forrest Park to eat my lunch under a shade tree. Afterwards I needed to relieve myself and used one of their outdoor restrooms. I got back into my Saab and this guy in this Audi 5000 proceeded to follow me for several blocks through this park. It was obvious something was going on. I did a quick u-turn and hightailed it out of there and went back to the office where I related this to a female co-worker. She then told me it was a common occurrence. I was on temporary assignment to St. Louis at the time. This would have been in 1982. \n \n BTW, I did NOT consider it a compliment.

For me it's been a little different. \n \n While I was in college, I - and several of my friends (all straight, except for me- and I was out then) - hosted a perspective freshman. He was in the navy, and did a tour and was now looking to go to college. We took him out to dinner, hung out at a bar (where he hit on a couple of my female friends), and then went back to our dorms and watched movies. Nothing scandalous to write home about. At some point I decided to look around the room (giving my eyes a bit of a break), and I noticed that the Navy guy had fallen asleep. As I looked at him, \"he's gay\" just popped in my head for the briefest of moments, but I shook it off. I don't even know why I thought it, since I didn't even think he was attractive.\n \n Six months later, I ran into him at a gay club in Boston, lip-locked with some random guy.\n \n There was another incident where this guy had a twin whom he wanted to work at our company. I saw him chatting up the receptionist and I so happened to comment to a coworker that I was with, \"wouldn't it be funny if he were the gay twin?\"\n \n I ran into him at another gay club a week later.\n \n Another gentleman who was hired at the company, had to share an office with me for about 3 months. Considering that we were too busy to stay in one place, it wasn't much of an issue, but there were moments when would chit chat about mundane stuff. He even told me about his girlfriend a couple of times. At some point I kept getting a nagging feeling that he was gay. I even asked another gay person (the twin) if he sensed it too. The twin asked me if he did or said anything to me (he hadn't), since he couldn't see it. I just kept having a nagging feeling.\n \n Well, there was a party, and things happened, and I ended up having to take him home (he was drunk, and I need to make sure he wasn't taken advantage of) and had a little talk about what I had witnessed. Now I see him out all the time.\n \n I would say that I have gaydar. However, for it to work for me, I cannot look for mannerisms. I also cannot have any suggestions that a person may be gay. It just has to happen on its own, while doing everyday things. When it's not suggested, I am dead on.",

I was just making an observation and asking for your input. That's it. I actually respect your honesty. \n \n \nBut having said what I have said, I have often thought that most homosexual relationships result from failed heterosexual relationships. I find it a little hard to understand how two people of the same sex can find true compatibility. But I'm willing to concede it may in fact be genetically programmed and we just have to accept it as what it is.\n\n \n Well you are completely entitled to your opinions. I just hope you see that I'm only trying to give you my take from my experiences as a lesbian. \n Yes, I was married to a man, no it did not last. (Thankfully) But my sexuality wasn't the cause nor the result of that relationships demise. \n I always knew I was attracked to women. \n I really thought that there was something terribly wrong with me, that I was bad or whatever. I thought that if I pretended to be straight, dated guys and even married and had a child that I would somehow be \"cured\" of my orientation towards women. \n It didn't happen. \n I never once mentioned this to my husband. I was ashamed of my feelings and couldn't talk about it to anyone. \n It took me years after the end of my marriage to resolve these issues and accept who I am, be comfortable in my own skin and start learning to actually like myself for who I am. I had to learn to stop punishing myself, stop telling myself how sick or bad I was. \n Only once I was able to do that was I ever able to actually find happiness. \n I found out that not only could I learn to love myself, but someone else was able to love me too. I found that my family still loved me, and even more so for being honest with myself. \n I have a wonderful partner, a supportive family and a happy child. \n All I don't have are the benefits and securities which I had when I was married to a man. \n \n My ex gets to go off and marry four times before he turned thirty without even a second glance by the government, but if I dare to find just one person whom I want to spend the rest of my life with, whom I want to grow old with, whom shares in raising my son, I am condemned to be concidered as a second class citizen? \n \n I'm sorry, but I joined the Navy because I believed in my country. I believed in it's fairness and took an oath to protect those freedoms for every citizen. \n But the irony is, I don't get those very same rights of which I took an oath to preserve. \n That's not democracy, that's not equality, that's just not the country I was raised to believe in. \n \n ...it's that knowledge which drives me. Because it affects me on such a personal level.\n \n I know you can't sympathize, but I can only hope that you are intellegent enough to at least understand even some part of what I and so many fellow citizens are going through. How so many families are put in perril because of this very divisive and descriminatory state of affairs. \n \n Tomarrow (well today actually) I will be talking to a group of fellow citizens, along with my partner and a few others, about why this is so important to myself, my partner and our family. \n Why our children and our children's children will only benefit from complete access to equality.",

   "I thought you were in the navy? Aren't you supposed to be a nautical killing machine?\n\n \n \n Ouch that hurt. Yeah, I was trained by the marines in alternative combat. But does that mean I currently subscribe to that mentality? No. I guess the military just didn't do a very good job of brainwashing me. Thankfully I never had to fire even one shot at a living soul. Inanimate targets are one thing, but I still do not know to this day if I could have been able to fire on a human being. \n That said, being a mother makes that question a bit more difficult. \n \n \n \nUnless somebody says \"I'm gay\", or I walk in on them having sex, I am clueless about such things. There are some exceptions. There are some folks that are such flaming homosexuals that you can not help but notice.\n\n \n And see this is exactly why I posted my story of my two friends. Both male, one gay, one straight. It's the flamer who's the STRAIGHT guy. \n I know, disappointing, but it's true. \n My dear flamming friend is as straight as they come. He's from Georgia, an actor and extremely over the top flammer. BUT STRAIGHT as a summer day is long. \n It's the one who you would never think to be gay who is. (at least between these two) \n Of course if you get to know the guy you know that everything is a mini drama and that it's always all about him.

While certin things have caused trouble (not any more, mostly in the past), I always knew that everybody would get over it. I would hate to ever think my kids would be afraid to tell me something like that.\n\n \n Well it's a combination of factors. She is \"out\" to her mother. But seeing as the rest of her family is kind of \"redneck\" her mother actually asked her to NEVER tell anyone else in the family. Yes, this causes my parter a lot of stress, because she so desperately wants to be honest with her family and hates being forced to lie in a way. I can't imaging being in her position. \n \n \n \nThats good! You tell her that a nobody businessman in kansas says not to be afraid of who she is.

I find theatre people to be very open about a lot. Even stuff you don't want to know. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that actors tend to pull from life experience as well as emotions thought to be lost to pull off a performance. Also the fact that you're bombarded with human sexuality and body types in the dressing rooms. Actors, at least backstage, tend to be a lot less uptight about things. \n \n I was on general cast for a local Renaissance Faire for eight years. There's really not a whole lot of \"privacy\" to be had there. Everyone comes to their pre-show cast meetings with little else on but their underwear...if you're lucky.

I read somewhere that men don't really have friends as adults and then I thought about myself and realized it was true. We do talk to one another but we don't really confide and comfort one another as women do. I think that's why men don't live as long as women. When we get on in years and lose our spouses or whatever we tend to become isolated and prone to illnesses and hopelessness that women don't have. They more or less assume they will outlive their spouses and have a reservoir of friends among their women friends. They can talk for hours on the phone. When's the last time a man would do that? That's not to put women down but there is a distinct difference. And I've found that I can talk to women, even on private matters, that I would never share with other men. A few years back my wife had a serious illness and I never felt so alone in my life. I didn't have that support system and I suspect most men don't either. Fortunately she did recover her health but that was a real eye-opener for me. Men may be much stronger physically, but emotionally much less secure.",
