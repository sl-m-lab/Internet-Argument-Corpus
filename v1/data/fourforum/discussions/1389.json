If not then all science would come to a halt and we would be mired in the 17th century.\n \nI then stated what my belief is about scientific reasoning. It does assume evolution to be true.\n\n No. It accepts evolution to be true based on over 100 years of hypothesis, prediction, and testing. There comes a time when it is no longer necessary to go over it every time. Given your objections, before a Dr. could treat a patient for an infection it would be necessary to \"prove\" that the infection was caused by a micro-organism. Scientific reasoning demands that the germ theory of disease not be assumed. It would be necessary to \"prove\" that the sun is the center of the solar system before calculating parameters for a shot to Mars. Scientific reasoning demands that the helocentic theory not be assumed. And, of course, all of the work in elementry nuclear physics would have to be repeated to demonstrate that U-235 in the correct concentration and environment can sustain a fission reaction before any reactor could be powered up. Such dangerous things cannot be assumed.\n \nWhen they then make statements that it proves evolution to be true (perhaps not them but perhaps you), I would disagree. One cannot assume it to be true and then use it to prove that it is true.\n\n Where did I ever make any statement about that anything \"proves\" evolution to be true. Don't put words in my mouth.\n \nProper scientific reasoning requires that one assume it to be untrue and then to look to disprove. If the evidence does not bear that out, then you have provided another anecdotal example of the theory being correct.\n\n Proper scientific reasoning requires that one assume that the earth is the center of the universe every time one intends to study astronomy, astrophysics or cosmology. The obvious observations must be disproven every time. It is apparently not acceptable to show that it is wrong (done many times) even if some people are incapable of understanding or accepting it. Even though it is theoretical, all scientists accept that it is true. They also understand the theoretical nature of the evidence.\n \n And whether a theory is correct or not is not based on anecdotal examples. You are confusing science with creationism. Creation scientists make it up as they go and call it a theory. Just read Hovind's XXXX. A huge comet crashed into the North Pole, froze all of the mammoths and caused the ice age. His evidence consists of frozen mammoths and the polar ice cap.\n \n Creationists have the utmost scorn for science. To accept creationism requires the rejection of the theories of physics, astrophysics, astronomy, nuclear physics, geology, biogeography, physiology, morphology, genetics, population genetics, ecology, embryology, and on and on. In real science one accepts the well supported theories as correct until some evidence is found that places it in doubt. The sun is accepted to be the center if the solar system until some evidence indicates that the theory is wrong. It is accepted that the universe is expanding (with the necessary conclusion about its size in the distant past) until some evidence, any evidence, that indicates otherwise is demonstrated. It is assumed, based on established theory, that if sufficient uranium that is 3% U-235 is gathered in the presense of a suitable moderator that a sustainable fission reaction will begin without blowing up. The entire theoretical basis of reactor construction isn't demonstrated anew before the reactor can be powered up.\n \nSorry if you don't like that.\n\n Sorry if you don't like the way science works.",

Wouldn't that be pretty good evidence for the common ancestry of all life?\n \n And you misunderstand what is being said. I am not making a claim, and most evolutionary biologists don't make the claim, that ther is no designer. Not everyone is Dawkins. On the other hand, there is no evidence of a designer that cannot be explained by naturalistic explanations better. If you understand what natural selection is you realize that the result is a population of animals that appears designed for their environment. Eldridge and Gould even proposed that a well adapted animals would tend to remain unchanged in a stable environment. For example, the two species of coelacanth are called living fossils because other coelacanths went extinct about 80 million years ago. But all known fossil species were shallow water species. The living species are deep water fish - an environment that changes little over the eons. Another example is the recently discovered 425 million year old ostracod. Ostracods are a type of crustacean that makes up the plankton in the open seas, another environment that is stable for long periods. These are examples of extreme stasis.\n \n But what the paper is discussing is what happens in unstable conditions. When environmental changes place populations under stress, when the usual coping mechanisms fail, then change changes in the population may be rapid. An example is that of Darwin's finches on Daphne Major in the Galapagos islands. The Grants studied them for 20 years and could distinguish the difference between the two species on the island. One species ate the large, hard seeds and had a beak suited to the task, the other ate the small, softer seeds and had a similarly suitable beak. But when a drought of several years reduced the available food, both species were almost wiped out. The few survivors of both species became adapted to the single remaining food source and came to look remarkably similar (beak size).\n \n But anyway, if you wish to postulate your designer, you may. It just isn't science. Natural explanations suffice and science, which is naturalistic, can't address the supernatural. It doesn't deny it. It just can't address it.",

However, looking at it from the beleif that God created for 6 days (days in this case meaning long periods of time), and has been resting from that since the beginning of the 7th 'day'... and that because of Adam's sin, nature is under a curse of sorts - then it would seem that the perfect designs of us and other living things have been allowed to degenerate. And the fact that the designs we see are very complex and beautiful - such that they are far beyond our own current capabilities of design should at least make the idea that there is a Creator plausible. \n \n As an aside, if it could be determined that the living organisms around us, as well as our own species are in fact degenerating over time, then it would make the evidence for origional perfection strong.\n \n \n Well, you haven't supported your 75% claim in the first place and you haven't shown the relationships of several phyla, classes, orders, genra, and species. But a more than 98% similarity in coding DNA is really, really close. It is even more convincing when you realize that your designer wasn't required to make the DNA of chimps and humans similar at all, much less bananas. POOF - GODDIDIT explains nothing.\n\n \n I've just looked it up, and it seems that it's 50% for bannanas (75% for worms, according to one page). My Google link isn't working right now, but if you want, just type 'banana human dna similarity' in. Quite interesting, I think. So there you go, 50% similarity between us and Bannanas. I don't think it really proves much either way - except to show that Dna similarity does not mean a highly close reation, necessarily. (please exuse my spelling)\n \n I think it's quite silly to rule out God because of similarity between species. I can only conclude that you are joking, or that you refuse to accept any possibility of a God. Certainly God, could have made each organism completely different, but would they be even able to interact? We have no idea. It doesn't seem likely to me. And God isn't required to make things completly differently. I beleive that you could see evidence for either Naturalistic Evolution or Creation through the similarities we see....\n \n All the instances of design of - for example shelters - we know of (by humans) contain similar elements. So do the living things we see. Obviously, there was a designer for both cases.\n \n Or, Naturalistic Evolution would of course give rise to similar organisms, we see that, so obviously, evolution is the answer.\n \n \n Of course. If you wish to claim otherwise then you are resorting to the god-of-the-gaps. Anything that is not fully understood and explained must be your designer, who is imperfect because he must design and must reuse parts from one organism to another. And then when science discovers the naturalistic explanations, your god is reduced by one more gap. As time goes on, your god is merely what we don't know.\n\n \n In other words, Science must automatically rule out God? Is it scientific to rule something out from the start, and with no exceptions? (especially when it comes to the origions of things) I do agree, as I stated, that you must not simply say God did it to what you don't understand.\n \n As for god-of-the-gaps, there has been an interesting occurence of what some call no-god-of-the-gaps in Astronomy. Astronomers who will not accept the evidence for design and intelligence behind the conditions of the universe, which seem to them to be fine-tuned to create the right conditions for life, have increasingly relied on an extremely short period of time just after the 'big bang', during which the laws of physics may or may not have broken down, to postulate that during this time, an infinity of universes were spawned - therefore making it possible that our seemingly fine-tuned universe is the product of chance.",

   "Robbie you are right that we might expect a Designer to reuse the same parts in different species. So even though most of our genes are the same as chimp genes, this does not show evolution as fact.\n In the same way you showed that walls, roofs, entrances are similar in lots of shelters which can be explained by common design.\n \n But walls, roofs and entrances are all functional design. Common descent of species (evolution) is beyond doubt because of a different type of similarity - errors.\n \n Human DNA contains millions of past mutations, broken genes and viral insertions that have been accumulated throughout the generations.\n When we look at Chimpanzee DNA we find some of these same mutations, broken genes and viral insertions are in the exact same place. These are not design features so it is hard to explain these similarities by common design and impossible to explain how they got there without common ancestory of humans and chimps.\n \n The analogy of these errors to the shelter example would be if you noticed all houses had a smudge on the wall in exactly the same shape and place. We know that smudges are not designed and therefore we know such a thing cannot be explained by common design*\n \n In fact errors in DNA can be matched up across many different species. What emerges is a pattern of shared errors and insertions that match the tree of evolution quite nicely.\n \n The only possible explaination of common design left would be to claim the common designer put these similarities to trick us, or to convince us that evolution is true.\n \n *The problem with shelters is that they cannot reproduce and evolve, therefore the similar smudges cannot be explained by common descent. On the otherhand creatures are different because they do reproduce and this means the common descent explaination is available\n \n Also evolution does not rule out God. It just shows that the species we see today didn't appear fully-formed, but gradually developed from previous species. Whether or not God had a role in this is not known",
