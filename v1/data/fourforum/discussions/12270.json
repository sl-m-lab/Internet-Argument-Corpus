Your claim that twinning or chimeras disproves that fact is little more than just a claim.\n\n I think the problem is that what you see as 'due consideration' is, again, highly subjective. Your 'due consideration' for Chimeras, for example, is (to paraphrase) 'they are meant to undermine my position, so I consider them fallacious'.\n \n The 'scientific community' has not established your much-touted 'fact' about the origin of life - you still have yet to even define 'life' as it relates to individuals. If we are going to discuss things which are 'little more than claims' - I'd put that near the top of the list... subjectively, of course.\n \n Oh, and incidentally - chimera organisms are not created by a 'genetic oddity' in one zygote. Instead, they are created from two separate zygotes that fuse together, and then individualise by the method you've brought up before. By your logic, a chimera individual would have not one, but two 'start points' to their life, as there are two different DNA sequences in their body.\n \n \nFor example, how would it be detrimental to a twin (developed by splitting post conception) if a law were written stating that thier life actually began at the conception (when the DNA was originally created) of the other twin?\nSurely this is the sort of law you are currently proposing? I imagine it would change things considerably, otherwise you wouldn't be proposing it.\n \n I also thought that you didn't want to talk about how the law is used, but 'how things are' - in absolute terms (given that you believe absolute terms even exist for 'life'). Speaking in those terms and using 'DNA' as a guide to 'individuality' - a zygote can be one or two 'individuals'. Potentially, any zygote can be one or two 'individuals'.\n ...and we return, as ever, to a zygote as 'potential'.\n \n Does that make someone who uses the morning-after pill guilty of double murder, but if they wait a few weeks until there is a guaranteed lack of twinning, they will only be charged with single murder?",
