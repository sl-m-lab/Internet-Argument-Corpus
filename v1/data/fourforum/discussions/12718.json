   "If mandatory gun registration can't be used to punish ex-felons in possession of a firearm, what purpose does such a law serve? If mandatory gun registration can only be used to punish people that can legally possess a gun, why bother? Because of the Haynes decision, if we want to punish ex-felons who are caught in possession of a gun, there are only two choices available: We must either skip registration, so that we can severely punish gun possession by those who aren't allowed to own guns; or use the \"sanitized\" form of registration law, where the criminal is guaranteed that gun registration can't hurt him, while the rest of us can be punished for failure to comply. In other words registration is not a crime fighting tool by any way you slice the pie. \n \n Gun registration records can be used in the future to confiscate guns, the only real excuse for doing so. The second director of Handgun Control, Inc. AKA the Brady bunch, has stated explicitly that mandatory registration is one of the steps towards prohibition of handgun ownership but when we examine how the courts have crippled gun registration laws so that felons are effectively exempt, and only law-abiding citizens need to fear such laws. What other explanation can there be for the continuing plea for mandatory gun registration? \n \n Registration does not prevent crime. How could it? The black market supplies all that is needed. Criminals aren't going to register their guns and they pay cash under the table for both guns and ammo. Not to mention the bottomless hole that money is poured into to do what? If gun crime reduction is the desired end then harsh punishment of existing criminals is much better. \n \n \"Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda. Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years. After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners, police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs. Given Hawaii's remote island geography, this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled. If registration is going to work anywhere, it should work there. Unfortunately, criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world. Other jurisdictions with a history of strict handgun bans, such as the District of Columbia and Chicago, have even required registration of hunting rifles and shotguns for more than 20 years. Neither the District nor Chicago can point to any crimes that have been solved using registration records.\" Washington Times 13 April 2009 \n \n Why continue to beat the dead horse of firearm registration?",

   "Why continue to beat the dead horse of firearm registration?\n\n \n The answer is simple: registering firearms has nothing to do with fighting crime, it's about policy and personal belief and fulfilling an agenda. It's about politics, not practical application.\n \n If nationwide gun registration was mandated, one could simply refuse to register, and if found out they could argue that they feared their registered firearm would later be declared illegal and they would be required to either turn it into the police or face prosecution for committing a criminal act, IE having their right against self-incrimination violated.",

Fighting crime has never been the idea behind registration. Its more like some left-tard politico urinating on your leg and telling you its raining. \n \n Well so far the courts have gone with protecting the felons. I don't believe the biased left mainstream media will be covering it in a favorable light either. Our only hope is the blogsphere and talk radio. But the left is after them in a big way. They can't bring back the \"fairness doctrine\" so now its the magic word diversity. As in diversity of ownership. When are we the people going to kick that garbage to the curb? What ever happened to equal protection under that law. Now its conservatives need not apply.",
