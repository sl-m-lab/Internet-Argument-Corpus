   "Do you believe in an absolute Right and Wrong that is true despite what people think?\n\n If an all-powerful God exists as God is described by the Christian Bible, for example, it is possible that this God has a well-defined line between the concepts that we call 'right' and 'wrong.' (Or similarly, these concepts can be labeled morally 'good' or morally 'bad' or 'evil.')\n \n However, no one existing in the physical realm knows whether any specific definition of God is absolute... let alone whether or not a God or many gods or no gods exist.\n \n It takes faith to believe that the concepts of 'right' and 'wrong' are absolute. Faith is very subjective -- it is dependant upon personal experience. In other words, no matter what you believe, there is no way to know within the physical realm whether your beliefs coincide with any absolute morals as defined by a God -- if that God even defines absolute morals, and if that God even exists.\n \n So my short answer is this:\n It is possible, but there is no way to know -- except through subjective belief -- which makes the application of perceived absolutes subjective.\n \n My even shorter answer is this:\n The concepts of 'right' and 'wrong' are completely fabricated by humanity.",

This should fail right there, but let's move on to consider why it is not a absolute. The aristocracy has litteraly robbed people for centuries, and this was considered just and normal. Kings took what they wanted, when they wanted, from virtually whoever they wanted, and that was just. But let's move away from the Royalty to people like you and me. Is stealing a piece of bread wrong if your family is on the verge of starvation? How about if your wife needs life saving medication and the owner of the meds is charging more then anyone will ever own? The award winning play Les Miserables, written by Victor Hugo briefly touchs upon this. Is stealing something someone else stole wrong? To say theft is a absolute wrong is to disgrard all circumstances as well as ethics. \n \n \nAbsolute Right: Honesty. I'd think that honesty would be absolutely right, telling the truth and being sincere is something virtuous and requires you to humble yourself, or others, in some cases - whether you end up hurting someone, something, or yourself is irrelevant.\n\n \n What if honesty gets a innocent million people killed? Is lying to a search party of genocidal rebels that no one is in the house wrong? What if a Russian spy asked how many nuclear weapons you had on standby, would it be right to tell him and compromise the safety and lives of millions of Americans? \n \n \nAbsolute Right: Generosity. Giving or being ready to give freely, free from meanness or prejudice, that is righteous.\n\n \n And if it only helps propagate behavior like child beggars? Is that just? Breaking the cycle of beggers requires denying them what they normally reside on. Forcing them to stand on their own proveraibal legs. \n \n I don't believe any of the four are absolute.",

It is all encompassing. Nothing is excepted. If you say everything but this statement, has exceptions. you are saying this statement has NO exceptions. Therefore it is absolute. Other cue words for absolutes are \"all\", \"nothing\", \"never\", \"none\", \"absolutely\", etc. The statement, \"there are no absolutes\" IS an absolute. The word \"no\" leaves no room to be different. NOw, if one were to say, \"most things are not absolute.\" That would be tough to argue logically. It could only be done empirically. The issue with using absolute words such as \"all\" or \"none\" is that it only takes one exception to prove them wrong. So, saying \"there are no absolutes, except this statement\" simply proves that there are indeed, absolutes as it is an absolute statement.\n \n YOu see, making that the assertion that there are none of anything is difficult to prove as you cannot do it anecdotally.

While you specifically have a truck-load of evolutionary programming, you, like most of us, can override much of it with higher thinking. Most other animals, we think, cannot do this, and certainly not to the degree humans can. That's one reason we're so helpless as infants...we traded much of the pre-programming for a blank slate to be written on by whoever/whatever is around.

Do you get a little physical feeling if someone you love is in danger? ..and so on, we could go on quite a while with that list.\n \n Now, can you not override or at least choose not to follow the \"instinctual\" motivation? Choose not to have sex even though you feel the urge? Choose to continue on in the woods despite your fear? Fast and forgo food even though your body screams for it? Control your anger even though it tells you to lash out? I can, why can't you? Evolution provides a good record of survival tips, but we're also gifted with higher thinking, a much more flexible system, to solve many of our everyday predicaments.\n \n So no, I don't think my genes explicitely said \"go post on 4forums or believe in XYZ. I do think I feel \"some\" compulsion to come here..entertainment, learning from others, learning about myself, etc. But can I resist that urge?

   "You know better montalbaln.\n\n It's M-O-N-T-A-L-B-A-N !\n \nWhile you specifically have a truck-load of evolutionary programming, you, like most of us, can override much of it with higher thinking. Most other animals, we think, cannot do this, and certainly not to the degree humans can. That's one reason we're so helpless as infants...we traded much of the pre-programming for a blank slate to be written on by whoever/whatever is around. Hopefully, it's our parents, who must have figured SOMETHING out if they made it to adulthood and procreated...\n\n So you're saying evolution has give us the ability to go beyond evolution? Why?\n \nWhy do you feel jealousy? Anger? Fear? Why do most people feel fear if they are abandoned in the woods in the pitch blank of night? Why do we feel the urge to engage in sexual activity? Why do you enjoy eating, and don't enjoy the feeling of starvation? Do you get a little physical feeling if someone you love is in danger? ..and so on, we could go on quite a while with that list.\n\n For you, it's just a matter of chemicals inter-acting. For me, love is a reflection of the love of God. What is, for you, the evolutionary necessity for love?\n \nNow, can you not override or at least choose not to follow the \"instinctual\" motivation? Choose not to have sex even though you feel the urge? Choose to continue on in the woods despite your fear? Fast and forgo food even though your body screams for it? Control your anger even though it tells you to lash out? \n\n And why did evolution allow this to happen? What is the evolutionary necessity of being supra-evolutional? (i.e. the ability to act without regards this 'evolutionary programming')\n \nI can, why can't you?\n\n Are you saying I can't control my anger?\n \n Evolution provides a good record of survival tips, but we're also gifted with higher thinking, a much more flexible system, to solve many of our everyday predicaments.\n\n No, it simply is believed that because evolution is true, everything that has survived is because of evolution. It is circular reasoning.\n \nSo no, I don't think my genes explicitly said \"go post on 4forums or believe in XYZ. I do think I feel \"some\" compulsion to come here..entertainment, learning from others, learning about myself, etc. But can I resist that urge? Can't prove it, but right now that's sort of irrelevant. There is nothing yet that tells me that I cannot control the urge, so I lean on the \"free will\" side. At least for every day practicalities.\n\n So what is the evolutionary purpose/process for you getting 'free will'? Why aren't you compelled to do these things, and yet do others?\n \nAs to absolutes, I agree with emclean. Absolutes right and wrong doesn't seem to be something you can prove. Duo has an interesting attempt at a broader definition of absolute \"right in every case\", but I don't think that's a good way to define an absolute personally. And \"good health\" is from a human perspective..which IMO makes it not an absolute by definition. \n -Mach\n \n\n God is absolute love. But you don't believe in God because you have no evidence, because you believe in naturalistic science , which therefore can't prove God. Rather circular reasoning there too, a bit like your evolution proves itself because we are here.\n \n Which evolution do you believe in anyway? There's many different schools of thought on it. There's Marxist evolutionary theory, capitalistic evolutionary theroy. There's theory that we slowly change, theory that we quickly changed. Evolution that points to us evolving in Africa, and then spreading out, then there's the one about us spreading-out, and then evolving. There's so many to choose from.",

   "So you're saying evolution has give us the ability to go beyond evolution? Why?\n\n It's just another step in the evolutionary process.

Call a spade a spade, or call it a mack truck. Your belief does nothing to change it.\n \n You need to define the love you are talking about for me to give my guess as to the biological/evolutionary advantage of love. Off the cuff, it's painfully obvious Montalban, but I'll answer once you clarify, in one post (not mixed in here). Feelilng a positive emotional response towards your close relatives and your mate, ehances their survival, and ultimately increases the liklihood of you passing on your DNA, and to a lesser extent the DNA of your relatives that is CLOSE to your DNA, but not exactly the same. Yet another survival advantage that would be selected. Same reason we don't feel the same need to save a starving child on the other side of the world as greatly as we feel the need to feed our own child. Would you let your own child starve? Yet you let millions of children starve without pause. Think about it....\n \n \nAnd why did evolution allow this to happen? What is the evolutionary necessity of being supra-evolutional? (i.e. the ability to act without regards this 'evolutionary programming')\n\n You're messing up again. Evolution doesn't \"allow\" things to happen, nor does it NOT allow things to happen. It's just a process. There is no \n evolutionary \"necessity\". There is no plan!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n If there had not been a mass extinction in the era of dinosaurs, it's entirely possible that higher thinking would never have occured. It's just chance. Maybe we're the only life in the universe with the capablity, who knows, it doesn't change anything.\n \n \nAre you saying I can't control my anger?\n\n Rhetorical question Montalban. Of course you can control your anger, which is CONTRADICTORY to your earlier assumption that having evolutionary responses necessity action without free will. You lost that argument right there.\n \n \nNo, it simply is believed that because evolution is true, everything that has survived is because of evolution. It is circular reasoning.\n\n To say that is somehow \"circular reasoning\" is a lack of understanding on your part. It's actually simple logic.\n \n If you believe evolution is the process by which all life was created on earth, then you believe life is a result of evolution. \n \n That's not circular reasoning, that's basic logic 101. Yes I believe evolution is the process by which all life was created on earth, therefore it's REASONABLE to think that I would then believe life was the result of evolutionary change. (!!!!!!!!)\n \n What you're confusing is the circular reasoning generally seen in religious arguments, where a religious person believes in god because the bible tells them to, and then when questioned on where did the words in the bible come from, they say it's God's word. That's circular reasoning. You're abusing philosophy :/\n \n \nSo what is the evolutionary purpose/process for you getting 'free will'? Why aren't you compelled to do these things, and yet do others?\n\n Why do you push for me to KNOW something fully, yet you're completely willing to believe in a whole mess of things that have absolutely NO evidence? I find that supremeley ironic, and unfortunate :/\n \n Put simply, higher thinking provides a survival advantage, evolution favors mutations that result in a survival advantage. Easy as punch.\n \n \nGod is absolute love. But you don't believe in God because you have no evidence, because you believe in naturalistic science , which therefore can't prove God. Rather circular reasoning there too, a bit like your evolution proves itself because we are here.\n\n \n So here you flay yourself with nonsense. You have NO evidence for existence of God, yet you bark at the evidence of evolution as the process for creating life. You don't want to believe what has sufficient evidence, so you decide not to. I call that free will, but also irrational. I cannot convince you through reason, if you arrive at your conclusions without relying on reason. I can try, but it's ultimately got to be your decision to reason and understand what you can.\n \n YOU ARE IRRATIONAL. Good heaven's man, the cause for not beleiving is lack of sufficient evidence, that is NOT CIRCULAR REASONING (See above an example of circular reasoning).\n \n I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THINGS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n \n Yet you do. So you're either incapable or unwilling to be rational. We don't need to argue past that, because it's pointless to try to show you, through reason, what you ignore through irrationality.\n \n \nWhich evolution do you believe in anyway? There's many different schools of thought on it. There's Marxist evolutionary theory, capitalistic evolutionary theroy. There's theory that we slowly change, theory that we quickly changed.

There's so many to choose from.\n\n \n where it relates to life on earth:\n \"evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next.\" \n \n You believe in evolution, you just don't accept it, despite the preponderance of evidence, as the process by which life on earth changes.\n \n We may want to move the discussion to a different thread if you still have unanswered questions.\n \n -Mach",

Call a spade a spade, or call it a mack truck. Your belief does nothing to change it.\n\n Of course it matters. If you see a painting that I have gone to some effort to paint, and you say it looks like paint just dripped onto a canvas, then you would be insulting the 'intelligence' behind the painting. It is still 'a painting' but how it came about is most important, if not, why are you having this conversation?\n \n You need to define the love you are talking about for me to give my guess as to the biological/evolutionary advantage of love.

Yet you let millions of children starve without pause. Think about it....\n\n How does that explain altruism? Further, how is it that at once you believe that we are capable of going beyond our evolution, but here saying that love came about from evolution? With regards love, which is something you do, that is independent of evolution, and which is it that's directly from evolution? You also simply explain that love must be from evolution - but how did it come about? Love is an immaterial process. Show me the step-by-step way love evolved. It shouldn't be so hard, after-all you guys claim you can show how the eye evolved.\n \nAnd why did evolution allow this to happen? What is the evolutionary necessity of being supra-evolutional? (i.e. the ability to act without regards this 'evolutionary programming') \n\n \nYou're messing up again. Evolution doesn't \"allow\" things to happen, nor does it NOT allow things to happen. It's just a process. There is no \n evolutionary \"necessity\". There is no plan!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n Not necessarily so. Complete randomness would mean that all species are continually producing massive amounts of monstrous oddities. There is not the complete randomness in nature.\n \"The theory of evolution most emphatically does not say that humans arose purely by chance.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB940.html\n In other words, evolution has a purpose -only the fit survive. Otherwise, why not kill off the most fit, and have an extinction of every living thing ever? Why are there in fact any animals alive? Why is there stability amongst species? With all the re-combinations possible for genes, there's the ordered reproduction that we see so that species do survive. Why is there order?\n \n If there had not been a mass extinction in the era of dinosaurs, it's entirely possible that higher thinking would never have occurred. It's just chance. Maybe we're the only life in the universe with the capability, who knows, it doesn't change anything.\n\n Things didn't just happen by chance. See above.\n \nAre you saying I can't control my anger? \n\n \nRhetorical question Montalban. Of course you can control your anger, which is CONTRADICTORY to your earlier assumption that having evolutionary responses necessity action without free will. You lost that argument right there.\n\n What argument do you think I was making? How did 'free will' come about through evolution? What is the evolutionary advantage of having it? Is it an advantage? If not, is it a residual of some past phase?\n \nNo, it simply is believed that because evolution is true, everything that has survived is because of evolution. It is circular reasoning.\n\n \nTo say that is somehow \"circular reasoning\" is a lack of understanding on your part. It's actually simple logic.\n\n No, it's circular. Everything we have, you attribute to evolution because you believe evolution to be true. You attribute things that evolution can't produce, such as love, to evolution, and another 'free will' both of which are non-material things. Somehow, you've got to explain how immaterial things popped out of the material. A bit like explaining how life came from non-life, which is also a thing that stumps all those that believe in an atheistic-evolution. There are people who extend evolution into all aspects of life, psychology, history, economics - because to you, it all came from evolution.\n [quote=Montalban]If you believe evolution is the process by which all life was created on earth, then you believe life is a result of evolution. \n \nThat's not circular reasoning, that's basic logic 101. Yes I believe evolution is the process by which all life was created on earth, therefore it's REASONABLE to think that I would then believe life was the result of evolutionary change. (!!!!!!!!)\n\n No, it leads to evolutionists thinking that all things come from evolution, love, business, philosophy, even religion. Like you attempting earlier, in very vague terms, about love. You need to, because for you it just has to have come from material processes... because you recognise love does exist, and believe that material process is all that there is. Somehow immaterial things came from material things.\n \n What you're confusing is the circular reasoning generally seen in religious arguments, where a religious person believes in god because the bible tells them to, and then when questioned on where did the words in the bible come from, they say it's God's word. That's circular reasoning. You're abusing philosophy\n\n I believe in God because I am witness to God. I don't believe in God for purely speculative reasons. I am witness to His calling, His miracles, His testimony. You are the one who doesn't believe in God because there's no proof because you only accept the proofs that can't prove God! (i.e. materialistic processes) That is an abuse of philosophy. Maybe it's because you don't have the right philosophy gene?\n \nSo what is the evolutionary purpose/process for you getting 'free will'? Why aren't you compelled to do these things, and yet do others? \n\n \nWhy do you push for me to KNOW something fully, yet you're completely willing to believe in a whole mess of things that have absolutely NO evidence? I find that supremely ironic, and unfortunate\n\n Where is the irony? It's in your re-construction of what I believe - that I believe in God, and you can't because you don't accept any evidences except materialistic ones which can't prove God. Now there's the irony!\n \nPut simply, higher thinking provides a survival advantage, evolution favours mutations that result in a survival advantage. Easy as punch.\n\n What has 'higher thinking' got to do with free will? Are you saying that a slug doesn't have free will?\n Or that a whale which does have higher thinking, has free will?\n But you exhibit the circular reasoning again. Higher thinking enables survival! A slug doesn't have the brains we do, yet survives. Everything survives because of evolution is what you're saying... whether it has higher thinking, or not. Everything just is, because of evolution! Higher thinking, lower thinking, no thinking, all enable survival, because they all survive.\n Why is it that we have 'free will' and not some insect-like communal system where-by the individual is under the will of the general good? That's another odd thing you have to face up to, all your dreams, desires etc, are from evolution. You are just a mess of chemicals.\n \nGod is absolute love. But you don't believe in God because you have no evidence, because you believe in naturalistic science , which therefore can't prove God. Rather circular reasoning there too, a bit like your evolution proves itself because we are here. \n\n \nSo here you flay yourself with nonsense. You have NO evidence for existence of God, yet you bark at the evidence of evolution as the process for creating life. You don't want to believe what has sufficient evidence, so you decide not to. I call that free will, but also irrational. I cannot convince you through reason, if you arrive at your conclusions without relying on reason. I can try, but it's ultimately got to be your decision to reason and understand what you can.\n\n I do have evidence for the existence of God. I have been witness to His miracles and His calling. Sure, it's not scientific evidence. And sure, you won't therefore accept it, but then you actually only believe this circular reasoning when its convenient. Unless you've actually seen an atom - I expect you accept the witness statements of other scientists on this.\n \nYOU ARE IRRATIONAL. Good heaven's man, the cause for not believing is lack of sufficient evidence, that is NOT CIRCULAR REASONING (See above an example of circular reasoning).\n I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THINGS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n Yet you do. So you're either incapable or unwilling to be rational. We don't need to argue past that, because it's pointless to try to show you, through reason, what you ignore through irrationality.\n\n No, once again you only believe in materialist evidences, which can never prove God, therefore you have no evidence for God. Yet you believe in immaterial things such as 'Beauty'. Unless you can show me the scientific proofs for 'beauty'. You're only selective in when you apply your circular reasoning, which is still illogical.\n \nWhich evolution do you believe in anyway? There's many different schools of thought on it. There's Marxist evolutionary theory, capitalistic evolutionary theory. There's theory that we slowly change, theory that we quickly changed. Evolution that points to us evolving in Africa, and then spreading out, then there's the one about us spreading-out, and then evolving. There's so many to choose from. \n\n \n\n where it relates to life on earth:\n \"evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next.\" \n\n So you're saying that if a gene changes, that's evolution. What about that caused by radiation say, from fall-out?\n \nYou believe in evolution, you just don't accept it, despite the preponderance of evidence, as the process by which life on earth changes.\n\n That's very arrogant of you to suggest what I do in fact believe. Is that the arrogant gene? Or is that the immaterial process of 'free will' that came about through material processes.\n \nWe may want to move the discussion to a different thread if you still have unanswered questions.\n -Mach\n\n I'm quite happy here.",
