   "I thought allowing firearms in National Parks was going to result in a bloodbath?\n \n After several months, it seems the folks who are not committing crimes everywhere else in the nation are not committing them in National Parks either.\n \n Looks like cries of the sky falling as promised by anti-gunners have failed to materialize as usual.\n \n Florida becomes one of the first states to allow CCW\n \n Anti-gunners: \"BLOOD WILL FLOW IN THE STREETS!\"\n What happened: nothing\n \n Almost every other state allows some form of CCW\n \n Anti-gunners: \"THERE WILL BE SHOOTOUTS OVER PARKING SPACES!\"\n What happened: nothing\n \n Staes such as Vermont and Alaska go permitless allowing anyone to CCW:\n \n Anti-gunners: \"INNOCENT CHILDREN AND BYSTANDERS WILL BE MOWED DOWN BY GUNSLINGERS!\"\n What happened: nothing\n \n National Parks are opened to firearms\n \n Anti-gunners: \"HIKING TRAILS WILL BE SLICK WITH THE BLOOD OF INNOCENTS!\"\n What happened: the usual non-event\n \n Anyone want to guess what the standard prediction will be from Brady when the SCOTUS rules in McDonald vs. Chicago?\n \n Anyone want to guess how accurate it will be?\n \n You know, if I were to predict outcome A when event B happened and it turned out to be nonsense.......\n \n Then I predict outcome A when event C happened and it turned out to be nonsense........\n \n I then continue to predict outcome A when events D, E, and F happen.....AND IT NEVER DOES........\n \n Do you think I might start to get a clue that whatever method I'm using to predict things might be completely erroneous? Do you think that \"I'm completely full of it\" might occur to someone with even a shred of intelligence when looking at previous outcomes when compared with previous predictions?\n \n Yet, it's a given. No introspection can be possible when faced with the prospect of gun control. Make the same prediction...AGAIN!\n \n NEVER LOOK AT PAST RESULTS! Simply tighten the blinders and spout out the usual \"BLOOD WILL RUN IN THE STREETS!\" doom and gloom.\n \n Saying the same thing over and over hasn't made the same by-rote prediction come true in the past. What makes it any more likely to come true any time in the future?\n \n It has reached the point where the entire world can see it except for the ones blindly spouting it out time after time after time:\n \n We've heard the same ol' \"cry wolf\" song so many times, the tune has grown monotonous to the point of absurdity.\n \n Why do anti-gunners keep singing it? Can't they hear everyone laughing past the sound of that same old song?",
