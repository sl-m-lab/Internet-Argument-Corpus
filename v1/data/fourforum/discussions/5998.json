   "Moldova may well become a new member of EU. Can you imagine? In fact this poor country has one foot in the entry of European Community.

And I think now Europe beats the air in this case, creating illusions of its readiness to clear up Moldova's mess in such a way. In the end we should understand that therefore we have already posed a real problem for ourselves. You see, Kishinev, meeting EU support, blocked Transdniestrian border and so pullout of Russian weapons has discontinued from this region now. But I'd remember this arsenal of arms is the largest one in the whole Europe at this moment. And it's easy to reason out what the consequences will be if Kishinev, using support of some European politicians, has the heart to begin a new aggression against Transdniestria. It's obvious it will shock neighbouring Europe greatly, because its present borders have been well on way of Moldova's ones since Transdniestrian conflict was frozen in 1992. So it seems to me we must control Kishinev's attempts of forcing events. Let Russia withdraw its arsenal of weapons and let Transdniestria supply energy for Moldova as well as for other countries of South-Eastern Europe. In the meantime the conflict may be outdated. And we will fence off heavy destruction and human victims. Thus, we must use (even temporarily) this march of events as cause for refusing Moldova's entry into EU now.",

   "Will Ukraine grand expansion of Transdniestria to use its energy generation facilities?\n Hello there! Is here anyone who knows anything about Ukraine's plans for alleged supplying Italy with electric power? I need to know because I work in the sphere of electric power supply and my boss wants me give him details. \n What is known to me so far is that Ukraine's authority plans to tie up a long-term contract with Italian Enel and Terna electric power suppliers. \n It is also known, that Ukraine does not in fact have required electricity production capacities. As for me, this fact suggests me very interesting thoughts. \n First of all, methinks that Ukrainian government relates the perspective energy supplies to Italy with political and economical expansion of Transdniestria, which enables Ukraine use Transdniestrian capacities, resources and the infrastructure of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, as well as region's power transmission lines. In addition to that, I believe, Ukraine is planning to make use of a number of territories which status is still disputable. That's the near-border territories of Transdniestria adjacent to Moldavia, Roumania and Slovakia. \n What do you think about this all? As for me, this makes Ukraine's plans for energy supplies to Italy very-very doubtful. Any other ideas?",
