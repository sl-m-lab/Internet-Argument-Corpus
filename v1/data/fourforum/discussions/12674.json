   "I am going to change up the order of this just a bit. I hope you don't mind.\n \nThe most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws?' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws, and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws.' \"\n\n Lets look at what is claimed in the link I post. It's origins were in response to   &#8220;Teddy bears are more regulated than guns.&#8221; -- Violence Policy Center. \n \n   The &#8220;Unregulated&#8221; Gun  \n &#8220;Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns&#8212;more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more.  \n \n (It talks about) Federal agents can wiretap citizens for gun crimes, \n \n a federal law banning qualified principals, teachers and parents from defending them with guns \n \n People have collectively spent untold millions of dollars in legal fees defending themselves in court against charges that involved their guns\n \n There are laws in some states mandating that guns in people&#8217;s homes (private property) be stored according to government edicts\n \n Gun buyers must go through background checks, waiting periods, and get licenses if they wish to carry concealed \n \n Self-defense with a firearm is banned in many cities and states in America. \n\n And we have a whole Federal Agency, which is part to the FBI, regulating one of our Constitutional Bill of Rights which is called a First Right, a Fundamental Right an Inalienable and essential right, named the BATF. And YET even all of this is not enough for you guys. \n \n And the purpose of your post is, YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY EVEN MORE of our Constitutional Rights!",

   "I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources\n\n First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! \n \n However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following! \n \n   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.\n \"I'm convinced that we have to have federal legislation to build on. We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily - given the political realities - going to be very modest. Of course, it's true that politicians will then go home and say, 'This is a great law. The problem is solved.' And it's also true that such statements will tend to defuse the gun-control issue for a time. So then we'll have to strengthen that law, and then again to strengthen that law, and maybe again and again. Right now, though, we'd be satisfied not with half a loaf but with a slice. Our ultimate goal - total control of handguns in the United States - is going to take time. My estimate is from seven to ten years. The problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns sold in this country. The second problem is to get them all registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition - except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors - totally illegal.\" \n -Pete Shields, Chairman and founder, Handgun Control Inc., \"A Reporter At Large: Handguns,\" The New Yorker, July 26, 1976, 57-58\n\n \n But there is no slippery slope.

But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number....\n\n \n SNIP\n \n This opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an \"assault weapons ban\" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.\n \n \nSo why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality, a decline in the number of gun laws, and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns?\n\n \n Why? Because people like you are still pushing gun bans regardless of the Heller ruling!\n \n It doesn't help your side's argument when your people continually talk about \"reasonable\" and \"common sense gun regulations\" and their examples include bans on \"assault weapons\", semi-automatic firearms, \"armor piercing ammunition\", \"high capacity magazines\", waiting periods, mental health evaluations, fingerprinting and photographing of gun owners, permits, nationwide registration, etc.\n \n DC is a fine example of this. After Heller dissolved their gun laws they basically said \"Fine! If it can't be 100% impossible to get a gun in DC then we'll make it 99.9999999% impossible!\" They did this through the enactment of so-called \"emergency legislation\" which violates the Heller ruling in every conceivable way. DC even sold out their home rule to California in the sake of having gun control. Don't you dare forget that DC denied a woman the ability to register her legally owned handgun because it's color scheme wasn't on a list of approved firearms.\n \n People like you are continually demanding that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition be banned, saying that nobody has a legal use for them and they're used exclusively for killing large groups of people, or turning animals into meat paste. Yet at the same time you claim that \"Saturday Night Specials\" as you call them, are the preferred choice of criminals, and yet not one of these \"Saturday Night Specials\" is capable of holding more than 7 rounds of ammunition in their magazine.\n \n People like you continually talk about gun violence, but your answer to the question always involves more laws that only affect the law-abiding. This suggests that you're either too stupid to live, or you have an absolute distrust of anyone who isn't a government working dog. Which is it that you fit into, stupid or paranoid?\n \n Why does the slippery slope argument prevail? Because to you anti-gunners nothing is ever good enough! There are more than enough laws regulating every possible facet of gun ownership and possession and punish anybody for committing a criminal act, and to you that's just not good enough!",

For example, many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places. Inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws.\" And here comes tada one of the slippery slopes. \"But if one considers only laws that control the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns-the cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun-control laws-the number of local laws will be much smaller. With most gun laws containing numerous, interrelated subparts, there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law.\" And yet another. \"In short, no matter how the 20,000- gun-law figure was initially derived, the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total. Even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20,000.\" Yea right! \"In our view, the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun-control statute (with some states having as few as one or two such laws) yields a far more appropriate figure for public-policy discussion.\" In other words we don't really have a clue here but we'll call it short so we win.

   "Since that would be me let's go over my position and you tell me which parts aren't reasonable and why:\n\n \n Time to get a helmet...\n \n \n1. I've advocated registration of all handguns but not all guns.\n \n \n Where to start with this proposal? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city, and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time, creating a de facto ban.\n \n Then there's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register, and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year, and the fee paid every time as well.\n \n Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the \"only registered guns are legal guns\" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.\n \n And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth. Not long after the New York spree killing, the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated.\n \n And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.\n \n Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!\n \n \n2. I've advocated mandatory secure storage for unattended firearms, like when you're not home.\n\n \n Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense, by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it. I don't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you're not at home, that's not good enough; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you're there.\n \n Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.\n \n There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety. Who should law enforcement be targeting more, a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia, or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store?\n \n Police resources are limited as is. I don't see why we should be squandering what resources we have, going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone.\n \n \n3.

We know that criminals won't submit to registration, they're not permitted to own or possess guns under any circumstances, etc. To me this seems more about the regulation of a constitutional right and the harassment of honest gun owners than anything else.",

   "Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated.\n\n \n How can you throw that statement out and still look at yourself in the mirror? It's a lie and you know it! Look at any country of the world and you'll see.\n \n \nIf you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.\n\n \n Well there's Great Britain, it used to have a constitutionally protected right to bear arms, but then it went away. And after the Dunblane Massacre of 1997 so did handgun ownership. A simple Yahoo! search will supply you with that information.\n \n However let's look closer to home. Here are some example of registered guns being confiscated in your home state of California.\n \n Gun confiscation in California\n \n First the gun was perfectly legal to own, no problem. Then the gun was only legal to own if you registered it. Then the gun was classified as illegal and confiscated from everyone foolish enough to believe the \"Oh no we're not gonna take your guns away from you, we'd never confiscate your registered firearms\" lie.\n \n \nSafe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea.\n\n \n Then what would be reason enough? Maybe a few dozen home owners being killed by intruders, their bloody fingerprints on the government sanctioned safes where their tools of defense were bound?\n \n You have no way of enforcing the law, meaning that you have no way of punishing those who break it. What's the point of such a law, just showing people who's in charge?\n \n \nThefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?\n\n \n I can't speak for anyone else, but I'd rather not need to report a theft of one of my firearms, because being the victim of a crime isn't something I want to go through.\n \n We've already covered this, multiple times. We're perfectly willing to report the loss of a gun, especially since a police report is necessary to recoup your losses through the insurance money. But we don't want to be told to do what we're going to do anyway like we're 3 year old children.\n \n The message sent by all of these laws that dictate this action and that action and everything else, suggests that those in office feel that citizens either aren't trustworthy, or they're too incompetent to walk and breathe at the same time without being told the mechanics of the process and walked through them.\n \n \nWhat identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?\n\n \n On the form itself, or for the check?\n \n On the form you have to put down your name, age, address, city, state, country, county of residence, county of birth, gender, height, weight, race, and answer multiple questions regarding citizenship, history of substance abuse or legal matters, etc.",

   "Time to get a helmet...\n \n \n \n Where to start with this proposal? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city, and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time, creating a de facto ban.\n\n So? A city could just as easily ban all future sales of firearms to citizens without gun registration. \n \n \n\n Then there's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register, and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year, and the fee paid every time as well.\n \n Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the \"only registered guns are legal guns\" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.\n \n And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth. Not long after the New York spree killing, the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated.\n\n In that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns. The logic of your argument seems questionable. It would be like arguing- \"It's the outright truth that property taxes lead to confiscation because if you don't pay them the government can take your property.\" Would anybody seriously think that that is a good argument against property taxes? \n \n \n\n And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.\n \n Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!\n\n While it's true that criminals won't be lining up to register guns that they already own, gun registration could make it harder for them to obtain more guns in the future. Registration could require law abiding citizens to be more careful about who they sell their guns to as well as making it easier to trace back a lost or stolen gun to the original owner. \n \n \n \n\n Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense, by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it. I don't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you're not at home, that's not good enough; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you're there.\n \n Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.\n\n So does requiring everyone to go through a security check before boarding a plane suggest that nobody is capable of being trusted?\n \n \n\n There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety. Who should law enforcement be targeting more, a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia, or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store?\n \n Police resources are limited as is. I don't see why we should be squandering what resources we have, going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone.\n \n \n \n Sex offenders who rape and kill children are required to be photographed and fingerprinted. Why are you in favor of people exercising a constitutional right, being treated in the exact same way?\n \n I can't see any type of measurable affect photographing and fingerprinting gun owners would have on fighting crime.

   "From your source which indeed does have its own slippery slope built in. \"Another problem with estimating the number of gun laws is agreeing on a definition of just what is to be included. For example, many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places. Inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws.\" And here comes tada one of the slippery slopes. \"But if one considers only laws that control the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns-the cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun-control laws-the number of local laws will be much smaller. With most gun laws containing numerous, interrelated subparts, there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law.\" And yet another. \"In short, no matter how the 20,000- gun-law figure was initially derived, the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total. Even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20,000.\" Yea right! \"In our view, the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun-control statute (with some states having as few as one or two such laws) yields a far more appropriate figure for public-policy discussion.\" In other words we don't really have a clue here but we'll call it short so we win. Nice try though.\n\n I don't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws. The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful. But the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot. 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods. That would count as 100 gun laws. Or the Federal Government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation. It would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws.",

   "This post was a joy to read. Some of the best stuff so far! Well done my friend.\n \n \nHowever let's look closer to home.

The Ninth Circuit Court recently ruled that anyone can challenge a gun law on the basis that it violates the Second Amendment of the Constitution. A ban on the purchasing of new firearms would never pass constitutional muster, any such law would be immediately overturned.\n \n \nIn that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns. The logic of your argument seems questionable.

You're the one who can't seem to grasp basic logic. New York law dictates that for a gun to be legal it has to be registered, and if the registration was made temporary the owner would be required to continually opt to have their gun made legal again and again and again and again...\n \n Call me crazy, but once something is made legal, I don't think that you should have to continually renew its legality. I don't care if driver's licenses expire, that's beyond the point of this topic of debate. Remember, your car is nothing more than a privilege, your gun is a constitutionally protected right, and that's the long and short of it.\n \n \nWhile it's true that criminals won't be lining up to register guns that they already own,\n\n \n So you admit that your proposal is useless. You should be proud of yourself, the first step in recovery is admitting that you have a problem.\n \n \ngun registration could make it harder for them to obtain more guns in the future.\n\n \n Or...it could just inspire criminals to follow people home from the gun stores and rob them then. Or they might become more bolstered to break into the stores and steal entire inventories. Or they might just import weapons like the mexican drug cartels are doing.\n \n \nRegistration could require law abiding citizens to be more careful about who they sell their guns to as well as making it easier to trace back a lost or stolen gun to the original owner.\n\n \n In theory yes, but in actual practice no. Once a serial number of removed the gun is no longer in the system, it's untraceable, it's a ghost, it no longer exists. Registration is easy to defeat and is commonly done so.\n \n And besides, tracing a gun is easy enough as is without any other money pit databases being enacted.\n \n \nSo does requiring everyone to go through a security check before boarding a plane suggest that nobody is capable of being trusted?\n\n \n Stop trying to change the subject with your insane comparisons. Travel might be a right, but travel in a specific manner isn't.\n \n \nGovernment employees are also expected to be fingerprinted but I don't think any reasonable person would think that is treating them like criminals.\n\n \n Government employment isn't a right, it's a privilege.

Don't you dare try and tell us it can't happen here, we know better.\n \n \nIt's clear to me that those on the pro-gun side are uncomfortable with some of the gun laws proposed by gun control advocates.\n\n \n Because nothing you propose is crime fighting in nature, it amounts to nothing except harassment, and anyone with a brain and the ability to think understands that.\n \n \nHowever, because of the reasons mentioned above it is highly unlikely that such proposed gun laws would lead to situation in which \"everything is banned\" as you say.\n\n \n Tell that to the people who survived Katrina, when the police chief publicly announced \"Nobody will be allowed to be armed, we're going to take ALL of the guns! A state constitution to be armed, a federal constitution to be armed, and it didn't do an ounce of good when the government decided to stop obeying the rules laid out to them.",

   "I think that some relevant differences are being ignored here-\n The US Supreme Court stands in the way of this becoming a reality. \n The gun culture in the US is much stronger than in Great Britain. Opposition to a proposed gun ban would be much greater. It's not hard to understand that there wasn't much opposition in the UK to the handgun ban since less than 1% of the population prior to the gun ban actually owned handguns. The gun lobby's influence in government is much stronger than in the US. \n \n It's clear to me that those on the pro-gun side are uncomfortable with some of the gun laws proposed by gun control advocates. However, because of the reasons mentioned above it is highly unlikely that such proposed gun laws would lead to situation in which \"everything is banned\" as you say.\n\n \n Yes, but if less than 1% of the population owned them what was the purpose of banning them? I'm not going to p foot around it, the UK has a very centralized type of government. The people there trust their government a heck of a lot more than we do here and the reasons are because they value different things than we do here. The funny thing is, they have this consensus that they do not even need a written constitution! Like I said, if nothing stands in the way, they will ban everything. Like in the UK nothing was standing in the way so therefore it was much easier. Still they continue to tighten controls, even though they do not have to.",

   "Hey Sinjin what about all of this?\n \n\n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n The CDC gave a weak apology seeming to contradict everything their findings said, and they did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. \n \n Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n They also gave a apology for failing to find a link between con control as crime control and violent outcomes, and also said more study was needed, but 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n\n \n Is the Anti-gun CDC's word good enough for you? The CDC also studied Firearm registration and licensing of owners and Child access prevention laws. The Licensing part should also take care of your photo ID requirement too.\n \n However I'll bet you have even some kind of criticism of why even the CDC's requirements are not enough to deter what you want. Why do I think that? Because NOTHING and I mean absolutely nothing but the 2nd Coming of Jesus himself will get you off of your favorite subject of all of the Gun Control you still want to inflict on the 2nd Amendment!\n \n Am I right?",

   "I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision. In that decision, the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years. I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as \"[i]t is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America\" which have little basis in fact:\n \n \"The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom..... But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number.... Since the early 1980s, the National Rifle Association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption' laws, forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws. Today, more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun-control laws, which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws....Clearly the 20,000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science. And however it was initially derived, the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total. The most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws?' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws, and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws.' \"\n http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf\n \n So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality, a decline in the number of gun laws, and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns? Could it be that pro-gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms?\n\n So Galileo. I shared your post and link with the Author of gunlaws.com / Bloomfield Press Alan Korwin, and he said I could share this, and any reply he gets with you guys.\n \n To Jon S. Vernick; Lisa M. Hepburn\n A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts.\n http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf\n Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect.\n California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law, twice what the federal government has passed.\n \n We publish the gun laws for several states, and distribute books on the subject for 24 states. Our definition for a gun law, while slightly different than yours, is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books.\n \n If it affects private ownership, possession or use of firearms, it is included. A huge list of laws that are not included, which would raise the counts dramatically, is printed in the front of each of our books (e.g., regs for police, criminals, military, Native Americans, federal officials, etc.; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents).\n \n Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because, for example, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects. The Brady law, for example, with its 3,000 words, controls airline baggage, point-of-sale purchases, development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more. Counting it as \"one law\" would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists.\n \n For specifics, I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes; Texas had 226; Arizona 183; Florida 229; and Virginia, in out just released 7th edition, has 193.

   "Let me give you my view of why many of us on the gun rights side of the debate are wary of those \"on the other side of the hill.\" I can start easily with a few pre-Heller quotes:\n \n \"Newt Gingrich and the Republican leadership are working hand in hand with the NRA and the gun lobby to use this committee to stage yet another pep rally for guns and gun nuts. But the intellectual content of this hearing is so far off the edge that we ought to declare this an official meeting of the flat earth society. Because the pro-gun arguments we will hear today are as flaky as the arguments of the tiny few who still insist that the earth is flat. Like flat earth fanatics, Second Amendment fanatics just don't get it....\" Statement of Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), April 5, 1995 (Speaking against the argument that the 2nd. Amendment protects an individual right)\n \n This, I believe, is the origin of the phrase \"gun nut.\" I have found it often used by gun ban supporters as a \"pay no attention to that man behind the curtain\" style response to an argument of mine they cannot deal with otherwise. I find it amusing when someone chooses to pretend that I am mentally unstable because I put together an argument which their logic cannot overcome. An example would be the blogger who calls himself \"Brady\" here-and regarding him I find that I cannot have an honest discussion with a person who cannot first be honest with himself. And then there are the intolerant declarations of socialites and wanna be politicians aimed at me: \n \n \"I honestly think - and I am not an expert on the amendments - I think the only people in this nation who should be allowed to own guns are police officers. I don't care if you want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I say 'sorry'. It is 1999, we have had enough as a nation. You are not allowed to own a gun and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison.\" Rosie O'Donnell, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, April 21, 1999.\n \n \"Pick a night and cordon off a section of South Dallas. Send hundreds of police officers--however many it would take-into the area to 'vacuum it up.' Shake down everybody on the street. Search every house and apartment. Confiscate all drugs and weapons.\" Ross Perot, The Washington Post, June 6, 1992.\n \n And so I have found myself also branded a criminal, a person who is so deserving of prison that I must also forfeit my right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure (or would the more accurate statement be that any invasion of my privacy is constitutionally reasonable if the goal is to take guns from me?). \n \n Now let me pose this mental picture. I have walked (on opposite sides) a long road with two gun control organizations, the Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center. We are now standing at the top of a hill trying to figure out whether it will become a \"slippery slope.\" They tell me no, we only want reasonable gun control laws and not bans. But regarding the BC, I remember the origins and goals of the organization which used to call itself Handgun Control, Inc.: \n \n \"We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal.\" Nelson T. Shields, founder of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and former Chairman of Handgun Control, Inc, in The New Yorker magazine, July 26, 1976, at Page 53f. \n \n And I also remember what I have seen from the VPC:\n \n \"We recoil in horror and search for explanations, but we never face up to the obvious preventive measure: a ban on the handy killing machines that make crimes so easy....Most gun-control groups -- and politicians who take up their cause -- are too timid to champion a forthright handgun ban like those in Britain and Japan.... A gun-control movement worthy of the name would insist that President Clinton move beyond his proposals for controls -- such as expanding background checks at gun shows and stopping the import of high-capacity magazines -- and immediately call on Congress to pass far-reaching industry regulation like the Firearms Safety and Consumer Protection Act introduced by Sen. Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, and Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island. Their measure would give the Treasury Department health and safety authority over the gun industry, and any rational regulator with that authority would ban handguns.\" Josh Sugarmann, Executive Director of the Violence Policy Center, New York Times Editorial 11/4/99.\n \n Now there are other quotes out there. I merely choose these as examples. My history of watching the actions of these two organizations reveals this to me: Neither organization has ever seen a gun control bill it did not like-or one which it considers goes \"too far.\" Each organization wishes to re-institute an expired ban which they have acknowledged was a failure. In essence, having a ban is so important that they tell us we need one just for the sake of having one.\n \n In response to my prior protests about their agendas, each organization has long declared that I have no standing to object to their mission-that I have no RKBA-that I possess firearms only at their discretion, and that nothing prohibits them from taking my firearms from me if they could pass such a law. As one of their legislative supporters has said: \n \n \"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done that. I could not do that, the votes weren't there.\" Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) 60 Minutes 2/5/1995 (speaking on her desire to ban all \"assault\" weapons). \n \n This is what they have told me of their political agenda.\n \n And I have seen this agenda drive their actions in our courts. Each organization has fought against my RKBA for years in that arena. I have seen them cultivate a \"means justifies the end\" mentality, where history and even the rules of English grammar must yield to their agenda. I have read their pleadings in our courts. They have deliberately ignored the clear history of the RKBA. They ignored the words of our founders. They have attempted to reword the amendment against its plain meaning. They have pretended that the phrase \"the right of the people\" recognizes and protects an individual right to assemble and petition government for a redress of grievances in the 1st. Amendment, yet somehow becomes re-interpreted into a \"states\" right in the 2nd. Amendment, only to return back to protecting an individual right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure in the 4th. Amendment. Each organization previously refused to recognize the legitimacy of an individual right opinion in the 5th. Circuit case of U.S. v. Emmerson. The Brady Campaign in particular called it \"the renegade decision.\" \n \n And I am asked to trust these organizations now that Parker has been decided. Can the slippery slope still exist after Parker? I believe so. Let me explain by way of an analogy between Parker and the landmark SCOTUS case of Miranda v. Arizona. That one case did not settle the issue of the how the 5th. Amendment governs custodial interrogation. It took us years and several more cases to fully answer questions like: what constitutes \"custody\", what is \"interrogation\", when do the rights have to be read, what constitutes an assertion of the Miranda rights, can you make a partial assertion of the rights, how to handle re-initiation by the suspect after he first asserts the right to remain silent, etc. Like Miranda, Parker v. DC was a great victory, but the law remains very unsettled. Will the individual right be incorporated against the states? (only the 9th. Circuit CoA says so at present) What is the full scope of the right? What test will be used when government passes a law which infringes upon the right-strict scrutiny-rational relation-etc.? These are questions for which I and the VPC and the BC have very different answers. \n \n And so I now ask myself: Will these two organizations at least agree to honor the individual RKBA as defined in Parker? The VPC's answer is:\n \n \"Today's opinion turns legal logic and common sense on its head. As measured in gun death and injury, handguns are our nation's most lethal category of firearm: accounting for the vast majority of the 30,000 Americans who die from guns each year. Handguns are our nation's leading murder and suicide tool. Yet the majority opinion offers the greatest offender the strongest legal protection. It's analogous to the Court carving out special constitutional protection for child pornography in a First Amendment case. In its ruling, the Court has ignored our nation's history of mass shootings, assassinations, and unparalleled gun violence. It has instead accepted an abstract academic argument with dangerous real-world results for residents of the District of Columbia.\" VPC - Press Release - (06/26/2008) - Statement of Violence Policy Center on Supreme Court Ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller Overturning DC Handgun Ban\n \n And this is the crux of the matter. The roots of anti-gun \"we must ban them\" thought run deep. The goal of banning guns has not been abandoned. I recognize that the people who run these organizations truly believe they are doing the right thing. The desire-the passion-which animates them towards such goals, and the mindset which refuses to recognize that I have an individual RKBA has not wavered. That they now grudgingly admit I have an individual right is not because history, common sense, or the concept of individual liberty dictates it, but only because SCOTUS forces them to do so over their long held objections. For these organizations, the Parker decision does not represent the rule of law. In this sense their view of Parker is very similar to how a pro-lifer views Roe v. Wade-not as a landmark case establishing a right, but as an illegitimate obstacle to their agenda-a rock in the stream they cannot move and so must now flow around and try to erode from behind. I see the future goal of these organizations to be an attempt to limit the impact of the Parker ruling as much as possible. For them the road map to the post-Parker world is not outlined by what they think is legally right. It is instead a search for what they can legally get away with despite Parker. And so the fight goes on: \n \n \"Our fight to enact sensible gun laws will be undiminished by the Supreme Court's decision in the Heller case. While we disagree with the Supreme Court's ruling, which strips the citizens of the District of Columbia of a law they strongly support, the decision clearly suggests that other gun laws are entirely consistent with the Constitution.\" Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n \n I have always enjoyed honest debate. And in this sense I want to recognize Galileo and Sinjin as two individuals who have given me one. When we disagree we do so without animosity, and when we agree we have been able to admit that fact. So if Sinjin and Galileo tell me they are prepared to accept my individual RKBA, that they accept the Parker decision and do not want to undermine it, and that they want to walk with me and talk about gun control, then I say let's go. \n \n But neither of you, to my knowledge, controls the agenda of the BC and the VPC-nor do you have the ear of the legislators I have mentioned like they do. When I view the \"slippery slope\" analogy, I do not see myself standing at the top of the hill with the two of you-I see the VPC and the BC. And if they also promise me they are prepared to accept my individual RKBA, that they will accept the Parker decision and not try to undermine it, then I have to introduce myself as \"my name's Bryan and I'm from Missouri.\" \"Trust, but verify\" is the only way I will deal with the BC or the VPC. People will not always believe what you say, but they will always believe what you do-and the best predictor of the future behavior of the BC and the VPC is how they have acted in the past. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) Justice Brandeis, dissenting.",

   " \n You do know that Galileo has put forth the tired Anti-gun line that we never had any Right at all under the 2nd Amendment. The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.\n\n That's not really my argument at all. To really understand what the Second Amendment means you have to understand what was meant by an infringement at the time. George Mason in the Virginia ratifying convention said, \n \n \"Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\"\n \n Gun owners of our day want to be left alone by the federal government. In contrast, gun owners of the early period of America feared being left alone or neglected by the federal government. The failure of the federal government to be proactive in making sure the people were well armed and militarily prepared constituted an infringement of the right to early Americans. We see this again when the First Congress debated whether or not to recognize a power of the federal government to exempt conscientious objectors from bearing arms. They feared that the federal government would declare most of the militia to be conscientious objectors and thus it would give them an excuse to neglect the militia and thus the right would be infringed. As it is now, both sides have allowed the right to be greatly infringed and the Supreme Court has jumped on the infringement bandwagon. I'll know the Second Amendment isn't being infringed when people like me are required to own machine guns and get military training. Since nobody else seems to be serious about following the Second Amendment, I don't think I need to be concerned if certain gun laws are in violation of the Second Amendment.",

It concerns the blogging environment and what it attracts. I was once on another blog site confronting a Bellesiles apologist who ranted and raved at Bellesiles' critics-and whose criticism often parted company with reality. Then came the day when the administrator of the site decided to require everyone who wanted to continue to blog to do so under their real name and to provide a valid e-mail address for verification. When the change occurred the ranting apologist blanched and fell silent-never to be heard from again. But until that time he inflicted himself upon every other blogger. \n \n Now I am not criticizing this site for allowing people to post things anonymously under pseudonyms. Some people just don't want to be identified when they post, and that's fine by me. Bryan is my real name but even I shrink at giving out too much personal info to people I don't know and have never met. Yet the blanket of anonymity gives courage to people like \"Brady\" to blog bomb lies and say all manner of things he would (or at least should) be embarrassed to have attached to his real name. In short, the offer of anonymity draws all sorts of people, and consequently I have wasted many conversations over the years arguing with anonymous gun control proponents who have ultimately shown themselves to be blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence-people who are quick to take offense at the first hint of disagreement and who fail to understand that personal attacks are really admissions of defeat. I do not suffer such fools gladly. Within this anonymous environment people like Sinjin and Galileo are the exception rather than the rule. I can talk and disagree with them without the acrimony. \n \n I am well acquainted with Galileo's arguments regarding the 2nd. A. He and I had a discussion of this topic in which we shared our views and disagreements. His Jedi mind trick failed to convince me then, and I still feel some immunity to both of their powers of persuasion when we disagree. Alas, my powers against both of them appear also as weak-but I still don't mind talking to them in the hope that one day I will be able to change their minds on some disagreement and then truly declare that \"I have grown strong, Obi-Wan.\" \n \n Now I'm going away for a few days.

   "I'm not familiar with the NY situation. I think NATO brought it up before. Something about re-registrationn every so many years or else?\n\n \n Yes. Once you register your gun in New York, you'd have to continually renewing the registration, otherwise they take it away from you, IE confiscation.\n \n \nIn CA it was one type of weapon with one specific feature.\n\n \n Irrelevant, the specific feature in question can easily be removed and discarded with five minutes of work, returning the gun to a stock configuration. California banned them all anyway.\n \n [QUOTE]In CA people stll have plenty of firearms. No general confiscation of firearms. No confiscation of \"registered\" handguns as has been predicted./QUOTE] \n \n YET! Although San Francisco sure tried with it's Proposition H bill that would ban possession of all handguns within city limits, forcing all residents to get rid of their handguns or face criminal prosecutions. That bill actually passed and became law.\n \n And then there are the cases involving California's \"Safe Handgun List\" which specifies which handguns a Californian may own, so long as the company pays exploitation fees for their model to be listed. Once they stop paying the model is removed from the list of safe and approved models, meaning it's ownership is now illegal and those who have it have to turn it into the police.\n \n \nWe already discussed the illegal actions of the New Orleans police chief. Registration had no part in the round up of firearms post-Katrina as far as I can find.\n\n \n It doesn't matter if registration played no part, the example serves as evidence that if they're given the chance, the government will forcefully disarm you regardless of what the law says.\n \n \nI like the idea of getting the insurance industry to do the heavy lifting with regards to safe storage. \n You may be onto something there.\n\n \n I don't. There's nothing stopping them from charging unreasonable rates.\n \n \nWith respect to the 4473, which btw I don't remember discussing specifically in the past, it appears a phoney driver's license and a willingness to lie would pretty much be all that would be necessary to get around the background check. Fingerprinting could make the system harder to beat.\n\n \n Then how would mandatory registration work any better?",

The California Department of Justice charges firearms manufacturers, importers, and dealers annual fees, ostensibly to operate the handgun roster program. California Penal Code \u00a7 12131(a)(1). \"Any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person\n that is manufactured by a manufacturer who manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state for sale, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person in this state, and who fails to pay any fee\n required pursuant to paragraph (1), may be excluded from the roster.\" California Penal Code \u00a7 12131(a)(2).\n \n 21.

Code of Regulations \u00a7 4059(c).\n \n 23. A handgun can remain on the roster if its manufacturer/importer goes out of business or discontinues the model, provided that the model is not being offered for sale to licensed dealers, and \"a fully licensed wholesaler, distributor, or dealer submits a written request to continue the listing and agrees to pay the annual maintenance fee.\" 11 Calif. Code of Regulations \u00a7 4070(d). So long as a handgun is sold to dealers outside of California, the\n handgun's manufacturer can cause the sale of that handgun to be forbidden inside California by failing to submit the gun for testing in that state or refusing to pay the annual $200 fee.\n \n 24. \"A manufacturer/importer or other responsible party may submit a written request to list a handgun model that was voluntarily discontinued or was removed for lack of payment of the annual maintenance fee.\" 11 Calif. Code of Regulations \u00a7 4070(e). The request may be approved, and the handgun restored to the \"safe gun\" roster, provided the fee is paid.\n \n 25.

To me it sounds more like the courts were using bias against gun ownership to determine their ruling.\n \n \nSounds ridiculous.\n\n \n My mistake. That was a case in DC where a woman was told she couldn't register her handgun, because it wasn't on California's safe handgun roster.\n \n http://www.hoffmang.com/firearms/dc-roster/Hanson-v-DC-Complaint-2009-03-09.pdf\n \n 45. Defendants denied plaintiff Tracey Ambeau Hanson's application to register a Springfield Armory XD-45 Tactical 5\" Bi-Tone stainless steel/black handgun in .45 ACP, model number XD9623, as that handgun is not on the California Safe Handgun Roster as adopted by the District of Columbia.\n \n 46. Other models of this identical gun - but in different colors - are listed on the approved handgun roster and are thus available to Ms. Hanson: the XD-45 Tactical 5\" .45 ACP in black (model XD9621), the XD-45 Tactical 5\" .45 ACP in OD Green (model XD9622), and the XD-45 Tactical 5\" .45 ACP in Dark Earth (XD9162).\n \n 47. So long as Springfield Armory, the manufacturer of the XD-45, renews these handguns' California registrations, they will remain available for registration under District of Columbia law.\n \n \nEven law enforcement probably has no idea how many times the system has been beaten. How could anyone?\n\n \n How could law enforcement not know? Somebody in the field has to be keeping track of this information.\n \n \nIf these are legitimate denials, what's the problem?\n\n \n Well if they're legitimate denials then we know that the NICS system is working. The only thing I call into question is just how many of these denied buyers should've been locked up at the time? How many of them were convicted felons trying to bypass the system with fake IDs?\n \n \nBut what if it could be made to do more? Like finding out if you still have the weapon a year later?\n\n \n Another what if hypothetical proposal?\n \n I think that's what the database of reportedly stolen firearms is for.\n \n \nRegistration data will never solve the robbery since the gun was not registered to the robbers. The best we can hope for is to uncover who is supposed to be in possession of that gun and punish that person if they transferred it illegally. That's what I would like to see.\n\n \n I've seen proposals like these, I don't like them. There aren't enough safeguards to protect those that were the victims of crime. The treatment for everyone is a one size fits all approach that makes no exceptions. It's painting everybody with the same brush stroke, something that I thought you were against.",

   "We don't know the ATF traced the weapons back to the retail transactions. They may have only been able to track the weapons back to the dealers since serial numbers are recorded when manufacturers sell to dealers. Correct?\n\n \n This is the explanation I was given when I inquired how the tracing process was carried out:\n \n When police acquire a gun at the crime scene the phone the serial number into the ATF. The ATF looks up the number, finds out the manufacturer, and contacts them to ask which FFL the gun was sold to. The manufacturer tells them who the gun was shipped to, the dealer is contacted, and the dealer informs the ATF or the police of who the gun was sold to and when.\n \n Even if you're correct and the ATF couldn't trace the guns back to the retail transactions, either because they were stolen or resold at a later date, it's likely irrelevant if the drug cartel members were buying the guns themselves with fake IDs. Even if they were using straw purchasers, these middle men could just claim that they were jumped by masked men and robbed at gun point.",

   "Having slept on this I think you've convinced me that we have an example of registration being one step in what ultimately was a case of confiscation. I'm not sure we have established that registration necessarily leads to confiscation since we have other registered CA weapons that have not been confiscated. Can we agree that in light of Heller, the likelihood of such a ban on say handguns, and their subsequent confiscation, is unlikely; unConstitutional? The only thing that remains is whether the CA confiscation was in fact Constitutional. Has there been a challenge? \n \n You claimed the system catches most who are trying to beat the system. How can we know that? I'm not saying NCIS broken, only relatively easily defeated. And I apologize for the crack. It was unnecessary. \n \n I am fully prepared to pay my share for a comprehensive system. I shouldn't have to pay yours.\n\n \n Well given the historical precedent all over the world and here it makes one uneasy to say the least. Whether or not it is defined by the supreme court is a dicey matter. It took 30 some years to get the DC ban heard. Why take a chance on losing some thing. Registration does not prevent any crimes. If it did this would be all over the media. Neither does it solve any crimes. Canada has had pistol registration since 1934 and no prevention nor solves. What other excuse is there for registration? Given the vehemence of the Brady bunch and the VPC and others, the very real danger exists that a handgun ban is a real goal. Yes there was a challenge that went to the CA supreme court. The US supreme court declined to hear the case. \n \n So are most firearm laws. Full auto firearms are relatively cheap in the UK from browsing some of the news articles. We have some thing that works if enforced that both sides can live with. \n \n The reason I asked that question was to see if you were in fact willing to step up rather than saddle firearms owners with the burden.\n \n Apology accepted.",

I don't think it is \"easy\" because it takes a criminal act which is further proof that laws do not concern criminals. One could say that crime is easy and bewilder a lot of folks simply because they do not have that tendency. That is a crime problem and not a gun problem. Why just consider the theft of your car to use in criminal activities and the amount of explosives sitting in that tank of fuel...from legal hands into illegal hands smuggling dope or worse.\n \n There are a lot of home invasions along the border, kidnapping, rapes many with no firearm involved.

   "I'm not interested in interfering with your self-defense.\n\n \n I'm afraid that statements made before in the past contradict this position. You've voiced your disapproval of people not storing their firearms in safes that make them inaccessible to persons that aren't the owner, and we know that such storage methods interfere with a person's ability to immediately defend themselves. There's simply no way to have mandatory safe storage, and still allow gun owners to have immediate access whenever they need it.\n \n \nWas not the notion \"reasonable\" gun control affirmed by SCOTUS as part of the Heller decision?\n\n \n Yes, the Supreme Court said that reasonable laws will be allowed to stand. However, and I can't stress this enough, the Supreme Court absolutely didn't set out the standards of just what qualifies as a \"reasonable\" law, nor did they review those on the books to determine which were reasonable and which weren't.\n \n Simply because supporters of gun control claim that a proposed law is \"reasonable\", \"well meaning\" or \"common sense\" doesn't make it so.\n \n \nThe same number of crimes with fewer being commited with firearms would still be an improvement IMO.\n\n \n Only if the resulting number of deaths dropped, otherwise you're gaining nothing.\n \n If there were 30,000 violent crimes committed every year, and 10,000 resulted in the victims dying, even if the number of people shot dropped considerably it wouldn't matter if the number of people bludgeoned and stabbed went up considerably.\n \n Machetes Becoming Weapon of Choice for Northern Virginia Gangs - wtop.com \n \n And then there's the fact that not every crime committed with a gun involves a shooting. That would mean that criminals could simply get their hands on toy guns, paint them to look real, and use them instead of the real thing so the number would still be high. Look at all of the United Kingdom, where their real gun bans weren't enough, they felt the need to severely curtail imitation guns as well.\n \n \nAnd no, I don't keep firearms. I don't think one needs to in order to have a stake in our gun policies.\n\n \n No, but one should be up to date on what the current legislation is and how it's relevant to the discussion.\n \n \nOther than my general support for the 2A I have no personal stake.\n\n \n I'm afraid I'm going to need to call you on this. What statements have you made before in the past that are in support of the Second Amendment? And which interpretation were you in support of at the time?\n \n \nUnless you count my kids and the chance of them getting shot by some dirtbag who easily came by a until-lately legal weapon. It has been my experience that many of these so-called fallacies have been anything but discredited, except in the minds of gun enthusiasts.\n\n \n Insufficient. While your concern for your children may give you reason to have a dog in the show about fighting crime, it's not grounds for you to support clearly unconstitutional laws that have no affect on criminals.\n \n I'm reminded of the Pittsburgh incident, with the mayor arguing that the killing of three police officers by a deranged lunatic is grounds enough to let the city violate state preemption laws and pass a \"lost or stolen guns\" measure even though they don't have the authority. However I fail to see how the murder of the police officers is related, because even though Poplawski was in illegal possession of a firearm, it wasn't stolen and thus the law would never have saved the three officers.\n \n You wanna play the concerned parent card? Then tell me how mandatory storage, mandatory registration, and mandatory reporting would do anything to prevent your kids from being killed by a criminal in possession of a stolen gun. Personally I don't see how it could happen, at best you'd only be getting justice after the fact, after your children are dead and buried.\n \n \nI am not arguing that registration prevents thefts.\n\n \n No, what you're arguing is still that victims of crime should be treated the same as arms dealers and gun smugglers who're making a profit by supplying illegal weapon to known criminals and terrorists, even if they had no way of knowing that they were victimized in the first place.\n \n You seem to want gun owners held to a very high standard of review. I would suggest that if that's so, then everybody should be held to the same exceedingly high standard. That way protest leaders could be charged if they fail to ensure that all assembled bodies are without a desire to riot and cause massive damage and destruction. Or perhaps parents can be charged with human trafficking if they choose not to have GPS chipped implanted into their children so they can monitor their whereabouts 24/7.\n \n \nIt does get a little tiring to be repeatedly cast as stupid, a liar, a communist, a coward, a traitor, etc., etc. So when you said I'm self-serving, with no understanding, I felt a bit attacked. Unreasonable?\n\n \n Then why, must I ask, do you continually ignore the facts we point out to you on a repeated basis, and make the same arguments that we shoot down over and over and over again? Why do you propose laws that are already on the books, or have been proven to have no crime fighting merit and removed from the books?\n \n \nI've decided I don't need a gun to protect myself and my family. I'm not troubled that you've decided otherwise.\n\n \n You weren't present for the Los Angeles Riots of 1992, when angry protesters were using molotov cocktails to burn down homes and stores, and the police weren't available to provide protection, were you?\n \n \nI'm troubled that so many firearms move undetected from legal hands to illegal. Aren't you?\n\n \n Well of course we are. But I recognize the fact that this is an unavoidable side effect of living in a country where rights are more honored than in other countries. You can't have a free exercise of rights without having those that'll take advantage of the situation, and unless you're in favor of suspending rights and taking away freedoms and liberties, there's really very little you can do about it. And even then it's still not going to be enough, so at the end of the day all you've done is take away the rights of those that weren't doing anything wrong, and the criminal element is giving you the finger because you've made their task easier.\n \n Look at Germany for example. After the latest school shooting their idea of stopping another from happening is raising the age of apprentice shooting to 18, mandating the all firearms must be locked up inside the home, empowering the police to make random searches of the home to ensure that the law is being complied with, and banning paintball because they say it \"simulates and promotes the killing of humans.\"",

The court's opinion, in hamstringing the efforts of state law enforcement agencies, could make it more likely that those crimes will happen by depriving authorities of a workable defense against them.\n In a 4-1 ruling Monday, the state's highest court ruled that those charged with having illicit firearms cannot be held without bail until a dangerousness hearing as a threat to society. This effectively brought to an end what had apparently been a successful strategy by Bristol County District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter to reduce gun violence within his region.\n \n The majority decision written by Francis X. Spina is couched in the same tortured language regularly used to defend all manner of gun \"rights.\" In arguing that possession of an unlicensed firearm poses no threat to society because \"it is the unlawful use of a firearm that involves a substantial risk that physical force against another may result,\" Justice Spina engaged in, as lone dissenter Justice Judith Cowin wrote, \"...a reiteration of the tired slogan that 'guns don't kill people, people do.' \" Noting that this popular catchphrase is a \"dangerous oversimplification,\" Justice Cowin went on to state what should have been obvious to her colleagues: \"The fact is that people kill people with guns, and in a substantial number of cases those guns are unlicensed.\"\n Since implementation of his strategy three years ago, Mr. Sutter's office asserts that shots fired reports have dropped by 25 percent in Taunton, 34 percent in Fall River and just under 40 percent in New Bedford, which would indicate it has had a beneficial impact. In telling the Boston Globe that the judicial majority is \"not as closely connected to the reality of urban, violent firearms crimes as I am,\" Mr. Sutter was politely suggesting that the judges in their ivory tower don't know the grim particulars of what they are ruling on.\n \n The three Bristol County communities cited above are small cities trying to combat violent, often drug-related crime &#8212; much like Pittsfield. Berkshire County District Attorney David Capeless, speaking in his capacity as president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, said that all of the state's DAs are confronted with a proliferation of illegal firearms and complimented Mr. Sutter \"for taking a preventive approach and not waiting until somebody shoots at somebody.\"\n \n Unfortunately, Justice Cowin's withering dissent aside, the SJC believes that law enforcement does have to wait until the shooting starts before taking action.

The risk of being a victim of crime has increased by one percentage point compared to 2005/06 but has fallen from 40 per cent at its peak in 1995 to 24 per cent according to BCS interviews in 2006/07, representing 5.5 million fewer victims.\n \n BCS violent crime remained stable between 2005/06 and 2006/07 and has fallen by 41 per cent since its peak in 1995, representing over half a million fewer victims. Police recorded crime showed that overall violence against the person fell by one per cent between 2005/06 and 2006/07, representing the first fall in eight years. Around half of BCS and police recorded violent crime incidents did not result in any actual injury to the victim.\n \n The number of police recorded offences involving firearms fell by thirteen per cent between 2005/06 and 2006/07.\n Vandalism is the only BCS crime category to show a statistically significant change compared with 2005/06, increasing by 10 per cent. However there was no change in the number of criminal damage offences recorded by the police and longer-term BCS trends show that vandalism has fallen by 11 per cent since 1995. \n\n http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=300677\n \n Here's a graph of crime trends in England:\n http://www.statistics.gov.uk/resources/graph1_tcm119-28050.jpg",

   "BBC NEWS | UK | Police miscount serious violence\n \n \nA number of police forces in England and Wales have been undercounting some of the most serious violent crimes, the government has admitted. \n \n It means figures for serious violent crimes rose by 22% compared to last year - rather than showing a fall as previous figures appeared to indicate. \n \n The mistake happened when some crimes classed as \"grievous bodily harm with intent\" were recorded as less serious. \n \n Figures say overall crime is down, and ministers say these can be trusted. \n \n The government says it does not know how long the undercounting has been going on - leading to concerns that figures on violent crime may have been wrong for up to a decade. \n \n A former Home Office crime consultant told the BBC the government had been \"hiding behind\" its changes in the crime counting rules. \n \n Professor Marian Fitzgerald, a criminologist at the University of Kent's Crime and Justice Centre, said the long-term trend of increasing violent crime was now \"catching up\" with the government. \n \n Let's be clear, this isn't crime that wasn't being recorded or wasn't being reported or wasn't being dealt with \n \n Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary \n \n The Conservatives said the new figures \"fatally undermined\" government claims that violent crime was in decline. \n \n Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said: \"They betray a government that is completely out of touch with what is going on, on our streets and in our communities.\"\n",

   "Crime in UK\n \n Even Dan Rather noticed England's problem long ago and observed their problems were much worse than ours.\n \n \nYet Americans still enjoy a substantially lower rate of violent crime than England, without the \"restraint on personal liberty\" English governments have seen as necessary. Rather than permit individuals more scope to defend themselves, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government plans to combat crime by extending those \"restraints on personal liberty\": removing the prohibition against double jeopardy so people can be tried twice for the same crime, making hearsay evidence admissible in court, and letting jurors know of a suspect's previous crimes.\n \n This is a cautionary tale. America's founders, like their English forebears, regarded personal security as first of the three primary rights of mankind. That was the main reason for including a right for individuals to be armed in the U.S. Constitution. Not everyone needs to avail himself or herself of that right. It is a dangerous right. But leaving personal protection to the police is also dangerous.\n \n The English government has effectively abolished the right of Englishmen, confirmed in their 1689 Bill of Rights, to \"have arms for their defence,\" insisting upon a monopoly of force it can succeed in imposing only on law-abiding citizens. It has come perilously close to depriving its people of the ability to protect themselves at all, and the result is a more, not less, dangerous society. Despite the English tendency to decry America's \"vigilante values,\" English policy makers would do well to consider a return to these crucial common law values, which stood them so well in the past.\n",

However, we are offered this caveat in a 2008 article. \n   How should we deal with gun crime?\n \n The publication of quarterly police recorded crime figures in January highlighted a general fall in crime, with a drop of some of 9% in overall recorded crime in the period concerned. While crime figures are notoriously unreliable, and should always be read with caution these seemed initially to be showing something positive.  Yet these statistics were blemished by a 4% rise in gun crime and a 21% rise in drug offences. \n\n However we need to also note this. \n   Are the courts too soft on young offenders? \n The number of under-18s in Britain committing violent offences jumped by more than a third between 2003 and 2006, according to The Sunday Telegraph&#8217;s statistics, based on reports from the Ministry of Justice. \n \n The figures also show that just over half of young offenders apprehended during this period were let off with a police caution, in which they admitted their offence but received no punishment, and that three-quarters of all violent crime suspects are freed on bail while awaiting crown court trials. \n\n So a lot of crimes are not recorded because of cautions. What kind of offenses deserve a caution? \n   Three Strikes and You're ... in Like Flint \nThe Home Office says offenses that may now be dealt with by a caution include burglary of a shop or office, threatening to kill, actual bodily harm, and possession of Class A drugs such as heroin or cocaine if police decide a caution would be the best approach.\n \n Other crimes including common assault, threatening behavior, sex with an underage girl or boy, and car theft should normally be dealt with by a caution, if the offenders admit their guilt but have no criminal record. \n\n \n   Government accused over deactivated gun ban \n The Home Secretary has been accused of \"papering over the cracks\" on gun crime by proposing a ban on old, deactivated firearms which only feature in a small number of offences.\n \n Mr Davis said: \"While we welcome any action, however overdue it may be, to tackle the scourge of gun crime the Government's own figures show that in 2005/06 there were only eight incidents where deactivated or reactivated weapons were used - just 0.04 per cent of gun offences. \n \n \"We need sustained action to tackle the other 99.6 per cent of this serious problem, bearing in mind that gun violence has increased four-fold over the last 10 years.\" \n\n Feb 6, 2007   Britain tops European crime league \n Britain has one of the worst crime rates in Europe, a report said yesterday. It is the most burgled country in Europe, has the highest level of assaults and above average rates of car theft, robbery and pickpocketing. Only Ireland has a worse record.\n \n Risks of being assaulted were highest in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark and lowest in Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Spain and France. \n\n So what does your graph actually mean?

When I've questioned gun activists about this before I usually get a very vague response. \n\n Our Inner city youth are socialized different than European countries, although that has changed some in recent years. The majority of murders in the US are committed by people who have previous criminal records, and pretty much the rest are most likely to be gang members. although Gang members can have no criminal records, and or could be considered career criminals. Some crimes of passion, but usually murderers have some involvement with the Criminal justice system. \n \n FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime - USATODAY.com\n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n However the Anti-gun CDC noted this, in reference to gun restrictions and violent outcomes in their exhaustive study. \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC gave a weak apology seeming to contradict everything their findings just said, \n (Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.)\n but they did suggest more studies. \n \n Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n They also gave a apology for failing to find a link between con control as crime control and violent outcomes, and also said more study was needed, but 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n So I say your theories about gun control being a fix for society's problems have been pretty much shot full of holes!

One cannot be one of the Western World's most violent places, and and have crime go up continually. That is just not possible. There must be an absolute worse case. \n \n Just as it is true that crime will never be zero. There is a bottom point too. And to the extent that the UK's crime problem has come down, after increasing for many years, has nothing to do with gun control! Here is one of the many articles explaining some of the crime drop. Good Police work, and good crime fighting practices.\n \n   Manchester: 'Streets safer after jailing of Gooch Gang members'\n Martin Wainwright reports from Moss Side, where shootings, murders and drug offences have plummeted after the jailing of members of the 'Gooch Gang'\n\n This is what we have been saying will work, all along. They Jailed the Violent Drug Gangs who are committing most of the problems, and a HUGE part of the Violent Crime. They also have police in boroughs out of cop cars, and walking beats making sure that doors and windows are locked. Even to the point of annoying the residents who feel their privacy is violated by cops walking into unlocked homes chastising them for having an unlocked door or window. . So they are working the correct system correctly and very hard.\n \n While the US has been concentrating on criminals, and it has accounted for a large crime drop, dropping crime near 40 year lows, Australia and England set out on the experiment of using gun control as crime control and both failed miserably. \n \n They learned their lessons! They have become smarter. They are now employing our methods! Canada too!",

   "What is it that keeps Galileo fluttering back to it like a moth to the flame? \n \n The BCS measures the amount of crime in England and Wales (the first survey covered Scotland as well, but now Scotland and Northern Ireland carry out their own crime surveys) by asking people about crimes they have experienced in the last year. The BCS includes crimes which are not reported to the police, so it is an important alternative to police records. The survey collects information about<b></b>:\n \n the victims of crime \n the circumstances in which incidents occur \n the behaviour of offenders in committing crimes \n \n The BCS currently interviews over 51,000 people aged 16 or over every year. This includes around 47,000 interviews in the main survey, with an additional boost to the number of interviews with 16- to 24-year-olds. The survey was also extended in January 2009 to include 4,000 interviews with children aged 10-15 each year.\n \n rds british crime survey\n \n So in other words it is an expanded Gallup poll. Since crime is either under reported or not reported to the government stats are worthless. Yet our star struck one says there are no caveats tied to this poll. \n \n So how is this poll/survey done?\n \n We cannot include everyone in the country in every survey as this would be too expensive and take too much of everyone's time, so we select a sample of a few thousand people to represent the country as a whole. For example, for our household surveys, addresses are chosen at random from the Post Office's list of addresses throughout the country. All our surveys use random sampling to make sure that all groups of people are properly represented and everyone has an equal chance of being able to help with our surveys. Once a person or household has been chosen we cannot substitute other people because we could not be sure that we were talking to a representative cross-section of society.\n Social Survey Division - Taking Part in a Survey\n \n In the words of the survey people it is random sampling. So there are no caveats in random sampling eh! \n \n Stripped of all its flim-flam, the British Crime Survey is about as informative - for one thing, no one under the age of 16 allowed to give evidence, so that loses a whole stratum of new-type knife victims - as a questionnaire on your favourite shampoo. \n Addresses of interviewees, we're told, are drawn at random from post office lists. \n \n Which means that if you live in a crime-free area, you're going to give crime-free replies. \n \n 'Now let me see, Audrey, when was it we got mugged for half a crown in Frinton-on-Sea? \n \n You remember \n The British Crime Survey?

   "  Ministry spin must stop, says watchdog \nNew laws are needed to stop the Government \"spinning\" official figures to its own advantage, a Whitehall watchdog said yesterday.\n \n The Statistics Commission said departments were risking accusations of abuse by using early access to data to present them favourably.\n\n \n   One in five Home Office statistics are unreliable, says department head \nSir David Normington, who had to apologise yesterday to the Commons public accounts committee for supplying inaccurate data on anti-social behaviour orders, said 30 of the 160 main sets of figures covering crime, immigration and prisons used by the Home Office were simply not up to the job.\n\n   \n Public lack confidence in justice system, poll shows -- Nearly 70 per cent of the public lack confidence in the justice system, an official poll revealed.\n The Tories accused the Government of failing to address \"real issues\" like sentencing and instead focusing on \"gimmicks and spin\". \n \n Dominic Grieve, the shadow justice secretary said: \"Is there any wonder 70 per cent of people lack confidence in the criminal justice system when ministers focus on gimmicks and spin rather than addressing real issues - like honesty in sentencing, properly enforced community penalties and building enough prison places.\" \n\n   Crime is running at '60m offences a year' \n The true level of crime is four times higher than official figures have previously shown with more than 60 million offences committed each year in Britain, according to a report published today.\n \n The report, compiled by the think-tank Civitas and based on Home Office research, much of which is unpublished, discloses, however, that the official total severely underestimates the real level of crime.\n \n \"Until members of the public do ask, the Government has every intention of pretending the crime figure is under control.\"\n \n Mr Green, whose report draws together all available Home Office research and statistics on crime for the first time, said that one flaw in the BCS was that it excludes all murders, drug offences and crimes against under-16s.\n\n What did the home Office say about this report? \nJon Simmons, the head of the Home Office crime statistics unit, has seen the figures used by Civitas and has confirmed that they are accurate, saying that he is \"content\" with the report's findings.\n\n \n   Row over figures as crime drops 5% \n Meanwhile, the figures recorded by the police showed a 1% rise in overall crime, with a 12% jump in violent crime.\n The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the BCS did not record \"various categories of violent crime\", including murder and rape, retail crime, drug-taking, or offences in which the victims were aged below 16. \n \n \"The most reliable measure of crime is that which is reported to the police,\" he added. \"We're facing over a million violent crimes a year for the first time in history.\"\n \n Crime statistics are enough of a political football as it is without this kind of manipulation by the home secretary.\"\n",

   "Award winning anti-gun English or perhaps Scottish Journalist Ian Bell came to fame after UK's Dunblane shooting, and all of his hard hitting articles were responsible for the gun bans in England. Here is an article that is 11 years after and he admits the obvious. \n \n   Dunblane made us all think about gun control &#8230; so what went wrong? By Ian Bell \n (English gun ban) The most troubling questions came, instead, from those who answered my simplicities with one of their own. They didn't oppose a ban, as such. They merely wanted to know why I was so sure that legislation would work.\n \n That seemed obvious. It even seemed faintly stupid to think otherwise. No guns, no gun-killings. Remove the threat: wasn't that one of the jobs of government?\n \n Sceptics were more subtle than I allowed. What they meant was that it is easy to impose laws on the law-abiding. Criminals, by definition, don't take much interest in well-meaning legislation. If they chose to arm themselves while the rest of society was, in effect, disarming, outraged newspaper commentators and their quick fixes might merely make matters worse.\n &#8230;..\n I read of three London teenagers murdered in the space of 11 days. I read of firearms \"incidents\" spreading like an epidemic across our cities. I read of Tony Blair holding a Downing Street summit on a crisis that seems - call me naive - a greater threat to many communities than any terrorism.\n \n What I say then becomes obvious: my idea didn't work. In fact, I begin to thread certain fears together, like links in a chain. Here's one: if even London teenagers can provide themselves with the means to kill 15-year-old Billy Cox in his bedroom, guns have become commonplace, so commonplace that every would-be terrorist worth his salt must be armed to the teeth. Bans have failed utterly. A weapons fetish escalates for a fairly obvious reason. Many things may have changed since my working-class youth, but I am certain that one piece of logic persists. If he is armed, you had better be armed too. Knives become swords, swords become pistols. \n\n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n &#8220;Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,&#8221; a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n So tell me. Is this the way Gun Control is supposed to work? Or do you think they had a different result in mind?",

   "The anti-gun researchers, Cook and Ludwig note in this Department of Justice report. \n   National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms. \n 4.7 Million Defensive Gun Uses! emoticon_smile\n\n Wow, you make a really big deal about caveats when others post but say nothing about the really major caveats contained in this study that you have \n introduced:\n \n \n\n Some troubling comparisons. If the DGU numbers are\n in the right ballpark, millions of attempted\n assaults, thefts, and break-ins were foiled by\n armed citizens during the 12-month period.\n According to these results, guns are used far more\n often to defend against crime than to perpetrate\n crime. (Firearms were used by perpetrators in 1.07\n million incidents of violent crime in 1994,\n according to NCVS data.) \n \n Thus, it is of considerable interest and importance\n to check the reasonableness of the NSPOF estimates\n before embracing them. Because respondents were\n asked to describe only their most recent defensive\n gun use, our comparisons are conservative, as they\n assume only one defensive gun use per defender. The\n results still suggest that DGU estimates are far\n too high.\n \n For example, in only a small fraction of rape and\n robbery attempts do victims use guns in\n self-defense. It does not make sense, then, that\n the NSPOF estimate of the number of rapes in which\n a woman defended herself with a gun was more than\n the total number of rapes estimated from NCVS\n (exhibit 8)....\n \n NSPOF estimates also suggest that 130,000 criminals\n are wounded or killed by civilian gun defenders.\n That number also appears completely out of line\n with other, more reliable statistics on the number\n of gunshot cases.[14]...\n \n Any estimate of the incidence of a rare event based\n on screening the general population is likely to\n have a positive bias. The reason can best be\n explained by use of an epidemiological\n framework.[15] Screening tests are always subject\n to error, whether the \"test\" is a medical\n examination for cancer or an interview question for\n DGUs. The errors are either \"false negatives\" or\n \"false positives.\" If the latter tend to outnumber\n the former, the population prevalence will be\n exaggerated.... \n \n Respondents might falsely provide a positive\n response to the DGU question for any of a number of\n reasons: \n \n o They may want to impress the interviewer by their\n heroism and hence exaggerate a trivial event. \n \n o They may be genuinely confused due to substance\n abuse, mental illness, or simply less-than-accurate\n memories. \n \n o They may actually have used a gun defensively\n within the last couple of years but falsely report\n it as occurring in the previous year--a phenomenon\n known as \"telescoping.\" \n \n Of course, it is easy to imagine the reasons why\n that rare respondent who actually did use a gun\n defensively within the time frame may have decided\n not to report it to the interviewer. But again, the\n arithmetic dictates that the false positives will\n likely predominate.\n \n In line with the theory that many DGU reports are\n exaggerated or falsified, we note that in some of\n these reports, the respondents' answers to the\n followup items are not consistent with respondents'\n reported DGUs. For example, of the 19 NSPOF\n respondents meeting the more restrictive Kleck and\n Gertz DGU criteria (exhibit 7), 6 indicated that\n the circumstance of the DGU was rape, robbery, or\n attack--but then responded \"no\" to a subsequent\n question: \"Did the perpetrator threaten, attack, or\n injure you?\"\n \n The key explanation for the difference between the\n 108,000 NCVS estimate for the annual number of DGUs\n and the several million from the surveys discussed\n earlier is that NCVS avoids the false-positive\n problem by limiting DGU questions to persons who\n first reported that they were crime victims. Most\n NCVS respondents never have a chance to answer the\n DGU question, falsely or otherwise.\n \n Unclear benefits and costs from gun uses. Even if\n one were clever enough to design a questionnaire\n that would weed out error, a problem in\n interpreting the result would remain. Should the\n number of DGUs serve as a measure of the public\n benefit of private gun possession, even in\n principle? When it comes to DGUs, is more better?\n That is doubtful, for two kinds of reasons: \n \n o First, people who draw their guns to defend\n themselves against perceived threats are not\n necessarily innocent victims; they may have started\n fights themselves or they may simply be mistaken\n about whether the other persons really intended to\n harm them. Survey interviewers must take the\n respondent's word for what happened and why; a\n competent police investigation of the same incident\n would interview all parties before reaching a\n conclusion.\n \n\n http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/165476.txt",

I had no family that could help so I had to move into a Cleveland Housing projects while I went back to college. While there I saw massive drug dealing, which also drew prostitution, and gambling. I saw street or parking lot gambling, public intoxication and public urination, and an occasional dead body, all from the drug dealing. However, I figured that the drug dealers weren&#8217;t bothering me so what did I care. After all, I was only going to be there for a very short time and it is a victimless crime right? \n \n Ah huh!\n \n Allow me to expel a few falsehoods. First of all, most every one of the drug dealers were NOT residence of the housing project, and neither were they the majority of their customers. Most all of the residents, although many were undereducated, were, in fact, good-hearted people who were, for the most part, good neighbors too.\n \n I was speaking to a neighbor, single mother of 2, and she was telling me that her children do not sleep on their beds at night. When I pressed her about this, she embarrassedly admitted that they sleep under their beds because of the almost nightly gunfire from the Drug dealers, and their patrons. Not residents. Most of the gun fire was from the drug dealers showing off, I am figuring, or testing out a gun being traded for crack. Any way, when I heard this, I lost my Natural mind. I thought to myself that in no way would I allow this to go on while I was on this Earth, while I could do something about it. I called the cops and was referred to the Housing police. They said they would do about as much as they can but their efforts were pretty ineffective. So I video taped all of the actors doing their crimes and took telephoto still pictures for positive identification and never told a sole that I was doing it because just before this, a church worker was murdered by the drug dealers because he inadvertently video taped a drug dealer while producing a video to try and spur donations. \n \n I mailed it to the Housing police and told my Senator, John Glenn about everything and his office got involved. They told the Housing authority, and the DEA, I think and contacted my Ohio State elected officials. There was an attempt to clean up the problem but it was not in any way what I thought the effort should be since the evidence I gathered had them dead to rights. They instead said they were going to concentrate their efforts on the Drug Buyers instead of the sellers. I thought, What? That isn&#8217;t going to solve anything, but I waited to see the results. Noting! Absolutely Nothing, but a show.\n \n It was not long after the show that the son of a neighbor came over and told me that Moody, the head of the drug dealers was going to kill me, because he somehow found out about the video tapes and the photos. I talked to the Cleveland Police and was again referred to the housing police, so I went down to their off ice and talked to the Captain, who informed me that I was, indeed, in a heap of danger. I asked him what I could do and he told me that if I did not own a gun to buy one and carry it. He explained that (Before Ohio&#8217;s CCW laws) there was a statute on the books called the prudent man defense. It seemed that the Ohio legislators in their wisdom, did not want to make any laws that violated common sense and put the law abiding in a trick bag for running afoul of a law that they could in no way obey. Hense, the Prudent Man Defense. \n \n To make a painfully long story short, I was once confronted by a drug dealer, and I produced my pistol. After that all of the Drug Dealers left me along, but was told that Moody was still planning to kill me. \n \n My friend from school knows a Cleveland Cop and told him about what was happening to me with a whole bunch of harassment and vandalism, and my friend was told by the cop, &#8220; Let the Black uneducated people kill each other! My friend explained that I was white and a Veteran and that I did not deserve to be left totally unprotected the way I was, and the cop again said, &#8220; I Said! Let the Negroes Kill each other.&#8221; Which was extremely typical of my experience there.\n \n At any rate, Moody was shortly arrested and convicted of murdering someone else and the Drug Dealers moved down as far away from me as they could. Before I left, only two people were ever arrested. Moody and another drug dealer, but no arrest were ever made even after all of the evidence I presented.\n \n So you can blow and go all you want to, but guns also save lives. And From what I later found out, I was just one of the 2.5 Million Defensive Gun uses every year. :)",

   "\"The Washington Post advises Maryland to pass a ban on \"assault-style\" weapons in the editorial \"A Roll Call on Weapons.\" The Post acknowledges a problem with truthfulness from a Violence Policy Center report which appears to have lied about the \"one-in-five\" number of police officers killed with such firearms. But the Post dismisses that deception by asking, \"What if the statistic were one in 20?\" That is a question worth exploring.\n \n Maryland is one of the most violent states with the highest rate of robbery for the past 8 years and high rates of murder and assaults. So, the weapons used to kill Maryland police officers should be of interest to Maryland legislators as they consider any ban.\n \n If we look at the Maryland police officers who have died during the period 1988 through 2003 from trauma received in felonious assaults, we have a total of 19 deaths. One was from stabbing, one from stabbing until incapacitation then the officer's handgun was used to finish him off, one assaulted with an automobile and 16 were straight shootings. Of wounds from these 16 shooting deaths 12 were from handguns, 3 from ordinary shotguns and one from a rifle. According to the Post 1 in 20 criteria, handguns should be banned, shotguns should be banned and rifles should be banned by Maryland.\n \n Here we have a moment of unintended truth from the Post. All guns should be banned from ownership by the people. The Post may claim that isn't their intent. If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.\n \n Perhaps the Post might want to exempt rifles from its one-in-20 criteria when it hears that the one officer dying from a rifle wound was actually shot in 1977 and died 23 years later and 10 years after retiring with 20 years on the force. If we remove that one death from the list, then no officers died from rifle wounds received in the 16 year period cited.\n That's right, Maryland officers have not been shot and killed with AK-47s, AR-15s, M-1As... or any rifle whatsoever during 16 years examined (and this is the record in one of the most violent states in the union). Perhaps the Post should re-think its support for banning \"assault-style\" firearms.\" \n \n The VPC in a lie? Say it ain't so.",
