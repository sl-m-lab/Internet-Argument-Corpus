   "1# It destroys the stability of man-woman marriage\n 2# It's against the Bible.\n 3# It's not natural.\n \n \n We've all heard these, but I doubt anyone who supports these beliefs have actually thought about them logically.* \n 1# Using this argument, divorce should be illegalized like yesterday. Divorce is a direct destroyer of the stability of marriages in that it Ends the marriage. Furthermore, men-women marriages are not as stable as they once were. The m-w marriage is destroying its own stability. I'd even go as far to say that marriage destroys the stability of a relationship, but that's another thread for another day:)\n 2# Who cares? What about separation of church and state? Let's bring back the bible and kill everyone who doesn't believe in it. Moreover, someone can make virtually anything be against the bible if they interpret it that way. It's like looking at clouds, except if you get it wrong you will burn in hell, which is why you should ask this special person what the cloud means. Who says your religion should dictate our country?\n 3# Gay marriage isn't natural. That's actually correct. There's nothing natural about it. Man-woman marriage isn't natural either. It isn't. Or, let's assume they mean being gay isn't natural. That's incorrect. Even if we ignore discoveries made in studying human genetics; there are animals which actively prefer and seek out sex with their own sex.\n \n Really, who cares? Gays should have the same rights to legally be miserable with another person for the rest of their life just as their straight counterparts.\n *duh, ignorance is logic's archenemy",
