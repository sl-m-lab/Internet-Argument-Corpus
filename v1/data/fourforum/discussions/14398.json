   "Chicago could limit handgun ownership, require registration - chicagotribune.com\n \n \nMayor Richard Daley's administration is making plans to limit the number of handguns allowed in Chicago homes as it grapples with a U.S. Supreme Court opinion gutting the city's long-standing gun ban.\n \n Each qualified gun owner in a home could have only one handgun under a new ordinance being drawn up that could be heard by the City Council Police and Fire Committee as soon as Thursday, officials said. The ordinance would require handgun owners to register their weapons with the Police Department and keep them secured inside the home.\n \n The measure also likely would force gun owners to take safety training classes, undergo a criminal background check and obtain liability insurance, city officials said. City Hall also is mulling a formal ban on gun shops, said Mara Georges, the city's top attorney.\n \n \"Reducing the number of handguns in Chicago is critical to public safety,\" Georges said. \"The same concerns that motivate a one handgun per person per residence limit - reducing the number of guns in circulation in Chicago and the risk of illegal traffic in guns - motivate the gun dealer ban.\"\n \n Chicago makes it tough to open a gun shop because the city has outlawed the display of guns for sale. There are no city stores that sell guns - but 45 suburban outlets that do within 13 miles of the city, Georges said.\n \n The scramble to pass new gun restrictions took place at a hearing the day after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the city's gun ban, enacted under then-Mayor Jane Byrne in 1982. Despite the ban, Chicago continues to struggle with gun violence.\n \n City officials are trying not to cross a fine line. The Supreme Court ruled that citizens are entitled to keep handguns in their homes for self protection, but also said \"reasonable\" restrictions could be placed on handgun ownership.\n \n Pro-gun groups that backed the lawsuit overturning the ban said they are watching Chicago to make sure the restrictions are not unduly burdensome or costly to citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights as interpreted by a closely divided top court.\n \n \"We are trying to figure out how far we can go and survive a (legal) challenge, because we know it will be challenged,\" Georges said.\n\n \n Now I know we didn't expect Daley to just roll over and take his losses like a real man. But to suggest that people be allowed to own only one single handgun is quite a step even for him. Even DC didn't try that one.\n \n I don't see how such a proposal would ever pass a legal challenge. You'd never get away with telling people they could only buy one book in their lifetime.\n \n And what exactly are you supposed to do if the gun you buy turns out to be something you don't like for whatever reason? Or what if it breaks and can't be repaired? Are you going to be allowed to replace it or are you gonna be SOL?\n \n And how about all those collectors out there?",

His visit was for the purpose of demonstrating the effectiveness of new gun safety locks. Picking up a Glock 9mm pistol, Glendening inserted a Saf T Lok into the pistol&#8217;s magazine well, turned a key, and fixed the lock in place. &#8220;This is proof that it works!&#8221; he exclaimed, holding the pistol in the air in front of the crowd of officers.\n \n The demonstration seemed to be proceeding without a hitch until Glendening attempted to remove the lock. On his first attempt, he inserted the key, turned it, and attempted to pull the lock out of the magazine well. It wouldn&#8217;t budge. He tried again and again and again. Calling Maryland National Capital Park Police Sergeant Jeff Pauley to his side for assistance, Glendening continued. After 54 attempts to remove the lock both Glendening and Pauley gave up.\n\n \n Our Law-abiding Chicago homeowner, if Glendenning is any example, after fumbling with the lock, then having no recourse but to hand the gun and the key to the fully functioning, fully awake thief, next he has to then beg for the thief not to kill him and his family!",

I would not venture to recommend gun regulations, as this is not an area where I have any expertise, and it is not an area of great interest of mine. I post here because I am interested in how the Supreme Court rules, not because I care about the issue of gun regulations specifically.\n\n \n Of course you have an opinion or you wouldn't be on these boards passing the time of day. No one would expect a history prof to have any expertise since we got a good look at Bellesiles work of fiction. :) \n \n \nOn the question of whether rights are absolute, I was presenting how the Supreme Court has long addressed the question of rights, not whether I personally think rights should be viewed as absolute. The Supreme Court has never treated individual rights as absolute; they have sought to balance individual rights with the interest of the state in protecting the common good.\n\n \n Have they? Proof? Court cases documented history? A balancing act huh?\n \n So we are going to have to go through it all again for your viewing pleasure? There is a way to make amendments but I doubt you will have much luck with the BOR since they are in a class all their own and 39 States signed onto the the concept that has existed since time of adoption. \"the interest of the state in protecting the common good\" is laughable at best. Get this thought in your head, the Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that the cops have no duty to protect you! It is in my interest and therefore Interest of the State, to protect myself, my property, my family and any third person I wish to protect. The State is the People ... not the State first and the people second. You don't have a marxist view of the State do you? \n \n \nI think the arguments will now focus on what is reasonable gun regulation that will protect the public while preserving the right to bear arms. Some people will argue that there should be little or no gun regulation, while others will argue that there should be as much regulation as the courts will allow.\n\n \n Well, is that your thesis for debate? Are you going to make the argument or depend on someone else to do it all for you while you keep score? Why don't you toe the line and serve and see if you can hit the return. :) Why is it that when the gun grabbers have lost the field there is always some Johnny come lately that wants to step up to the plate and pretend the outcome has never really existed and one can ignore the rulings and scope with impunity? No doubt exists in my mind that you want to marginalize the 2A rights as much as you think you can get by with. You once stated that the P or I clause presented was the best way to incorporate the civil rights which I then assumed you were pro right, pro 2A. Now it appears you want to moderate that stance into something else entirely. Am I wrong?",

   "Doc, it's interesting that you bring up Michael Bellesiles. Although my PhD research was not on gun issues, I was a graduate student at Emory University when Michael was there, and I took a course with him on early America back around 1990. I remember us in the Emory History Department all watching in horror as his career evaporated, and he tried desperately to explain where his evidence came from. Things got really bizarre when he claimed that his notes were destroyed in a flood in his office. There was a flood in the building that affected his office, but I don't think anyone believed that the flood destroyed his notes. The whole thing was sad. I have lost touch with Michael, but I believe he is teaching in Connecticut now. Another colleague of ours, one of Michael's friends, said at the end, \"Michael has lost his mind.\"\n \n I think Michael fell victim to hubris. He became so enamored of his own argument that he inflated his case way beyond what the evidence actually showed. As he became a superstar in a sense, winning awards and accolades and also drawing attacks from the NRA and its supporters, he grew less and less cautious, claiming that his probate evidence was central to sustaining his case. It turned out that he could not point to this evidence, and some of it he may have invented. Had he been more careful and less intent on confirming a stark and unambiguous argument, he might have sustained a modified version of his thesis with his other historical evidence. But he lost sight of caution and of the mission of the true scholar. A true scholar must look for the truth, whatever it is. A true scholar must never try to prove a pre-conceived belief. A true scholar must be open to what the evidence tells him or her, not exclude evidence that does not confirm his or her argument. And a true scholar must never inflate evidence or make it up.\n \n In answer to your other questions and points, my interest here is mainly in how the Supreme Court rules in regard to the 14th amendment and incorporation, not in gun control laws specifically. I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass. \n \n It is true that the Supreme Court has not, over time, interpreted individual rights as being absolute. They have created balancing tests, and they have ruled on exceptions to individual rights. Even the first amendment right of free speech, which the Supreme Court has usually been careful to protect, has not been interpreted by the Court as being absolute. We have laws against slander and libel. And we have seen the Court wade into that ambiguous terrain of pornography and what can and cannot be banned. Whether you and I agree with the Supreme Court that rights are not absolute is a different question and one that I don't care to get into. I am simply observing that the Supreme Court is likely to rule that gun regulations are constitutional, but not outright bans, such as the one that existed in Chicago. What regulations the Court deems constitutional will be the big new question. \n \n My other interest in posting here is to hear from Steeeve again, as I have always enjoyed our arguments about constitutional interpretation, though in the past they took place in other threads.\n \n Do I personally support the individual right to bear arms? Yes, but only because it is in the constitution, and now the Supreme Court has ruled that this is an individual right and the right is protected from state abrogation. I think this was the right ruling, though I wish the Court majority had incorporated the amendment through the privileges and immunities clause. I am certainly not going to oppose people's right to bear arms. It really does not matter much to me. I understand that many other people have passionate feelings about this, and that's fine. I just don't have passionate feelings about this one way or the other.",

Jim Lindgren has some questions for him :) Thought you might appreciate the update?\n \n How exactly are the college generation supposed to get an education from people such as him, and we know this is not an isolated incident. Perhaps that is why we see such confusion on the younger generations that are so sure they understand history and the Constitution and feel qualified to come to boards like these when they have been fed enough \"stories\" to puke a buzzard off a gut wagon?

   "Also, I do not think Michael's \"sole purpose\" in writing \"Arming America\" was \"agenda-based political activism.\" My take on this, as someone who knew Michael at the time, is that he was trying to become a superstar among scholars, to enhance his reputation by writing a history that would debunk what he viewed as popular myths about guns in the nation's past. Michael was never, from what I recall, a political activist particularly. He was and apparently still is ambitious, and I think he was motivated by that ambition. He wanted to make a big splash academically with his book, and he did. At first, he drew fire from the NRA, and that only enhanced his reputation in scholarly circles. But then, when James Lindgren challenged the probate data, he made a splash because of his downfall. \n \n I am not defending Michael here. I am trying to illuminate what I think motivated him. I remember Michael as extremely ambitious and energetic, as someone who was in a hurry to publish a ground-breaking book that would change how scholars and ordinary Americans think about the history of guns in our nation. I think he hoped to win the esteem of his colleagues. I think he believed then and probably still believes that he was right about gun ownership in early America. But the question of whether or not his argument, with qualifications, may be right got lost when he could not produce the probate evidence, and when his explanations in defense of his book gradually fell apart. \n \n He did not, btw, resign as soon as the questions about his scholarship emerged. He engaged in a lengthy effort to defend his research, an effort that seemed only to make things worse. He resigned after the investigating committee issued its report.",

Too bad the courthouse he claimed to have gotten all his probate files had burned down almost a century ago with all records he claimed to have, most unfortunate.\n \n On this latest incident, when Lindgren smells smoke it is best to evacuate and call the fire department :) We will have to see how this plays out. At any rate, it makes Bellesiles appear to have missed yet another AA meeting. Perhaps he will respond and maybe he will not, we will see.\n \n The first book was written to influence a civil right and cater to political agenda and goals to disarm America. I have no use for low lifes who use academia to accomplish goals against the Rule of Law. It is possible his new book might have some redeeming qualities and might make a decent read...then again, maybe not. I am willing to wait and see but I remain skeptical after what he pulled the first time around. A second would place him solidly in Saul Alinksky's camp. It will be difficult since he wrote the article mainly to promote his upcoming book if the hype proves to be a fabrication.

   "Jim Lindgren \u0095 July 9, 2010 6:30 pm \n \n \nA few days ago, questions were raised first by Big Journalism and then by me about a story that Michael Bellesiles published in the June 27th issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education: Teaching Military History in a Time of War. I have now read through every DoD casualty report from last fall for both Iraq and Afghanistan and news obituaries for most of them, and I have found none that was even remotely possible as the case that Bellesiles wrote about in the Chronicle. This post discusses the serious questions this raises for the veracity of Bellesiles account.\n",
