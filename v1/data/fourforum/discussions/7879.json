   "Recently deputies of Russian State Duma sent their British colleagues from House of Commons letter asking what do they think about fact of Russian criminal oligarch Berezovsky staying in Britain. It turned out that this letter hadn't even reached Commons. When they were asked about it they told that they discuss Iraqi and Iranian problems and problems of education and possibility of Tony Blair's retirement. But nobody heard about this letter!\n That's funny statement for possibility of Blair's retirement is exactly discussion of Berezovsky problem. This Israeli protege had entangled the whole Britain in his net and British parliament knows nothing about his activity!\n Berezovsky is very rich man and native Jew. So he has numerous connections and men everywhere. He's bought half of European journalists and carrying out campaign on discrediting of UK politicians (for example press conference of London mayor, Blair's presumable retirement). He also sponsors terrorist and extremist organizations making precedents for kindling of European hatred of Arabs. By the way cartoon scandal is his doing either.\n Just look, all Berezovsky's activity is aimed for one purpose: for toughening of European policy against Arab Middle East countries and involving EU into future war against Iran. That precisely matches to aims of Israeli foreign policy. It looks like he influences on entire European foreign policy and British deputies don't know a single thing about his activity in UK!\n At the same time Mr.Berezovsky walks freely everywhere he likes and even comments Ukrainian elections' results on one of London TV channels! And Europeans even don't notice that they're puppets in hands of dangerous international criminal!",

   "i have heard about that scandal with mayor of london. i don't know why boris berezovsky has grudge on him but it was rather unpleasant. bb had set \"evening standard' correspondent on him. You know this paper is hostile to livingston and that journalist finegold was jew (and our mayor is known by his anti-semitic expression). and this appearance of jewish journalist from hostile newspaper was mere provocation. and of course livingston showed himself in all his glory. *i'm against anti-semitism but there is a little other theme here*\n and \"jyllands-posten\" daily's (which first published those caricatures of mohammad) editor-in-chief is under berezovsky's thumb. so tcs, some of europeans are know quite well about your \"dangerous international criminal\", eh? ;)",
