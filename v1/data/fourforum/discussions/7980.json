   "\n Who's going to pay for this expanded federal police force and the associated costs they incur \n\n \n Well I'll tell you who will NOT be paying for it, people with illegal status. So to suck it up, guess who will...legal citizens of the U.S.\n \n Our government needs to follow through on their own laws, instead, they send a mixed message and give them money, give them housing, give them medical, give them schooling. Our government has shown that they lack experience and dedication in enforcing the laws we've created.\n \n Illegal immigrants are people just like you and I, we are all the same in equality as human beings, no one is disputing that but at some point \"america\" is going to break, the influx of people and jobs (life-sustaining- beyond-poverty-job) not increasing at the same rate, it truly is a disaster in the making. \n \n \"They\" say there are 12 million illegals here, well, personally I think its more than that but whatever, in the next 10 years, I think the true number will double and double again 10 years after that, the majority of illegals are of mexican and south american heritage, by 2050 America's domiant race will be hispanic and this will be a spanish speaking country.\n \n Is this good or bad? Well, in reality its neither. Look back on history. The Americas have had numerous owners, of various descents some gained by trade, some by wars. What the new \"occupants\" are doing is quiete interesting I think, they come in peace and they come by the millions, and \"we\" let them stay.\n \n The landscape of US will dramatically change, but it's really never about people, but the economics of that country that will decide that fate of that country. The US will become a third-world country, not because of the people but the economics by 2050 I do predict.\n \n Mexico and South America is geographically located in climate-friendly locations the land is invaluable, but people from these countries come in droves to the US not really wanting to leave a \"beautiful\" country, but to leave their country to find JOBS, to live life out of poverty. To live a better life for them and their family. \n \n What's the solution for the US?\n \n Two roads to take. Create laws and ENFORCE THEM, and prosecute those who harbor and employ illegals. Illegals will not remain if they can't feed themselve,house themselves, clothe themselves. For those illegals who then commit crimes, we need to take a hard line and make them do hard time, 5 years, 10 years and not in a comfy prison, that's another problem we have here.\n \n Or\n \n The other road we can take and seem to be going that route. Turn a blind eye and act as if the fate of america isn't at stake. Let US citizens pay for non-US citizens. Let good jobs be devalued with poverty paying wages with no benefits, let America, be a culture of two; Rich or Poor, let america have many cultures not assimilating.\n \n America is a large country, and frankly the amount of people legal or not living in the US as of today can sustain with the economy we do have now. However, 25 years from now...??? \n \n I'll be around in 25 years from now, I'm just sitting back and waiting, to see how it all pans out. It will be very interesting that is for sure.",

Who's going to pay for the new federal police force and associated costs? More deficit spending or further reductions of revenue sharing with states forcing additional tax increases at state and municipal levels? Property and sales taxes will only bear a finite percentage of taxation before defaults and reduced transaction levels become common.",

What we need idealy is to change the penalty structure so there are steeper fines for the company, not just the individuals.\n \n I would imagine this will be fairly effective.

Bye-bye even more tax base.\n \n The majority of jobs taken by illegal immigrants are not with large companies but small operations on thin margins and individuals who employ personal help. I can't see how intimidation would have any effect on them unless compliance was expanded to where enforcement, the judicial system and incarceration grows to where it becomes additional government overhead with negligible offsetting revenue from fines. \n \n We know we can't seal the borders, our growing two-tier system demands cheap labor (though the general public still hasn't caught on to that), no politician is capable of fixing our welfare or retirement systems because that's how they buy votes and we really can't afford a new federal police force with associated costs and deportation burden. We need an economic depression or guest worker program.",
