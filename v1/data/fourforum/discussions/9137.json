   "Pope tells Irish bishops to find the truth, prevent priestly abuse\n \n VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Pope Benedict XVI said priestly sexual abuse of minors was a \"heart-rending\" tragedy that requires an effort of purification by the church. Addressing Ireland's bishops at the Vatican the pope encouraged them to establish the truth of past sex abuse cases, take steps to prevent future crimes and bring healing to the victims. \"The wounds caused by such acts run deep, and it is an urgent task to rebuild confidence and trust where these have been damaged,\" the pope said. Irish church leaders have had to deal with hundreds of allegations of clerical sexual abuse, many of which came to light in recent years. The bishops set up an advisory committee and an independent, lay-led commission to study the problem, and earlier this year published \"Our Children, Our Church,\" a child protection policy that included new measures more consistent with state procedures.",
