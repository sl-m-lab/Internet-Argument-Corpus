   "Official: Saudi king traveling to U.S. for blood clot treatment - CNN.com\n \n \nSaudi Arabia's King Abdullah will fly to the United States on Monday for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that is causing him back pain, the country's health minister said Sunday.\n \n \"The medical team recommended that that he leaves to the U.S. to visit a spine-specialized medical center in order to complete medical examinations and for follow-up treatment,\" Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah said during an interview with Saudi state television. \"But I assure everyone that he is in a stable condition, and that he is enjoying health and well-being, and God willing, he will be back safe and sound to lead this proud nation.\"\n \n Doctors performed tests on the 86-year-old monarch Friday after he complained of back pain and had more tests on Sunday, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. His doctors have advised him to rest, but he took calls from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in which the regional leaders wished him a speedy recovery, the news agency reported.\n \n Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since 2005. But he ran most of the kingdom's affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half-brother, King Fahd, and has moved to reform the highly conservative Saudi government since assuming the throne.\n \n Crown Prince Sultan is expected to return to Riyadh while the king is overseas, the Saudi Press Agency said. But there are also questions looming about the crown prince's health: He has lived in Morocco for a year and a half after surgery for an undisclosed ailment in February 2009.\n\n \n So I guess the government run free for all health care plan provided to the people of foreign nations is insufficient.",

Any cases of a poor individual being thrown out by the hospital staff because it was discovered they had no chance of paying their hospital bills?\n\n \n Yes. It happens all the time.\n \n Patient Dumping:X Another Dark Side of Health Care\n \n \nCarol Ann Reyes, a 63-year-old homeless woman, was found wandering in the street near Los Angeles' Skid Row. Reyes had just been discharged from Kaiser Permanente Bellflower hospital where, after taking a fall, she had been treated for three days. Wearing little more than a hospital gown and a diaper-the hospital lost her clothes and even left her without pants or shoes-Reyes was put in a taxi and dumped on Skid Row, a 50 square-block area that is the last stop for approximately 11,000 people.\n\n \n From the same article, a brief explanation of the care hospitals must provide:\n \n \nBack in 1986, as part of COBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, a provision called EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) was introduced, which governs when and how a patient may be (1) refused treatment or (2) transferred from one hospital to another when he is in an unstable medical condition.\n \n A person found to be in an \"emergency medical condition\" or \"active labor\" must either be provided with medical treatment or transferred. However, if such a person has not been \"stabilized,\" or is in \"active labor,\" the hospital is not permitted to transfer the patient except in certain limited circumstances. Once \"stabilized,\" a person with an \"emergency medical condition,\" but not a person in \"active labor,\" may be transferred without restriction. Both hospitals and physicians may be held liable for EMTALA violations. A hospital's or physician's violation of the Act can result in civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000.00 for each incident.\n\n \n Hospitals are only required to provide EMERGENCY care, and they are only required to STABILIZE you. havea heart attack with no insurance? They will keep you and medicate you until you have a regular cardiac rhythm (or as close as you are going to get) and then kick you out the door with 99% blockage in your arteries. EMTALA does NOT cover ANY kind of surgery. \n \n A very good friend of mine died last year because he was diabetic and had no insurance. He got an infection in his foot that he just could not beat. They tried all the standard antibiotics and it would temporarily beat the infection back, but not cure it. They finally decided he needed a surgery to remove some of the bones in his feet and some of the infected tissue. He could not afford it and did not feel right about asking his friends for help/money for the surgery, so they let him die. Every time he went into the emergency room they would give him antibiotics to beat the infection back, stabilize him and send him home. After a while the bacteria was immune to pretty much all the antibiotics. One day they could not stop the infection and 36 hours later he was dead. \n \n It does not even have to be that severe. The truth is that we let people die in this country of infections that a $4 bottle of penicillin could cure, because they cant afford the $150 doctors visit to get the prescription for the $4 antibiotic they need. By the time they become ill enough for it to constitute an \"emergency medical condition\" under EMTALA, the infection has gone so far that they cannot be saved. \n \n The idea that anybody can walk into an emergency room and be treated regardless of ability to pay is at best naive and in most cases is just a bold faced lie that the person has picked up from some politician somewhere. \n \n Frankly your entire thread here is childish and ignorant. So, the king of Saudi Arabia is coming to the US for medical care. At the same time, over 50,000 Americans a year cross the border to canada every year for medical care. Another roughly 70,000 Americans go to mexico for medical care. The fastest growing industry in the health care field in this country is medical tourism....Americans traveling to other countries to get medical care that they cannot afford here in the US. \n \n I dont care what kind of care the king of saudi arabia gets or where he gets it. I care if AMERICANS get good care in the AMERICAN medical system.\n \n Besides, trust me, you can not afford the care he is getting. That is a WHOLE different level of care than any insurance company provides.",
