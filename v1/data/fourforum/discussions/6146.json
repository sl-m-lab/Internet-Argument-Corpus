   "Great... These two guys are knuckleheads. Funny, but nevertheless, it's just foolish. I suppose that means that we should all get married to someone, even if we aren't in love with them, if only that means tax breaks. There you go, for all of you conservatives, here's another attack on the sanctity of marriage. But here's the funny part (and this just kills me) it's HETEROSEXUAL guys doing it! Isn't that a scream?",

What was really funny is the double-standard the attorney at the end of the article had when he said \"Generally speaking, marriage should be for love,\" he said. \"People who don't marry for love will find themselves in trouble.\" Wonder if he said that to any of the TV marriagees in San Francisco and Massachusetts? :p",

   "Although I'm sure gay rights opponents might find the actions of these guys appealling simply because they are on the same team, I think the argument that same-sex marriage legalizes marriages of convenience is truly pointless. Opposite-sex marriages of convenience have been legal and happening ever since we legalized opposite-sex marriage.\n \n It's generally a bad idea to criticize same-sex marriage for something opposite-sex marriage has been doing for years and years. Marriages of convenience haven't destroyed marriage in any way, shape or form, nor will they do so if same-sex marriage is legalized.\n \n This is especially true if it actually takes two same-sex marriage opponents to engage in a marriage of convenience before we actually see one happen.",
