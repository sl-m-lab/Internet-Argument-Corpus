Religion (church) and politics (state) should always be put into different conversations. \n Their beliefs will not agree with every person watching or reading what they say. It should not happen and it will probably make their popularity fall, if only a little bit.\n \n I like to say that, but my views are being broken by president Bush right now. When giving a speech, he always includes something about God being involved.",

At least Christians can now get a break from years of liberal lies, bull, and anti-Christian laws being passed. \n \n -------\n \n Crim, politicians don't care about alienation unless they're trying to get a law passed against Christians. Politicians show their humanistic beliefs in their speeches and talks all the time... do you care about it then? Or is it only when they make references towards the Christian God?",

If you put a cap on what they are allowed to say or not allowed to say, do you honestly believe that at some point they won't turn it back upon you? That would be very foolish if you believe they would not. We all have the right to speak freely in this country, and that includes politicians. They have the same rights as the rest of us, and though sometimes we may wish we can muzzle some of them, they have as much right to speak as the rest of us do.
