   "If you weren't there then how do you know absolutely there is no intelligent design?\n\n \n I like the way you inserted the qualifier \"absolutely\" :-) LOL!\n \n Intelligent Design (aka 'Creationism Lite') is a response by certain conservative/fundamentalist Christian groups to the failure in their long-standing attempt to push classical creationism into the public schools. ID will probably meet the same fate. Why?\n [*]It contributes nothing toward our understanding of the workings of the physical universe [*]It cannot be falsified[*]It has no predictive value\n In short, ID is a solution in search of a problem.\n \n Do you consider, say, the human backbone to be evidence of intelligent design? I certainly don't. Ask anyone who suffers from back problems. But those problems make perfect sense when you consider that the human backbone is an evolutionary adaptation from a quadupedal (four-footed) to a bipedal (two-footed) architecture. In other words, evolution almost always makes do with and modifies what it already has. Ask any competent structural engineer to design the human backbone from scratch and the result would no doubt resemble nothing like what we are endowed with. For one thing, it wouldn't be dorsal, whereas a dorsal backbone makes sense for a quadruped. \n \n The human sweating mechanism as an attempt at temperature control is another example. It is an evolutionary adaptation which is grossly inefficient and can prove to be deadly. Sweating deprives the body of not only water, but salts and minerals as well (lousy design - the excretion of salts and minerals does nothing to cool the body. Moreover, sweating in a humid environment is ineffectual). The symptoms of mineral loss consist of extreme abdominal cramps followed by convulsions followed by death. Way to go.",

   "The first thing people have to believe in when they discount the idea of a sovereign creator is they have to believe in the theory of evolution. Notice first that I didn't say the proven model of evolution - I said the \"theory\" of evolution. Almost two centuries after Darwin wrote the Origin of Species, his formulations still, to this day, remain only a theory - and an unproven theory at that. Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking (author of \"A Brief History of Time\") are probably two of the greatest scientific minds that the twentieth century has produced, yet both of them, after exhaustive research and analysis, have remarked about \"the grand design\" of the universe. Design certainly strongly implies the existence of a designer. We know the designer as Jesus Christ. Science has yet to identify its designer. So if you hold in high esteem in your mind the credibility of Einstein, Hawking, and others who speak of the grand design of the universe, while you also buy into the randomness of purposeless evolution, then you now have a very unpleasant disparity to start off with. And that's one of the first disparities that people are faced with when they buy into evolution.\n \n The second disparity is known as the \"Law of Non-Contradiction.\" Very simply, this says that the universe can not be responsible for its own creation. The universe would have already had to exist in order for that to occur. So someone or something else had to be responsible for its creation. Along these lines we have to ask, \"Where did all the matter and energy come from that supposedly 'created' the universe?\" How can that matter and energy \"evolve\" out of the vacuum of space? Where did it all come from? Some evolutionists say that it isn't worth studying, since it's just an \"infinite regression\" that no one can trace all the way back. So why are scientists sending up Hubble telescopes to gaze back to the \"beginnings\" of the universe? Why do they study genetics if not to find out the origins of man, and why do they spend big money studying quantum mechanics and all the other related areas of science if not to discover where we came from? Infinite regression is simply a term that unbelievers have coined so that they do not have to come to terms with something they don't like the looks of. \n \n Now in order to believe in evolution, people have to swallow whole the unlikely concept of spontaneous generation - the highly improbable and scientifically unexplainable precept that living organisms suddenly came to life in the midst of a primordial organic \"soup.\" Dr. George Wald, a Nobel Prize-winning laureate from Harvard University, had this to say concerning spontaneous generation: \"One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation\" (Scientific American, August, 1954). That kind of a statement surely demonstrates a much greater faith than a religious creationist can possibly muster. Dr. Wald categorically states that it could not possibly have happened - yet he believes it did. A Christian who professes to so great a faith would be labeled as naive and gullible. What a difference a cloak of higher education makes to those who are so easily impressed! What is this evolutionary doctrine that inspires so much faith in its disciples, and what are the odds that an event such as spontaneous generation can actually occur? A Swiss mathematician by the name of Charles Eugene Guye computed the odds of such an occurrence at one chance in 10 to the 160th power. That's one over ten followed by 160 zeros! Your chances of winning the Florida Lottery are one in fourteen million, and people say you're a fool for spending your money on such an improbability, but these same people will turn right around and put their eternal faith in an event that is millions and millions of times less likely to occur. My friends, that's not called science, that's called blind faith. The odds against spontaneous generation alone are enough for a reasonable individual to give up on the theory of evolution, but that's the kind of thing you have to believe in when you don't believe in God.\n \n (to be continued)",

   "But let's not stop there. Let's look at some of the other improbable events that must come to pass for evolution to be true. Let's take a look at the transitional fossil record and listen to what die-hard evolutionists themselves say about it. To begin with, S. M. Stanley of Johns Hopkins University tells us how important the transitional fossil record is to the theory of evolution: \"It is doubtful whether, in the absence of (transitional) fossils, the idea of evolution would represent anything more than an outrageous hypothesis....the fossil record and only the fossil record provides direct evidence of major sequential changes...\" (Evolutionary Timetable, 1981, page 72.). Now regarding whether or not these transitional fossils exist, Colin Patterson, Senior Paleontologist for the British Museum of Natural History remarks, \"You say I should at least show a photo of a fossil from which each type of organism was derived. I will lay it on the line - there is not one such fossil for which we can make a watertight argument\" (Harper's, Feb. 1984, page 56). Niles Elidridge of Columbia University and a former paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History categorically states, \"Darwin prophesied that future generations of paleontologists would fill in these (transitional fossil) gaps by diligent research....One hundred and fifty years of paleontological research later, it has become abundantly clear that the fossil record will not confirm this part of Darwin's predictions....The fossil record simply shows that this prediction was wrong\" (The Myths of Human Evolution, pages 45-46). Professor D. B. Kitts from the University of Oklahoma echoes what Elidredge said when he states, \"Despite the bright promise that paleontology provides a means of 'seeing' evolution, it has presented some rather nasty difficulties for evolutionists, the most notorious of which is the presence of 'gaps' in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species, and paleontology does not provide them\" (Evolution, Vol. 28, page 467). And let me give you just one or two more before I move on to some of the other absurdities found in Darwinian evolution. Professor Mark Ridley of Oxford University wrote this in the New Scientist Journal (1981, p. 831): \"A lot of people just do not know what evidence the theory of evolution stands upon. They think that the main evidence is the gradual descent of one species from another in the fossil record....In any case, no real evolutionist, whether gradualist or punctuationist, uses the fossil record as evidence in favor of the theory of evolution as opposed to special creation.\" Remarkable. People, these are not fundamentalist Christians who are speaking - these are university paleontologists and evolutionary scientists who are commenting on their own theory. Darwin himself wrote in the Origin of Species, \"If in the future these transitional fossils are not found, then my theory will have been proven to be wrong.\" By the way, many of the top evolutionary scientists have summarily given up on supporting the theory of evolution by virtue of the transitional fossil record, and they have graduated to new models of evolution known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\" or \"Special Creation,\" which may not require transitional fossils as supporting evidence. To this, Colin Patterson of the British Museum of Natural History concludes (paraphrasing), \"Well, it seems to me that they have accepted that the fossil record doesn't give them the support they would value so they had to search around for another model....When they haven't got the evidence they need to support their theory, they come up with another theory to explain their lack of evidence\" (Quoted in Darwin's Enigma, p. 100). And this is exactly what you're seeing in science today. These are some of the remarkable intellectual foundations that masquerade as \"truth and science\" that people have to swallow whole when they don't believe in God. There may well be some variation within species since God's creation of life (microevolution), but there's no convincing evidence of any new species (macroevolution). Many people do not understand this distinction.\n \n (To be continued)",

   "Okay, on to the next \"problem child\" of evolution - \"Natural Selection\" - as a means of generating new species. The assumption of Natural Selection is that since only the strongest and \"most fit\" species survive to father the next generation, the species will gradually improve, even to the point of advancing into other more \"highly\" developed states on the evolutionary scale. Darwin looked upon natural selection as the most important factor in the development of his theory. Another evolutionist by the name of Sir Julian Huxley said, \"So far as we know....natural selection is the only effective agency of evolution\" (Evolution in Action, p. 36). Huxley goes on to state, \"On the basis of our present knowledge natural selection is bound to produce genetic adaptations; and genetic adaptations are thus presumptive evidence for the efficacy of natural selection.\" Did you catch that gem of twisted logic? Huxley's proof for natural selection is genetic adaptations within the species, but these genetic adaptations are at the same time the result of natural selection. So which is it? Does natural selection give rise to genetic adaptation, or does genetic adaptation give rise to natural selection? Huxley contends that both of these things are true at the same time! Surely this is one of the most vacuous examples of circular reasoning to ever be perpetrated in the name of science. Huxley continues with his defense of natural selection by saying, \"....(natural selection) operates with the aid of time to produce improvements in the machinery of life, and in the process generates results of a more than astronomical improbability which could have been achieved in no other way\" (Evolution in Action, p. 54-55). Don't miss the force of that last statement. Huxley states that the odds of natural selection occurring are \"astronomically improbable,\" but because Huxley sees no other way for it to have occurred, he believes in the astronomically improbable! God help us! Huxley even calculated the odds of natural selection occurring in nature as 1 over 10 followed by three million zeros. If you think I'm making that up just read his book entitled, \"Evolution in Action,\" on page 46. Now listen to what another evolutionist says regarding natural selection: Dr. Ernst Mayr, considered to be one of the heavyweights in the field of evolution, contends that, \"Natural Selection is no longer regarded as an all-or-none process, but rather as a purely statistical concept\" (Animal Species, p. 7). It is statistical because there is a lack of physical evidence to support it! And G. G. Simpson, another highly regarded interpreter of evolutionary theory, remarks, \"It might be argued that the theory is quite unsubstantiated and has status only as a speculation\" (Major Features, p. 118-119). Natural selection may indeed produce stronger and more viable species, but they always remain the same species. \n \n Just one more - the concept of genetic mutation. Genetic mutations are perceived to be abnormal changes in the living organism caused by chemical damage, unusual pairings, or other influences, which supposedly give rise to changes in an offspring and possibly new species. The evolutionist assumes that, due to genetic mutations, amoebas turned into invertebrates, which magically evolved into amphibians, then reptiles, quadrupeds, ape man, and finally into modern man. \n \n You all may remember the evolution charts in science classes when you were growing up, where you saw the drawings of Australopithecus, Peking man, Java man, Cro-Magnum man, the Neanderthal man, and modern man - they were all neatly lined up there on the charts. Come to find out that in 1997 scientists conducted genetic testing on the Neanderthal man and came to the scientific conclusion that it was genetically impossible for the Neanderthal man to be our direct ancestor! In addition, no genetic testing on any of the other \"missing links\" has yet to identify any vertebrate species as being our direct-line ancestor. When I asked one university professor to identify for me which species is it that is man's direct-line ancestor, or which species is it that we can look to as the \"missing-link,\" he couldn't do it. In fact he said I was presenting a \"straw man\" argument - asking him to identify something that doesn't need to exist in order for evolution to be true. It's only a \"straw-man\" argument in his eyes. Does anyone have any doubt whatsoever that if they found the so-called \"missing link\" they would not parade him around like their missing messiah? Anyway, what we are able to conclude from the genetic testing of the Neanderthal man was that the evolution charts were just an exercise in pseudoscience, where anatomical and physiological similarities were used to infer that the Neanderthal man was once our forefather. It's obvious now that the initial inference was baseless. And if that inference was wrong, how many of the other evolutionary inferences that we've been force-fed since the first grade are also wrong? We can study science in the form of physiology, paleontology, and biology, but it ceases to become good science when ill-advised inferences are made.\n \n Anyway, getting back to genetic mutations - Professor Ernst Mayr stated, \"(Genetic) mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation found in natural populations, and the only raw material for natural selection to work on\" (Evolution, p. 170). Well, to begin with, all scientists agree that genetic mutations are very rare. Secondly, when they do occur, they are almost certain to be harmful or deadly to the organism. Huxley admits that, \"The great majority of mutant genes are harmful in their effect on the organism.\" Other scientists, including Darwin himself, conceded that most mutants are recessive and degenerative - they would therefore be more likely to cause the death or extinction of the species than to cause the emergence of a new species. Professor G.G. Simpson, one of the top spokesmen for evolution, reports that the mathematical likelihood of getting good evolutionary results through mutations would only tend to occur once every 274 billion years. And that would be assuming 100 million individuals reproducing a new generation every day. Simpson concludes by saying that, \"Obviously...such a process has played no part whatever in evolution\" (The Major Features of Evolution, p. 96). Evolutionists say that genetic mutations are necessary to make the changes required by their theory, yet when they do the calculations they confess that it is scientifically improbable for multiple mutations to effect the required changes that are needed. \n \n It's time to expose evolution for the pseudoscience that it really is. \n \n And let's be clear on one more thing: Since creationism cannot be taught in public schools, then the evolution show - no matter how bizarre and squirrely it becomes - must go on.",
