   "Can you believe GW raised 260 million for his re-election campaign before public financing kicked in? John Kerry raised 233 million dollars. The previous record was GW in 2000 with 106 million dollars. Special Interests and big dollar corporations are financing elections. After spending almost 500 million dollars, are we supposed to think that these people are getting a return on their investment? Whether you're Democrat, Republican, or of some other party, we have got to stop allowing our government to be manipulated by the wealthy. We have got to stop allowing our elected representatives to use their office for personal gain. When our forefathers drafted the constitution, government was supposed to be for the people and by the people. We've gone way off track. USA Today had an article yesterday showing that every American;s share of the national debt is almost $500,000. We can't continue to mortgage our future to benefit a select few. Vote intelligently. Research your candidates and see if they actually deserve your vote. Two great web sites are Citizens Against Government Waste and American Outrage . Make sure your voice is heard in this election.",

And both the $260 and $233mm raised will be repaid, by consumers in the form of government contracts and special interest oriented legislation.

At that rate, the debt should be about $150,000,000,000,000, or $150 trillion. \n \n According to the Department of Labor, approximately 130 million Americans are currently employed. This number does not take into account farmers or those that are self-employed. Last year, approximately 135 million Americans filed income tax returns, with 44 million of them getting everything that they paid back from the government (they pay nothing in taxes). Simple math shows that about 90 million Americans pay income taxes. Even if we were to just include them in the figure, they would only share about $80,000 each of the debt. But why are we even arguing who shares it? Every American shares it because everyone benefits from the governments' use of taxes, and in fact those who pay less or even no taxes benefit more than those who are in the highest tax bracket. Why would only the people who pay taxes be considered when determining the shared burden of the debt?\n \n For the shared debt to be $500,000 with our debt being $7.4 trillion, that would mean that there were only 15 million people involved in this dispersal of the debt. I know for a fact that much more than 15 million people pay taxes.",

You can slice it up any way you want, it still comes out to more than most Americans can afford to pay. If you're comfortable using the $25,000 figure, by all means use it. Keep in mind the total is still rising. Argueing over which rediculously high amount is my share of a carelessly acrued national debt is counterproductive. \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd if John Kerry's 20 year Senate record was worth a dime, he wouldn't have had to raise $230 million or but a multi-million jet for his campaign?

However, George Bush is running for the actual job he's held for the last 4 years. John Kerry had to emerge from a group of several Democrats just to be nominated to be the candidate. Don't forget George spent all that money back in 2000 as well. Anyway, Ill agree they both have spent too much and campaigning is a distraction from both of their day jobs.",

   "Sorry for the copy of the post above. Still learning. Jskufan is correct. Whether the amount we owe is 25k or 600k, I don't feel we should have to pay it. I pay a lot of taxes as it is and I don't want to spen even an extra 25k for frivolous spending. In 2003, the government spent 250k for a preschool anger management project. They spent 1 million dollars to build a tropical rainforest in Iowa. Why are they using our taxpayer dollars for idiotic projects like this. In the overal scheme of things, the dollars arent high but if you eat out for lunch every day, imagine the impact on your budget if look at the annual cost. There are tons of wasteful projects like this in every budget year. This will continue as long as corporate America is financing our candidates. These executives aren't spending that kind of money without getting a return on their investment. Public financing for presidential elections is a joke. Look at all the special political 528's created like MoveOn and others. There will always be money paid to influence elections. It's up to us to cut through the **** and make them answer to the people.",
