   "This is hilarious--a fitting thing to happen in the wake of the liberal move by the SCOTUS allowing commuinities to take people's land and homes for such vague reasons as \"the greater good.\"\n \n http://www.freestarmedia.com/hotellostliberty2.html\n Weare, New Hampshire (PRWEB) Could a hotel be built on the land owned by Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter? A new ruling by the Supreme Court which was supported by Justice Souter himself itself might allow it. A private developer is seeking to use this very law to build a hotel on Souter's land.\n \n Clements indicated that the hotel must be built on this particular piece of land because it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans.\n \n \"This is not a prank\" said Clements, \"The Towne of Weare has five people on the Board of Selectmen. If three of them vote to use the power of eminent domain to take this land from Mr. Souter we can begin our hotel development.\" \n Wonder if Mr. Souter will support his own decision in this case . . .",
