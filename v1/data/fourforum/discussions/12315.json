   "635 million years (or more) is the claim of this fossil finder. \n \n \n Oldest Animal Fossils Discovered | Wired Science from Wired.com\n \n Fossil traces found in an oil field on the Arabian Peninsula are the oldest evidence yet of animals, pushing back the known origins of higher life to more than 635 million years ago.\n The animals' remains don't look like traditional fossils. They're more like fossil echoes: chemical traces of a compound only produced - at least in modern times - by demosponges, descendants of what some scientists consider to be the last common ancestor of all animals. \n \"It is, definitively, the earliest evidence for animals,\" said geochemist Gordon Love of the University of California, Riverside, lead author of the study published Wednesday in Nature. \n Love's team identified the fossils while analyzing sedimentary deposits mined by Oman's national oil company. The sediments date to the last stages of the the aptly-named Cryogenian period after a deep freeze referred to by scientists as Snowball Earth.",
