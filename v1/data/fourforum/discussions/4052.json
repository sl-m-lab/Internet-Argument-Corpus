   "I found a certain article that is basically a free opinion but is a good read:\n \n \n\"I have come to a realization recently that it is indeed the white race that is responsible for the stupidity of humans in general. I have proof! And I am going to tell you all the proof right now. In the beginning there were people all over the world with all different colors of skin. No one really lived together until people started to migrate, in places like Southern Europe and Northern Africa, and do you know what? These people actually got along! In those days the only people who were looked at as inferior were women(and isn't it amazing, we still are?) So anyway, Europeans created this delusion in their heads that they were the most important people on the planet. Africans, Asians, and \"Indians\" never thought this about themselves. Probably because they weren't self centered scum. Well, low and behold, the Europeans started asking questions and they decided to send some people out to look for God or something, who really knows what they thought they would find. Well, they \"discovered\" a brand new country, complete with it's own inhabitants. Now, only a complete FOOL would think that it was their land to take. But they did. So they took over a country from a people who were perhaps the most intelligent race on the planet at the time. The Europeans STOLE the land from the Native American tribes. Then they decided they needed help or something, and South America was too close to steal people from. You see, if they stole South Americans, the South Americans might fight back, being that they were right there. Asia was too far away to import the stolen people, so Africa seemed like a fitting place to snatch people from. After all, it was just a short boat trip from Europe to Africa, so they could stop off, steal some people, then go back to their new stolen homes in America. Now, years and years went by, and there began to be more and more white people. And as with any group of people, no matter how stupid, when you get enough of them, a few are going to start realizing the truth. So a few white people, like Abraham Lincoln, the great non-Christian President, realized how sick that indeed was, and they said \"okay, we feel kind of bad that we stole the people, not so much the land, but kind of the people, so we'll let you have your lives, but we won't let you learn with us or anything like that. That's up to you.\" Well, more white people started coming around, so a few more realized the truth. So they decided to make some laws and stuff that said we were all equal. But, naturally, the smart white people were still greatly outnumbered by the dumb white people, so even though they were trying, it didn't really work out that well. Well, time went by, and eventually all kinds of people were able to go to school together and learn, but the dumb white people were still in control of everything, and they proceeded to teach their ideals to all of the people, white, black, brown, yellow and red. Or, as I like to say, every different shade of tan. And this is the state of America today. A group of narrow minded people who are still living by the truths of other people. Then, as if to make matters even worse, they decided that they were going to force feed us all Christianity. This is you and this is me. You have been taught, and you are living, the ideals of the white man, it doesn't matter what color you are or if you realize it or not. Of course, a few of us have minds of our own and we realize that we are not the center of any universe. We are the lucky ones. Our souls will not have to perish in agony because of their bad karma. \n \n So, as I said, these white people who still thought they were the center of the world brought their narrow minded Christian religion into our lives. Buddhism was wrong, they said. Confusianism was wrong, they said. Islam was wrong, they said. But Christianity was their religion, so Christianity was right. Well, is it not an amazing coincidence that the leaders of all those other religions are of races other than white? But, the dumb white Christians have portrayed their Lord as a white man. In all their pictures, Jesus Christ is white. So are his parents. But, there is a huge problem here! Jesus Christ was born in, lived in and died in the Middle East. He was a Jew by race, and I guarantee you, his skin was far from being peach. And yet the dumb white Christians portray him as being WHITE. Just another way of saying that Europeans still think they are the center of the world. They have attempted to brainwash people into believing that the son of God is white, when he was not. \n \n White people have never even had an original thought of their own. Western philosophy is the dominant way of thinking in today's society. Athens is considered \"the birthplace of philosophy\" when it is nothing of the sort. People such as the Ancient Egyptians and Native Americans had their own philosophies for centuries before Athens became the center of philosophical debate. Perhaps you have heard of the three great philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Socrates was educated in Africa, and based many of his ideas on already created Egyptian philosophies. He was the teacher of Plato, who was also educated in Africa. And Plato, in turn, was the teacher of Aristotle, who was also educated in Africa. Now, these men were by no means XXXXXX, they added some flavor, but for god's sake, don't you realize that white people even stole thoughts? \n \n My skin may be peach, but my soul is not that of the white man. \n Tina J~ \"\n\n \n I agree to an extent that if it weren't for Africa and the Middle East the world would not be as \"proseprous\" and \"successful\" as it is today. In fact, if africans had not been brought over to \"Native America\" and Europeans had not tampered with African societies it would probably be the world power. With all the oil supply and diamonds, gold, coal, etc coming from Africa and the Middle East they would definently be a world power. Africa's and Middle East's resources alone could support those countries and other countries. Also the bible refers to Jesus being of Middle Eastern decent and not White. If you look at the word Human and break it down, Hue meaning skin color, and man meaning the inhabitants of the earth you will see that hue-man means man of color. Essentially implying that men of color make up the majority of the world, not europeans who feel they are superior and do not have color.",
