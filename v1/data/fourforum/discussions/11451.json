And since all aliens I know are depicted in the old American TV show and movie of the same name, 'Alien Nation', I surmise that you're a former slave (Slavenia) from another planet who's crash landed on ours.\n This surmation is also compounded by the fact that you said you can't get any sea. And it's a noted fact that Aliens from Alien Nation melt in sea water.\n \n Yep, you're an alien invader posing as some benign creature here to get our women...as all aliens are.\n \n And your alien logic would have us reason that since you stated you need some sea, that our bigotry would take hold and we'd seek to deprive you of it in spite.\n \n My conclusion, based on all the known facts and cunning use of reverse psychology 101 is to toss you into the sea.\n \n Thus, I call upon my fellow xenophobes to contribute to the 'Send Iuris to Hawaii' fund.\n \n You all can send me the funds at gimme money.\n \n I'll ensure Iuris gets it...honest injun!",
