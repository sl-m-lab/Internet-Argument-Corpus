   "you mean server! \n \n Do you actually use all of that power?\n\n \n Actually, my server at home is a module from an old Cray MTA that I picked up at a government auction for next to nothing. The processors are only 400 mhz, but since there are 700 of them, that seems to be plenty.\n \n I run engineering and motion simulation programs on the sun, and have locked it up a time or two because processors were at capacity. \n \n I think you will see a lot more 64 bit applications and dual processor setups in the future. Unix systems have been 64 bit for a long time, which is why an old sun system with a 300 mhz processor runs faster than a 1ghz athalon. The downside to 64 bit has always been cost, biut hat is coming down as well.\n \n We will have to wait and see how the new XP handles multiple processors. Traditionally, multiple processors for windows has been a waste of money, even at the server level because their support just wasn't great. In windows, you have to have every application written to run 2 processors. In a *nix environment you can generally set up your kernel to handle all processor interaction, so it handles it on its won. \n \n I can certainly see why microsoft would like to grab a piece of the multi processsor pie, but I personally doubt their ability to do so. They just have too bad a reputation for it.",
