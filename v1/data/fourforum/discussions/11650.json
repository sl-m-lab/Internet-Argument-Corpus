   "A common argument against guns is that the police can protect you. But if you believe this, then here's some things you should ponder:\n [*]We have no constitutional right to life; if we did, lawsuits would be filed against congress on a daily basis. People would whine and scream \"My cousin got murdered! That right didn't save him!\" And truth be told, it wouldn't.\n [*]We have no constitutional right to police protection; if we did, lawsuits against the police would be filed daily.\n [*]Dialing 9-11 isn't reliable. The police have no obligation to be particulary concerned about the life of an individual. They will show up, but they won't just jump out of their desks, wave magic wands, and teleport to your location. They'll show up whenever they're good and ready. The life of an individual isn't first priority to the police.\n [*]The police can't arrest people before a crime is committed. If they could, then they would have the power to arrest anyone at all on the grounds that \"They look suspicous\". And what boat would you be in if your favorite punching bag in grade school grew up to become a cop? The police can rarely prevent crimes from happening; they can only arrest after a crime has been committed - wether it was attempted or actual.\n PS: Some anti-gun people may call this a strawman. But really, just because this argument is not (directly or commonly) used on this forum doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.",

   "Ethmi, \n \n While I largely agree with the premise of what you are trying to say, you have made a comment that deserves a harsh rebuke, and I intend to deliver it.\n \n \nThey'll show up whenever they're good and ready. The life of an individual isn't first priority to the police.\n\n \n Until you have chosen to stand in uniform between the criminal element and the law abiding in our communities; until you have felt the anguish of attending a funeral service for a fallen brother, until you have felt the helplessness and shed tears resulting from an inability to prevent someone from seeing harm; until you have stood upon our streets and offered service in defense against those that would seek to do others harm; you have no ground on which to stand in making such comments!!!\n \n Law enforcement, as a whole, exhibits a love of community that few can even comprehend. Every day we place ourselves in harms way, in the hope that we can prevent some of the evil that lurks in our world. We do this by choice. No one has forced us into this position. We do this because we are of a breed that is able and willing to fight in the face of evil. We do this knowing that it is unlikely that we will win this war, but that it is the fight which matters. \n \n Our reward for such service?? Last year, my net income was a little over $42,000. We are constantly berated by a public that has no real comprehension of what we struggle with on a daily basis. We are often held in contempt by many, for life and death decisions we make in a split second with little or unreliable information. Our families are often victims of the stresses created by our chosen profession. I have encountered grief over the evils of man that you and many others have no way of even imagining.DO NOT sit safely behind your keyboard, and pretend that you have some insight into what we think and feel, until you are prepared to stand where I have stood for the past twelve years.\n \n Justin",

   "As you probably already know, the primary role of law enforcement is to attempt to uphold and enforce the laws of our communities. This includes everything from minor infractions to to felony crimes such as murder. While it is true that the police are not able to offer absolute security to every individual within society, this does not mean that we have placed the individual at a lower priority. Quite the opposite actually. The safety of individuals is the goal of enforcing the laws of a community. \n \n Statements such as \"They'll show up whenever they are good and ready\" indicate that you believe that when we receive a call, we consciously make a decision to put that call off until such time as we deem it convenient to respond. As I am sure you can imagine, the number of officers on the street makes it impossible to respond, instantly to every call put out. This however, does not indicate that we have a lesser desire to respond in a timely manner. \n \n Not only do we respond to calls from our community, but we are often engaged in actions as a result of observed behavior. This, combined with calls for service, typically results in a fast paced and busy shift. I frequently handle in excess of 20 calls per shift. This comes out to about one call every fifteen minutes. Now account for travel time to the scene, time lag in reporting, time to handle the call for service, and various other things that influence response times, and you may have some idea of what a typical shift is like. \n \n If your local department has a ride along program, I would encourage you to take advantage of it some time. It will certainly give you a different perspective of what your local police encounter at work, and may well provide you with some insight into what we do while on patrol. Contrary to what some believe, we don't sit in parking lots, eating donuts and drinking coffee while the public cries for help.\n \n JW",
