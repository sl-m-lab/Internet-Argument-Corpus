   "Men from traditional homes are more the 'marrying kind'\n By Marilyn Elias, USA TODAY\n Men who grew up in homes without two biological parents are less likely to be married by their early 30s than men from traditional families - and they're more dead-set against ever marrying, a national survey reports today. \n Those from non-traditional families also mistrust women more than other men do, says the survey of 1,010 heterosexual men ages 25 to 34. It was commissioned by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and done by Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton.\n \n \"Divorce usually means bitterness from one side or another, or both,\" says David Popenoe, co-director of the National Marriage Project. \"These men may be more fearful of marriage because of what they've seen.\" \n \n There's less pressure nowadays to marry, and adults raised by divorced parents have more \"live together\" relationships than do those from traditional homes, Popenoe says. In the survey:\n \n \u0095 Among married men, 63% grew up in two-parent homes vs. 37% in non-traditional families. \n \n \u0095 54% from traditional homes say they'd \"be ready to marry tomorrow if the right person came along\" vs. 43% of men from single-parent or step-parent families.\n \n \u0095 22% of singles are \"not the marrying kind.\" These are more likely to be from non-traditional families (59%) vs. 41% from homes with two biological parents. \n \n Men from religious homes and those who say their dads were more involved in their upbringing are more ready to marry than are men raised in secular families or without much father time.\n \n \"Example is not just the best teacher, it's the only teacher, and a lot of these guys learned attitudes about marriage and women from their fathers,\" says Diane Sollee, director of SmartMarriages.com, an information clearinghouse on marriage education and improvement. \"Many saw fathers estranged from their mothers, or fathers who weren't there, maybe in their third marriage or their 14th girlfriend.\" \n \n These boys may grow up to fear commitment or not respect women, she adds. But marriage education classes can teach relationship skills \"and help them rebuild confidence that they can have a happy marriage.\"\n \n The survey findings don't surprise psychologist Judith Wallerstein, whose 25-year study of children post-divorce has followed them into their early 40s. The men in her study often have live-in relationships but fear marriage. \n \n \"What they fear is being betrayed. The notion that relationships could last is hard for them to believe. ... They just don't have a vision of how you can work things out,\" she says. \n \n But the idea that most kids whose parents divorced will have trouble making healthy marriages is challenged by psychologist Stephanie Coontz, research director at the Council on Contemporary Families, which supports varied types of healthy families.\n \n \"This is way too broad-stroke. It ignores the tremendous variation in non-traditional families. ... Just because there's a higher percentage not getting married doesn't mean most kids from these families end up troubled,\" Coontz says.\n \n In step-parent studies, boys and girls who grow up with strong, mentally healthy parents look more similar to children from intact homes, says psychologist James Bray of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \n \n \"Of course, if you grow up with your father not around, or in angry disputes with your mother, you may have doubts about marriage and being a good father yourself,\" Bray says. \"But there are a lot of healthy situations in stepfamilies, and these kids aren't afraid of commitments.\" \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-06-22-married-young_x.htm",

Seems to me that's more of an argument that the most important thing in a marriage is love, not opposite genders.\n\n It seems taht you didn't understand the article. It supports wht people ahve been saying all along. Traditional parents are the ebst parents for a child. Single parents and other parents are not the best for promoting families. Children learn parenting skills and roles from tehir parents.\n \n Yes it is not beneficial that there is fighting in the home. Howev er if you implying that gay marriages will be less violent than taditional marriages, you have no support for that.",

   "This study doesn't seem relevant at all for a couple reasons. One: Even if it included some families that had 2 men or 2 women, it's unfair to group those families in with families that have parents that split up. The question is weather gay couples are worse at raising children than straight couples.... and including the straight couples in with the gay group is not representative of the gay couples. \n \n Second, even IF it was found that gay parents turn out children that are worse off than straight couples (i hardly think adults who don't feel like getting married is detrimental to the child or society) are we now going to let the government get involved with how children are supposed to turn out? It's generally agreed that parents divorcing is harsh on kids, so why is no one pushing for a ban on that?\n \n I think the only way that the effect on children can be used as a argument against gay marriages is if it was shown that gay couples produce children that are significantly worse off than children from divorced families... and even then we would have to consider weather it's significant enough damage to warrant government involvement. \n \n \nHowev er if you implying that gay marriages will be less violent than taditional marriages, you have no support for that.\n\n \n Why do gay marriages have to be better for children than straight couples when no ban on divorcing couples is even being considered?",

   "I thought his point was very well made. If the government lets people get divorced, which is known to be harsh on kids, than what right does it have to say that gay parents might possibly be bad for kids without rock solid proof. \n \n Let me try another example. Right now, a drug addicted child molester can marry a woman and have kids, and the government can't stop him. Yes, they can arrest him if they catch him doing drugs or molesting children, but they can't tell him that he's not allowed to get married, or that he's not allowed to have kids. If that sort of person can have kids, than I don't see how the government has any grounds to deny gays that right.",

You seem to think that because i don't want the government to intervene in certain places, it means i don't want the government to intervene at all. Kronus touched on this subject. Since the government largely doesn't tell you how to raise your kids (i can teach them whatever religion i want, what values to have, what prejudices to have, even push them towards smoking and uncle sam can't get involved) why does it suddenly matter so much when gay parents are concerned. \n \n my \"point\" is that your OP is irrelevant to the issue.",
