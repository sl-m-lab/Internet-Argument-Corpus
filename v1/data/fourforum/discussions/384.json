   "I read that a group of German scientists analyzed the faces of \"Saddam.\" We know he uses doubles all the time. This group of scientists say that Saddam has not been seen in public in seven years. \n \n Could Saddam be dead and his sons or someone else using the doubles to continue inspiring fear in the Iraqis to lead Iraq? \n \n It's a great arrangment...keep the people scared, countries worried over someone who no longer exists.\n \n It's a leap...what do you think?",

If he doesn't have the power of Iraq behind him, he couldn't do much damage before someone caught him. We need to make the Iraqi's be stable, and form a reliable sort of government so that they can learn how to become independent of a dictator. However, this may not be a possibility because they are so used to being told what to do....but this is a different debate. What do you think?",
