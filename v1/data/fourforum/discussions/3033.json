   "Will the Cheney curse strike again?\n (Sadly, I doubt it.)\n \n http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story?id=6450422&pageid=rs.Home&pageregion=single7\n \n \nShould George W. Bush win this election, it will give him the distinction of being the first occupant of the White House to have survived naming Dick Cheney to a post in his administration. \n\n I love this article, mainly because it says:\n \nHaving turned Ford into their instrument, Rumsfeld and Cheney staged a palace coup. They pushed Ford to fire Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, tell Vice President Nelson Rockefeller to look for another job and remove Henry Kissinger from his post as national security adviser. Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense, and Cheney became chief of staff to the president. The Yale dropout and draft dodger was, at the age of thirty-four, the second-most-powerful man in the White House.\n\n AND\n \nThe period between August 1974 and November 1976, when Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter, is essential to understanding George W. Bush's disastrous misjudgments -- and Dick Cheney's role in them. In both cases, Cheney and Rumsfeld played the key role in turning opportunity into chaos. Ford, like Bush later, hadn't been elected president. As he entered office, he was overshadowed by a secretary of state (Kissinger then, Powell later) who was considered incontestably his better. \n\n This article tells you what evil bastards Cheney and Rumsfeld are.\n \nBy the end of the first Bush administration, others had come to the conclusion that Cheney and his followers were dangerous. \"They were referred to collectively as the crazies,\" recalls Ray McGovern, a CIA professional who interpreted intelligence for presidents going back to Kennedy. Around the same time, McGovern remembers, Secretary of State James Baker and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft counseled the elder President Bush, \"Keep these guys at arm's length.\"\n\n And of course that Wolfy is an imperialist pig.\n \nAppointed to another powerful position, Cheney promptly went about screwing it up. He pushed to turn many military duties over to private companies and began moving \"defense intellectuals\" with no military experience into key posts at the Pentagon. Most notable among them was Paul Wolfowitz, who later masterminded much of the disastrous strategy that George W. Bush has pursued in Iraq. In 1992, as undersecretary of defense, Wolfowitz turned out a forty-page report titled \"Defense Planning Guidance,\" arguing that historic allies should be demoted to the status of U.S. satellites, and that the modernization of India and China should be treated as a threat, as should the democratization of Russia. \"We must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role,\" the report declared. It was nothing less than a blueprint for worldwide domination, and Cheney loved it. He maneuvered to have the president adopt it as doctrine, but the elder Bush, recognizing that the proposals were not only foolish but dangerous, immediately rejected them.\n\n And all of this war mongering from an ardent draft dodger.\n \nThanks to Lyndon Johnson's escalation of Vietnam, lounging around was suddenly no longer an option. Cheney snapped into action. First he enrolled in Casper Community College; then he went to the University of Wyoming. That kept him out of the draft until August 7th, 1964, when Congress initiated massive conscription in the armed forces. Three weeks later, Cheney married Lynne Vincent, his high school girlfriend, earning him another deferment. Then, on October 26th, 1965, the Selective Service announced that childless married men no longer would be exempted from having to fight for their country. Nine months and two days later, the first of Cheney's two daughters, Elizabeth, was born. All told, between 1963 and 1966, Cheney received five deferments.\n\n Imagine! Having 2 kids to dodge the draft. I guess he calls his kids \"my little safety nets.\" ;) Just kidding, but it is a bit suspicious that it was exactly 9 months later. O well.\n \n So what do the Bushies think?",
