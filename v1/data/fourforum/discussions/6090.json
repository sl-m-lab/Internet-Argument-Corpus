   "I have a '46 chevy pickup I purchased a sa project truck (had to cut a tree out of the engine compartment to get it). It has been more or less sittign while I decide what I want to do with it. Current plans include a 400hp smallblock, suspension from a navigator (unless I can find a donor suburban with the 4 wheel steering), all modern conveniences. \n \n The only question left is whether to chop the top or not. I am not talkig enything too severe, a couple inches maybe. \n \n Here is a page with pictures of a '46 stock:\n \n http://www.dealsonwheels.com/search/dealerbig.cfm?Autos__ID=000778-200507-000010\n \n Here is one with a 2\" chop:\n \n http://www.hotrods.ca/Features/Photos/StanZink.jpg\n \n Here is one that is beat to death witha rediculously high price tag:\n \n http://www.oldchevytruck.com/trucks8/zf.htm\n \n Sheesh. I paid $500 for mine, and it has a better looking body than that.\n \n Anyway, what do you folks think? Chop it or not? I am going to try to stick close to stock height (though I will gain about an inch with the navigator suspension). There is plenty of headroom, you can chop them 5\" before things start to seem at all cramped.",

If I was raising it, I would leave the roof stock height, but probably cut the front of the cab and rake the windshield an extra 10 degrees. Lweaving it stock height, though, I am not sure what to do. \n \n I am sticking with the big chrome grille (though I will probably go polished stainless instead of chrome for longer life and easier maintenance), and the chrome headlight rings, cowl strips, etc...\n \n I have never seen one stock height with a chop, so I am not sure what it would look like. Usually when people chop them, they either drop or raise them, shave doorhandles, pull chrome, paint grilles, replace bumpers with pans, etc...\n \n I have a GREAT sheetmetal guy, so I can do pretty much anything with it (I considered stretching the cab 2.5 ft and making it a 4 door club cab). My sheetmetal guy was willing to do that one at cost just to see what it looked like when done. He can go from sketch on napkin straight to finished steel.",
