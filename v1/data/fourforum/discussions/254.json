   "26CFR part1 states clearly that all us citizens must pay tax on income. They go one to define taxable income and gross income etc. Taxable income is calculated from the gross income. Gross income is defined as money received from any source.\n\n \n \n Although, 26 USC 1 imposes a tax on income it does not make us liable for it or require us to pay it on our wages or salaries. Later in the IRC grosss income is defined as \"Gross income means all INCOME from whatever soucrce derived\".\n \n The word income is used in the definition of \"gross income\" but it (income) is not defined nor is its definition referenced within the IRC.",

   "I believe that an income tax (or something with a similar result such as a value-added tax) is necessary to discourage people from working too hard.\n \n Let me give as an example the construction industy of a large city. Suppose the industry is operating at capcity. If Mary wants to build a house, she can hire a contractor to do that. Since the city is large and has numerous contractors, and since Mary can compete for contractors just as well as anybody else, her workers will only have to work a negligible amount of overtime to get the job done. Consequently, she will choose to build her house if workers are willing to build her house using non-overtime work for less money than what she is willing to spend on it. But the industry is operating at capacity, so the effect of Mary building her house is that the construction workers of the city will have to work overtime to get her house built along with the other houses, etc., they are building. If in the obvious sense working overtime is half as efficient and twice as unpleasant as non-overtime work, then the net effect of Mary deciding to build her house on the suffering of the construction workers in the city is that these construction workers will suffer an amount they would pay four times what Mary spent in hiring them to avoid! This is undesirable! Without taxation to discourage production, the economy overheats and people have to work too hard.\n \n I would be interested in knowing what branch of macroeconomics deals with this and similar considerations. It wasn't convered in my undergraduate Econ course, but it is so obvious to me surely someone must have thought of this?",

Larken Rose's report provides an excellent analysis that disproves many of the old assumptions, such as:\n \n 1. The 16th Amendment is the basis for the income tax law (USC Title 26 and CFR Title 26). FALSE!\n \n 2. The U.S. Congress has the power to regulate commerce within the 50 states. FALSE!\n \n 3. \"Gross income means all income from whatever source derived\" means \"all income no matter where it comes from.\" FALSE!\n \n This report shows how the income tax law, although legal and constitutional in itself, was written in such a way as to deceive the American people. Most people who begin reading the law quit reading before they ever get to the punch line. It is a must read for all \"taxpayers.\"",

   "IMO, $75k is actually a very low income number to mis-use as the 'rich' comparison side. At that income level most probably don't incur capital gain taxes, where the majority of wealthy taxpayers derive their taxable income from investment returns. That was the important tax cut for the wealthy. \n \n I disagree with tax cuts for any group of taxpayers in a declining economy. Regardless of benefits by income levels, when compared to the 10% of taxpayers who pay 90% of income taxes, there are numerically far more voters in the lower income levels, which makes tax cuts in a declining economy pure and simple vote buying. \n \n Kerry's strategy is based on the same principle the Bush administration used, appeal to the largest number of voters regardless of actual benefits. Neither bring capital gain tax cuts into play without sending a mixed message due to their personal wealth. They both rationalize that by insisting it brings additional capital investment to our failing equity markets. Realistically, one doesn't retain one's wealth by additional investment in a pending disaster.",
