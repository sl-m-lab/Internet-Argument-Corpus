Answer is: they weren't, they didn't and government took away the most effective means of protection from a tyrant under many names.\n \n That is all gun control is, fear of the people drummed up by anti rights actors funded and encouraged by the government intent at the time of depriving people of their personal property and rights. The brady bunch even had a 5 year plan to destroy 2A rights. \n \n Project GUNWALKER is yet another attempt by a government agency to drum up fear and skew statistics to frighten the illiterate and willing accomplices...only this time they got caught emoticon_wow\n \n We can depend on you and people like you to be complicit in any scheme that has a purpose to deprive people of their second amendment rights no matter how crooked and illegal and unconstitutional it is can't we?
