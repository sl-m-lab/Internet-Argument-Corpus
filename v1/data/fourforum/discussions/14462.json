   "Liberal or conservative if:\n \n 1. You support welfare programs and government make-work programs as emergency measures during periods of economic hard times, but you believe that the government should not otherwise be in the welfare business because the government dole acts like a narcotic that destroys the human spirit, saps the vitality of its recipients while government make-work programs erode a person's work ethic. And under no circumstances are you willing to support government welfare or make-work programs when you have to borrow money to pay for them.\n \n 2. You support higher tax rates for the rich in principle, but you won't make any real effort to have higher tax rates written into law.\n \n 3. You favor a mildly inflationary monetary policy as a means of increasing the amount of money in circulation in order to spur economic activity during times of economic distress, but you would rather let a bad economy continue than cause hyper-inflation.\n \n 4. You support labor unions' right to collective bargaining with employers, but you generally support employers whenever a union goes on strike because you fear the social unrest and economic disruption that strikes can cause.\n \n 5. You support minimum wage laws, but you don't actively work towards their adoption.\n \n 6. You support government spending as a means of spurring the economy when the economy is bad, but only as long as you don't have to go into debt to do it.\n \n 7. Your welfare and make-work programs are implemented in such a way to discriminate against women to discourage women from entering the workforce so you can promote stay-at-home mothers.",
