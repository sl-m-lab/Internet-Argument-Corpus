   "John Boehner doesn't even have the majority in the house yet and already he caved. Turns out the only things democrats and republicans agree on is increasing spending (although apparently they can't all agree on that) and saying the only deficit reduction plan that exists is \"dead on arrival\". Instead of focusing on this plan they prefer lowering taxes for people that don't want them lowered and giving unemployment benefits for people that refuse to admit their management degree was a waste of money.\n \n We have the supposed tea party leaders screaming for tax cuts as if that magically creates more government revenue (which is easily proven not to be true). So all those \"fiscal conservatives\" were basically just putting up a smoke screen to convince themselves that they aren't totally bending over their kids and giving them the financial beating of a lifetime. \n \n So almost half of people don't like the Deficit Reduction Commissions and most everyone doesn't like a majority of the recommendations...see study below. I'm guessing that this leaves Ron Paul, myself, Daewoo, and David Walker as the only 4 people that think fiscally more than 2 hours in front of them. Oh well. You can find the recommendations here: National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. They basically boil down to tax more spend less. I personally wish they would do more but considering only one realistic plan exists I'd vote for it. \n \n Honestly what more does it take for people to realize that this much debt is not sustainable? Did everyone's house value dropping in half not help? Ten percent unemployed not help? Do we have to end up like Greece or worse?\n \n So I ask, why do people claim to care about the deficit while at the same time not be willing to address it? \n \n The only good Huffington Post article in history:\n Bill George: Politics Trumps Sound Fiscal Policy (Again)\n \n Apparently no one likes the Deficit Reduction commission ideas: \n Deficit Solutions Meet With Public Skepticism: Overview - Pew Research Center for the People & the Press\n \n And before you ask, I knew the tea party was full of it before so the post title is sarcastic.",

I'm not sure how this is a debatable issue. Have you ever found it beneficial to spend twice as much as you make each year? If not, perhaps you shouldn't expect the government to do the same. If you agree with that than the debate becomes either raising revenue to pay for what we got or reducing what you get in services. Frankly raising the revenue by that much would probably not be the best idea considering tax rates would be 80% at the top and 50% for the middle class (give or take...haven't done the math in awhile). Cutting spending only is also not plausible. Could you imagine the shock of cutting everything in half including social security and medicare? \n \n I've proposed cutting all departments by 15% to start with and the next year cut by 10% and the third year cut 5%. Repeal any law that restricts those cuts and is not essential or productive. The question becomes how do you determine that and I would just say if it isn't in the constitution and the economy doesn't stop than you can cut it. Next raise taxes on the top 10% earners by 8-10%. Cut social security and medicare benefits for those same folks. Repeal Medicare Part D (or just completely change medicare). \n \n Over time you could then reform social security and reduce what the federal government controls. As the world adopts to a non-government run country you could lower the tax rates back down. \n \n Over 10-20 years tuition would stop growing in cost, health care would stop growing in cost, and our economy would actually start producing tangible goods.",

Reduced Revenues + Increased Spending = Unbalanced Overblown Budget. Reagan Tried it in the 80's when he cut taxes across the board but he didn't do anything to slow down spending. Clinton Raised the Tax rates but Kept on spending, the only thing that saved him was the Revenues coming in at the time, then Bushy Boy and his Massive cuts added to more increased spending and here we are again. \n \n I would agree to almost all of that plan, except the cuts in Social Security.

   "If the Government did what Clinton and Gore thought about and put Social Security in a \" Locked Box\" to keep Government hands out of the Till do you think the Program would be Solvent and pay for itself as it is intended to?...\nKind of depends on how you look at it. Social Security was set up so they use the proceeds from the tax to \"invest\" in treasuries which are government issued bonds. You'd never issue bonds unless you want to use the money. So a lockbox means the money literally sits there. In this case your money now takes a loss because of inflation. Furthermore, it is projected that SS would also run out of money anyway. In fact, SS paid more in benefits last year than SS took in. \n \n So you can see it is actually a little bit more of a problem that at first glance. Investing in treasuries is not always a bad thing but when you roll that money into just general fund money it isn't good. At the same time you can't let it sit there because it depreciates. Finally, if you invest it than you basically flood and possibly distort the market.\n \n \nIf the Government would stop using the Social Security fund as a bank it wouldn't really need to be reformed would it?...\nAs I say above, this in and of itself is a reform.",

I'm basically talking about cutting the federal workforce by 15-20% plus cutting grants or social benefits to millions. Basically no one is left untouched. If you are a University you are going to lose research grants and student aid. If you receive that or your spouse does you lose too. If you are poor or actually need SS or medicare you might be left with nothing. Unfortunately when you dig yourself a deep enough hole you don't know what is up or down and so to start over is damaging to many in the short term for a long term overall benefit.

While worth saving it only accounts for .7% of the cost of social security (give or take a few tenths of a percent). \n \n \nRaising the age to 69 or 70 as they have suggested will do absolutely Nothing to solve the \" Current\" problem.\nWell it isn't designed to. This was a long term fix. I'll address the immediate solution suggested in the \"debt commission\" report below.\n \n \nAnyone who is already on the program will not be affected by an age increase. Basically the Governments Idea of increasing the age to 69 is their way to once again pass off a problem to the future generations. Our Grandchildren will Pay for this change, not us.\nBasically the short term fixes are increasing revenue by taxing more wages and paying out less for higher wage earners.",

   "Be a private health insurance company. Why do you think Medicare (I know we are talking about SS) has \"low\" administrative costs? This is one reason. Furthermore, the fraud is estimated at around 5-6 billion a year. While worth saving it only accounts for .7% of the cost of social security (give or take a few tenths of a percent). \n \n Well it isn't designed to. This was a long term fix. I'll address the immediate solution suggested in the \"debt commission\" report below.\n \n Basically the short term fixes are increasing revenue by taxing more wages and paying out less for higher wage earners.\n\n \n Yeah I realize this would not fix the problem currently or for the long run. My hope is that the Democrats continue to block the extension of the Bush era tax cuts at least until January 1st when they are set to expire. The Nation can use a boost in revenues right about now . I think once we start seeing a increase we can finally find some breathing room , although that doesn't mean changes are still needed. \n \n Also.. when the new Congress convenes next year they will most certainly try to keep their promise and I suspect the GOP, specifically the new Tea Party split will spend all of their energy in a failed attempt to repeal ObamaCare. I don't like all of ObamaCare as it is and I think there needs to be some changes made , but I do like some of what it does. By 2012 when the Elections roll around It is my view that it will be too late for the GOP to change anything concerning the Health-care. There will be a Few Million Americans who will be reluctant to go back to not having any insurance at all so it might be tougher to make changes to the bill. I guess we'll see in a few years.",
