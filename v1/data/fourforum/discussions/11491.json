   "Try to think of a single major threat to our species for which no plausible solution has been suggested.\n \n Global warming? Easy - cut the greenhouse gasses drastically. Terrorism? Simple - change the policies and cultural instruction which fuel it. Poverty, starvation? Plenty of resources exist to wipe it out. Three months of Iraq war money used wisely would drastically reduce both.\n \n Nuclear weapons and war in general? We only lack the collective will to deal with them, and to insist on diplomatic solutions. If we can put ships into space and make digital watches, we should be beyond the caveman tactics of bloody combat by now.\n \n Two facts should be clear: \n A. We have the \"know how\" and resources to effectively deal with such problems. \n B. We are not actually doing so, even though such problems threaten our well being and even our very survival. Try to tell me that we wouldn't have done something about global warming by now if humanity was 90% \"liberal\" in our thinking. Would we be ignoring poverty and AIDS, invading Iraq, facing a rise in religious terrorism or watching health care and education crumble around us? Not too likely.\n \n The real problem, the root problem of nearly all others, is not found in some external force or enemy. This enormous threat to humanity lies in the human mind - it all starts in the few inches between our ears.\n \n Call it conservatism, fundamentalism, right wing thinking, ideological insanity, what have you, it can clearly be considered a mental disorder; a dysfunction of the human mind, and it threatens our survival.\n \n I have put some thought into this problem, and I believe I can identify the symptoms as specific mental behavior patterns. I can even suggest solutions.\n \n Do you have this disorder? Maybe. See if these symptoms fit how you think:\n \n * Instead of valuing results of policies and actions above all, choosing behavior according to consequences, you instead hold rigid commitment to an ideology or a philosophical conviction as a supreme value. In other words, \"it's okay to get things wrong as long as you have strong beliefs.\"\n \n * You believe that your strength of will or faith defines reality, and that truth is a matter of your conviction, instead of independent fact.\n \n * You believe that fate is inevitable, and that your decisions or behavior cannot alter destiny.\n \n * You do not believe humanity is truly able to work together rationally and pragmatically to solve basic problems, and view that strategy as basically impossible, for various reasons.\n \n * When solutions to major problems are suggested, you tend to think of reasons that they cannot or should not be attempted.\n \n * You consider faith and personal conviction as being more compelling, or stronger, than facts or consequences of behavior.\n \n * You believe things to be true for subjective reasons of personal perspective - ie., \"I believe [x] is true because I feel it gives my life meaning.\"\n These symptoms provide a rough sketch of the conservative disorder as I think of it. The kind of thinking described above is a recipe for disaster and destruction.\n \n **************** But... ***************\n \n This problem can be \"cured\" or at least greatly reduced, if people want it, through fairly simple education. Even this major problem is solvable, as long as people have the will to deal with it.\n \n I think this problem is one of mental discipline and habit, but it may be that there are chemical / biological factors as well. Either way, it is a matter of brain function - how people's minds operate. Therefore, any solution must address that.\n \n Imagine if societies taught children these core values:\n \n * The human species, and individual lives, are very precious, and should be valued and protected.\n \n * Being mistaken about what is true or real in the world around you is very dangerous, and it can seriously hurt or kill you. So it is important to understand reality accurately.\n \n * The consequences of your actions and decisions are very important, because they can either hurt or help you and others around you - real results matter more than intentions or beliefs.\n \n * Treating people equally, and according to how you would prefer to be treated in their place, is important. Unjustified inequality, especially in the extreme, generally fosters conflict and violence, and so increases threats to survival.\n \n * Survival and well-being is more easily protected when we refrain from providing others with motives to threaten or harm us (another reason for the Golden Rule).\n \n * Religious beliefs are your own business, and people should not oppose their own faith on others in any way.\n \n * A society of reasonable, helpful laws is vital to survival, and rule of law should be respected and defended as a standard greater than personal feeling.\n \n * Individual rights are equally sovereign under the law, as are personal freedoms.\n \n I'm pretty sure that if all societies taught and preserved those values as part of the cultural foundation, we'd find it much easier to address other problems we face.\n \n The real danger of the conservative disorder is that it causes people to think and act in ways which do not support the goal of human survival, and are often contrary to that goal.\n \n The Bush administration provides an excellent example of the dangers this conservative disorder poses to humanity.",

   "\n * Instead of valuing results of policies and actions above all, choosing behavior according to consequences, you instead hold rigid commitment to an ideology or a philosophical conviction as a supreme value. \n\n \n Consequentialism is deeply flawed.\n \n a) Since value is subjective, trying to \"maximise\" the best consequences is itself insanity, you can only maximise benefits in the subjective view of a single observer. This comment will probably go over your head. You can't add up the \"utils\" or \"consequensites\" for everyone and produce an overall \"best\" outcome, since \"goodness\" is ordinal, not cardinal. This single objection utterly destroys consequentialism as a social norm because it renders it meaningless.\n \n b) Since you aren't omniscient, trying to produce the best outcomes actually produces outcomes that aren't the best, even in the eyes of the individual's pursuing those goals. Ironically, \"rule based behaviour\" produces superior outcomes in complex situations to \"outcome based behaviour\" which is why man has evolved a rule based cognitive mechanisms. This is accepted as fact in cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology, and I should know, I'm provisionally registered as a psychologist.\n \n The thing is, your diatribe is filled with inane self-contradictions.\n \n You appeal to consequentialism, and then point to the golden rule. The golden rule and consequentialism don't mean they same thing - at times they irreconcilably contradict.\n \n \nYou believe that your strength of will or faith defines reality\n\n \n \nNuclear weapons and war in general? We only lack the collective will to deal with them\n",

   "The problem with most peoples 'solutions' to 'X' problem is that they reinvent what being 'human' means and desire others to comply with that mind set.\n \n Basically, you, like most 'liberals' want people to stop being HUMAN.\n \n My solution would be to STOP making such ridiculous demands and embrace your humanity. Your greed, lust, envy, self-centered desires. Your passion, your desires to advance yourself in the most efficient manner you can, factoring in as many variables as you can to ensure the perpetuation of this simple, innate and genetically based programing mandate.\n \n Be human.\n \n Once you are, you'll disregard believing in myths, mumbo-jumbo and use such only as a tool to exploit the weak and the foolish.\n \n Everything can be dictated from a position of superior power and will.\n And preferably, you'll be the one with the power and the unflinching will.\n \n \n Human survival?\n \n HAhahahahhahhahhah.\n \n We, like all other species, have an incredibly high chance of eventual extinction. I'm about as concerned with your personal survival as I am with the 70,000 who died in recent Chinese quakes.\n Human minds as simply UNABLE to care. We're not even built to do so.\n I care less for someone over 'there' than I do for someone in my own family.\n If I (and all other humas) are 100% INCAPABLE to accepting your programming, WHY suggest it? If there is an natural inequality in care and concern, then following artifical beliefs to suggest the opposite is doomed to failure.\n \n In the end, I'd suggest you take some pyschology classes or just observe your fellow human. If, for untold thousands of years of our existance we have never accepted anything remotly like your ideology, and actually nearly always do the opposite, you may find less stress and personal angst if you were to join in and become 'conservative' or whatever it is you're describing.\n I think you'd find a little more joy in losing yourself in some luxuries and personal survival than you would by thinking the sky is falling.\n \n \n Now, my solution would be to round up all those who are physically mature (mid 20's and older) who exibit the irrational, self and species destructive tendencies enbodied in 'liberalism' and place them in re-education camps. \n Basically deep pits in the Earth.\n \n And forget about them.\n \n They'll either collectively design their own utopia becasue they're all 'liberals' (apparently that's the goal you're pushing, have everyone be a liberal)...or, prove themselved to actually be humans...and eat each other.\n Regardless...problem solved.\n We can call them 'Morlocks'.\n \n \n \n But, to sum it all up, if your goal to saving humanity requires a changing of that humanity...then you've already destroyed it.",
