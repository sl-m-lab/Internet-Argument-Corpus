   "Who is the real parent?\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/26/opinion/l26donor.html\n \n \nNovember 26, 2005\n He Donated Sperm. Is He a Father? (3 Letters) \n To the Editor:\n Re \"Hello, I'm Your Sister. Our Father Is Donor 150\" (front page, Nov. 20):\n \n Given the advance of modern technology, parents have the right to fear that their children will have too many resources at their disposal and will disregard their parents' guidance and seek it elsewhere. \n \n Children should not be allowed to go online and find their half-siblings or biological fathers without parental consent. Children in this position are not capable of making a decision of this magnitude. \n \n Their parents have their best interests at heart and should have control over the situation. It could be emotionally damaging to meet a half-sibling or a biological father if they are not ready, and only their parents know for sure. \n \n Parents are the people who raise and love their kids, not the people who give birth or donate sperm. \n \n Stephanie Singer -- Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Nov. 21, 2005 \n \n To the Editor:\n \n I am saddened that your Nov. 20 front-page article used the term \"father\" to refer to a sperm donor. \"Fathers\" are parents who raise children. They change diapers, go to soccer practice, supervise first dates. \"Fathers\" are members of a family, not anonymous sperm donors. \n \n There are millions of healthy parents raising children across our country. These parents may not be a traditional \"father\" and \"mother.\" They may be grandparents, single parents, gay parents, family friends, couples who adopt. How often will they be condemned for their absence of \"father\"? \n \n When can we celebrate the reality of these successful, healthy, happy families without holding on to the false myth of the American family?\n \n Alyson D. Miller -- Portland, Ore., Nov. 20, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n As your Nov. 20 front-page article points out, many sperm banks have not kept records of conceptions. But this is changing. Most sperm banks today not only keep records of conceptions and births, but also limit the number of families created by one donor.\n \n The article leaves the impression that all donor insemination offspring have little or no information about their donors and limited opportunity to connect with other donor families. \n \n In fact, since the early 1980's, there has been a movement toward providing more information about donors to their offspring. The Sperm Bank of California pioneered a program in 1983 that allows adult offspring access to their donor's identity. \n \n In 1997, we started a family contact service to allow families who used the same donor to have contact with one another. In recent years, an increasing number of sperm banks have developed similar programs. \n \n The conventional wisdom is that most men would donate sperm only anonymously. But in the past two years, 75 percent of donors at our bank have chosen to participate in our identity program. \n \n Alice Ruby -- Executive Director, The Sperm Bank of California -- Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 22, 2005\nAnd, are \"birth\" parents obligated to the welfare of a zygote, an embryo, a fetus, do the zygotes, embryos, fetuses own \"birth\" parents?",
