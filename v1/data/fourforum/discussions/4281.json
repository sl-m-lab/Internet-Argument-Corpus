Starting at the bottom of the list, I'd have to eliminate those who obviously have a slippery grasp on all reality. Then I'd strike blatant bible thumpers for the same reason (though an agnostic, I do respect the beliefs of others). Anyone who blindly supports our crusade in Iraq wouldn't have too many original or rational thoughts on that subject and probably many others, so scratch them. That doesn't include those with strong military attachment and/or affiliation, I understand those conditions. Politics are interesting, but not a reason to exclude anyone unless they're such party dogs it approaches a belief system. \n \n That leaves a big group of people I'd like to meet. From there I'd cut it by Americans and non-Americans, simply because I'm very familiar with most conceited American train of thoughts and enjoy new information. At that point, I'd have to examine age, education and other sociodemographic factors. After all that, if it came down to a tie, I'd pick a woman because they generally provide better conversation with different insight than men. Are there any female posters who fit that description? Otherwise, make it a group meeting without the irrational posters in attendance.",

I went to a party being thrown by a firend of mine, a mexican emmigrant who is a truck driver for the BNSF. He took a 200 lb hog, gutted it, skinned it, dug a pit in the ground about 3 ft deep. He loaded the pit with charcoal about 8\" deep, then lit it an put a big piece of clean sheet metal over the coals. Hog went on the sheet metal, antoher piece of sheet metal on top, more coals and some dirt. Let roast for 2 days.\n \n He stuffed the hog with a huge numebr of pepper (jalapeno, poblano, hot lemon, fatalii, and fluorecent purple). When he finally dug up the hog, the meat was falling off the bone. they shredded the whole thing into a big couldren over a hot coal bed (to keep it hot), added some chopped jalapeno and firecracker chili peppers, and served it with fried rice, refried beans, and home made tortillas. It was absolutly incredible. \n \n Just thought I would let you know what those tamales have to contend with.

There were no government accounting courses when I was in school and I assume current government accounting study is similar to fund (not-for-profit) reporting. No slur intended on your studies, politicians are the controllers in government accounting, not those keeping the books. One of, if not the major problem in our country's fiscal demise.",
