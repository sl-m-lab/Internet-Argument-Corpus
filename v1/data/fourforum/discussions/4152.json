   "A talented, landmark entertainer who will be missed. He paid his dues, coming up the hard way by playing what must have seemed like endless years of bars, small rooms and then received the national recognition that deservedly made him a star. \n \n I can remember seeing him in those early years in memorable places like Fresno, the San Fernando Valley and other basic ginmills with stages. He earned every round of applause and penny he ever made. \n \n For those of us accustomed to indulgence in what part of society now labels as sinful or politically incorrect ingestion, until his last few years he was well-known for fully enjoying those habits. And was rewarded with 79-years of life. Not at all a bad run.",

Johnny would come walking out wearing that ostentatious, jewel-bedecked, red pillow on his head and begin divining the questions to answers that were stored in Funk and Wagnall's porch or whatever. He'd hold the envelope to his head and say something like, \"Hi diddle diddle.\" Then he'd rip the envelope and blow it open. Ed McMahon would repeat it, and Johnny's reactions would always give me a free extra laugh. Then he's say, \"What do you say to your diddle diddle in the morning?\" Grand humor.",
