   "First of all, bipedal dinosaurs on this planet have almost evolved three legs, with their tail acting to balance them like a tripod. I think that's also true for kangaroos. What if such a tail were to become like a springboard to propel the animal, so it could hop? It would then be acting as a leg. Also, spider monkeys have a really prehensile tail which is like an extra limb. If such a structure evolved so it could also bear weight, it would be a leg. In addition, imagine how a person moves on crutches using a tripod form of locomotion. A three-legged animal could use a similar kind of gait. \n \n From a developmental standpoint, three legs could easily evolve in a radially symmetrical animal. In a bilateral animal it would be more problematical, as the third leg would probably evolve from a midline structure, like tail. Well, I'm all out of ideas for the moment.",
