   "Ciudad Juarez is a city of two million people, burgeoning with commerce and industry, directly across the border from El Paso, Texas. It is heralded by the local tourism department as \"a city of great people, interesting attractions, fine restaurants, a fascinating history, and very impressive shopping values.\" The rape and murder of almost 400 women over the last 11 years, with many more suspected dead, doesn't make the list.\n \n The Mexican government conservatively estimates that since '93, 370 women have been murdered in Juarez, at least 137 of whom were sexually assaulted prior to being killedas well. Over 70 women are missing. Nearly every victim has been a worker in the maquiladoras that have grown up in the city since the signing of several free trade agreements in the early '90s. Most of the women have been between the ages of 11 and 25, and all have been poor, slim and dark-skinned. These atrocities initially had the markings of a serial killer, and so the Mexican government made meager and limited attempts to investigate them as such. The Mexican authorities have arrested at least 12 suspects since '95 without so much as slowing the tide of brutal rape-murders. Despite crackdowns on suspect gangs and further arrests, the murders proceed unabated.\n \n It has become apparent to much of the public and many human rights organizations that there is a deeper problem, one to which the Mexican authorities seem blind. Human rights reports criticizing inept police-work in '98 were suppressed for political reasons. Amnesty International is now demanding immediate federal intervention in the investigation, independent judicial review of the cases handled so far by the Chihuahua Public Prosecutor's office, and a more concerted effort at recovering and identifying bodies.\n\n The Dartmouth Free Press\n \n Lest you think that the barbaric crime of rape is a distant problem, within our own hemisphere...",

   "Gansao, have you been a victim of sexual assault?\n \n Let me tell what that is like.\n \n Because of my Nordic, sexually egalitarian heritage I was not used to being insulted, disrespected, never had I been physically assaulted simply because I was a woman.\n \n Until I moved to Alburqerque, New Mexico, which was an entirely new culture to experience.\n \n Simply because I was standing on the street waiting for a bus, I was considered a prostitute.\n \n Simply because I dared to walk in public, even during the broadest of daylight, I was solicited as though I were a common harlot.\n \n One day, early in the morning, as I walked to work, I noticed an automobile a short ways away, its motor idling.\n \n I went on my way, the car followed me. I paid no attention. A man parked the car just ahead of where I was to pass.\n \n A man got out of the car and as I passed he grabbed me.\n \n I was very, very surprised. I was not accustomed to a woman being treated like that.\n \n I tried to grab his hair in retaliation. His hair was cropped and I failed. He resoundingly slapped me and stunned me.\n \n He absolutely must have been carefully schooled in how to discipline women and over power them.\n \n He then drew out a very large screwdriver and threatingly thrust it at my appendix. I did not at that point relish having an appendectomy performed with a large, unsanitary screwdriver so I quit struggling. He strong-armed me into his vehicle.\n \n He forced me to perform fellatio on him.\n \n \"Get me up and get me off!\" he threatened.\n \n Just then a car drove up. He instantly started the car. The bastard was even going to kidnap me! I started screaming as loudly as I could.\n \n He could not stand it.\n \n \"Get out, Bitch!\"\n \n You damned right I got out and the bastard drove away.\n \n After I got over my terror I was very angry.\n \n Who the hell treats women in this way?\n \n I had never encountered such bastardly behavior in all my life.\n \n I was angry for weeks, if not months.\n \n If a man looked at me, I growled at him and he drew away in terror.\n \n A ragingly angry woman is frightening to men who do not respect women.",

   "Mmmmm. Where to begin?\n \n Some of what Ms. Simone says \"was\" true. It has changed somewhat. However, the Hickville I live in isn't much different from the 1970's. The way a woman, or girl, dresses still implies \"sex for hire,\" and often that is still the case. While not all of the styles are meant tht way, some do buy into the fad and offer themselves to the highest bidder. \n \n Example. A few years ago, when the fad of wearing torn jeans filtered through the area, a young girl of maybe 16 years old was in a parking lot wearing said jeans. At first, I didn't pay much attention to her or the males hanging around her. However, as I waited for my charge to leave that night, I noticed she would talk with one guy for a while, he would go to the store and purchase beer or wine, and return. Then, that took positions so that she was hidden from view, from the waist down, and exchanged favors via a stratigic \"rip\" in her jeans. After 30 minutes of this, and perhaps 15 guys from age 14 up, my charge needed escort to the bank and we left. When the police found out about the dealings, they moved in to arrest the victims and offenders (however you want to describe them is open). After that, for the summer, any girl in torn jeans was followed and bothered by only the male police officers. Usually, the girl or woman was a slave to fashion, but it never stopped a reputation from spreading that she was easy. \n \n So, yes. The clothes still make the woman, in the wrong ways. In the city, the prostitutes dress in a certain way so that johns can tell who is who. The unlucky lady who dresses that way is still assumed to be something she is not. It also happens to women who dress like men, \"they're all lesbians,\" and men who do not wear perfectly male clothing. It is hard to change the way people are brought up, if they are right or wrong. My father was one of those who felt that women got what they asked for by dressing slutty. In his day, a naked ankle was a sign, just like smoking. Today, well, I doubt he would consider a nun decently dressed. When this type of male raises another male, sexism and racism cannot help but follow unless the child is able to think for themselves from an early age. \n \n As for the chances of a male acting in a group, it depends on a lot of things. I know a few who would defend a lady with their life, but far more who would stand back, afraid to get involved. Sadly, this includes a number of the police and government types who care more for their jobs and peers than the rights of a single woman. A man, especially a homosexual one, has no rights if he cannot defend himself. A lesser number, even worse, would join in. In their defense, peer pressure and conformity cause the actions, not lack of respect for the victim. They just put themselves in front of a stranger's welfare. In that, I would guess that 90% of American men have been taught that by dear ol' dad and the money making racket. Where violence rules, morals rarely follow hand in hand. \n \n I agree with the idea that male control is a factor in female abuse. It is less so when women have control, historically, but can still happen. Any time someone has control over another, abuse can become common. Studies have been done that show that \"controllers\" abuse \"inmates\" repeatedly, no matter which role they have. In real life, it happens the same way. Inmates in prison are often abused by the controllers, including rape. When the inmates get control away from the controllers, they tend to return the favors they have suffered. This happened with the Nazi Party also. The abused took control, abused, and then were abused by the victors. \n \n By the way, women do rape women, men rape men, and not always with their bodies. Women do rape men. Most men I have met say that they wouldn't mind, but I think that is macho talk. While an aggressive female can be fun, being forced to have sex is not, and there is a difference. In high school, a friend of mine was raped by the football team because he was suspected of being gay and they thought he would like it. While he was gay, rape is still rape.\n \n American schools tend to teach conformity and group placement more than anything else. Even today, most women are taught they are less than men. I knew a school girl who was being bothered by a group of boys during lunch. She came home and told her mother about it and was basically told to accept it, it was her place. The next day the boy put his hand down her jeans and joked about it. She told the teacher and it was brushed aside. She told the guy in charge of the school (acting) and he laughed, basically saying the same thing her mother did. As a friend of her mother, I asked what was wrong and she told me. I suggested the chain she followed with no luck. So, I showed her how to break the boy's arm when he did that again. Needless to say, he tried his game again. She told him to remove his hand, and he didn't. She applied pressure and asked again. He didn't. A little more and she told him to remove it. When he didn't, she broke it. He got what he asked for. She was expelled. I got a call from her mother, upset about it. When I spoke with the school board, they were very understanding when I said that I would be willing to have an investigation done as to why she broke his arm. Needless to say, the story changed and she was allowed back to school. The teacher and acting director were fired. It was a shame she had to use force to defend herself, but sometimes change needs to be fought for. \n \n I have seen classes where women are taught to \"defend\" themselves from rapists. About 75% of it is based at not being where they can be raped. Great idea, shame it doesn't always work. A husband can rape his wife. A date can rape his date. It doesn't make it right because you didn't aviod the situation. And yes, they did use the excuse that marriage was a \"rule\" for sex. It was, and still is in some areas, felt that men pay for their wives by taking them into their homes, paying them for food, clothes, and so on, and they should get \"free sex\" back as part of the agreement. This has gone on for ages. Only recently has it started to change, with much shame to the male who is forced to take it to court. Never mind the woman's feelings. \n \n Simply put, we need more change. If a woman, or man, is attacked, s/he should be able and allowed to use whatever force available to defend themselves. If a man wants oral sex via rape, bite it off. Tear his eyes out, burst his eardrums, or do whatever it takes to get away. They say it will make it worse. Maybe. But rapists rarely use protection, so STD's are likely anyway. Today, rapists and others use murder to keep themselves out of jail and prison, so defending yourself only makes sense to me. It isn't PC and most men sicken at the thought of being harmed this way, but very few consider the woman, or man, who is the victim. You may end up in court for what you do, but it is going to be hard to explain how a member was lost during romantic relations, far moreso than just simple rape where the man's defense is it was \"just sex, not rape.\" \n \n Sorry if I offend anyone in MY opinions. I have looked into too many eyes of living victims and see far too many dead ones to ignore the issues. Even one 16-year-olds eyes were too many then, and the list isn't growing any shorter.",

   "[QUOTE][QUOTE]\nMmmmm. Where to begin?\n \n Some of what Ms. Simone says \"was\" true. It has changed somewhat. However, the Hickville I live in isn't much different from the 1970's. The way a woman, or girl, dresses still implies \"sex for hire,\" and often that is still the case. While not all of the styles are meant tht way, some do buy into the fad and offer themselves to the highest bidder. \n\n \n In some (maybe even a lot) places there are still some people that still believe this (hell, I've seen some on this forum) but I think its an ever decreasing number. Thankfully. (however,I'm speaking of in the US in other parts of the world it is much worse) \n \n \nExample. A few years ago, when the fad of wearing torn jeans filtered through the area, a young girl of maybe 16 years old was in a parking lot wearing said jeans. At first, I didn't pay much attention to her or the males hanging around her. However, as I waited for my charge to leave that night, I noticed she would talk with one guy for a while, he would go to the store and purchase beer or wine, and return. Then, that took positions so that she was hidden from view, from the waist down, and exchanged favors via a stratigic \"rip\" in her jeans. After 30 minutes of this, and perhaps 15 guys from age 14 up, my charge needed escort to the bank and we left. When the police found out about the dealings, they moved in to arrest the victims and offenders (however you want to describe them is open). After that, for the summer, any girl in torn jeans was followed and bothered by only the male police officers. Usually, the girl or woman was a slave to fashion, but it never stopped a reputation from spreading that she was easy. \n \n So, yes. The clothes still make the woman, in the wrong ways. In the city, the prostitutes dress in a certain way so that johns can tell who is who. The unlucky lady who dresses that way is still assumed to be something she is not. It also happens to women who dress like men, \"they're all lesbians,\" and men who do not wear perfectly male clothing. It is hard to change the way people are brought up, if they are right or wrong. My father was one of those who felt that women got what they asked for by dressing slutty. In his day, a naked ankle was a sign, just like smoking. Today, well, I doubt he would consider a nun decently dressed. When this type of male raises another male, sexism and racism cannot help but follow unless the child is able to think for themselves from an early age.\n\n \n A person is not slave to their parents beliefs and we should spread a message of respect for women to help combat these antiquated beliefs.\n \n \n \nAs for the chances of a male acting in a group, it depends on a lot of things. I know a few who would defend a lady with their life, but far more who would stand back, afraid to get involved. Sadly, this includes a number of the police and government types who care more for their jobs and peers than the rights of a single woman. A man, especially a homosexual one, has no rights if he cannot defend himself. A lesser number, even worse, would join in. In their defense, peer pressure and conformity cause the actions, not lack of respect for the victim. They just put themselves in front of a stranger's welfare. In that, I would guess that 90% of American men have been taught that by dear ol' dad and the money making racket. Where violence rules, morals rarely follow hand in hand. \n\n \n Your numbers are way off and your comment is a bit sexist isn't it?\n \n \n \nI agree with the idea that male control is a factor in female abuse. It is less so when women have control, historically, but can still happen. Any time someone has control over another, abuse can become common. Studies have been done that show that \"controllers\" abuse \"inmates\" repeatedly, no matter which role they have. In real life, it happens the same way. Inmates in prison are often abused by the controllers, including rape. When the inmates get control away from the controllers, they tend to return the favors they have suffered. This happened with the Nazi Party also. The abused took control, abused, and then were abused by the victors. \n\n \n You can see this demonstrated very clearly in the govts. of other countries. Mexico for instance followed this pattern for years. My wife has told me of the abuses by the PRI when they were in charge. When the PAN took over (largely on the anti-corruption issue) they began doing the exact same thing immediately. Its important to break the cycle.\n \n \n \nBy the way, women do rape women, men rape men, and not always with their bodies. Women do rape men. Most men I have met say that they wouldn't mind, but I think that is macho talk. While an aggressive female can be fun, being forced to have sex is not, and there is a difference. In high school, a friend of mine was raped by the football team because he was suspected of being gay and they thought he would like it. While he was gay, rape is still rape.\n\n \n As a man, I can difinitively say that there are tons of women I wouldn't have sex with even if I wasn't married. If one of them somehow forced me to have sex with them, it would be rape.\n \n \n \nAmerican schools tend to teach conformity and group placement more than anything else. Even today, most women are taught they are less than men. I knew a school girl who was being bothered by a group of boys during lunch. She came home and told her mother about it and was basically told to accept it, it was her place. The next day the boy put his hand down her jeans and joked about it.

Needless to say, the story changed and she was allowed back to school. The teacher and acting director were fired. It was a shame she had to use force to defend herself, but sometimes change needs to be fought for. \n\n \n When I was in school, about 80%+ of the teachers were women. I always thought that I noticed favoritism toward the girl but maybe that's because I was a guy.\n \n \nI have seen classes where women are taught to \"defend\" themselves from rapists. About 75% of it is based at not being where they can be raped. Great idea, shame it doesn't always work. A husband can rape his wife. A date can rape his date.

This has gone on for ages. Only recently has it started to change, with much shame to the male who is forced to take it to court. Never mind the woman's feelings. \n\n \n I think the 'not being where she can get raped' is meant as keep an eye on your surroundings and try to avoid 'bad' areas. The same applies to me not walking through certain areas at night because of the probability I will be attacked and robbed. The idea that a woman can say no to her husband has been around for a very long time. I know of no place where a woman can't say no to sex from her husband. If a husband goes ahead and takes it, he is subject to all rape laws.\n \n \nSimply put, we need more change. If a woman, or man, is attacked, s/he should be able and allowed to use whatever force available to defend themselves.\n\n \n I believe they DO have the right to defend themselves.\n \n \n If a man wants oral sex via rape, bite it off.

It isn't PC and most men sicken at the thought of being harmed this way, but very few consider the woman, or man, who is the victim.\n \n \n Most men would agree that a rapist DESERVES to have it cut/bitten off.\n \n \n You may end up in court for what you do, but it is going to be hard to explain how a member was lost during romantic relations, far moreso than just simple rape where the man's defense is it was \"just sex, not rape.\" \n\n \n In most cases (assult, rape, robbery) it is better to KILL your attacker so there is no other version of events to be told!\n \n \nSorry if I offend anyone in MY opinions. I have looked into too many eyes of living victims and see far too many dead ones to ignore the issues. Even one 16-year-olds eyes were too many then, and the list isn't growing any shorter.\n\n \n I think you are dead on on most of it. I would however, say that you seem a overly ready to lump all (or most) men into a group that they don't deserve to be in. Making broad assumptions about any 'group' based on how they were born is rarely advisable or accurate.",

   "Well, I have been a male for well over 40 years. Of the thousands I have met, very few are really different enough for me to even think about leaving a young lady alone with. \n \n I am sorry to say that I have had the chance to listen to police talk about their cases, as well as sit in on gatherings of soldiers, criminals, and even hate groups of various natures. Generally, the more education a man has, the better he treats a woman. That could be read as the more manly the man, the more stupid he is. This also seems to have an attractive effect included. The smarter the male, the less attractive he is to the female. Not always 100% true, but man seems to have evolved little in the last few thousand years. \n \n Self defense, in the US and abroad, is a joke. Owning a firearm makes you a felon today. Trust me, I know. I made the mistake of going to a range one day and had a dirty cop show up. Instead of doing his job, he charged me with mulitiple felony charges (for each firearm I owned) and had me locked up. The fact that they were all legal, used in my employment, and that I HAD to practice to keep my permits up didn't matter, to him or the dirty judges and prosecutor. Since I wasn't a drinking buddy, I fried. I was also tried for body armor, used on my job, as well as pepper spray and other items that I was cleared to carry on my job. Others have been done this way too. One girl lost her future for their dirty tactics and making a name for themselves. And yet, mentally ill people murder and rape daily, because they waste money on innocent people who would try to follow the law. My network is still going, but I no longer support the police with it. They only seek to hurt the citizens, not protect. They are hated for a reason, and it took me way to long to learn that. If you defend yourself, the job they do not want to do, you will be tried and left hanging for daring to protect yourself. Gangs form for protection. Protection from other gangs and the hostile police forces. This is the same thing happening in El Salvador, Mexico, and other countries. When people are afraid, they defend themselves. \n \n History is written in blood. Sadly, most of it is/was innocent. I thought what I did was right, and that is my sin. I regret the laws I had helped enforce, and have retired, completely. I own nothing. I want nothing. I see people hurt every day and know that I cannot help them. I see young men and women join up to serve, and die, all for lies. I will say so when they ask, but they never do. If I did try to help, I could only hurt their cause because I'm just another crazy old \"-------\" who doesn't know anything. So, when Simone says the TRUTH, I will support her. Maybe some things are off a little. Slick Willie got elected saying he would equalize the gays, when the military could not be changed by one man, but the military only (who has no intent on changing). He did admit to sex outside of marriage, adultery here, but no charges because he, and most, are above the laws we \"slaves\" are forced to follow. I have never met a cop who didn't cheat on his or her spouse. I have never met an honest lawyer, either. But, this isn't what they are paid for. \n \n The fact is, gangs rule because they follow the rules. Might makes right. Only another gang can stand up to another gang. El Salvador is an example. The government and the FMLN fought for 12 years. Just two gangs. In the US, a gang forms and another forms to defend itself from real or imaginary threats. Here, however, we are so mixed that people need more options. The police, just a gang in blue. Reps and Dems, just two more gangs, just not using open violence. They use the police for their work. The bloodshed, just like El Sal, fighting when talking and respect won't work. The FMLN and the government in El Sal have cut back on violence. Iraq, basically the same. Even the US is set up on that idea. We can voice our issues and have them addressed, talking, or desolve the government when they fail (Civil war) and fight it out. England didn't listen, so the US broke off and fought to be free. Women, stood up and demanded the right to vote. What happened? Blacks, finally stood up and fought for their freedom (regardless of side which they took). Gays? Well, they are fighting with their voices, but against a lot of other groups who are siding against them (to deny them the same freedom that others enjoy). When a lone person stands up, he is often shut up and put in place by a gang, holding force over his or her head. President Obama, right or wrong, called the police wrong, he was forced to back off on his call because they, united, stood up against him. His call was, in my experience, right. Far too many cops are racist, and sexist, but that is for YOU to decide. America works on a supported idea. Being quiet, you agree. Speaking out, you are heard. \n \n We do not need guns or violence here. Sit down and discuss things. I was taught that one \"man's\" rights end where another's begin. America has lost that idea. A man can rape a woman because... Sex is not a given. If you see it as an item to purchase, pay a hooker who is willing to let you rent her for a while. Which is worse? Prostitution or rape? Decide. Navada has legal prostitution and few complain. Treat others with respect, even if you disagree, and try to live together without killing each other. \n \n The funny thing is, all of the religions in the world actually try to help others. However, most use violence and force to spread the word they teach. We fight over who is right or wrong, but don't look at the whole picture. No matter what you claim, it is about living together without doing some things, for the security of the whole. Why can't two groups agree not to mess with the other, and live, instead of killing each other to win and achieve the same goal? Somehow, I find it really messed up that a person can walk through a village torn apart, with dead bodies everywhere, and feel proud that his or her \"peaceful\" religion is the cause for the raped and murdered bodies of women, men, and children scattered about. To me, at least, that is a major psychological issue that far too many seem to enjoy.",

   "It is so nice to find people who can think for a change. I really need to move. :)\n \n War has been a reason to rape, or an excuse, forever. Way back, victors would rape men and women who lost the battle, for many reasons. One, simply to prove that the victor \"owned\" them. Often, the extra was that a woman, or a girl, could have a child of mixed background, which was an insult and an attempt to destroy the race of the loser. Also, just like today, locals would take the chance to rape a local girl, if it came about. Today, men use alcohol and drugs to subdue women, and men, to rape. Most of the time, the poor woman just assumes it is fun and games (drinking and having fun, not the rape) and the man just sees the chance and pounces when she passes out. And no, I don't exclude gays, I have known a few who would get their date drunk or high and move in just as quick as a straight guy on a girl. Predators come in all genders and races. \n \n Most people would disagree about the nature of rape. They see it only as an attack, aggression, violence, and so on. The problem I have is that violence is not always the means to the end. A man who gets a teen drunk to have sex with is not using violence, though he may be trying to \"own\" her by taking her sexually. In war, it may be about wiping a race out, but just using the woman as a means to attack her group, family, or religion. In my classes, in college, it was pushed that races did not rape members of other races. I hate to disagree with men of science, but they have, do and will continue to do so. During the civil war in the US, Yankee troops often raped white and black women in the South, even though they were to \"rescue\" the slaves. Often, the forced the Blacks to work in bordellos, or join the Army, since they were \"less than human.\" Yes, the South did also. The Nazi Party, for all of their hatred of many groups, spared no chance to \"have fun\" with women who were to be killed anyway. And yes, US soldiers did the same, just like in all the other wars. Today, gang members often have no issue raping a member of another gang, or non-gang member, who is of a different race. As a whole, most do not. But, there are some who break the unspoken rules in every group and give them all a bad name. A while back some US soldiers raped a Japanese minor, and it was quite a scandal when it leaked out (as they would have liked it to stay unknown). Almost always, the woman \"asked for it,\" when it gets to court. Uh, most men do not change. \n \n As for me, yeah. I guess you could say that (about being two people). I'm not, but \"in another life,\" I was very different than I am now. I am trying to come to terms with \"both\" parts of me, after a very complicated few years. My late wife could attest that I can be a very gentle, loving creature. However, she also knew that a darker side of me was inside. As a kid, I was unsure and timid. Since that is what is expected of me, I play that game. But, the part my wife saw was very different. When a \"friend\" put our family in danger, he was told to leave. Had he not, friendship or not, he would have been removed. Another tried to rape a girl he was with, and I was there also. They had an fight and she turned to me. She hated me greatly, but she agreed to go with me, even walking back to town. When he reached for his gun, she got behind me and hid. He realized that, if he moved that way, I would have shot him flat out. He left. I tend to live and let live. However, never ask me to decide between a \"friendship\" and someone's life or rights, because I will defend them, 100%. I have been chewed out many times by higher ups for risking my life to do something stupid like that, but I have, and will continue to, made a choice I can live with. I freely admit I'm a nobody. I have stood up to police and others. Many times I have been tried for my actions and the system says that I was wrong for treating people the way I thought they should be. In college, I earned my grades while most got them by being cops or future cops, and the instructor was a former cop. I often stand alone, and have been punished for that. I do not care who or what a person is. To me, they have equal rights like I do. I have stopped a prostitutes husband from beating her up. He got mad, but I held my ground. I have had many chances to be scum or do anything I wanted to do, but I did what I thought was right, even if it turned out to be wrong in the end. \n \n So, yes. I do often act very different. What I feel and what I do often conflict. A rapist or child molester, to me, should not live. But, the law decides that, not me. I WILL stop him, if I can. Hopefully, the victim can get away before he attacks them. If not, he will kill me or I will do anything to save them from him. Prison is nothing. A mental ward, is nothing. That one life, to me, means a lot more than what happens to me. That is the way I was raised, taught, and continue. I am not better than anyone. One girl, 16-years-old, changed my life one day, by dying needlessly. No one cared. Was she raped? What happened? I don't know. I just know that I did not do everything I could have to have saved her life, because it was \"not my place\" to. The doctors, were afraid of being sued. The \"police,\" enjoyed looking at her nude body, and beating people for information. Her friends, hid because they were afraid of what might happen. Most of the people around were more afraid of what people would say, think, or do than about her life. I was a young, foolish, FNG who would not dare to disobey a superior officer. If I had, she might have survived. Even the pilot wouldn't fly in because it was \"too dangerous.\" And yet, many more pilots flew in to \"hot zones\" and storms for their friends or under orders. So, I decided then what I would do. I have been shot and punished for my actions. The US courts are more than willing to try me for anything they can (after all, it is about money and not justice), but I still put those eyes before my own thoughts of selfishness. After all, I have lived through much worse than a little prison or nuthouse. Under US law, I am not even a person. I am a convicted felon. No rights. No freedoms. No \"voting.\" I didn't even a lawyer to \"defend\" me. He just sat there for $4k. Under the state law, I'm not even allowed to have sex, drink, or decide things about my own life. Basically, I don't exist. In one fell swipe they destroyed years of college, training, service, and life. They don't care. They just want their cushy jobs secure. If you are raped, murdered, or whatever, the US courts do not care. Every conviction is money from the Federal Goverment. Most crimes are nothing. Speeding, 100% profit for the locality. If they lie in court, who knows? They are beyond that, and you are expected to. It is really funny, if you think about it. Its all a game. Words, and everything. \n \n So, sometimes I get bored or tired of the games. We complain about El Salvador, Iraq, or other countries, and the very same stuff is going on here. When someone speaks out, there are suddenly voices to shut him or her up, as if they want to ignore it. Maybe they do. I mean, as long as it is someone else in another place, it isn't \"real.\" But, for me, it is very real. The kid in me thinks one thing, the man thinks another. I wish it was like it was as a kid, but it isn't. \n \n Pretty screwed up, huh? emoticon_wow",

   "I really don't know bro. Really don't know. \n \n \n What were you in for?\n\n \n This is funny, really. My high school reunion was coming up and they kept \"stalking\" me to agree to come. After about three months of endless phone calls, letters, emails, and being stopped on the street, I finally told them to leave me alone. Just to act like I had died with my wife and never bother me again. I didn't think anything about it since I didn't threaten them or myself, or so I thought. About two weeks later, the local branch of the Nazi Party showed up and \"questioned\" about it. My big mistake was that I was headed to the doctor and then to the firing range near there to practice like I did every Spring. I laid the 1911-A1 on my desk and answered the door. Mr. Nazi demanded in, so I told him I had a pistol on the desk and thought I was being \"nice\" by not just shoving it in his face. I was wrong. \n \n After they had me \"detained,\" they returned and raided my home. There, they found some \"illegal weapons\" in my locker (like we are supposed to keep them locked up) and a \"weapon of mass distruction.\" The \"weapon\" was a flare launcher, often used in boating areas to launch a large flare, smoke, or even rope to another boat, all when in distress. I actually insult the Nazi Party by calling them Nazis, because they were far more aggressive and stupid than the originals. They first called it a \"Thumper,\" a street/Nam term for an M-79 grenade launcher, out of date since the 1970's. Even if it had been, they can fire flares and were only illegal with explosive rounds present. They \"forgot\" that the police use these same \"weapons\" in crowd control, and that the M-79 is actually a 40mm and not a 37mm, like what they use. Anyway. A year later I had a trial on multiple charges (assault rifles, grenade launcher, etc.). My attorney then, bailed on court day, so the judge agreed to give me time to find another. Another $4K later, and a few months, and this snake bailed saying that they \"knew the law too well\" and he couldn't argue with them. He did this as I was standing before the freaking judge. Needless to say, no defense and I was fried. The truth was that my \"defense\" was married to a Jewish woman, though he was not Jewish, and the officer was bucking to move up in rank. Well, Nazi and Jew, you get the idea. Either the lawyer played along or his wife would find out how hard it is to live with the KKK having police contacts. \n \n Yes, I COULD have been my own defense. However, in this police state, someone who has a \"mental illness,\" which can be something as minor as depression, is not allowed to defend themselves. Nice law, huh? So, having combat related PSTD AND Depression, I was double hexed. \n \n I did attempt to complain. Each \"tick\" in office that my area had, I wrote. This included ones I had known since childhood, as well as those I did not. I also wrote various agencies that claimed to protect citizens from police abuse and so on. Those who \"investigate\" the police, said their actions were legal and never said another word. The \"ticks,\" one half responded to get a lawyer and the other half didn't even bother to respond. \n \n Life in the US, I found, is no different than in El Salvador, or many other places around the world. When the terrorists are in office and supported by others, the only crimes are those they determine, not that are drafted and agreed to. Our local police act in much the same ways as the ES Death Squads did (and probably still do to some extent). People disappear suddenly and turn up later. The difference, in the US, alive after being in mental wards or jails, and ES in craters listed as \"deceased.\" Sometimes, I wonder if those bodies we find along the roads and back lots aren't victims of police backed death squads, as they are usually women, black, or some other group that is targeted by the police. \n \n My time was nothing. Even less compared to the guys who have done nothing and been sent up for decades. Sure, there are some murderers locked up, but even between them, some actions were completely legal (self defense) and they just got time because they were black, Asian, Hispanic, or whatever. Most women I have met, did time for killing a husband who abused/raped them, or something along that line. By far, drug charges made up the majority of crime. The laws broken were minor, if the US got money in taxes for the sells. Alcohol is legal, and taxed, and is sold by the state. Dope, illegal because it is cheaper to import than make and taxes aren't enough. I do not approve of drugs, but handle that by not using them. If you can legally get drunk, why not high? Punish the crimes done under the influence and not the use, when you have double standards. But, that is the way things are set up. A cop can rape a girl and get by with it. Another guy can, and he gets time. A judge can be busted for DUI, and gets nothing. A regular Joe gets it, and he's in jail or prison for time, plus other things. I knew one cop who cased places out so that his wife could rob then while the owners were gone. Another attacked people, using the court system, to impress women or for revenge, and was finally found insane, but his cases were never reversed or re-heard. Others lie in court, a crime for us, but keep on going without correction. They also will not write each other tickets for \"minor stuff\" but will bust you or I for it. One gay cop was fired and charged for being with a minor (a month short of his birthday) and they admitted that had it been a straight cop with a GIRL, it would have been overlooked quicker. As anyone inside can tell you, it is a game. I was always told that \"everyone says they are innocent\" by a cop. Wrong. I never met one who denied the charges on him. They just disagreed on the facts. Most, like me, agree that we screwed up. But, the resulting action was out of place for the \"crime\" done. Owning a flare launcher is not a crime, but the way they twist the laws around, makes it an illegal weapon, weapon of mass destruction, or sawed-off shotgun, when the ATF clearly state, as if they are gods, that it is not a \"Weapon.\" When the police cannot use the actual laws, they twist or make up some so that they can still charge someone. \n \n Yes, sometimes it is about race, sex, or religion. But they never say that openly. They can use hate to fuel their attacks, but they use the laws to punish and get income. You are punished for being a black, woman, or whatever. Each conviction gets a reward by the system, in grants or funding by a higher up. They do not count how it is obtained, or if it is reversed. Just when YOU go to court, and the judge bangs that gavel down on \"guilty.\" That is like a cash register dinging as money flows into the coffers. If the cop busts a person for personal reasons, racial, or whatever, the conviction STILL makes money, looks good, and the \"criminal\" is branded. Nope, never saw a single quota book in any crusier I rode in (on either side of the partition). But, I did see the system at work. The cops use blackmail, threats, or whatever they need to in order to convict. Higher ups, like the prez, may never know what is going on down on the street. In college, the instructor had porn on his computer, even while he lectured against it to his classes. Double standards?\n \n If you are a threat to them, look for double trouble. Those who see the system and won't play along, are tagged and will NEVER see a badge on their chest. Women, put out or get out. Blacks, hold that \"uncle tom\" role and do not dare step out. Gays, better hide that. And that isn't my opinions only. One came from a DEA agent, now deceased. Another, from a black man who was working in another agency, who is also deceased. Mrs. DEA saw the racist, sexist cult at work. She was married to a black man and was, of course, a woman. Maybe we are all biased, but it is funny that we all go out the same way.\n \n Oh, that reminds me. I have had lawyers tell me that a plea agreement is your best hope. However, in class, we were taught that a plea agreement, made by the state, is an iffy game. The state may or may not have a case, and they are playing on the plea to get you to accept conviction (CHING) and they will \"Let you off\" on a lesser charge. The only reason I remember this today, is my cousin just said that he got less time by standing up and telling the court to stick the plea than his girlfriend who chose to accept it did. The funny thing, her charge was resisting arrest while DUI, and his was DUI, resisting arrest, obstuction of justice, and so on. She is a diabetic and will spend time in jail, and he is healthy, has done time, and doesn't serve any for this charge. This isn't a rule that I know of, but something to think about when they offer a plea agreement. \n \n Yep, I know someone will call me names and say I'm lying. Not a problem. I hope I am wrong that the US has sunk this far. But, in a post before, I said that MOST men would join in on a rape or watch without doing anything. How do I know? Uh, like I have been the one to stand up to them. Even in a class of future cops, few have held that view when it came down to the street. In psych tests, my minor, a lot of people would TORTURE another person because they were told to do so, and someone else was taking the blame if something happened. I wish I hadn't trashed my text books, but since they were used against me in court, I decided to get rid of them before another round with the courts. However, if you search the net long enough, or hit a college library, I'm sure you can find the tests the shrinks did back in the 1960's and before. \n \n So, I would like to think my fellow man would not do some of the things I have seen, but the truth is they do. It doesn't matter what a man looks like, as to what type of man he is. But, the better looking or more macho he is, the less likely he is to have a mind of his own, and use it, than to be a follower in the crowd. What makes a man, or woman, is growing up and understanding that things change. You may be beautiful one day, and ugly the next from an accident, but the real you never changes. Looks, clothes, sex, these things do not alter the person. Experiences do. Most people never grow up, they stay fixed at an age where life is simple. In this, Siggy was right. Oh, and it was he who implied that a man's weapon was related to the size of his \"manhood.\" Most men are insecure and tend to brag about what they have. However, I know for a fact that the men who don't usually have accepted the fact that they have what they have and don't let it bother them. Oddly, these chaps also have bigger packages than the others, regardless of race or attraction. emoticon_smile",

   "I'd have to agree with Sin here. I don't have much life experience, but from what little experience I do have, I have learned that people are D*cks. I blame it on bad parenting. Parents these days cannot raise a kid if their life depended on it. Most kids end up in jail as violent felons, or become cops who take their scarred past out on their victims. Parents really need to start raising their children better, because our society is rapidly deteriorating due to their idiocy. If you don't think you can be a good parent, don't have kids. Simple as that. I'd have to say out of 5 separate kids, 4 of them will be no good because of poor parenting.",

   "Shooter, I have to admit, I hadn't thought of that angle. I mean, I see it every day, kids with abused pasts \"going bad,\" but never thought about the cops having abusive parents/families. \n \n I know that studies have been done, on civies, military, and police, and most that have violent family life as children tend to pass that on to their children when they have kids. But then, something as simple as football has been cited as causing violence in people, so it could just be something the person wanted to see in his or her test more than any related factor. I mean, I was raised on westerns, D&D, violent cartoons, and horror movies, and never killed anyone who was just walking down the street or something innocent (like most do today). Yes, I know that could read another way, and I intend that for the men and women who have fought in wars and those who have used force in self-defense, because I feel that the people, who were killed/died, started the action that ended their life which is different from a person eating or whatever and is killed by someone for no reason. I have talked to some men who have fought and they say that the first time they hurt or killed someone has stayed with them, regardless of how justified, and others say that it was cool/fun/whatever, and show an enjoyment of it, which shows how different we are, regardless of who we are or how we were raised. \n \n However, I have to disagree on one point. Many of the people I know, who are felons, have actually done little, or nothing, \"wrong\" to be branded as such. If someone is killed in a confrontation, it depends on the system as to if they are or are not a felon. Given two identical situations, but with a black and a white defendant, one can get life in prison and a felony charge, and another not even get fined. Unlike what we \"pretend\" happens, a lot of it boils down to the judge, lawyers, jury, and even more so, the RACE of the accused. We assume the judge knows what is going on, but in truth, they may not know much more than the jury does. Few are really experts in weapons, forensics, and other details that the jury relies on experts for. I mean, most assume that an \"assult rifle\" is the same if owned by a civilian or a soldier (in the military) but few actually know the laws that restrict what a civilian can actually own. Some think the looks of the weapon related to its ability to kill, but few know that most hunting rifles are far more lethal than the \"assult rifle\" that replaced them on the battle field, or even why. I've even met one judge who thought that a bullet could change course after it was fired, by 360 degrees, repeatedly! emoticon_wow Anyone should know that a bullet must react to the laws of physics like any other object, and even guided missles cannot change correction with such accuracy (or how could a jet avoid them). \n \n While parents could be guilty of a lot of things, sometimes it is just survival or hatred that changes a person. Most recognize that the Jewish people were murdered so by the Nazi Party because they were Jewish, and not for a crime or something that they were often accused of. Here, in the US, a black man gets a harsher sentence than a white often because he is black. The logic is that all blacks are trash, even if we don't say it. I wish I could say it wasn't, but most whites, raised in the states, were taught that. I know I was, and it took a long time to realize that I was even doing it, though I tried not to. I don't know about others who have been raised in better areas (racially), but many of the people I met have been taught that. Likewise, many of the blacks have been taught that whites are dangerous, and I wonder why? We may joke and kid each other as friends about such stuff, the truth is that it still goes on today and infects the \"system\" and how we are treated. When President Obama took office, I heard many whites complain that now was our time to be slaves. They felt that a black man would, actually, hate all whites because of what had been done to all of the black people, and not just himself. If nothing else, I think that his time in office may prove to many that not everyone hates someone based on color of skin, even if they have been abused themselves. \n \n Also, without thinking, we assume that people from some areas are less than others. We often assume that all blacks belong to gangs, when the truth is that they don't any more than \"all\" whites or any other group does. Even if they do belong to a gang, we have to understand that membership isn't 100%about criminal activity, even though the police and government wants us to think that. Part of being a human being is understanding how to survive. We are quick to say that blacks had the first gangs, but the truth is that it has been going on for a very long time. Blacks were, however, able to adapt a very basic tactic to modern life. The first gang, you could say, was the police agency that forced the blacks to stand together for protection. The police, as a gang, began to focus on blacks during the 1960's, with the Civil Rights movement. The black people, then, formed their own \"gang\" to protect themselves. This filtered down to the two groups who became the \"Bloods\" and the \"Crips.\" (Alphabetically, no other reason) Biker gangs, before that, basically the same thing, except on scooters/hogs or whatever you want to call a motorcycle. No matter where you look, you have a group who form together, based on a common bond, to protect themselves. Money, a common need, is just an item to obtain, to extend protection, and earning it by the best and most effective means. True, some people do great violence to others, which gives everyone in that group a bad reputation. But, again, not all are bad. They are just trying to survive in a very hostile world that, they percieve, to them is \"out to get them.\" We can say it isn't, in the safety of our living rooms, but it is very different on the streets when almost everyone seems set on using or abusing you. \n \n I am not making excuses for any of groups out there who are criminals. However, there is a difference between the person who kills for the thrill of the kill, and the one who must in order to survive, or protect his or her family and friends. We call gang violence that because we do not want to accept that they are \"at war.\" As long as someone attacks them, for whatever reason, they will retaliate. Is the US any better or worse? Think about 9/11. Terrorists (we call them) attacked US, so we declared war on \"terrorists.\" Who did it didn't really matter. It doesn't to the lowly gang involved either. They were attacked, and that demands action. Every war \"we\" have ever fought was bascially a gang on gang attack. In prison, it isn't any different. A bunch of men of such and such group band together to protect themselves from another bunch of men. We can make all sorts of theories about who and why, but we are just fooling ourselves. The fools are the ones who think they are in control, when it is really the smart gang members who survive the XXXX we dump on them, just like they do in the streets. \n \n In short, all we're doing is creating a name for someone who is different from us somehow. I have very few friends. Mostly because I am a \"felon.\" Admit it, when you hear that, do you not tremble inside assuming I have murdered or raped dozens of people? If you do, you're not alone. Most of the cops I know are near pi$$ing their pants when they see me because of that. It isn't anything bad. They just believe the XXXX about a grenade launcher and assume that if I know how to use one, had one, and so on, that I'm a dangerous threat to them, their families, the nation, and the world in general. The truth is, I'm safer than their wives are, who are cheating on them on the Internet with dozens of men, any one of whom could have AIDS or dangerous STD. I'm safer than most of the cops they work with because I won't kill them for drug money or a cut on some deal that they may decide to get a part of. Almost any Veteran in the US, of any war and from any nation, can do as much as, if not a lot more, that I can do. And trust me, they have had more XXXX dumped on them by a lot more people and have more reason than I do. However, 99% of these unheard men and women love this country a hell of a lot more than those sitting in the government, fearing every day that they will lose their cushy jobs, fancy cars, and million dollar homes. For that matter, I would really hate to think what would happen if all of us worthless felons, vets, and others who love this nation equally as much would do if some nation really messed with us like in World War 1 and 2. Most of those guys in Iraq today, will be somewhere in the system tomorrow. When they come back home, where will they go? Where will they work? Who will greet them? \n \n I was lucky, really. I've had XXXX dumped on me all of my life, like most have. But, I learned one thing. I'm not any different from anyone else on the planet. I eat, drink, XXXX, think, love, feel, and everything, just like anyone else. I even hate like others do. But, I give everyone a chance. That is something that 75% of the US doesn't do. No, I don't have that in writing. I just know it by the way people act. Very few people act on pure hatred. A rapist, a cold blooded killer, a racist, but not the average guy on the street. The gang member who wastes a rival gang member is probably more on revenge or survival that pure hate. I mean, he could very well be a member of his gang if his skin, nation, religion or whatever was the same. But, he sides with an enemy. In war, how many really know their enemies and how many just do what they have to do? \n \n I was raised in a good, honest, law abiding family where all the men served in the military, worked hard, had families and kids, and passed this mentality down to their kids. I'm told I'm smarter than any of them before me. They taught me right from wrong. There was no logical reason for me to become a \"felon.\" And yet, I am. I could hate blacks, or any group, but I don't. One of my closest friends, who I trust with my life, is black. My family hated that, but I don't care. Another is gay, big deal. Last time I checked, we all loved our mates, kids, felt anger, ate food, drank water, took a dump, and lived just like the others. I heard a report one night about a gang of girls in some city, who had sex with all of the male gang members in order to belong. Some commented that it was sick, or they were sluts/whores, and so on. The women seemed really offended. And yet, they have had the same number of lovers, or more, for other reasons. The female gang members joined a group that would, on some level, protect them. But, the women I know, were often abused by the very ones they had sex with. Maybe I am scum/trash/whatever this government says I am. I won't disagree. I have done things in the past that I am ashamed of, sure. Who hasn't. But, I know better men and women sitting in prison and free who are a thousand times better than those who judge us, and have never served a day behind bars for anything. Some of these people are cops, lawyers, judges, priests, and who knows what else, and they have raped, murdered, stolen, and even worse crimes than most of those in prison, and they are upstanding, \"law abiding,\" role models of our communities. So, where is the problem? A parent can't raise their kid without one of these \"role models\" telling them how to, even if they have never had a kid or knows how to get one. We teach our kids to grow up and \"be like someone,\" and who do we give them to copy? Athelets who cheat, rape, and do drugs? Presidents who do drugs, cheat, and start wars for personal reasons? Cops who use and sell as many drugs as they take off the streets, often the same ones? Cops who abuse and torture their wives, for fun or because they were caught cheating, when they have sex with their partners and interns? Or, maybe they just see a minority alone and shoot and kill him or her before planting a weapon on them and saying it was justified? I mean, we've tossed G-d out of the schools and workplaces because it is offensive to some, and yet the three big religions follow the same principals coming from different people. We preach money endlessly and then blame them when they earn in in ways that we don't approve of. We push sex day and night, from the cartoons to XXX porn and use it to sell everything under the sun, including ways to keep from getting pregnant or make it better. I'm glad I'm old and unwanted. I would hate to think that I had to figure out what was right and wrong, plus grow up mentally, physically and sexually today, with everyone saying that everyone else is wrong. And then, if a person does make a mistake, we label them FOR LIFE, and claim that they can never change, and never even give them a chance to prove themselves. \n \n Blame? Maybe I am. I mean, don't I have some responciblity in this world? I mean, if I go out and rape a young girl and leave her on the ground, even if I never get caught, aren't I responsible for what happens to her afterwards? Isn't it my kid she carries? What about my STD that I put in her? Or, what about my relation to how she can never trust a man again because of what I did to her? I mean, it was just sex, right? She was born to breed right? It doesn't matter that I forced her to let me in and got her pregnant. She should have used birth control, even if she was a virgin, right? She's too young to be having sex, right? What about the man she may be married to, 20 years down the road, who decides that he has a \"right\" to have sex after work. If she freaks out and kills him because he reminded her of me and how I forced myself on her, it doesn't concern me. What if she's my daughter? Should I just forget she's my child, under 18, who I am supposed to protect and raise? Or, is she my wife? Can I just act like nothing every happened and I can \"tap\" that until I get tired, then blame her for not pleasing my sexually because she doesn't want sex after being raped? Or maybe she's my mother, and I'm the bastard she had to raise? What about my sister? No, I'm not directing this at Shooter. He's just the one who made a point, that I wanted to expand on. If I was a cop, walking the beat, and I came up on a girl who had been raped, would she just be \"my job,\" or something more? Or the soldier in war? Or the priest in the nearby church? In forensics, we learned that every time two people come in contact, they leave some type of trace evidence behind. This can be sperm, hair, skin, or carpet fibre. Well, those wonderful doctors and Phd's forgot that we also influence others emotionally. What is the difference between rape, sex, and love? Last time I checked, though it was several years ago, the same basic act happens. So, what is a victim, client, or lover? Emotions, consent, respect? Well, that happens if I happen to be the next guy a rape victim deals with too. I am responsible for what I do. Maybe I was abused as a child. Maybe I was raped. But, I decide if I rape her, or not. Maybe I decide to take my shirt and put it on her, take her to the hospital, spend time to make sure she (or he) is OK. So, maybe I'm late for work. Maybe I get fired. Was it the first time? Will it be the last? Who needs me more, at that second? Yeah, I've paid for the things I have done, in this life and probably a few others. I have passed up a lot of sex, with younger and older women, sober and drunk. I have had the chance to kill a lot of people, during those years I carried a legal, concealed weapon, on and off the job. But, did I? Even some scum that I know raped a girl, I didn't kill, which was the least I should have done so he wouldn't go on to abuse more women. I may be scum, puke, trash, or whatever society judges me to be. But, I can live with myself, each day. I was taught that I had responsibility to myself, and others. To admit when I was wrong, and not brag when I was right. Maybe I haven't had a lot of sex, but does that matter? I could have raped any girl I wanted to on a date, but I chose to respect her \"no,\" even if it hurt or upset me. Try that with a cop and see how you get treated. If he doesn't arrest you for nothing, you'll be lucky. I've seen them pull their weapons on some because they couldn't handle the insult to their ego, a hangover from their military days of \"destroy, rape, and destroy.\" \n \n I guess what, all these words mean, to me, is that \"I\" have responsibility. I can't shake that. I can say that this or that \"made me do it,\" but I'm just lying to myself, and anyone else who listens. I really did it because I wanted to. I put myself over someone else. Maybe it is screwed up, but that sounds to me like what Christ and the decalog was trying to say in both texts we call the Bible. \"Do unto others,\" means putting someone before me. I would like to think, at least, that is what was meant, so that maybe I won't be tossed aside for trying to follow the \"rules,\" but even if I am, I can only blame myself. If nothing else, maybe that one, lost or hurt, person that I tried to help came off better for what I tried to do, somewhere down the line. I mean, I tried to do what I thought would make things better, for her and me. I know I usually gained by feeling like I tried. But, then maybe that is why I'm \"insane,\" \"crazy,\" and all the other terms that people use instead of my name to refer to me. \n \n Just something tossed out there, to think about...",

   "Just a note, only slightly related to firearms and crime. After the US Supreme Court ruled that the 2nd Amendment WAS about ownership of firearms, how does the private attacks on the firearms owners in the US stand as they continue to pass laws that are unrelated to firearms, but make a person a felon? No felon is allowed to own firearms, but if everyone is either a government stooge (agent, cop, or whatever) or a felon, does it matter what the supreme court decides on the amendment? The NRA and other gun groups claim to represent firearms ownership. But, when they are asked to deal with the increasingly false charges from the courts, siting lack of funding, publicity, etc, they are letting little wins go, even though they \"won\" the big issue that was bait. Not a single gun owner stood up WITH me when I sited the very laws they used against me, because they were afraid that they would target them next. This same tactic has been used by this, and other, governments to keep us divided so that real change cannot occur and single \"attacks\" like President Obama's election can be checked by a single united front against him on issues he promised, making him a liar (to the people) and not risking their jobs. emoticon_wow",

   "Regarding bad parenting: Most of it is not abusive or violent. The parent's just don't know how to raise their kids. An example: I was at work one day cleaning the outside windows near some of the tables (I work at a stylish Frozen yogurt place) and there was a man with a child no older than 4. I presume the man was his father, and he was telling his kid how he was gonna \"beat you [the kid] with my f*cken fist\".\n \n But, most kids with bad parents aren't being abused. They're just not cared for, not wanted, or just not paid attention to. This leaves a huge impression on the kid. My view is this: when you're born, you're a nice moist hunk of clay. The people around you, mostly your parents, mold that clay consciously or unconsciously. As you grow older, that clay gradually begins to harden. All of your experiences in the past contribute to how that clay is molded. Like I said, I'd estimate that only 1/5 of parents mold that clay even close to properly. I'm very lucky to be in that 1/5 group and to have good parents. Most people aren't so lucky. People aren't born better, nicer, or smarter than one another. Their parents make them who they are. If you're a \"decent\" parent, you kid will probably smoke pot, go to a mediocre college if that, and land a low paying but not minimum wage job. If you're a bad parent, your kid will probably be heavily into drugs and in and out of prison. That's why I'm so afraid to have kids when I'm older. I have a friend who's parents are pretty good. They're well off, decent people. I would say they are decent parents. But lately my friend who is becoming more and more distant is starting to do stupid things, like smoking pot and stealing things. He's going down the wrong road and probably doesn't know it even though I've tried to talk sense into him. He has perfectly decent parent's. They're not great parents, they're good parents. That scares the living sh*t out of me. I know plenty of kids who have parents who are ten times worse than my friend's. What are they gonna be like?\n \n This is the world I'm growing up into. And let me tell ya, I'm not looking forward to it.",
