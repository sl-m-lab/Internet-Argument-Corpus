   "I find it ironic that opponents of gay marriage conclude that granting equal marriage rights to gays is a slippery slope for the reason that unrestricted marriage may become the norm when they blatantly ignore the larger slippery slope of ballot box discrimination. If we deny rights to gays, then who is next? Interracial marriage? Jews? Blacks? Women?\n \n What makes them any more deserving of rights. These are sad times in California, especially after the passage of Proposition 8. Minority groups, beware!",
