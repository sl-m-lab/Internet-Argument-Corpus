   "Has anyone found it odd that McCain has moved to the right. I allways thought he was more moderate but after going over his website, he might as well be George W Bush 2. And I understand why as I remembered that, the christianist Marlene Elwell http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070531/31mccain.htm is involved in McCains campaign. This page http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/95b18512-d5b6-456e-90a2-12028d71df58.htm from the McCain's web site looks very similar to this page from Elwells christianist web site http://www.catholicsinthepublicsquare.org/aboutus_history.html What is it with this woman and wanting to deny others there civil rights. \n Maybe I will just have to work harder with the pin on her doll on my voodoo wall.",

   "HOw scarry is this\n \n http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070531/31mccain.htm\n \nThe McCain campaign's Heckman said that, far from exhibiting hostility to religious conservatives, McCain speaks regularly with such prominent evangelical figures as former presidential candidate Gary Bauer, Southern Baptist Convention public policy chief Richard Land, and televangelist John Hagee. Heckman, himself a veteran of Bauer's 2000 presidential campaign, also noted that McCain has hired former Christian Coalition field director Guy Rodgers to help with national religious outreach and Marlys Popma, an evangelical Christian and former head of Iowa Right to Life, as a top Iowa staffer.\n\n \n I hope that the american people can see these people for who they are, enemies of freedom, perpetrators of injustice, and agents of oppression.",
