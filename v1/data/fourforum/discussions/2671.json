The rabbi told me that when I die I will lay in a coffin and my body will decompose and that's that.\n \n Can someone please kindly explain what hell is?\n\n The belief in and of hell is associated with the belief in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: The Creator of all things. If one chooses not to believe in God and deems Him non-existent, then neither does hell exist for them.\n \n If a person believes in God, then, in my opinion, hell is a direction, any direction away from God. It is a gate through which those who do not believe travels and vanishes, which is the second death. It has been said that hell is a place of misery, a place of fire and brimstone where the immortal soul resides eternally in torment, but I don&#8217;t believe in that. Knowing God as I do, He would not permit such pain and agony. However, He will permit those who do not listen to Him, those who fall for a lie, to be completely destroyed. Of course, it&#8217;s our choice which road to take, not His.\n \n Some say that hell is literally and physically in the center of the earth, where many explorers and researches claimed to have heard wailing, and screams and gnashing of teeth. They claim that the hot, molten core of the earth is evidence.\n \n Some say it refers to a horrible place like that of Gehenna, a valley on the west/southwest side of Jerusalem where idolatrous and abominable human sacrifices were offered to Molech the fire god. Secular historians record that the site became the cesspool and repository of the filth of Jerusalem where fires were kept burning and where worms constantly bred in the decaying corpses of criminals. In Mark 9:44 Jesus refers to a place &#8220;where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&#8221; Some take this as eternal torment, but if you think about it, if the worms continued to eat it would soon devour its food.\n \n Some scholars add to the confusion by saying the bottomless pit and the lake of fire though these are not translated to hell as we know it. The result is that while many believers find the concept of eternal damnation in hell consistent to Scripture they lack the wherewithal to check His word in the original languages through a Strong&#8217;s concordance. In going about it, lazily accepting what someone else says instead of what is written, they fail to see the grace of God and His purpose for mankind.",

   "yeah, apparently the only thing that the bible says about hell that i can drum up through searches that hell involves fire and that there are gates to it\n \n this reference is interesting: \n Luke 16\n  19\"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.\n 22\"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23In hell,[3] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'\n 25\"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'\n 27\"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'\n 29\"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'\n 30\" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'\n 31\"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' \"\n \n Apparently these two men have a memory of their former lives, and their deeds in the former life determined which place they would wax nostalgic. The deeds? Being rich will send you to hell and being poor will send you to heaven. There was no other criteria given here.",

   "\n Fisher, Are you aware of any sources other than the Bible or Christian/Jewish scholars that contain info on hell? \n\n \n \nlet me get back to you on that one\n\n \n The Greeks and Romans had a 'hell' called Hades.\n The Norse did too, in fact hell is a Norse word - which is why we use it - because it best aproximates an English word for the Greek concept of that place for the dead.\n \n hell - O.E. hel, helle \"nether world, abode of the dead, infernal regions,\" from P.Gmc. *khaljo (cf. O.Fris. helle, O.N. hel, Ger. H\u00f6lle, Goth. halja \"hell\") \"the underworld,\" lit. \"concealed place,\" from PIE *kel- \"to cover, conceal, save.\" The Eng. word may be in part from O.N. Hel (from P.Gmc. *khalija \"one who covers up or hides something\"), in Norse mythology Loki's daughter, who rules over the evil dead in Niflheim, the lowest of all worlds (nifl \"mist\"), a death aspect of the three-fold goddess. Transfer of a pagan concept and word to a Christian idiom, used in the K.J.V. for O.T. Heb. Sheol, N.T. Gk. Hades, Gehenna. Used figuratively for \"any bad experience\" since at least 1374. As an expression of disgust, etc., first recorded 1678. Hell-bent is from 1835. Hell-raiser is from 1914 (to raise hell is from 1896); hellacious is 1930s college slang. Expression Hell in a handbasket is c.1941, perhaps a revision of earlier heaven in a handbasket (c.1913), with a sense of \"easy passage\" to whichever destination. Expression hell of a _____ is attested from 1776. Hell or high water is apparently a variation of between the devil and the deep blue sea. To wish someone would go to hell is in Shakespeare (1596). Snowball's chance in hell \"no chance\" is from 1931; till hell freezes over \"never\" is from 1919. To ride hell for leather is from 1889, originally with reference to riding on horseback. Hell on wheels is from 1843. \n \n http://www.etymonline.com/h3etym.htm\n \n Thus even as the Norse used it, it refers to a place where dead people dwell - not just 'oblvious' to their surroundings.\n \n Hel rules Helheim...\n \"Helheim (\"house of Hel\") is one of the nine worlds of Norse mythology. It is ruled by Hel, the monstrous daughter of the trickster god Loki and his wife Angrboda. \n This cold, dark and misty abode of the dead is located in the world of Niflheim, on the lowest level of the Norse universe. No one can ever leave this place, because of the impassable river Gjoll that flows from the spring Hvergelmir and encircles Helheim. Once they enter Helheim, not even the gods can leave. Those who die of old age or disease, and those not killed in battle, go to Helheim while those who die bravely on the battlefield go to Valhalla. \n The entrance to Helheim is guarded by Garm, a monstrous hound, and Modgud. The giant Hraesvelg (\"corpse eater\") sits at the edge of the world, overlooking Helheim. In the form of an eagle with flapping wings he makes the wind blow. \"\n http://www.pantheon.org/articles/h/helheim.html\n \n Balder was the son of Odin and Frigg, and was renowned for his friendliness, gentleness and wisdom. Balder was haunted by nightmares and was afraid of dying, but his mother - the most powerful of all the \u00c5sgard goddesses - extracted an oath from everyone and everything that no one would ever do him harm. The gods soon made a game of flinging weapons at Balder, since he could no longer be killed or wounded. However, Frigg forgot to ask the mistletoe, which she considered too small and insignificant. Loki the Troublemaker learned of this, and deceived the blind Hod into killing Balder with an arrow made of mistletoe. The \u00c6sir sent a rider to Helheim, the Realm of the Dead, to ask for Balder's return. Hel, Queen of Helheim, replied that Balder would be restored to life if the entire world shed tears over his fate. And everything and everyone - even the stones and trees - are still trying (in vain) to weep the dead god back to life. \n http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/nor...k000-b-n-a.html\n \n The place helheim, was a place where dead people went, but it was not oblivion. Therefore any pretence JWs (et al) would have that hell is derived simply for 'covering-up' falls apart, because the true entymology of the word is clear... and we use the word 'hell' based on the Germanic legends because it most equates with the Biblical place of eternal punishment.",

   "Go for it, Greg.\n\n \n Well you asked , so here it is , and its a long one , get a cool drink and a soft chair :)\n \n I was raised to go to church very Sunday until I was at least 13 years old, and then my parents said I could make my own choice as to whether to continue going on my own or not. So, at 13, I chose to stop going to church at all anymore. My mother was a great woman, low in education, but savy in life , a life she lived hard, one not made any easier by raising 9 of us kids, on a poverty income during the Great Depression. She was a house Christian, to me meaning she did not ever go to church with us, but was raised a Christian, read her big old family Bible with vigor, and believed with all her heart that Christ was her Saviour.... \n \n When I was 21 and living single in my own apartment, I made sure to visit Mom at least weekly to check on her , she at that time being a widow living alone. She was my favorite parent of the two, and we were always close, we could talk about anything with the upmost sincerity and honesty. Almost every visit, she would end it by asking me if I had any intention of starting going back to church. I always has the same reply to her, saying church had nothing to offer me, that I didnt need it to teach me how to lead a good moral life , and that she had raised me right, anyway. But she always countered by saying , \" Church is not just to teach you about a moral life, its most important thing, is to teach you that Christ is your Saviour , and by accepting Him and believing in Him with all of your heart that He is your Saviour ,and by that, you will be saved fron damnation in Hell. \" ....\n \n Now, that one always got my goat, so to speak. Those very same thing words were taught to me in Sunday school as a kid, I had not gotten a grasp on it back then, and it made no more sense to me at 21 years of age. I was always respectful to Mom, so I would not go up against her on that with counter claim, but would just mumble something about I need to get to the laundrymat before it closed, etc, so I would give her a big hug and kiss and exit promply. But , as the years went by she continued reminding me that to be saved , I must turn my life over to Christ, be baptized in his name , to avoid the eternal fire and damnation....\n \n Finally, one pretty Sunday fall afternoon in 1982, I was visiting with her and we were having a good evening of chit chat. By now she was 78 years old, and had a lot of physical ailments coming upon her. So, this day I was feeling more accomodating , and was willing to discuss this fire and brimstone thing with her. As of yet, I still had not been back to church , and was not baptized . After she gave me her speech about wanting me to go back to church again, her voiced sort of trailed off, and a sadness came over her face. In her next sentence she said, \" Son, I dont know how much longer I have here on earth, and I just dont want to lay down and die, and know that when I draw my last breath , that you are still not saved yet . \" ...\n \n Well, that kind of got to me and sort of stuck in my gizzard so to speak, so I opened up to her with what my feelings were, about this hell thing. I told her that in order for a person to be afraid of hell, they need to know, and proven to them, that there is such a place, OR at LEAST prove to me, there is a afterlife. I told her that without a soul or spirit energy living on after physical death, THAT would make the concept of eternal torment hellfire , a complete impossibility in my mind. I asked her that in her long lifetime, had she ever had ANY aknowledgement of a person that had died, and then came back and proved to her that a afterlife existed ?. She replied with a no, and that it was just something she was raised to believe in, and she believed in her heart that Christ was real, and so was the afterlife...\n \n Being 29 now, and so worldly in my ways, I couldnt accept that. To me it just didnt make sense, and it had no logic at all. What ? Believe in something you cant see, smell, or touch, humbug , I thought. So , in my huge 29 year old mind, I came up with a thought to make her PROVE to me a afterlife existed. I knew my Mom had NEVER (that I knew of) mislead me about anything, or lied to me in my whole 29 years of living. So I had a thought...\n \n We sat there and wound down on the topic, her not winning, nor I for that matter. So, finally I rendered to her my ingenious, agnostic thought. I told Mom that by ALL probability, she would expire before I would, and she concured. So, my Mom and I made a pact that Sunday afternoon, and hugged on it, one that I knew in my heart I could trust her or myself, to live up to. She agreed to me, that if she died first, she would do something, ANY thing, to let me know her spirit/soul had lived on beyond her death. Even if it meant she had to carry a lamp across the room in front of me. :) So, every time I visted Mom thereafter for the following 10 years, the Christ and hell fire thing was never brought up again between us ...\n \n On August 13, 1992 in the late evening, the phone rang and my wife answered it. It was my sister calling from the nursing home, Mom had just passed away a hour ago, she said. She was found in her favorite chair, her Harlequin romance book still clutched in her hand, like she had just nodded off in to death. All arrangements were made, Mom was laid to rest beside Dad at the cemetery...\n \n About 45 days after Mom was buried, one night something really weird happened at my home. I recall it as if it was yesterday, the exact events of it. It was 2 am, when I was wakened by what I thought was a earthquake or at least a tremor. I thought I might be in a \"sleep/dream state\" so I quickly sat up in the bed to tell my wife , who was lying beside me. Except, she was not there, she and our chow dog, both were standing in the bedroom doorway , eyes bugged out, looking at me and the bed mattress moving side to side. I quickly asked my wife \" Was it a tremor ? Was anything else on the walls shaking ? She said no, and by the time she said no, the mattress stopped moving from side to side. We both went back to bed and said no more about it...\n \n We both went to work the next day and at that time we worked different shifts . Finally, late that night we sat down to eat and I started the topic about the bed shaking side to side the night before. I asked her if I was crazy, making it up, or just had a nightmare. I let her tell me what she had experienced, without me telling my experience first. That way, I knew I would not be leading her in to saying something I had felt, I wanted to know what she had felt first. She told me that she was awakened by a violent side to side movement of the mattress about 2 am. When she opened her eyes, our chow dog , who always slept at the foot of the bed on the floor, was already in the bedroom door looking back at the bed, with its hair bristled and ears laid flat. She said as she ran to the door and looked back at me, I sat up and asked her was it a earthquake, and she said that the mattress was still moving side to side. SO, she had seen and felt what I had , without us ever discussing it, so it wasnt contrived or a nightmare on either part of us....\n \n I never gave the incident anymore thought until one day about 3 months later, a guy I worked with, a baby Christian it just so happened, was spouting scripture about the hellfire and brimstone. It instantly took my mind back to Mom, and our long chats about that subject . It even took me further back, to when as a child and even as a young teen, Mom awoke me every morning by putting her knee against the head of my mattress, and would violently shake it side to side, until I woke up.",

Our pact was for me to get some sort of handle on IF there is an afterlife, not any type of proof of a Hades existence. This afterlife idealogy is quite complexing to say the least. I have experienced what I think was my Mom's \"sign\", which am sure will probaly be explained away by someone here. Then, there are people like The Great Houdini, that was a man in great wonder about the spirit world, and he promised to make a \"sign\" of his crossing over on Halloween to his wife, to prove he was on the other side. It has never happened . And yes, I now believe in the paranormal at the very least, because there is something out here besides what we can just see and touch. .. \n \n I believe there is another dimension to our universe, and I will call it spiritual , not in the religous sense , but for the lack of a word to describe a bodies energy that lives on. I believe in Christ and his work, and that is because of my own religous experience I had, but that's another long story I'll refrain from for now. I believe in Christ because of the experience I had, not because of a scholar lecturing or a tent revival \"awakening\". Religion is a DEEP and diverse subject, for every valid point made for it, non -religous people can counter it with equal credible logic. To me, Christianity is a world nutured by unseen faith and personal commitment to a person (entity)that is also unseen , but when people open their hearts up to HIS word, and believe in it, they are remarkably changed inside. And THAT is the only proof a true Christian needs I would say, as to whether there is actually a hell or not. all jmo",

They have a sense of inner peace, humility, graciousness, and joy that is hard to explain. This feeling is noted as the JOY of Christ in the book of Galatians, if memory serves me right. I know this to be a fact, because it happened to me, but I was weak, and went back to my old ways shortly after, and the spirit left me.

It certainly looks like I took the thread to a different path, and I certainly did not mean to... As I stated in my first post one needs to know for themselves, whether or not there is a afterlife, before the thoughts of the existence of a hell has any substance to them...\n \n Now I will try to make a point on the main topic. If one believes there really is no existence beyond the grave, there would be no need for that person to concern themselves with the thought of a place that is called hell. On the other hand, if one BELIEVES that the physical body has a soul, one that transcends the death of the body, then that person has some validity when questioning the existence of a place called hell.

Having duly consiedered the issue, my current conclusion is that there's simply no way to know, and so we shouldn't let the possiblity influence the way we lead our lives. I try to lead a moral life not due to threat of hell, or to try to please God, but because it's what I think is the right thing to do. If I knew what God considered moral, and if I knew there was a hell waiting for me if I didn't measure up, then I might change the way I lead my life. Or I might not, we'd have to see. Until that time, I will lead my life the best way I know how, given what I know.",

   "First thing, did you ever see if there WAS an earthquake or tremor? Seems like the first thing I'd have done. I'd have been scared.\n \n \n OK, Kronus I mostly agree with you. We know we were given a life here on earth. I would like to live my life for me and not for someone else. I know I'm here and how I want to live my life, why live it for someone else who may not even exist? Think of Noah's Ark:\n \n It rained for 40 days and nights. It flooded up \"to the heavens\" now since there are mountains many miles high I think 1000 miles would be considerably short of the heavens. Now that would be 25 feet a day. MORE THAN A FOOT A DAY. That's only if the heavens are 1000 feet up.\n \n I'm not trying to say the bible is totally false. That would be as stupid as saying I was sure it was god's word. I'm going to live my life with what I know, I'm in a great life, and take advantage of it as best I can and not worry about after my life. I don't know what will happen. Even if I knew god existed I wouldn't know which religion's god to believe. So many god's (confused smilie, where my other one was and it deleted the whole post :(, really annoyed right now). Mostly I think the morals in the bible (what I know of it) are good but the stories are just that, stories. Indian myths were the same.

   "Lots of answers here...different ones. He is right, she is right, everyone can't be right can they?\n\n \n Ladywolf, everyone here is not right , just as not everyone here is totally wrong either. It has certainly been a eye opener topic, but as most political and religous discussions go, the person's stance on the issue, will directly relate to that persons own convictions, and those convictions are based on that persons religous (or not) upbringing, life experiences, and education from whatever biased source , they learned the topic from. So, that being said, get a cold drink and a soft chair, this one is a long one, :) \n \n As I touched on above, ( NOT my mothers afterlife debate / experience, that is a different event) , I had a religous experience 25 years ago right after my divorce, at age 27. I was at the bottom of the barrel of my life so to speak, I was waking up everyday downtrodden with depression and sometimes I even had a notion of ending it all. One day a guy I worked with, started spouting off about how the \"end was near\" and all the signs of the Book of Revelations were upon us, on and on. I just listened to him and thought to myself, well, maybe he had just drank some bad beer the night before. That night I went to bed tired, and had not thought any more about it....\n \n Sometime during that night I had a dream, a powerful one that I can still explain every detail of, even now , 25 years later. In my dream , I was at my sisters farm, at the huge cookout that her and my bro-in-law held for our family every summer. I was standing beside the big hay wagon, that had all the food on it, and felt a \"push\" to go around beside the big tobacco barn, why I didnt know. In my dream it was dark already, but it was a nice star lit night, and as I walked around to the back corner of the barn, another \"sensation \" hit me, moving me to look up to the dark, but starlit sky. Just as I did that, ( both of my arms are full of goosebumps now as I am typing this) ALL of the stars in that portion of the night sky I looked at, had pulled from their position in the universe, and formed a HUGE star lit CROSS. Then, suddenly I just awoke from the dream, then quickly went back to sleep. ... \n \n \n I went to work that coming morning , not really thinking much of my dream. It just seemed to me like another odd dream, and I had always held dreams as just illogical firing sequences of the brainwaves in a resting state, with sporatic images of the subconcious merging togther to form a mini-movie. But, for whatever ever reason, that evening when I got back to my apt, I had a urge to pull the dusty old family Bible off of the bookshelf, something I hadnt read since I was 13 years old. I read the scripture in the red print, because it seemed to have a bit more kick, being the words of Christ and all. But, that night, the words didnt make much sense, thou, upon, liken, etc, yuck :(. The next night, for whatever reason, I was pulled to get out the big book again. I still had plenty of Playboy mags around, but for some reason, they had lost their attraction for once in my young life. I read the scriptures again , tonight though, I felt a \"sense\" of understanding of the words, that give me a \"fuzzy\" inside.....\n \n I found myself pulled to the Book each night , hungering to read the scriptures in the New Testament. I found my eyes tearing up as I read the \"Sermon on the Mount. \" For five nights in a row , I was reading and could feel myself pulling up out of the depths of depression I had grown accustomed to, every since that day I had caught my new bride of only a year , cheating on me. Alas, the scriptures NOW made sense to me, and somehow , I was changing on the inside of me, and I didnt really know why....\n \n \n I was working construction at that time, living that rough and tumble life daily, one that had a lot of cussing, telling onnery jokes, looking at Hustler mags on my lunch break, going to topless bars whenever we got rained out from working. But, for some reason, all of a sudden I just quit swearing, it didnt \"feel\" right, I couldnt go in to a bar, because as soon as I tried to step in the door, it felt as if someone had thrown a wet blanket on me. The guys at work start making fun of me, calling me a \"holy roller\" when I told them I enjoyed reading the Bible , and didnt want their Hustler mags anymore. Whenever my nephew that I worked with, started tearing in to me about this \"religion\" stuff, and questioned me on why I believed in GOD and all that hokey stuff, I was amazed the answers I had for him. Knowledge poured out of me to counter him, or answer any question he fired at me about it. I lost my ability to get mad at people, something I was always good at, prior to my reading of the Book. I felt in me, a inner peace and joy I could not explain, along with a knowledge of the unknown , that I KNEW I did not have UNTIL the Book reading sessions....\n \n I struggled at being a baby Christian as the clergy called me, and it was a daily endeavor. I went from church to church, trying to find the \"right\" one, one that suited my expectations. All the time, I was losing friends, because my old friends felt uncomfortable around me, they wanted to go kill animals for fun, got to bars, get drunk, etc, and they knew I did not want to do those things anymore. I had not got the jest of being a christian, did not know it was a lifetime of leading a different life, a life of doing God's will and not just always ones own will, and one that by doing so , I was getting ready to lose my best friend I had met , when we were just 7 years old. So, I wasnt strong enough to hold on to my faith, because I was \"losing\" to many friends, I was weak and I fell back in to my old ways, and lost those \"fruits of the Spirit\" that I had enjoyed for a short time...\n \n \n \n My dream was referred to as a \"calling\" , at least that was what a few of the clergy said, when I told them of my dream. In the Bible it says Christ may call upon those thirsting for or needing his blessings, yet some of the hard core clergy, say those \"callings\" are meant only for those being called to ministry, not ordinary people. I say hogwash, they have there opinion, I have mine. WHile I was on my \"thirst\" for divine knowledge, I did a lot of reading on religion, the afterlife, some of the books I read were a 120 years old. It was interesting the way all the religions and faiths around the world had so many different ways of believing in basically the same message. And once again, this was just my personal experience, some may mock it, some can debate it to death, but none the less, I KNOW it happened to me. ...\n \n So , that was a life experience to me, and one I will base my opinions on whenever a topic about life after death, hell, being \"saved\" any of those issues come up. I refrain from quoting scripture and pounding the Bible, because to truly understand the Bible as it is written, and to get the \"inspired\" script from it, one has to be in \"spirit\". I am NOT a churchgoer , scripture quoter, and \"public\" Christian. But, I do believe in the power and saving grace of Christ, BECAUSE of my life experience, not because a clergy or a poster on a BBS , told me it is that way....\n \n Now, Ladywolf, this long post may have meant nothing to you, but if one sentence made sense , then maybe I helped, or I may have made it more muddled for you, I dont know. I know this, if you are beating yourself up because of your sexual orientation , and this quest for the proven knowledge of hell is the motivating factor, rest easy. Stop and think about something and I will just make a REAL broad what IF, here. What IF, Jeffrey Dahmer , while getting the last bit of life beat out of him, in his heart he gave his last minute of life over to Jesus, asked HIM for his saving grace and TRULY believed in HIM. Does that not fill the criteria sheet for the soul saving salvation, as the BIble states ?? ...\n \n That is where I could not ever get settled in my mind or heart about this saving grace criteria. Throughout all of my research , I found one common thread, whenever the theory of the hereafter was discussed by the entity scholars. That is, they believe the soul will live on as it has lived on earth. That being if a person has loved without restraint, cared and helped those needing it , in general lived a good life here on earth , then the herafter will be liken to it. Live the opposite, the soul's hereafter will repeats itself, so on. What about all the souls that has never heard of Christ ? What of the people that denied Christ, although He grew up and testified in their own country ? To make a assumption that only ONE way is the only right way, is being a bit naive I think. I know people that are the most loving , honest, giving, family cherishing humans that there is, but they do not go the way of the Billy Grahams. Are they doomed to burn ? It is hard to rationalize that a omnipotent loving God, as having that kind of agenda...\n \n I know, the Holy Bible KJV, says believe in HIM and surrender your life to HIM, and ask HIM to forgive your sins and you will be granted eternal life. And that is TRUE , I believe that, but can ALL souls fit in to that category, we ask ? And what if one would really like for death to be the end, and not have a soul that lives on and on and on and on....... that appeals to me, because what if I dont really care for the socialites up there ?? :)\n And sometimes I think, hmmm,, what if old Jeffy D. and Ted Bundy did do the death bed salvation bit, and they are up there with the gold bricks and singing angels . If thats true, I would just as soon be exterminated for good, and let it be the end of the end for me. cheers to ya, and all jmo",

I know where the devil is....\n\n \n Which part of Genesis?\n \n God does not condemn people to hell, people do. You have something called \"Free Will\" and this means two very real choices. You choose to be with God, or not. If you choose option #2 then you get exactly what you wanted - a place called hell.\n \n Here are some of the verses you simply have to ignore...\n Matthew 5:22\n But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[ 5:22 Some manuscripts brother without cause] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,[ 5:22 An Aramaic term of contempt] ' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.\n \n Matthew 5:29\n If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\n \n Matthew 5:30\n And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. \n \n Matthew 10:28\n Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n \n Matthew 16:18\n And I tell you that you are Peter,[ 16:18 Peter means rock.] and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.\n \n Matthew 18:9\n And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.\n \n Matthew 23:15\n \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.\n \n Matthew 23:33\n \"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? \n \n Mark 9:43\n If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out.\n \n Mark 9:45\n And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.\n \n Mark 9:47\n And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, \n \n Luke 12:5\n But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. \n \n Luke 16:23\n In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. \n \n James 3:6\n The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. \n \n 2 Peter 2:4\n For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment; \n \n and the Jehovah's and their ilk say that when you die you lose all 'self' in that you go into oblivion. This too is countered by the Bible..\n There's the story in the Bible about the man cast to hell...\n Luke 16\n 22 \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.\n 23 In hell,[1] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.\n 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' \n \n Quite clearly he's recognising the torment he's in.\n \n \n Once again you show a highly selective look at the Bible. You've not debated me on the issue of the Trinity so I expect no response here, but again it shows the dangers of personal interpretation - especially when you select a version of God that doesn't fit in with your a priori sensibilities\n \n St. Isaac the Syrian\n \"I also maintain that those who are punished in Gehenna (hell), are scourged by the scourge of love. Nay, what is so bitter and vehement as the torment of love?\"\n http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b24.en.l...er_death.07.htm\n That is to say, that hell is the removal from God's love. No greater torture could exist.\n \n God said to Moses: \"I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion? (Ex. 33, 19). The Apostle Paul, citing this Old Testament passage, concludes: \"Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills, He hardens? (Rom. 9, 18). It needs to be interpreted in Orthodox terms. How does God want to have mercy on one and want to harden another? Is there favouritism in God?\n According to the interpretation of (St) Theophylactus of Bulgaria, this is connected with the nature of man and not with God's action. St. Theophylactus says: \"Just as the sun softens the wax candle but hardens clay, not arbitrarily but because of the different materials of the wax candle and the clay: so also God is said to harden the clay heart of the Pharaoh\"11. Therefore the grace of God, that is to say His love, which will radiate to all, will work according to a man's spiritual condition. \n Ibid.",

   "Well, at least homie's mom was right all along. God let her come back and haunt him! \n \n If that happened to me I'd pyss myself and never tell anyone about it.\n \n\n \n Hi, Apathy, thanks for posting ... I dont know if you are referring to me or not, but you are eluding to my post, so I feel the need to respond. By the way, my name is Greg, not homie or Homer. :) I did not feel as if my experience with the mattress thing, was a \"haunting\" at all. As a matter of fact, it never occurred to me that way. I just thought we were having a tremor like the one we had back in 1981, but as my wife said, it woke her up also, and as she stood in the doorway looking around , nothing on the walls or in the house was moving , except for the mattress. Only later, after thinking about it deeply and searching for a answer, did I recall the pact my Mother and I had made with each other 10 years earlier.... \n \n I share my mattress experience with others face to face sometimes. Not because I am a professional storyteller by any means, or that I feel the need to \"testify for Christianity\", but I just get a feeling that some people I meet have a thirst for a knowledge of, or just SOME kind of personal acknowledgement , on the afterlife/religion type topics. We have all watched the evangelists on TV \"heal\" the lame and afflicted with their God given powers on stage. We all at one time or another , or at least will in our lifetime, pick up a book at a bookstore or library on the afterlife , spirituality, and read them with great interest, yet read them with tainted views of skepticism. The only problem I have with either of those two avenues of knowledge , either books or TV preachers , is motivation... \n \n And motivation for what one asks ?, hmmm, MONEY. People write books for money , the more dramatic and mysterious the script , the better seller it will be. Books on the afterlife, OBE's, are hot seller's nowadays. People have always been at least mildly curious about the reasons for religion, and along with that, searching for a PROOF of a non visible world of spirits or souls. The TV preachers that \"cure \" people on stage of all their dreaded diseases and afflictions, those same preachers , certainly do not live in poverty. So, because I have enough age and experience in life, enough to the point that I dont really care what people think about me telling my life experiences, I have no qualms about telling them. .. \n \n I have no hidden agenda, and certainly no financial gain to be had from my posts, therefore I think I would be a tad more credible to someone in search of knowledge about the spiritual /paranormal world, than a TV preacher or a writer of books on the afterlife. If there is just one person out here, that is at the crossroads in their quest for information about the afterlife/religous experiences, and they happen to read my posts above, and acquire just one TINY molecule of valuable information from them, then I see that as a good thing . And, as with any writings, whether it be a BBS post or a book, people have their free will to gather what information they want or feel is credible from them, and cull the rest. cheers. :) all jmo",

   "Hi Ladywolf:\n \n \nWhat is Hell? I haven't ever considered hell before. There are many, many people who have told me throughout the years that I'm going there...\n\n \n Looking below I see you are counted among Israel of the flesh. Therefore, your question about 'hell' is a bit confusing. I would expect to see a question from you about Sheol (Gen. 37:35, 42:38, etc.) or the pit (Psalms 30:3). Sheol is the place in the underworld that received both the righteous and unrighteous throughout the times of the Tanak (Old Testament to Christians). \n \n \nLadywolf << Some people tell me that because I'm Jewish, homosexual, don't believe Christ is the Lord that I'm going to this place that is not mentioned anywhere in the torah or the mishna or the 10 commandments or even the talmoud or Kabbalah.\n\n \n You should not expect to find information on 'hell' in any of those places. But it is not as though Isaiah fails to mention the two opposite extremes of Sheol and Heaven. \"Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make {it} deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\" Isaiah 7:11. While 'heaven' is introduced in the eight verse of the Torah, the Lord offers no instruction on how this place should become a preferred destination to anyone descended from Jacob (Israel). After all, the Lord is, \"the God of heaven.\" Genesis 24:7. \n \n From the Jewish perspective, God is for heaven, and men are for the earth. The Lord proclaims Himself to be, \"the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" Exodus 3:6. The very heart and soul of Israel is tied to the land promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Exodus 6:8, 33:1, etc.). Thus, the people and the land have the same name. From this context perhaps some can see that Israel has a totally different mindset from that of the typical professing Christian. That being said, the Lord does give clues to His future intentions for both groups.\n \n What did the Lord say to Abraham? \"Indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.\" Gen. 22:17. I submit that the Lord is performing great works on the earth (as the sand) and in the heavens (as the stars) themselves. While Israel shall surely inherit the land promised to Abraham, the Lord has also made a provision for Gentiles to be grafted in and receive His blessing of a heavenly inheritance. So while Israel of the flesh concentrates upon their earthly inheritance, members of the body of Christ seek what is above. And this is the reason that the Lord has given for Gentiles to know the difference between their heavenly inheritance and 'hell.' \n \n But first, Ezekiel speaks of a day when \"All Israel\" will be resurrected into the Messianic Kingdom. Read Chapter 37 of Ezekiel from the start, until we find, \n \n \n\"Then He said to me, \"Son of man, these bones are the WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL; behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off. ' Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, \"Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it,\" declares the LORD.'\" Ezek. 37:11-14.\n\n \n \nLady << So you see, I'm kind of ignorant about hell and what it is and why I will go there after I die. The rabbi told me that when I die I will lay in a coffin and my body will decompose and that's that.\n\n \n He may be teaching that you will sleep, until that resurrection into the Promised Land. Israel is living through a dark period associated with the 'time of the Gentiles.' This period will come to an end with the appearance of Elijah (Malachi 4:5+6). If you can bear with a few of our New Testament quotes, the Apostle Paul agrees 100 percent with Ezekiel and Isaiah, saying, \n \n \n\"For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so ALL ISRAEL will be saved; just as it is written, \"The deliverer [Elijah] will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob. This is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.\" Rom. 11:25-27. (Those are verses from Isaiah 59:20+21.)\n \n \n On the Passover, that fourth and last cup of wine is left full on the table in anticipation of this deliverer. So our (Christian) gospel is not for everyone, and it is apparently not for you. That in no way spells doom for you or Israel. The above explains why Israel simply does not see it. It is from this position that maybe we are ready to address you question.\n \n \nLadywolf << Can someone please kindly explain what hell is?\n\n \n The answer must come from a Christian (New Testament) perspective, as we have already determined that the word does not appear in the Tanak. As man is spirit, body and soul, and the family is male, female and seed, Sheol is made up of the three parts of \"Abraham's Bosom\" (Paradise), \"Hades\" (hell) and the \"Great Chasm\" (between the two). All three parts are mentioned in these Gospel verses,\n \n \n\"In 'Hades' he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his 'bosom.' And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.' But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you there is a 'great chasm' fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and {that} none may cross over from there to us.'\" Luke 16:23-26.\n\n \n Since Abraham noted the differences of \"good things\" and \"bad things,\" then we are inclined to believe that a judgment has taken place. That being so, nothing is written that excludes the members of both sides from being part of the \"All Israel\" resurrection into the Messianic Kingdom and the Promised Land. On the far side of that resurrection, and beyond the fulfillment of all the prophecies of all the prophets, there is another judgment where the punishment is far worse than anything experienced by this rich man above. Those among Israel who do not heed that deliverer shall be utterly destroyed from among the people (Acts 3:23), and shall be cast into that lake of fire (Rev. 19:20, 20:10, 14, 15, 21:8). So there are things far worse than going to hell. \n \n Here is a good reference for you:\n \n Exploring Heaven and Hell in Judaism by Rabbi Bernard Baskin\n \n http://www.cjnews.com/pastissues/99/aug19-99/feature/feature3.htm\n \n May His hand be upon you,\n \n Terral",

   "Which part of Genesis?\n\n \n Why in the Adam and Eve story (Chapter 2). He gave them freedom with one rule - and told them what disobediance would mean. Death. It's what they got and we inherited.\n \n \nGod does not condemn people to hell, people do. You have something called \"Free Will\" and this means two very real choices. You choose to be with God, or not. If you choose option #2 then you get exactly what you wanted - a place called hell.\n \n Here are some of the verses you simply have to ignore...\n Matthew 5:22\n But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[ 5:22 Some manuscripts brother without cause] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,[ 5:22 An Aramaic term of contempt] ' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. \n \n Matthew 5:29\n If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. \n \n Matthew 5:30\n And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.  \n \n Matthew 10:28\n Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. \n \n Matthew 16:18\n And I tell you that you are Peter,[ 16:18 Peter means rock.] and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it. \n \n Matthew 18:9\n And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. \n \n Matthew 23:15\n \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. \n \n Matthew 23:33\n \"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?  \n \n Mark 9:43\n If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out. \n \n Mark 9:45\n And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. \n \n Mark 9:47\n And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,  \n \n Luke 12:5\n But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. \n \n Luke 16:23\n In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. \n \n James 3:6\n The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. \n \n 2 Peter 2:4\n For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment; \n \n and the Jehovah's and their ilk say that when you die you lose all 'self' in that you go into oblivion. This too is countered by the Bible..\n There's the story in the Bible about the man cast to hell...\n Luke 16\n 22 \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.\n 23 In hell,[1] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.\n 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' \n \n Quite clearly he's recognising the torment he's in.\n \n Once again you show a highly selective look at the Bible. You've not debated me on the issue of the Trinity so I expect no response here, but again it shows the dangers of personal interpretation - especially when you select a version of God that doesn't fit in with your a priori sensibilities\n \n St. Isaac the Syrian\n \"I also maintain that those who are punished in Gehenna (hell), are scourged by the scourge of love. Nay, what is so bitter and vehement as the torment of love?\"\n http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b24.en.l...er_death.07.htm\n That is to say, that hell is the removal from God's love. No greater torture could exist.\n \n God said to Moses: \"I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion? (Ex. 33, 19). The Apostle Paul, citing this Old Testament passage, concludes: \"Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills, He hardens? (Rom. 9, 18). It needs to be interpreted in Orthodox terms. How does God want to have mercy on one and want to harden another? Is there favouritism in God?\n According to the interpretation of (St) Theophylactus of Bulgaria, this is connected with the nature of man and not with God's action. St. Theophylactus says: \"Just as the sun softens the wax candle but hardens clay, not arbitrarily but because of the different materials of the wax candle and the clay: so also God is said to harden the clay heart of the Pharaoh\"11. Therefore the grace of God, that is to say His love, which will radiate to all, will work according to a man's spiritual condition. \n Ibid.\n\n \n The word hell is three words in the Bible.\n \n sheol - Hebrew - means death/the pit/the grave. Jews don't believe in hell. That is relevant to me.\n \n haides - Greek - replaced sheol in Greek text\n \n Gehena - was real place on Earth. People were sacrificed there in pagan ritual, and it was later used to burn refuse. It was well known - which is why Christ used the word (Matthew above). Things did not get tortured there. They got destroyed. Christ came with a promise of life. Non-participation and you don't get it. Your destruction becoms permanant vs temporary. Maybe that end will be fiery. But in no way do I believe that God tortures people for eternity. Why free will then - to tease us with \"my way or or torture\"? What does that say about God? It's DISGUSTING! I simply think humans are bastardly enough to get into the idea that a person they disagree with will burn forever.\n \n You actually can love a God who uses the same techniques as a dictator or Mafia thug?\n \n yuck",

I don't know who shook your mattress but either God / his angels, or the devil is capable of that, I believe.

   "What is hell? One thing's for sure - hell is a threat. Whether it is real or not is uncertain. Combined with its counterpart, heaven, it serves as an effective control tool for gullible people. Reward and punishment, the old Chinese Legalist mode of tyranny.\n \n However, threats of hell and promises of heaven are ultimately self-defeating when all faith-based claims of the sort are considered. For example, religion #1 claims that eating oranges will get you in hell, while religion #2 claims that eating oranges will get you to heaven. When religions contradict each other with their threats, it reveals how hollow their threats are. The way to heaven (or hell) becomes uncertain, and individuals with sense choose to bet their dollars on the certain - intellectual liberty through secular philosophies.",

   "Being 52 now, my life just in the last 4 years has become full of health and pain issues, I am on a crutch now for the very painful arthritis in my left knee. Today my Doc put me on high blood pressure meds , and I now sleep with a b-pap machine mask on my face to keep me breathing at night, because of sleep apnea. It sometimes seems that since I turned my back on the Light, the personal \"tests\" for my survival are getting harder and harder. I have read on here about what happens to back sliders of Christ, and it seems I am reaping my dues.\n\n \n Consider the fact that you are simply getting older. It's perfectly natural that, as time goes on, you're going to start to creak and that parts are going to break. Eight years ago I put a new roof on my house. Today, I wouldn't even think of doing such a thing because I know that I would be incapable of it. I would suggest to you that you are not reaping any 'dues', my friend. You're simply getting older, and in my opinion, the difficulties you mention constitute neither a punishment nor a warning but are, instead, a natural consequence of age. \n \n What to do about it? Well, I've got a few years on you and I would humbly suggest that you attempt to enjoy your life. Recognize the fact that you're probably not going to be able to do some of the things which you were able to do in the past. Use your imagination and try to discover new activities/pursuits. And try to number among them the idea of bringing comfort to others. I'll give you a suggestion from personal experience: go to your local animal shelter and 'borrow' a bunch of puppies and kittens for an afternoon. Make arrangements to deliver them to a nursing home. Then, stand back and watch what happens :-)",

   "But if when he picks up a bible and goes to church he dies, that's never god or christ's fault, right? Was it just an accident? Or did he not believe hard enough? That seems to be the fallacy, when something good happens, it's God's doing, when something bad happens, God had nothing to do with it. Sort of like in Vegas, when you win a dollar lights flash and bells ring loud, but when you lose a million dollars, no one knows. It claims credit for only the good, much like God.\n\n \n \n Hi, Zach. From what I have witnessed in my lifetime , I think God really does not have a hand in the individuals life, nor wants to. As a matter of fact, maybe its just me, but it appears as if the deck is stacked against the \"good\" people in this world we live in. Almost too often we can read where a young mother with her baby was killed by a drunk driver, the DD walks away unhurt. The store is robbed and the robber kills the young Christian clerk for kicks, while walking right past the known suicidal druggie. ...\n \n I have known people that could not have cared less, if the sun ever rose again, and they have lived to a ripe old age. Yet, I have had WAY too many people around me that I knew cherished life , and every second of it, and they ended up suffering and dying way too young. I find myself often struggling with the rationale on this fact of life. I believe God will hear ones heartfelt prayers and move people around that person , to help answer their prayer. So, the way I see it , God is not to \"blame\" for anything , he sent his SON so we can make a choice , about how we want to live now, and hereafter. So, for people to give God credit for any of the good or bad that is happening in their lives, may be presumptous on their part for sure. Cheers and all jmo,",

   "I read post # 44. Yes, that was the Holy Spirit who gave you the hunger for the Bible. I like the NIV translation and the New KJV also (without all the \"thou's\", etc. I also had a dream from God and woke up. It was foretold to me 21 days in advance that I'd hear from God, but I didn't know it would be in a dream. They say when you have a dream from God, you \"wake up\". Anyway, what's your current status in Christ? Prodigal Son / backslider or believer? I think he can help you out with your health too (if it's his will). I think you have your evidence for Christ already. Good stuff, Greg!\n\n \n As I stated in the post a ways back, I was weak and fell from the \"light\". I live daily in obedience of the Ten Commandments , and I believe in Christ and His works. What I have NOT done is found a church, joined it in fellowship, and received baptism. I guess my Mom's words are still haunting me . With me no longer being \"in spirit\" I am not enlightened to the Word, and end up asking too many questions that seem agnostic, to which I am not. I guess I am looking for written FACTS about all of this, yet I know it is all based on faith, always has been. I think as I see my health degrading I am getting prone to wanting confirmation of what has happened to me. thanks for your input EZR, cheers",

There's a spiritual baptism (Titus 3:5) that washes you clean and gave you \"rebirth\". Remember that the thief on the cross wasn't water baptized (he was saved by faith in Christ) , but Jesus said to the thief, \"Today you will be with me in paradise\". Water Baptism is like circumcision in a way. In the Old Testament people were justified by faith in God (note Genesis 15:6), the same way we today are justified by faith in Christ (note Ephesians 2:8-9 and also Romans 10:9-10). Circumcision was just an outward ritual of sorts that symbolized the inward circumcision of the heart that God does in a person (many scriptures). So you're probably saved already by faith in Christ. Do recommend you go to church once in a while (if not often) and get water baptized. Something like the Assembly (Assemblies) of God Church is pretty good and Biblically-based. It will do wonders for your mindset. God bless, bro!",

The pet sharing thing always goes wrong for us, we end keeping one of them that is homeless. :) \n My saying I was paying my \"dues\" was my simple minded way of saying that I believe my life is being pulled in two directions. I have this constant \"pull\" on my spirit , for lack of a better analogy, to get back in to the church. Somehow I get the feeling that once a person is touched by the Light of Christ, that person is \"nudged\" back on track by the powers that be. I think when one completely and publicly denounces their faith in Christ after being touched by HIM, that the Christ spirit will leave them and they will not feel the inner \"push \" to go back. But, I have not denounced Him, so maybe I am still getting guided back in to the light. I dunno....\n \n I just know that there are two real forces present here on this earth , one is evil, the darkness, and the other is good, the Light, and they are constantly opposing forces . Why people are more subject to go to one, as opposed the other, I dont know. Why some people can go from the crib to the casket and never even have the urge to think about those forces, I dont know. But I do know one thing, after we breathe our last breath, THEN we will KNOW, one way or the other. cheers to you, all jmo",
