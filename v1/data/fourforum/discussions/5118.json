   "Contrary to a pro-Bush TV ad, Republicans share the blame for \"empty courtrooms,\" and delays are shorter now than they were before Bush.\n May 6, 2005\n Modified: May 6, 2005 \n \n Summary\n \n A multimillion-dollar ad campaign blames Democrats for the fact that \"courtrooms sit empty.\" In fact, there are now half as many judicial vacancies as when Bush took office. And of the 46 federal judgeships that remain vacant, Bush has named only 16 replacements.\n \n The ad also says cases are being delayed in federal courts for \"thousands of Americans.\" Actually, official statistics show cases typically being decided more quickly now than they were in 1999, when it was Republicans opposing Clinton's judicial nominees.\n \n <snip<\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/article324.html \n \n 200+ confirmed, 46 vacant, 16 named, 10 contested....of course that means Dems are against religion.... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "The way this reads:\n \n \nTo be sure, there are currently four vacancies on that court all considered \"judicial emergencies\" based on its volume of cases, according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts. Bush has nominated judges to fill all of them.\n \n However, a closer look shows that both parties share responsibility for the 6th Circuit's awful record. Three of those vacancies opened up during the Clinton administration, one of them as far back as 1995. But former Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham, now Bush's energy secretary, blocked two of Clinton' s nominees to that court by the simple expedient of refusing to allow hearings on them. And that was despite the fact that even then the 6th Circuit's delays had been the worst in the country since 1998.\n\n \n It makes it sound like 3 of the vacancies could have been filled by Clinton nominees, but the Republicans blocked votes on these nominees and now Bush wants to fill these positions with his own nominees. And the Republicans are bitching about blocked nominees. I really don't see how anyone votes for these people.",
