A couple of things puzzle me though.\n \n The poorer areas of the world are often the ones where religion is very strong - in the middle east, in India and Africa for example. If your mortal life is pretty hard, you want to cling on to the notion that all your sacrifices and hard work will be repaid after you die. The southern US is considerably poorer than the northern and coastal regions, and indeed this is where we find the highest concentration of very devout Christians - the famous 'Bible Belt'.\n However, surely a lot of these poor, religious types would want a change in the status quo seeing as they gain very little from it at the present time.\n \n On the other hand, there is the section of US society that is very rich and very religious. These are people who will always be able to stay one step ahead of any percieved change in the status quo because of the money and power they have already amassed. I cannot understand why these people have the need for such strong belief, and I am not so cynical to believe that they are only doing it for the good publicity it gets them.\n \n Johnhanks' argument makes a lot of sense from a broad perspective, but I can't help but feel there is something else going on as well, some fundamental (no pun) difference, historically, between US and European culture that I can't quite put my finger on.\n \n \n1 - Parents and societies who encourage acceptance of things without questioning.\n \n 2 - A public school system which does not focus enough on critical thinking or problem solving skills.\n\n \n This is very interesting, particularly the second point; can anyone elaborate with some examples?

Now I know you're going to go on about responsibility, duty, loyalty and obligation again but my point is: If Christianity is true, any woman who repents for her abortion (as I'm sure they all do) is getting into heaven anyway.\n Whereas if all those kids were born into families (often where the dad has buggered off) that could not support them, and/or where the mother is not mature enough to handle it, those kids are at least 50% of the time going to end up becoming wasters and criminals.\n Abortion is not a holocaust, it is a blessing for society.\n \n Also, has it never occured to you that if the US slashed its military budget by say, 75% you'd still spend more than anybody else and you'd have about three hundred billion dollars extra to spend on rectifying social problems?",

   "\n Unamerican? How dare you question my patriotism, sir. First off, isolationism hasn't worked. And it will not work in the present global environment that we live in. \n\n \n I question your patriotism because your political ideaology is nearly 100% at odd with the concepts on which this nation was founded. You have failed miserably in your responsibility to keep yourself educated and informed so that you can do your part as a citizen of this nation. \n \n Isolationism hasn't worked? Maybe you can tell me when we tried it? IT does nto matter, though, becuase I am not an isolaitonist. Using our military as a negotiationg tool for everything from trade to ideology certainly has not worked. Besides the fact that it has brought the ineveitable retaliation (terrorist attacks) it has destroyed our economy to support our oversized military all these years. Now we are using massive military spending as a tool to increase our GDP, using it to hide the economic problems we have. This has essentially sealed our fate as a nation. Fools like you, who are equate military might with a strong nation have essentially assured the destruction of the very nation you pretend to adore.\n \n \nSecond, if we have a small military, how can we, as a nation possibly defend against invasion and terrorism if all our military is glorified rent-a-cops\n\n \n Defend ourselves against invasion? Are you absolutly insane? The last time somebody tried to invade the US, it was the British. The best defense the US has is the fact that we have a large ocean on etiehr side and friendly nations above and below. We have NO costal defenses. We have 2 border defense bases for the entire nation. The rest of our bases are all either training bases, or international deployment/support bases. \n \n Defend against terrorim? Why do you think we have a problem with terrorism? Every anti american terrorist that has ever existed has cited Americas gunboat politics, support of tyrants, and international meddling. all of these things are the result of having a huge standing military. Maybe you should go back and review what those who founded this country had to say about standing militaries being a threat to peace. \n \n Why have we supported tyrants and used our military to force everything from idealogical reforms to trade agreements that turn foreign children into slave labor for US owned factories? Because fools like you prefer to follow blindly instead of taking the time to actually follow what is going on in the world and Americas part in it. The American public has become complacent and has not bothered to police its government for a great many years. \n \n I think maybe the real problem is that we inherited a great nation wihtout having to do anything to build it; that was done by our parents and grandparents. Without having to put any real work into it, we took a great nation and ran it down to nothing. We took the biggest creditor nation on the planet and turned it into the biggest debtor nation on the planet. We took the largest, most advanced industrial infrastructure the world has ever seen and dismantled it, sold it off a piece at a time, because it was easier than actually using it and because the same XXXXXX who inherited it somehow felt entitled to massive compensation for their labor, which made us uncometitve. It was people like YOU who did this and allowed it to happen.\n \n How dare I question your patriotism? The idealogy you support has been, and will be, the demise of this country. You are not patriot, you are a sabateur.",

There, the focus was on spoon-feeding students in order that they can pass their exams, get a good final score, and get into university.
