   "Sigh, hi everyone it;s been well over a year now since I have posted on these forums and I must say alot has happened. Number one, I joined the military with hopes of finding a good sense of self worth and a purpose of serving my country and the rights we all have. \n \n Since then I have realized what a terrible mistake it was. I have been litterally railroaded by the system. I signed up for music and was told I passed the audition so they played bait and switch and so I signed up for the job of intel specialist. Didnt even get that far. On the day of the last test a death occured in my family. I told my superiors but they flatly ignored me. So I failed the test of course and was dropped from the school and sent into the fleet as a paint chipper. \n \n Well enough of that for now. I find myself in an ever confusing situation with where I'm at in life, what I have learned about myself etc. I currently have a question though since one of my buddies in the service is gay. How do you deal or hide the fact that you are? I find that my friend is stressed out of his mind and cannot take the abuse from others. He cannot get out due to a financial dituation back home and well im out of ideas on how to help him. If any of the regulars on the forum (please no bashers I dont need that kind of biased bigotry) can private message me I would really appreciate it",

   "All I can say is \"I am sorry for your pain\".\n \n I am also sorry you did not say anything before you joined... I would have been happy to talk you out of it. I could have brought on everybody from buck privates to 2 star generals to list all the reasons to run like hell when a recruiter comes knocking. \n \n On the up side, it is not forever. Do your hitch, get the hell out, and put it down as \"lesson learned\". \n \n Are you at least getting to see some of the world, or are you stuck in a shipyard somewhere??",

   "I was lucky. After college, I had several lousy, boring jobs. I started thinking about joining the airforce to go into meterology. My friends that had been in the military warned me that for gay men, the military is hell on earth. You are hated by everyone, especially the top brass. They will make your life absolutely miserable. My friends advised that if I thought High School was bad, the Air Force, with all the evangelicals that are in there, would be absolute hell. I was especially uncomfortable with lying to make other people happy. So I turned away and never looked back, and I'm very thankful I did. The hatefulness of the generals toward people like us that I see on tv just confirms that no gay person should serve in the military (unless you are willing to endure lying all the time to make other people happy). I admire any gay person that joins the military and is able to put up with the hate filled atmosphere.",
