   "Tony Benn once (or probably often) said \"the closest England came to democracy was in the English civil war\". He was refering to the continuing power of the monachy in the present day but in the context of representitive democracy he was also probably correct.\n At that time the electorate was solely made up of landowning, white, largely protestant males. Their interests, religeous, ecenomic and social would more or less have been as one. Therefore any representitive they elected, comming from a similar background would have the same ideals and values, the electorate was therefore represented with one voice. Conflict between emerging cliques or parties did not fundementally impinge on these basic values.\n Today we live in comunities that although segregated by wealth and race in that one street can have three and four hundred thousand pound houses with high wage earning occupants mainly from the indigenous population. A few streets away will be low value rented dwellings occupied by low or non wage earners from lower social groups and second third or fourth generation immigrants. Rural comunities will have people from the former group escaping from the cities intermingleing with the exsisting comunity who are far less well off and where there is rarely a non white face to be seen. There are many overlaps and groups not mentioned as some religons are in closely knit comunities but within other comunities. Some people will belong to two or more catagories with overlapping interests. All these catagories of people can be found within the same and possibly every parlimentary constituency.\n It follows therefore that an elected representitive cannot represent all the constituants or even the majority and there views. \n I submit that in the recent past, probably since the last war the nature of the representitive has changed, gradualy and perhaps un-noticed. As his (or her, but still in a minority) electorate changed and became more diverse, the candidate and (all parties) changed not to represent the view and interests of the majority of the electorate in a constituany but to ailienate as few as possible so securing the maximum number of votes. This results in the election of a representitive who cannot be solely identified with any social, religeous or ecenomic sector of the electorate. The approach is to say nice things to everybody and interpretting the parties maifesto in a way that will please everybody. \n The end resultis that all main stream parties sing from the same hymnsheet, only minor differences can be identified, there are of course exeptions but not many. Voting in one direction can be for a policy in which you are in agreement but another policy advocated by the same party you dissagree with. the opposing parties offer a similer dillema.\n I submit therefore the interests of the people are not being represented, any manifesto can mean anything and yet nothing but the party and candidates can still command votes. \n From the days following the civil war when the electorate identified with the candidate and vice verca to today where few can do so. From a time when the electorate was at one mind with the candidate and literally sent him to represent their views in parliament to today where the situation is reverced. \n The situation is reverces in that the electorate no longer send their representitive to Westminister to voice their views, the candidate promotes the party's manifesto and tries to persuade the electorate to vote on the basis of those policies and views. All the major parties do this and have so little funemental difference that making ones mind up is possibly more on personality than policy. The parties are therefore leading the electorate not as in a democracy where the people are arbetors of policy creating the policies.\n Take recent events in Britain. If you were against the war in Iraq you would have voted for a party that opposed it, the Liberal Democrats. If for it either Labour or Tory. If you oppose closer links with the European Comunity you could not vote Liberal Democrat you may be doubious about voting Labour so go with the Tories as a safer (not safe) bet. These are just two examples but the parties are closer or rather more blured on other issues. The point being the electorate have no real choice, their views are not heard, they are being led from the front. \n The role of the politician, parlimentary candidate has fundementally changed from one who is sent to parliament to be the voice of the majority to one who persuades people to vote for him or her simply because someone has to conduct the business of the country and this candidate/party will be better that that candidate/party.\n We the electorate are nolonger being represented, we are being led by carreer politicians.\n If the political process operated as it should, given the divercity of the electorate, the manifesto should be drawn up by the people and topics within it voted upon. The government would then be duty bound to impiment said manifesto. \n As a basic idea for discussion I would propose that any individual can petition the Speaker of the House of Commons with a proposal with a minimum of say half a million signitures, this then accepted for inclusion in the manifesto. The exact wording to be determined by the electoral commission but with agreement with the proposer. Perhaps ten or twenty proposels could be included in the manifesto. This would be offered to the electorate to vote upon every four years each item would require a separate aye or no. at the end there would be a manifesto of the majority of the peoples wishes. anything could be included, no exeptions. Certain fundimental safeguards would have to be written into a constitution or similar to safeguard less fortunate membars of society, a safety net and all proposals would have to be practical (abolition of income tax for over thirties would be a non starter).\n The head of state i.e. Speaker, Monarch or Presedent if we go that way would then offer the manifesto to all parties and any party that undertook to carry out the manifesto within the four year period would become the government. If more than one was deemed caperble of carrying it out then a second vote would be taken to determine the party (or possibly individual who would then pick a government) to become the government.\n This then takes the power away from carreer politicians and gives it back to the people. power would for the first time reside with the electorate.",
