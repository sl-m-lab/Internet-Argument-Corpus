Where he refuse to support \"hate crime\" legislation. \n \n His longstanding counseling from the 700 club goofs, and now his stance on FMA. With him it is not one thing. It is his collective record with the gay community that is poor.",

   "The only gay rights issue that Kerry did not support is same-sex marriage. He also supported mandatory civil union benefits for same-sex couples. He declared that he would let the states decide on same-sex marriage. Kerry supports revoking the don't ask, don't tell policy in the military (which of course kicks anyone out of the military who admits to being anything other than heterosexual). Kerry supports banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in a fashion similar to the way we ban discrimination based on sex, race, disabilities, etc. (hate crimes legislation is an example of this, as well as housing and workplace discrimination, though I'm not certain how involved the federal government plans on getting in these issues).\n \n Bush, on the other hand, supports a Constitutional Ammendment that bans both marriage and civil unions in every state, even if that state wishes to allow it. He opposes bills that would remove discrimination based on sexual orientation, and he supports the don't ask don't tell policy.\n \n Most importantly, Bush will certainly appoint Supreme Court judges which strongly oppose gay rights, making it possible for freedoms that same-sex currently hold to be stripped away. An example this is the Texas sodomy law, which removed the right of same-sex couples to have sex. It is my assumption that once Bush is finished appointing judges, the new court would not strike down that sodomy law, but uphold it. Once a law like that is in place, it will only be another small step to move to banning any sexual intimacy between same-sex couples.\n \n The reappointment of Bush is bad news for freedom and good news for tyranny.\n \n Gays will also be worse off based on the same set of flawed economics, poor foreign policy, and removal of freedoms that everyone else will face under the Bush administration. But that is another topic of conversation altogether, I think.",
