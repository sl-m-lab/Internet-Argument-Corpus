Your choice two logical fallacies, choose your belief\n \n Here are a couple of examples:\n \n \"Of course the Bible is true. Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n \n \"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist. Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\"\n \n \"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth. The earth doesn't have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles. Therefore no such flood occurred.\"\n \n other fallacies:\n \n Affirmation of the consequent\n \n This fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true.\" To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table . Here's an example:\n \n \"If the universe had been created by a supernatural being, we would see order and organization everywhere. And we do see order, not randomness -- so it's clear that the universe had a creator.\"\n \n Anecdotal evidence\n One of the simplest fallacies is to rely on anecdotal evidence. For example:\n \n \"There's abundant proof that God exists and is still performing miracles today. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. Her whole family went to church and prayed for her, and she was cured.\"\n \n Petitio principii / Begging the question\n \n This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached. Typically the premises of the argument implicitly assume the result which the argument purports to prove, in a disguised form. For example:\n \n \"The Bible is the word of God. The word of God cannot be doubted, and the Bible states that the Bible is true. Therefore the Bible must be true.\n \n Ah yes not to forget, \n \n Shifting the burden of proof\n \n The burden of proof is always on the person asserting something. Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion. The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n \n \"OK, so if you don't think the grey aliens have gained control of the US government, can you prove it?\" \n \n As you can see your question is a logical fallacy, \"Why do you believe in atheism?

   "Atheism is a logical fallacy....Theism can be...it would depend on the the reasons for ones beliefs....\n\n Perhaps you could bring our atheists here to a gnashing of teeth by substantiating your claim that atheism is a logical fallacy.\n \nPlease, don't look foolish...go lookup logical fallacies...As Parcum's original post most surely is a prime example of a fallacy...\n Need Proof?\n Reread the entire thread. Its been stated more than once as to why.\n\n Have you read my last post? I just wrote precisely why there was no logical fallacy in his original post. There has been some confusion with the use of \"logical fallacy\" trigger.\n \nMy statement was hypothetical; thus, proof isn't a factor; in addition, my statement most certaintly is not a logical fallacy, I states that *if* somebody believes FOO then to them god does not exist; thus, to them there is a 0% chance god will appear\n\n Your earlier quote from your post certainly did not contain the word \"If\" and it wasn't a conditional statement. You stated clearly that Atheism is here merely to state \"there is no prove that god exist; therefore, god does not exist.\" Not only was there no \"if\" or intention of a hypothetical situation, but it was a direct statement about atheism.\n \nask yourself what was Parcum's reasons for posting the message?\n\n That's really quite irrelevant. There was no statement of the existence of God in Parcum's post, except from in his signature - which I didn't regard. No statement = no burden of proof for him. This is in my post above.\n \nThat's not really where I was going with it. People have an urge to find answers, even if the answers are unknowable. I don't think there is any instinct to believe in a higher power.\n\n Perhaps not, but since it appears to be common sense since so many people have believed in the existence of a Supreme Being - it might well be logical to conclude that it is instinctive.",

You're presuming that all religions are equally likely of being correct - which is most definitely wrong. For example, my religion states that when I'm ten, I'll be king of the world. Once I'm king, I'm going to learn to fly. I'm 16 now, and it hasn't happened. It's near enough safe to say that my religion is incorrect.\n \nI didnt forget, I even accounted for it. the possibility that God doesnt exist is 50-50. \n\n Perhaps you could explain to us how you know of such a probability? Simply because we know that either God exists or God does not exist, the rules of probability say nothing that would it imply that the chances of either being true are 50-50. \n \nthe possibility of evidence that he doesnt exist is zero (I think I stated it wrong in the previous post...)\n\n That's wrong too, both Crim and I explained why above.\n \n More later.",

Not only are you going to have to prove the law of noncontradiction wrong, which is an accepted principle in the Euclidean frame, but this would also suggest that Reduction Ad Absurdum is wrong. You've got pretty much all mathematic theory going against you. I've explained to you why saying that you cannot prove the non-existence of God is clearly wrong. It was just an atheistic plea, (not proving a negative) which was proved wrong. It pretty much self-destructs itself.\n \nGood, because the man basically in his opinon stated that nothing comes from nothing...so everything comes from something...therefore god exist .\n\n Well, I'm not really sure if that's true. Aquinas suggested that at one point, things came ex nihilo - from nothing. It proves problamatic in itself since \"comes\" is a time-dependant word, so it's really not going to work. Plus, \"coming from\" imples \"something\" anyways. However, if there was nothing - effect-causation didn't exist. What we're left with, either the Universe came (i) ex nihilo or it is (ii) eternal. (i) has logical problems, but (ii) seems to be challenged quite seriously by both logic and empirical evidence. \n \nIf god dos exist, how does he explain aliens if they are found to truly exist.\n\n I don't understand your reasoning.

Not only are you going to have to prove the law of noncontradiction wrong, which is an accepted principle in the Euclidean frame, but this would also suggest that Reduction Ad Absurdum is wrong. You've got pretty much all mathematic theory going against you. I've explained to you why saying that you cannot prove the non-existence of God is clearly wrong.

It pretty much self-destructs itself.\n\n I dont have to prove that the law of non-contradiction is wrong, because I dont believe its wrong. however, I asked you how it can be applied to the issue of the Existence of God, and noone has offered even an attempt to prove the existence of God is self-contradictory. I am truly interested in seeing how that law can be applied in this particular senario, and I say that with no sarcasm\n \nIndeed, I would be very interested in meeting the Theist who claims to understand God completely.

It is a mental state beyond hope or belief, when you actually *know* that something is true, even when no evidence supports that hypothesis\n \n futhermore, the Bible goes on to say that if you have already seen what you hope for, then you are not applying faith. thats because faith can only kick in when evidence is absent.\n \n this is deirectly contradictory to what is logical. faith, by its very nature and definition, opposes logic\n \n ironically, even though they never admit it, atheism actually requires more faith than theism. both are logical fallacies, but while the chance of proving theism is infinitesmally slim, the chance of proving no theism is zero...\n\n \n Here's the problem with your argument (logically speaking). You bandy about the term \"no evidence\" llike that is what Hebrews is talking about. It is not. It is a reference to direct evidence which is needed for proof. However, indirect evidence can lead one to hope and a conviction of things not seen. \n \n An example is that trafic lights in the states are programmed and they are programmed by someone other than me or you (probably). Neither you nor I insist upon direct evidence of the proof of the reliability of lights, yet we rely on their reliability. We have indirect evidence through our experience, and as we gain more and more experience we rely more and more. This is the nature of Faith. Initially, we have to trust someone else because we have no experience, hence someone tells us about the nature of trafic lights (or someone tells us about the nature of God). We then try it out (faith) and hope we are correct. As we try and learn that we are correct then we rely more and more. We grow in Faith. There is the initial step. It is not illogical to take that step, after all someone we trust has told us information and we know that person is not going to lie to us.\n \n This is the problem I have with street evangelists. They have not developed any relationship with anyone before sharing the Gospel. The missionaries that I know personally, have always worked first to establish a relationship, to become trustworthy. Then when people ASK about God the information has meaning. The same is true with traffic lights. Your parents, or a teacher etc. tells you about this. There is an established relationship with a person that you know wants your best. There is nothing illogical about that.",

The writings of Aristophanes are considered legitimate but he wrote farsical plays. People will argue the meaning of the bible but there is strong evidence to its legitimacy and authenticity. One measure (archaelogicaly speaking) for a manuscript's authenticity is the shear number of reproductions that it has early on. There are more for the biblical books than any other book in history (by the thousands). Another measure is the agreement in wording between the various manuscripts. There is a statistically significant greater accuracy between books of the bible than any other book in history. To the degree that it is 99.999% certain that the accuracy is maintained. There are other secular books that contain similar statistics. The books of the bible can be compared to other historical manuscripts that are considered authentic and see how they compare. You will find significant data out there. Another measure is the content. The biblical authors did not make themselves look all that great. Or the kings of the time. Look at King David. The bible calls him a man after God's own heart. Yet he was a murderer and adulterer. These are all clues to the authenticity. \n \n What that means practically and spiritually has always been a debate. Even the ancient Hebrew Rabbis debated the nature of God. \n \n Plus, here Unker and I have been discussing this together. If you don't like to use scripture references then don't.

Just because we don't have proof does not make it illogical. We often can draw conclusions, logically, without having proof. To use your example, if the person was someone you trusted a great great deal, it may not be that bad to trust them. The logic comes in, not with whether or not the gun is loaded (as you really have no clue), but in whether or not you should trust this person with this situation.\n \n Another example, My wife trusts me to provide for her. She does not work and I do. (By and at her request I might add, not because of a chauvinist attitude lest someone jab me there). She does not trust me to pay the bills on time. I am a notorious procrastinator and have incurred late fees in the past because of this. Her trust of me as a provider is logical as is her distrust that I won't procrastinate. She has evidence that I might behave in certain ways although she cannot predict what will happen. I often do pay the bills on time, but I sometimes don't. Her distrust is logical.\n \n Logic is a manner of thinking. It is why Math is such an important subject. One will not likely use all of the mathematical operations, but learning the subject forces one to learn to think logically. This is essential to living in this world. Therefore, I owuld say that theism and atheism are both logical but both require faith. Both require that one trust someone other than themselves about the nature of reality, in spite of the atheist claim that there is no reality and everything is subjective. If that were true then traffic lights might exhibit unpredictable behavior.",

   "I don't think you are being rude. emoticon_smile \n \n I mentioned the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous as they are quite famous and are a good example of the process of growing in faith. I was also being repetitive trying to explain in different ways so that you could see what I was saying. \n \n Faith is putting feet to your beliefs. That is a reasonable summary. \n \n If I say I believe I will win the lottery. WHOOO HOOOO! great news. Do you believe me if you find out I never bought a lottery ticket? Faith is what actually makes me buy the ticket. Faith is evidence of things not seen. In other words, I hope to win the lottery. How do I show my hope? I buy a ticket. That is faith. Faith is not the same as belief. One can give intellectual assent and that is belief. It has nothing to do with I actually am willing to put my money where my mouth is.\n \n Does that make more sense?\n\n \n Thats better, thank you, i understand what your trying to say now.\n \n Faith is trust, so you trust what you believe to be the truth, so you beileve in god as a matter of faith and trust. Thats understandable.\n \n I would assume that as the chances of winning a lottery are practically nil, would you also say that you will never possibly know if the trust you have in the teachings of the bible are correct, what i mean is your faith in what you believe, is so strong that you are prepared to live your life by it.\n \n I dont mean literally, but would it be fair to say your faith gives you a guide as to how you live your life?\n \n If it does, do you think you are a better person for it, or would you still be the same person if you didnt believe in god?",

A friend of mine says \"we are just a blind squirrel that got an acorn.\" Meaning I did nothing to deserve what I have. The faith is a gift. The growth of the faith is fostered by my repeated reliance on God. I think the real question is \"Is God a guide as to how to live?\" The answer to that would be definitely.\n \n Is my faith so strong that I am willing to live my life by it. I already am living in faith. I will mess up and mess up big. I will hurt some people badly and those that are closest to me will be hurt the worst. The truth is that is true for everyone.

NO one is better than anyone else. I sin too. Sin earns man death. Nothing you can do about it. However, God has given a gift. A free gift. It is not earned. It is Jesus. In Him we have eternal life. You can do nothing to earn it and nothing to unearn it. It does say that Christ is the only way. It says nothing about it being the only religion. It says that Jesus is the only way to God. \n \n The choice is still left up to you. No one forces you to choose christ. If you don't want to then don't. I talk to people about Jesus because of the incredible impact he has had on me. When you find that thing that you enjoy and has been of such great support to you, don't you want to share it with others? This is true of most evangelists (not televangelists mind you). There is no contradiction. God does not want you to sin. But you were not given, in and of yourself, the ability to deal with sin. Only God can do that. Jesus is again the way.",

That does not make the argument circular.\n\n Since I have a little extra time, I think I'll go on with this. Your terms need to be thoroughly defined. I define God as Supreme Being. I think that God is Love, and I define love as that which facilitates goodness (not original to me). I also define omnipotence as \"Supreme Power\". Darkness is the absence of light - a lie is the obstruction of truth, evil is goodness denied. Evil, in itself, is not really a substance. It is but a deprivation. When an apple rots, the rottenness itself is not a substance, but simply the privation of freshness. Furthermore, \"coldness\" does not exist; it is but the absence of heat/energy. When we call a person \"cold\" we mean that they are one who is lacking in emotion or in sensitivity. In the same way, evil is goodness denied.\n \n I fail to see your logical grounding for axiom 2. Why would this God not allow evil? If we run with the free will defense for a second, we can progress this argument. If a Supreme Being allowed this evil to occur, but for it to have a purpose, then things are \"all gravy\" and there's really no problem. On another note, if this God provided humans with free will moral agency, then it would not mean that he is malicious. What I mean, is that free moral agency is neither good nor evil. It is a mechanism, not an aesthetic, by which love and goodness can occur. Of course, it allows the contrapositive to occur since it is necessary. One does not call a line crooked without some idea of a straight line. It can be easily argued that evil exists for us to consciously identify it from good. Paul writes, \"For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\" \n \n We might get into debate on how there can therefore be \"good without evil\", but that, I believe, is just confusion in semantics.\n \n Finally, the POE can never be used to refute the existence of an almighty being. It only poses as \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) to those who follow the God of Classical Theism. Therefore, it does not prove the non-existence of a God.",

That does not make the argument circular.\n\n first off you assume 2 is true, perhaps based on your idea of the role of God. We cannot say that a good and omnipotent God cannot allow evil to exist. the mere fact that evil exists is the demonstration that good also exists, and without evil (which is relative to good) there could be no good (which is relative to evil) and if no good exists, then no good and omnipotent God exists. evil must exist in order for good to exist\n \n forget the above paragraph (you probably heard that a thousand times anyway), lets follow the logic that you started:\n 1. God exists\n 2. But evil exists\n 3. Therefore God does not exist\n \n but it doesnt stop here either\n \n 4. Therefore there is no \"sin\" or \"wrong\" (since these are defined by God)\n 5. therefore evil does not exist\n \n once again, there is no way evil can even be defined in the absence of the existence of God. If God doesnt exist, then the events that we classify as evil are not evil at all, because there is nothing wrong with them, and there is no standard for good that can define evil as it is\n \n another flaw of your logic is the premise it starts from. you start off saying that God exists, then seemingly tie him in to the evil in the world. If God doesnot exist, how do you account for all the evil in the world? who do you hold responsible or accountable? Athiests usually site the evil in the world as \"how could God allow it to happen\". But God doesnt exist... so who allows evil to happen? is it just evil people? is it just bad things happening to unfortunate victims?",
