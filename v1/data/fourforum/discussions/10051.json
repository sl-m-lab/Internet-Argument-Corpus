   "Why do schools continue to oppress their gay students? This type of behavior only reinforces the negative perception of gay students and gays in general. I really hope they redistribute the yearbooks with this photo included. They didn't have a problem including straight students kisses in the book. \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/education/24yearbook.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\n \n NEWARK, June 23 - It started with a kiss.\n \n Skip to next paragraph \n \n A black-marker splotch covered the photo, above, in students' yearbooks. \n Andre Jackson, a senior at East Side High School, leaned over his boyfriend's shoulder one day several months ago and kissed him on the lips. He took a picture of the smooch with his digital camera.\n \n Like other students, Mr. Jackson later paid $150 to have his own special page of photos in the school yearbook. He decided to include the picture of the kiss, to make not a political statement, but a personal one.\n \n \"I didn't intend to say, 'Oh hey, look at me, I'm gay,' \" said Mr. Jackson, 18. \"It was just a picture showing my emotion, saying that I'm happy, you know, whatever. It was to look back on as a memory.\"\n \n On Thursday evening, when the seniors gathered at a restaurant here for the Senior Banquet, students received the yearbooks they had bought for around $85. But the picture of Mr. Jackson kissing his boyfriend was gone. School officials had blacked it out. Roughly 250 yearbooks were distributed, and all of them had a black-marker splotch covering every inch of the photo.\n \n \"I was upset,\" Mr. Jackson said. \"I was hurt. I felt embarrassed and abused.\"\n \n He and another student said the photo was blacked out at the restaurant by several teachers and the principal, Mario Santos, as the yearbooks were being handed out to the seniors when they entered. The other student, Benilde Barroqueiro, said a teacher told her: \"It's not that we want to do this. It's that we have to do this.\"\n \n Saturday, after The Newark Star-Ledger published an article about the controversy, Mr. Jackson's blacked-out kiss became the subject of debate, outrage and inquiry.\n \n The decision to blot out the photo was made by Marion A. Bolden, the Newark Public Schools superintendent. Ms. Bolden said that an assistant superintendent had alerted her to the picture on Thursday afternoon. \"I thought that the photo was suggestive,\" Ms. Bolden said.\n \n She said she made her decision without seeing the entire yearbook, and looked at only the one page.\n \n The thin, hardcover yearbook, titled \"Take Another Look,\" features many pictures of the Class of 2007, including several of heterosexual couples embracing and kissing. On the page immediately opposite Mr. Jackson's, a young man and a young woman kiss on a couch, his hand on her leg as she sits on his lap.\n \n A New Jersey gay rights group, Garden State Equality, demanded that Ms. Bolden publicly apologize to Mr. Jackson and his boyfriend, David Escobales, 19, of Allentown, Pa. The group is also calling on Ms. Bolden to redistribute the yearbooks with the photo of the kiss included, describing the decision to black out the picture as \"homophobic\" and \"unlawful.\"\n \n \"The school district's erasure of this student and his boyfriend is a tragic metaphor of the school district trying to erase the lesbian and gay community from its schools, and we won't stand for it,\" said Steven Goldstein, the chairman and chief executive of Garden State Equality.\n \n Ms. Bolden said she did not intend for the officials' actions to be taken as anti-gay. \"I'm a superintendent that talks about tolerance,\" she said. \"I don't have a problem at all.\"\n \n She said she felt that the photo was provocative for a high school yearbook, regardless of whether it showed heterosexual or homosexual kissing. But she said it was a decision that was made too quickly and without taking into consideration other couples' pictures. She said she was told on Thursday that neither of the men were students, adding that she would have been more hesitant to black out a picture of a student.\n \n \"It looked like two men kissing,\" she said. \"To me, it looked fairly illicit. It was pointed out as problematic, so maybe I read more into it.\" \n \n Ms. Bolden said she wanted to meet with Mr. Jackson and apologize if necessary. \"He was personally hurt,\" she said. \"That bothers me very much.\"\n \n Mr. Jackson said he came out when he was 16 and that he and Mr. Escobales have been together since October. Mr. Jackson is graduating on Wednesday, and he plans to attend Berkeley College here.\n \n It was unclear Saturday if the school would redistribute the yearbooks.\n \n Mr. Jackson said he threw away his in disgust. \"I didn't feel right,\" he said. \"What I wanted to see wasn't there.\"",

   "...[I]f we were to use the Bible as our only source for the history of kissing, we might conclude that same-sex kissing had always been the norm and that no actual man had kissed an actual woman since Jacob kissed Rachel at Gen. 29:11 late in the third millennium BCE.\n \n Of the forty-six kisses registered in the Holy Writ, only six are between men and women in a non-family setting (Gen. 29:11; Prov. 7:13; Song 1:2; Song 8:1; Luke 7:38; Luke 7:45) and only two of those are demonstrably sexual (Gen. 29:11; Prov. 7:13). Of the remaining number, two are acts of worship to graven images (1Kgs. 19:18 & Hosea 13:2), one is between allegorical constructs of Righteousness and Peace (Ps. 85:10), one is a slightly puzzling act of self- osculation in the book of Job (31:27), and two occur between women (Ruth 1:14 & 19). We are left with twenty-nine kisses (including those in which Judas betrays Jesus) that involve men nuzzling up to express affection or respect, either partially or exclusively between themselves. The combined total of same-sex kisses is thirty-one, which renders a 67.39% ratio in favor of the practice including the seven (15.21%) that require it as a sign of membership in a Christian community.\n \n The Bible is quite specific about the way to salvation: believe in the Lord (Jn. 3:16) and give each other a kiss from time to time.\n http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/2554/frame/fkiss.html",

The laws say that the reason you don't hire someone can't be their race, religion, etc (etc depending on local wordings, some include sexual orientation and some don't).

I will absolutely deny that my intent was to consider gays and profanity to be comparitively negative. My goal was to determine wheter there was ANYTHING that children should not be exposed to. So far the only thing the assembled believe that children should be spared is homophobia. Hardly surprising given the title of this thread, but the fact that no one wil hazard an opinion on any thing that impacts anything but their special interest is telling. \n \n Note the value judgment was made not by me but by Kronus. For you to suggest that the commentary regarding those who engage in homosexuality and those who engage in profanity is negative in nature indicates that YOU judge the latter to be negative. \n \n Hence my curiosity. How do you come by your value judgment? Is ANYTHING inappropriate for a school setting? Why or why not?\n \n As to the lesser items of distraction:\n \n This has already been exposed as false.\n You are pretending to have better knowledge than the dictionary, which EXPLICITLY defines \"-phobia\" as including an irrational aversion to?\n \n This makes no logical sense.\n \n Yes, your opinions are fact, mine are false. Only YOU can expose anything as false. \n \n You did manage to find \"aversion\" as the second listed definition for a word whose primary definition is fear. Likely you missed the fact that the words usage (as I have labored to establish) varies by context. It is a subltetly you are either willingly missing or ignorant of. \n \n When you speak of a phobia you are either dealing from a psychological perspective in which case you are dealing with fear, Chemistry in which case you are indeed dealing with aversion or perhaps some other biological reference to cell membranes being hydrophobic, etc. In dealing with a mental condition which you must be when dealing with a human phobia, you are dealing with a fear. Homophobia, by your definition, would appear to thus be the only phobia that a non-professional can diagnose and for which no fear is required. \n \n Well, lets digress then. You earlier claimed the MW had no reference to homophilia. Return thereto and enter \"Homophile\". Then reference chapter 1 of any basic greek language book for a discussion of phile, philia, phillic, phobe, phobia, phobic. \n \n Or you could simply take the word of the (straight) doctor who coined the term:http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchiv...w/020397in.htm\n \n After all, he should know what he meant to describe, right?\n \n Well lets see he references:\n \"some phobic dread\"\n \"a woman I met there was terrified about being alone in a room with me. \"\n I realized this was something that had a very deep root, a classical phobia, but of all the phobias, the most destructive being homophobia. \"Claustrophobia or agoraphobia---if you can't go to the theater or outside---or you have almost any kind of dread but it doesn't ordinarily get converted into the violence. These were recognized as phobias, but this---homophobia-- was not recognized as one.\"\n \n Seems to me that the common thread is fear once again. So if the gentleman WHO COINED THE TERM recognizes the root of fear, perhaps your disagreement should be with him rather than me.\n \n \n And that whole \"we would only have one word\" argument? That was kind of funny.\n You ever hear of SYNONYMS?\n \n Indeed. Thank you for the suggestion. The following are the synonyms for Phobia as listed on dictionary.com\n \n anxiety, aversion, avoidance, awe, bag, bee, detestation, disgust, dislike, distaste, dread, fear, grabber, hang-up*, hatred, horror, irrationality, loathing, neurosis, obsession, repulsion, resentment, revulsion, terror, thing*, thing about*, tiger \n \n Note that the synonyms do not have THE SAME meaning. Similar perhaps, related? mayhap. Do you mean to suggest that Anxiety is the same as hatred? avoidance the same as awe??? Could it be that these words all are used for there own distinct purpose to convey a specific meaning? Hmmm....I suppose in calling me a homophobe, you take me for one in awe of homosexuals. I am in awe of the reasoning you have demonstrated heretofore. \n \n Deconstructing the word for people who don't like gays and work to deny them equal rights doesn't mean such people magically don't exist. If you don't like \"homephobe,\" tell us what term you think should be used for people like that, and we'll call you that instead.\n \n Why the persistent need to treat your opponent as a label rather than an individual?

It is a subltetly you are either willingly missing or ignorant of.\n\n Not \"ignorant of\", E Mutz. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n But the POINT, which you seem to be missing, is that BOTH are acceptable usages in their varying contexts.\n And as I pains-takingly EXPLICITLY took the time to explain to you, the HOMOPHOBIA context DOES INCLUDE both possibilities.\n \n Again, I cannot help it if you want to argue with the dictionary.\n You keep trying to pretend that I am somehow ignorant of something, but in the end analysis it is truly you against the dictionary.\n \n \n \nWhen you speak of a phobia you are either dealing from a psychological perspective in which case you are dealing with fear, Chemistry in which case you are indeed dealing with aversion or perhaps some other biological reference to cell membranes being hydrophobic, etc.\n\n No.\n When I speak of homophobia, I am using the dictionary meaning.\n YOU are improperly trying to claim meanings and contexts by throwing out your opinions on the matter, ignoring the evidence.\n \n And your claims of \"psychological perspective\" are also false. You're just plain wrong.\n And it's not me telling you this. It's the APA, so don't even try to lay in with your lame falsehoods again.\n \n Psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia -- the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals -- is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the August 1996 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.\n http://www.philosophy-religion.org/handouts/homophobia.htm\n \n \n \nWell, lets digress then. You earlier claimed the MW had no reference to homophilia. Return thereto and enter \"Homophile\". Then reference chapter 1 of any basic greek language book for a discussion of phile, philia, phillic, phobe, phobia, phobic. \n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n I took your advice, and this is what I got...\n homophile: \n Etymology: hom- + 2-phil\n : GAY 4b \n \n Gay:\n 4 a : HOMOSEXUAL <gay men< b : of, relating to, or used by homosexuals <the gay rights movement< <a gay bar<\n In which case, in the context of your original comment, it makes no sense.\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Maybe you should make yourself better acquainted with the dictionary...\n Most of these disputes are centering around you arguing with the dictionary, which is :xbanghead \n \n \n \nOr you could simply take the word of the (straight) doctor who coined the term:http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchiv...w/020397in.htm\n After all, he should know what he meant to describe, right?\n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n Link doesn't work.\n \n \n \nSeems to me that the common thread is fear once again. So if the gentleman WHO COINED THE TERM recognizes the root of fear, perhaps your disagreement should be with him rather than me.\n\n Words DO evolve. You know that, right?\n I mean take the word \"gay\" for example. Originally had nothing to do with homosexuals. Then it was used as a derogatory term towards homosexuals. Then homosexuals essentially took the word back, and now it's not necessarily inherently derogatory at all.\n \n If the guy who coined the term (over 30 decades ago) meant it to be one thing, and then it evolved afterwards, I see no reason why we should pretend we're stuck 30 years in the past.\n \n \n And that whole \"we would only have one word\" argument? That was kind of funny.\n You ever hear of SYNONYMS?\n \nIndeed. Thank you for the suggestion. The following are the synonyms for Phobia as listed on dictionary.com\n anxiety, aversion, avoidance, awe, bag, bee, detestation, disgust, dislike, distaste, dread, fear, grabber, hang-up*, hatred, horror, irrationality, loathing, neurosis, obsession, repulsion, resentment, revulsion, terror, thing*, thing about*, tiger \n\n Thanks for that. But not sure how you see this as proving your point.\n I mean, a LOT of these synonyms demonstrate that the meaning is much more complex than JUST fear.\n And I have no doubts that in some cases it IS an issue of \"fear\".\n The point to get through your head is that NOT ALL of the issues require \"fear\".\n Do you understand the difference?\n \n \n \nNote that the synonyms do not have THE SAME meaning.\n\n Really? I don't get where you think you're going with this. I feel like I should be making these arguments.\n The synonyms DO NOT all have the same meaning.\n YOU are the one insisting that -phobia has to have ONLY ONE meaning. \"fear\".\n I am the one trying to get you to realize that it has MORE than one usage.\n \n I feel like you should be taking the medicine you think you're trying to give me... ;) \n \n \n \nDo you mean to suggest that Anxiety is the same as hatred? avoidance the same as awe??? Could it be that these words all are used for there own distinct purpose to convey a specific meaning?\n\n No, No, and YES.\n So with the last YES in mind, can you please finally understand and accept that \"fear\" is NOT THE ONLY specific meaning for \"-phobia\"???\n \n \n \nWhy the persistent need to treat your opponent as a label rather than an individual? Do you require a label to engage in debate?\n\n It's more of an accurate assessment of the situation.\n If somebody called me a \"pedophile-ophobe\", I would gladly admit that I whole-heartedly endorse a variety of discriminatory practices against pedophiles.\n And then I would SUPPORT my beliefs with reasons and facts.\n \n But for homophobes on some issues, like on this subject here, there is a LOT of obfuscation of the real issue.\n I don't get why they don't just admit the truth? WHY all the avoidance?\n Just admit: \"Yes. We covered up a gay kiss. There were straight kisses that were in plain sight that we had no problem with. It was the GAY aspect that was the problem.\"\n WHY is that so hard to admit?",

   "SUMMARY: \"We have to own up to the fact that it was a homophobic moment,\" Newark's Marion Bolden says of the censored yearbook kiss. \n \n The Newark, N.J., city schools superintendent apologized to a gay student Tuesday for having staffers black out a picture of the student kissing his boyfriend from the high school yearbook, calling the incident \"a homophobic moment.\" \n \n Superintendent Marion A. Bolden said she spoke with senior Andre Jackson, 18, a day after she issued him a written apology that said she regretted the decision to censor his personal page in the East Side High School yearbook. \n \n \"We have to own up to the fact that it was a homophobic moment,\" she said. \"That's what everybody's afraid to say. There are sensitivity issues we need to talk about as a result of this.\" \n \n Jackson on Monday had refused to accept Bolden's written apology, saying he wanted her to apologize publicly. Bolden said she arrived at the school Tuesday to find him reluctant to speak with her, but that the two spoke after she made a public apology to the assembled students. \n \n \"He said he felt a lot better,\" Bolden said. \"He said he's had more issues around his coming out from outside school than in school, so it was particularly hard for him.\" \n \n During her public remarks, she said the picture of Jackson kissing his boyfriend was not appropriate for the yearbook and that, if it was to be removed, two pictures of heterosexual couples kissing should have been removed as well. \n \n Jackson, who paid $150 for the page, and others noted that the yearbook was filled with pictures of heterosexual couples kissing. \n \n The district said it would reissue an uncensored version of the 2007 yearbook to any student who wants one. \n \n Garden State Equality, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, condemned the censorship, saying it violated the state's Law Against Discrimination. Attempts to reach Jackson through Garden State Equality as well as friends were unsuccessful Tuesday night.
