   "Excerpt (emphases mine):\n \n \nThe latest research shows that people's erotic and affectional \"personalities\" are as varied and unique as a fingerprint or someone's voice, and that no one person is, as she puts it, \"100 percent heterosexual 100 percent of the time.\" People's erotic attractions can be surprisingly fluid when it comes to erotic attractions, and science fails to support the conventional wisdom that people's sexuality can be neatly placed in rigid categories, she said. \n \n Emerging research from hundreds of studies debunks a number of notions about sexual orientation, Garnets said. One is that sexual orientation is dichotomous--that one is either exclusively homosexual or heterosexual. Instead, new research finds that sexual orientations exist along a continuum, like colors in the spectrum of a rainbow. People can be sexually, affectionally or erotically attracted to people of the same gender, the other gender or both genders, she said. \n \n New research also challenges the idea that people's sexual behavior is what defines sexual orientation, Garnets said. Sexual orientation has many dimensions that are related to their sexual orientation, including erotic and affectional fantasies, emotional attachments, self-identification and current relationship status.\n http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/erotic.html\n \n I realize, of course, that these studies were performed by professionally trained scientists, who are pea-brained next to the overwhelming intellect of our resident idiot savant, who sees all and knows all in such matters, and will therefore trash them automatically.",

It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female) and the social gender role (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior). \n \n Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality and includes various forms of bisexuality. \n \n Sexual orientation is different from sexual behavior because it refers to feelings and self-concept.

   "homosexuality, as defined in the dictionary:\n \n Sexual orientation to persons of the same sex. \n Sexual activity with another of the same sex. \n \n \n orientation, as defined by the dictionary\n \n The direction followed in the course of a trend, movement, or development. \n A tendency of thought; a general inclination: a Marxist orientation. \n \n there were 6 other definition entries, but these best suit the context. orientation can then be described as a tendency, direction or inclination\n \n homosexuality can therefore be defined in 2 ways. first, if a person has sexual activity with a member of the same sex, thats homosexuality. second, if a member has a sexual inclination or tendency to have sex with a member of the same sex, that is also homosexuality. perhaps for the second definition we can also use the word urge\n \n now, is it possible to have sex with a member of the same sex, and not have a general inclination to have sex with members of the same sex? also, if a person has an urge or impulse to have sex with a member of the same sex, but doesnt commit the act itself, does that mean they are homosexual? i say yes to both, according to the dictionary, but i'd like to hear other's views. \n \n finally, at what point does a particular sexual inclination to a particular gender become \"general\"? i suppose it would mean predominantly? a one-time homosexual encounter, or even an occassional occurence, may not be an indicator of a general orientation, because its not predominant. would that mean that you can commit homosexual acts without the orientation?\n\n \n This is really a non-issue. I have met hundreds of gays and straights and not once did I find someone that didn't know what their sexual orientation is. How many heterosexuals do you think would answer if asked \"well I'm not sure\". You have to be kidding. I do admit however that there are some gay people that claim they don't know. This usually is just them trying to supress their attractions to same sex due to overwhelming pressure from family, friends and society in general. They know what their attraction is, they just won't admit it.",

Either you're attacted to the same sex or you're not. You know whether you are or not. If you are, and not to the opposite sex, you're homosexual (whether you act on it or not).

Are you permanently marked as \"gay\" because of those early experiences? How much behavior do you have to have with the opposite sex before the label is no longer appropriate.

Can you?[/quote]\n I think that you should look up the scientific definition of continuous. Too many people on this thread don't know what it means. :xbanghead \n A continuous variable means that any value in between two points is possible.

The variations are discrete and not continuous.

For example, if I mostly was attracted to men and I decided I want to only date and have relationships with men, I probably would identify as and call myself gay.\n \n\n So, your sexual identity is a choice, but some mysterious, yet unidentified genome, is responsible for your orientation. \n \n\n The \"not\" part is absolutely correct. There are many, many people who live their lives as straight who are in complete denial of their feeling or who are closeted. I know this because when they come out, that is the story they tell.\n \n It sounds like you do not have any close gay friends or you might know this. It's sorta homo 101.\n\n \n Actually, I occasionally go drag racing (cars, that is) with a gay man that is unaware that I know he's gay.

It really makes no difference to me either way.\n I've always wondered about those so called \"closet gays\" that married and had families.

   "To take your example: \n if a guy has sex with women but fantasizes about guys, then thats homosexual. if a guy has sex with guys and fantasizes about women, then thats homosexual.\n Isn't the following also true about the exact same situation:\n \n if a guy has sex with women but fantasizes about guys, then thats heterosexual. if a guy has sex with guys and fantasizes about women, then thats heterosexual.\n\n \n For my own personal definition, sexual orientation essentially works virtually solely from \"desire\", as people can have sex without any sexual attraction.\n I realize that leaves part of the definition off (i.e. sexual conduct), but that's my personal perspective.\n \n It's kind of like if a person \"has sex with\" their hand. Does that mean they are \"sexually oriented\" to their hand? In my perspective, no.\n If a guy had sex with another person and fantasized about his hand, THAT would be a \"sexual orientation\" towards his hand...\n \n Sexual conduct can help determine what a person's \"attraction\" is, but it can be a trivial factor, IMO. As in if a guy claims he is straight, has sex with both genders in fairly equivalent abundance, when the opportunity exists to have sex with only one gender, then that demonstrates that his \"claim\" is inaccurate to me.\n If an \"ex-gay\" guy has sex with a \"wife\", but fantasizes about having sex with a guy during sex with his wife, and occasionally sneaks off to have sex with other men, he would still be \"gay\" in my opinion...\n \n I have had sex with women in the past, but when I realized that I had to fantasize about guys to achieve climax, I knew there was no significant part of me that was 'heterosexual'.\n To me, a bisexual would be somebody who fantasizes about sex with BOTH men and women. (Not necessarily at the same time...)\n \n Including \"sex acts\" in the definition of \"sexual orientation\" muddies the waters, as a \"sex act\" can be driven by SOCIETY'S sexual inclinations, and a person's desire to fit into society, as it can be just a means of \"getting off\" or of having sex with somebody who you are genuinely attracted to.\n \n And in my perspective/definition, society's leanings towards heterosexual bias doesn't influence an individual's \"sexual orientation\"...",

However, identical twins, whether raised together or raised apart, showed about the same outcome (Pillard 1996, 1997).\"\n \n Bouchard, T. J., Jr., and M.
