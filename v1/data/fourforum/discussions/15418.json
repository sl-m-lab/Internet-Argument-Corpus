   "For the nutcases in the Republican party:\n \nRand's work is very popular among conservatives now. It forms a core justification for their \"on your own\" philosophy praising the wealthy and discarding the rest. So it is useful to explore the formation and core of this philosophy. Early in her writings Rand became fascinated with a serial killer named William Hickman.Rand wrote that the serial killer was an \"ideal man,\" a superior form of human because he didn't let society impose their morals on him. He didn't worry about what others thought and just did as he pleased.\n \n \"Other people do not exist for him, and he does not see why they should,\" Rand wrote. Hickman had \"no regard whatsoever for all that society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. He has the true, innate psychology of a Superman. He can never realize and feel 'other people.'\" She considered these to be good qualities! And so does her cult.\n\n Alan Greenspan and Things Forgotten | OurFuture.org\n \n Jesus Christ vs. Ayn Rand, from a priest, Father Cleet Kiley:\n \nThere was a time in this country when we all believed in something called the common good. And we believed that if we all put in our fair share, we would be a just country, a strong country, a nation at peace with itself.\n \n There was a time in this country when we all believed it was right to take care of our elderly; to secure their retirement; to provide them with health care; to give them a dignity and quality of life.\n\n Ayn Rand's Poison: GOP Faces Backlash for Their Obsessive Worship of a Psycho | | AlterNet\n \n Ayn Rand would have used the 25th chapter of the book of Matthew in the New Testament as toilet paper.\n \n And the current big name in the Ayn Rand cult, Paul Ryan, congressman from Wisconsin, is afraid of a Bible.",

   "Atlas Shrugged, like Sir Thomas More's Utopia, is not very successful as a pure work of fiction or as a pure work of philosophy, but it is a very subversive novel in combining fiction and philosophy in a single work.\n \n And it is very successful in both attracting people to read it, and in compelling those who have read it to question their beliefs.\n \n An atheist might say that the bible does the same thing. \n \n If you are looking to Rand for economics, you are mistaken, she was not an economist. She was an author of fiction and an armchair philosopher.\n \n It seems absurd to me to level criticisms at an early 20th century science fiction author for penning things that \"could not happen\", unless your criticism is about sci fi as a genre. I don't see Battlestar Galactica happening either, but it also succeeds in getting people to think about contemporary issues.\n \n As far as the character assassination goes, Nietsczhe used a lot of drugs, Rand wrote favourably towards a serial killer in her 20s, and the Greeks had sex with small boys. They're all dead now, so besmirching their characters serves really no purpose except to reveal your own.",

   "Jesus Christ vs. Ayn Rand, from a priest, Father Cleet Kiley:\n\n \n \nAnd then their is the issue of people picking bits out of Rands books that they like and ignoring the rest, very similar to the bible in that respect.\n\n Oh but we objectivist are far worse than Christians because since we admit rand was a human being with failures, mistakes, and downright irrational qualities we are perfectly justified in picking out the 'bits' we like and throwing out the rest. We aren't claiming she's a prophet or a god, nor that anything she wrote is absolute truth because she wrote it. The bible it is claimed is a book from God. We only claim atlas shrugged is a book. We don't have a 'word of god' principle to contradict.\n \n Atlas shrugged in particular has no objectionable parts in my opinion. It's perfect. That does not mean the author or anything else the author wrote is perfect. Atlas Shrugged purely from a fictional standpoint is average, I'll cede that. What it seems that people who read it and think it sucks as literature can't see is that the plot twists that normally fill a typical novel still exist in atlas shrugged, but the twists are of the philosophy of those involved. You aren't surprised that it really was the butler, you are surprised to find out what Dagny taggart really thought.\n \n I find the irrational, and clearly absurd actions that Rand took in her life no more a challenge to accepting the ideas she espoused than the fact that half this country used to keep slaves. What is writing about a certain aspect of a serial killer favourable to keeping slaves? I am not trying to march Jefferson to the sociopath ward, and the only excuse emotionalist would give him is that he felt oh so much empathy towards his slaves so it's really 'not that bad'. In fact many of our founding fathers kept slaves, for that reason I will always personally respect Adams, Franklin and the other northern FF more. That doesn't mean the profound quotes on liberty that Jefferson made are any less true.\n \n Character assassination has always been the last resort of those who cannot deal with another's ideas honestly.\n \n \nI am surprised by how people so easily take up some of Ayn Rand's ideas, \n\n I am surprised at how vehemently some people hate Rand's ideas. If I were like you perhaps I would doubt man's ability to think for themselves, but I know it's in everyone of us. It just needs to be encouraged and nurtured.\n \n \nreally makes me doubt the human races ability to think for themselves. \n\n This coming from someone who supports less than 1/4 of what he says. I am still waiting for a defense of your statements on irrational evolution, the center of the universe, the 'beginning' of time, and many other statements.\n \n \nAtlas Shrugged was a ridiculous story, it could never happen\n\n No it could never happen, that is because it was a book specifically designed to portray an ideal, and ideals don't perfectly exist. To some that makes the book unreal, but I love stories like that. I don't like baseball particularly but I loved 'the natural', I like any story with a hero who makes no fundamental errors, small errors, learning errors sure; but no fundamental errors.\n \n \nand says nothing more worthwhile than a poorly written science fiction fantasy story.\n\n It implies a lot that is of great worth.\n \n \nAtlas Shrugged is said to be the second best selling book of all time the bible being first and it is fitting these two fairy tales are so popular given the intelligence of people in general.\n\n Where the bible tells men what to think atlas shrugged tells them to think. If atlas shrugged does will it's only because the bible and variations on it's theme have done so well for so long. A healthy uncorrupted person adores the idea that they must think for themselves. Atlas shrugged entices everyone to be scientist while the bible begs them to be mystics.\n \n \nThese two books basically setup the general public \n to subordinate themselves without a question.\n\n The public maybe, but not people. There is nothing more unquestionably consistent in objectivist literature than the impropriety of blind submission.",
