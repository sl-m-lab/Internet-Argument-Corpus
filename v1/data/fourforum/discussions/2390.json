Since the human ideal would be to live a life without strife and deprivation it wouldn't be too outlandish to construct a story showing how humans once had it made. This would certainly allow people to vicariously live in utopia. Additionally it would serve to reinforce the need for rules and regulation (i.e. Adam and Eve didn't follow the rules and look what happened to all of us).\n \n This is my take on it, but I guess I don't really understand what you are getting at?

In this garden were two trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death (called the Tree of Knowledge in the Bible). Man had the choice of eating the fruit of the Tree of life and becoming immortal, or of eating the fruit of the Tree of Death and becoming mortal. God sent the serpent to tell Adam and Eve to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, so that they might live forever, and to warn them against eating of the fruit of the Tree of Death, for if they should eat this forbidden fruit they would surely die, and this course would descend to their children from generation to generation. The wily serpent, however, reversed the message. He told the first human pair that they would obtain immortality by eating of the fruit of the Tree of Death. Unfortunately Adam and Eve believed the diabolical snake, ate the forbidden fruit, and as a consequence were expelled from Eden and became mortal. The sly reptile, on the other hand, helped himself to the fruit of the Tree of Life and gained immortal life for himself and his kind. emoticon_xangel",

However, it seems to me that there is something real there.\n \n \nHumans have always felt pain and suffering since they became self-aware.\n\n I'm not certain this is true. Even today there are 'enlightened' beings who do not feel pain and suffering. Though I certainly do not consider myself enlightened, I gave up suffering. I gave up pain. These concepts are no longer a part of my being. Though, on second thought, perhaps what you are suggesting is accurate... Humans that are 'self-aware' will experience suffering. Humans that are, what???, 'universally-aware'?... are detached from themselves as a 'self' and do not suffer. In other words, suffering is only possible if we allow ourselves to suffer. But anyone and everyone has the ability to leave suffering behind whenever they make the choice to do so.\n \n \nThis is my take on it, but I guess I don't really understand what you are getting at?

In other words, I would suggest that the nature of humanity itself is not qualitatively different today than it was when humanity first appeared on this earth - regardless of when that was. \n \n That may seem counter to what I have indicated earlier, but consider this... What I am suggesting is that there was possibly a real event (or series of events, or time period in human history) that was perceived by some individuals of humanity to be a 'fall.'

It is evident that at least some individual human beings alive today perceive that there was a fall... that human nature itself was scarred and is now in need of salvation of some sort.\n \n I don't believe the idea of humanity having an 'imperfect' nature and a need for salvation extends back into pre-history. According to what I have read, there is no evidence of Salvationist religious practices that extend back more than 6,000 to 10,000 years. So, presumably, something happened around this time in the history of humanity to change the perception of at least some individual human beings. The more I ponder the interconnectedness of the story of the fall and actual human history, the more one particular something seems to make sense. \n \n I am fishing here to see if there may be other aspects of human history that can be correlated to the story of the fall. Aspects that I haven't yet considered. But, I can guarantee you that there is at least one aspect that fits very neatly into the story, which if you cannot figure out here, I will share eventually.

Or are we just fooling ourselves? Are we 'being like gods' as the serpent suggested, because we have eaten from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? We certainly try to have mastery over nature in every way imaginable. On the surface, it appears that we are succeeding. Yet... this earth does not have the resources to allow our continued 'mastery' indefinitely. Before long, we will reach a point known as 'peak oil' on this planet. (Do a google search if you are unfamiliar with the term.) If we continue converting the earth's biomass into human biomass, there will be no biomass left for humans to work with. Ultimately, we are at the mercy of nature just as much as we ever have been at any time in the history of humanity. We cannot escape natural law anymore than a group of mice in a corn field can escape natural law. If food is plentiful, biological populations will grow (regardless of where the food comes from). If food is scarce, biological populations will decrease.

What does God say in Genesis to Adam and Eve after they disobey God? Something about 'toiling under the sweat of your brow for food.' Are you aware that the amount of work necessary to feed an individual in an agricultural culture is far, far greater than the amount of work to feed an individual in a hunter-gatherer culture?

Are you saying that humans actually ARE more special than the rest of 'creation' and it was just a matter of time until they realized this? Or are you suggesting that according to the new perspective gained after the 'agricultural revolution' and the invention of civilization that it was obvious to them (from that perspective) that they were separate from the rest of the natural world?\n \n \n \n Do we really have any mastery over nature? Or are we just fooling ourselves? Are we 'being like gods' as the serpent suggested, because we have eaten from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? We certainly try to have mastery over nature in every way imaginable. On the surface, it appears that we are succeeding. Yet... this earth does not have the resources to allow our continued 'mastery' indefinitely. Before long, we will reach a point known as 'peak oil' on this planet. (Do a google search if you are unfamiliar with the term.) If we continue converting the earth's biomass into human biomass, there will be no biomass left for humans to work with. Ultimately, we are at the mercy of nature just as much as we ever have been at any time in the history of humanity. We cannot escape natural law anymore than a group of mice in a corn field can escape natural law. If food is plentiful, biological populations will grow (regardless of where the food comes from). If food is scarce, biological populations will decrease. That includes humans.\n \n \n Here again, I'm not certain that your perception of life prior to totalitarian agriculture is entirely accurate. What does God say in Genesis to Adam and Eve after they disobey God? Something about 'toiling under the sweat of your brow for food.' Are you aware that the amount of work necessary to feed an individual in an agricultural culture is far, far greater than the amount of work to feed an individual in a hunter-gatherer culture? People had LESS time after becoming agriculturalists. Well, at least SOME people had less time. The royalty and the nobility (who had the working poor to feed them) had more time.\n\n \n For the most part I was speaking in broad generalizations and deliberately overstating the point to provide fodder for your hypothesis machine since you weren't doing it yourself. Further, my perception of reality is fairly diametrically opposed to that espoused by the authors of the 'fall' story. I don't believe in the dominion of humans over nature. I don't think we are more special than any other life form on the planet (qualitatively different, yes but more worthy of life, no). I know agriculture is exceedingly labor intensive but I also know it changed humanity greatly. Again, these were points I brought up to fit your hypothesis regardless of the fact whether I thought they were valid.\n \n Perhaps I should have made that clearer. On the other hand, perhaps you should have been more forthcoming with your ideas instead of having people guess at them and then attacking them when they were a little bit off. :( \n \n Whistler",

On the other hand, perhaps you should have been more forthcoming with your ideas instead of having people guess at them and then attacking them when they were a little bit off.\n\n Certainly I wasn\\'t \\'attacking\\' your ideas. I was just looking for clarification on a few issues that it appears I misunderstood from your comments. And I am still fishing for other possibilities in actual human history that may coincide with the story of the fall. I actually find it quite exciting that someone else can see the possibility of a connection between the fall and the advent of the agricultural revolution.\n \n \nFurther, my perception of reality is fairly diametrically opposed to that espoused by the authors of the \\'fall\\' story.\n\n Though I can\\'t know what your perception of reality is... I\\'d guess that it\\'s not diametrically opposed to that of the authors like you suggest. Quinn suggests that the authors of the story of the fall were not those involved in the fall themselves, but rather those outside of the fall. The story of the fall makes a lot more sense when considered from the perspective of a segment of the human population that had not suffered the fall.\n \n It can sometimes be a bit of a challenge to express intent clearly in such a medium as this, particularly when we do not know each others\\' personalities in \\'real life.\\' I appreciate your discussion. If you feel so inclined, keep the thoughts coming... Be assured that I have no desire to \\'attack\\' you in any way, but rather I have a desire to consider new ideas, new possibilities and new angles that I have not yet considered. On occasion, I ask for clarification or offer clarification.\n \n The \\'Fall\\' itself is something that it seems many people take for granted... both within a salvationist religion and outside of them. The basis for all salvationist religions is essentially that humanity has in some way removed themselves from grace and are in need of salvation in some fashion. But the reasons WHY and HOW humanity removed themselves from grace are answered in general terms such as \\'disobedience\\' or \\'inevitable result of free will.\\' Whatever caused this shift in perspective has major implications in the way the majority of humanity sees themselves and the rest of the world. Discovering what exactly caused this shift in perspective could potentially be the beginning of a new age for all of humanity.",

Thanks.\n \n However, I have one question he doesn't address. \n \n Quinn argues that the Semites created this story about their farmer neighbors, the Caucasians. This implies that the Semites were still at the hunter-gather stage; but at some point they eventually became agriculturalists. Thus the Semites experienced their own 'fall'. \n \n Which fall is being written about in the bible then? The original fall of the Caucasians or the second fall of the Semites?

   "I would like to add this, which is my own theory:\n In the time before that of Adam and Eve, the earth was already established. Humans had populated the earth as God commanded and had begun to understand nature. They had abundant wildlife, plants, nuts, etc. to eat. It was not only unthinkable, but unnecessary to plant gardens, raise livestock, etc, even though there were, I believe, domesticated animals. These were humans in like form as we are, but maybe a different bone structure, a protruding forehead, longer arms (for fishing, gathering nuts, fruits, berries), but similar nonetheless.\n Then one day <insert the &#8220;fall&#8221; here< these new humans appeared, fresh from a magical place, a place of abundance where one could walk just inches and find abundant food. They kept to themselves mainly, due to the difference in language and appearance. After a few years one of them, named Cain, left the region of the new humans and settled in one of the outlying villages, called Nod.\n \n It was this man that taught the others about tilling the ground and about a great god that his father told him of, one that would walk with his father in the magical place, a place called Eden.\n \n I have believed this for quite some time now.

   "From my little understanding, Orthodox don't believe in Original Sin, but Original Guilt, or rather, the consequences of this guilt.*\n \n Protestants such as Calvinists believe that man is by nature a low and sinful creature, but we don't hold this true.\n \n Adam let sin into creation, by his disobedience, and thus all of nature has sin in it - it is in the world, of which we are a part.\n \n We are however, by nature, God's creatures, and our purpose is to return to him.\n \n Jesus came, not to carry my personal sin upon His shoulders - to pay a price for me, but to conqueor all sin.\n \n *\n \"Most orthodox theologians reject the idea of ?original guilt,? put forward by Augustine and still accepted (albeit in a mitigated form) by the Roman Catholic Church. Men (Orthodox usually teach) automatically inherit Adam?s corruption and mortality, but not his guilt: they are only guilty in so far as by their own free choice they imitate Adam. Many western Christians believe that whatever a man does in his fallen and unredeemed state, since it is tainted by original guilt, cannot possibly be pleasing to God: ?Works before Justification,? says the thirteenth of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, ?...are not pleasant to God ... but have the nature of sin.? Orthodox would hesitate to say this. And Orthodox have never held (as Augustine and many others in the west have done) that unbaptized babies, because tainted with original guilt, are consigned by the just God to the everlasting games of Hell (Thomas Aquinas, in his discussion of the fall, on the whole followed Augustine, and in particular retained the idea of original guilt; but as regards unbaptized babies, he maintained that they go not to Hell but to Limbo ? a view now generally accepted by Roman theologians. So far as I can discover, Orthodox writers do not make use of the idea of Limbo. It should be noted that an Augustinian view of the fall is found from time to time in Orthodox theological literature; but this is usually the result of western influence. The Orthodox Confession by Peter of Moghila is, as one might expect, strongly Augustinian; on the other hand the Confession of Dositheus is free from Augustinianism). The Orthodox picture of fallen humanity is far less sombre than the Augustinian or Calvinist view.\n \n But although Orthodox maintain that man after the fall still possessed free will and was still capable of good actions, yet they certainly agree with the west in believing that man?s sin had set up between him and God a barrier, which man by his own efforts could never break down. Sin blocked the path to union with God. Since man could not come to God, God came to man.\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm",

   "i have touched on this subject with bootfitter before, particularly on how it affects christianity itself. most non-christians really have no interest in whether there was a 'fall' or significant ethical shift in historical humanity. so your target audience would obviously be very thin.\n \n anyway, my particualr concern is (and this may be a tangent) if there was no biblical 'fall', then what basis is there for redemption and christianity altoghether?\n \n back to the topic... if the discovery of agriculture as an alternative to hunting/gathering was percieved as \"evil\" in the eyes of at least some of the people at that time, then to me it shows that man has not really changed at all. there would have been some people that wanted to keep things the way they were, and be more satisfied with the fact that they brought home one deer after a week's hunt. then again of course the majority would embrace this new convenience as they could gain more with less effort\n \n or perhaps, after agriculture really took off some people would have lamented the destruction of land or pollution of reserves, as well as the wastes of food. or even the tendency of certain people to try and monopolize food supplies to obtain power over other people that had become dependent on farming. this may have been what some would have perceived as the \"evil fall\"\n \n to me, this just goes to show that mankind has been always greedy and potentially evil, and that the spread of agriculture as a trend just made it more evident.\n \n this hardly qualifies as a \"fall\" but more like a manifestation of man's malice on a larger scale than ever before.",
