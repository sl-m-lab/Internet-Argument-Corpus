   "Okay, let's get you up to speed on the incredibly true story about how a bunch of right-wingers got taken in by some satiric blog post on Barack Obama's college thesis, written ages ago, and frantically presented it as real.\n \n Months ago, some blogger crafted a fake news story about how Time Magazine's Joe Klein had obtained ten pages of a thesis written by Barack Obama, in which he wrote about how the Constitution was \"inherently flawed.\"\n In the paper, in which only the first ten pages were given to the general media, Obama decries the plight of the poor: \"I see poverty in every place I walk. In Los Angeles and New York, the poor reach to me with bleary eyes and all I can do is sigh.\"\n \n In part, the future President blames this on the current economic system: \"There are many who will defend the 'free market.' But who will defend the single mother of four working three jobs. When a system is allowed to be free at the expense of its citizens, then it is tyranny.\"\n \n However, the President also singled out the American Constitution: \"... the Constitution allows for many things, but what it does not allow is the most revealing. The so-called Founders did not allow for economic freedom. While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document, the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned. While many believed that the new Constitution gave them liberty, it instead fitted them with the shackles of hypocrisy.\"\n Now, I don't see a whole lot in there about the \"the evolution of the arms reduction negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States,\" which is what he actually wrote about for Columbia, which should have been the first clue that this was a satire. ALSO HELPFUL: the tag on the satiric blog post, which reads, and I quote, \"SATIRE.\"\n \n Did you hear the one about Kanye West attributing his outburst at the VMAs to a gluten overdose? No, because apparently that critical news story was vetted by professionals, not Rush Limbaugh and Michael Ledeen, who beef-farted this false Obama thesis story all over the radio and the blogosphere today.\n \n Eventually, Joe Klein caught wind of the thesis that people were saying he had read and penned a post at Swampland, saying that it was \"nonsense.\"\n A report is circulating among the wingnuts that I had a peek at Barack Obama's senior thesis. It is completely false. I've never seen Obama's thesis. I have no idea where this report comes from--but I can assure you that it's complete nonsense.\n Ledeen had to eventually apologize for the misinformation, telling his readers, \"Joe Klein has said that he never read any part of an Obama 'thesis' from his Columbia days, and that's conclusive, as far as I'm concerned.\" Charitable! The Washington Independent's Dave Weigel says that Limbaugh \"discovered the hoax midway through the show, and used what used to be known as the \"fake but accurate\" defense.\n \n So, hey, that right-wing reportage infrastructure is in great shape, I guess!\n\n Read more at: Fake Obama Thesis Story Goes Viral, Because Of Stupidity\n \n 1) I expect the usual \"shoot the messenger\" complaints regarding Huffington Post.\n I acknowledge they are biased. I present this as more of an editorial on what happened.\n \n 2) The important part to take away is WHAT HAPPENED.\n If you go to the HP web-site, you can see TONS of links verifying their facts as true. While some people may disagree on conclusion, their factual observations are on the money.\n Right down to a link documenting Rush's *fake but true* type defense.\n Claiming \"I have had this happen to me,\" Limbaugh says he doesn't care if thesis quotes are fake, \"I know Obama thinks it\" | Media Matters for America\n (And what is absolutely pathetic about Rush's presentation on that is that he argues things that undoubtedly he thinks are reprehensible when committed against him, but he turns around and repeats the practice (unabashedly) just the same... emoticon_confused emoticon_mad )\n \n But I'm sure there is going to be an inrush of people insisting that EVERYTHING must be ignored, just because HP talked about it... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 3) I know others will want to ignore this, but this part is crucial.\n The right-wing story IS FALSE.\n There is no legitimate question on that. No legitimate dispute.\n I have bold-faced and red-marked the parts of this article which demonstrate why any RATIONAL reviewer should have recognized that the story, AT FACE VALUE, was false...\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 4) Dan Rather was fired for similar actions, when his source purposely deceived him.\n In this case where the real source ACKNOWLEDGED it was \"satire\", can I expect a similar support (firing the people involved) for such misconduct???\n \n (I'm not holding my breath...)",

   "I don't remember how Rather retracted it...glad to see you admit rush did....but I don't think it was within hours and I don't believe Rush Limbaugh is a news organization. \n\n Rather's wasn't from a web-site that clearly marked its content as \"SATIRE\".\n If Rather's source HAD come from a web-site that clearly marked itself as \"SATIRE\", you can bet that he wouldn't have used it in the first place... emoticon_xgood\n \n And as for \"not a news organization\", neither am I so I guess you'll just sit quietly next time you inaccurately think I'm not telling the truth, huh...\n :xbanghead\n \n Nah. You won't.\n And the real difference, as you have previously shown, is that you will make a point of looking my way to ensure I am telling the truth (even though I'm not a news organization) and when it comes to Limbaugh you're happy to look the other way (cause he's not a news organization).\n \n \n \nSo is condemning someone for correcting a mistake mere hours after saying it. You need to recognize context a little more. \n\n BLOWI.\n IT IS THE DEGREE of the mistake that is being criticized.\n \n Rather had a source give him information, and then had some \"experts\" verify it.\n Limbaugh had a source OPENLY STATE it was satire, but he was too busy drooling at the idea of attacking Obama to notice.\n \n \n \nIs that a yes or no?\n\n Considering you already recognized the answer was \"yes\" by your PREVIOUS statement of \"glad to see you admit rush did\", your follow-on question seems bizarre...\n \n Unless it was merely an attempt to side-step addressing the fact that I obviously can't say the same for you on numerous issues, as previously cited...\n \n \n \nWhich is what I like to do with Simone but I find this entertaining \n\n Why?\n What's the difference?\n \n I think I already know the difference, but I'm curious what excuse you'll come up with...\n \n \n \nThat you are a troll?\n\n It's interesting to note how you insist I should take your criticism of me seriously, but when it comes for quid pro quo for you to take a look at yourself, you deflect.\n \n Let me make this painfully clear.\n If I had uttered the statements you had made earlier, whereby you CLEARLY demonstrated your conscious intent to side-track this thread, would you have used that hypothetical statement of mine to assess me as a troll?\n \n \n \nI don't need to prove anything you haven't shown already.\n\n You are the one who openly admits to purposely derailing a thread, showing no interest in anything but invectives, and I am the one who has supposedly proven something in an unsubstantiated allegation...\n \n Again, the obfuscation continues...\n \n \n \nWait...are you a principal at an elementary school?\n\n You just gave me the quote I will use for you for whenever you try to criticize my behavior...\n \n \n \nI phrased it as a question! There are questions about you comparing...I'm not saying it is true HAHA. Perhaps false but true. Irony number 2?\n\n Kindly explain the \"That's even worse for you!\" if you weren't reaching some conclusion that coincided with your \"question\"...\n \n Nah. You lack the intellectual integrity to admit what you just did...\n \n \n \nYou can't just do it on your own?\n\n I have already explained why that isn't prudent.\n \n The truly hilarious thing about this is that I am truly proving my point to anybody who cares to listen.\n It's just that this board has devolved to the point where some people don't need that point proven yet again...\n ... and others are reveling in the fact that they have pushed things to the point where others don't want to listen to your trolling.\n \n \n \nno\n\n Hypothetically (based on the question assumption) presuming I were the source of the problem, as you would have others believe, why would it not make sense for you to agree to the situation I pose?\n \n After all, you would supposedly not be giving up anything, while I would be giving up something you want me to give up.\n \n By the way you try to paint things, it would be like an alcoholic giving up alcohol because the teetotaler has likewise agreed to give up alcohol.\n (The hypothetical analogy, by your explanation, having me be the alcoholic and you the teetotaler...)\n \n So WHY does it not make sense for you to agree to the agreement I pose to you?\n \n \n \nWell thank you for saying we prove stuff :)\n\n Sadly for you, what you are proving is contradicting your claims...\n But you have my thanks for proving me right.\n \n \n \nI said I act like the very definition of a troll. It comes from trolling like the fishing technique, no?\n\n No.\n \n \n \nOne would be foolish in a debate to take the bait of a troll because you end up like a fish on a hook. With you, it seems way to easy.\n\n How am I a \"fish on a hook\"?\n In the end, all you have done is shown I will talk to you while you play the role of a troll...\n \n Quite frankly, it's more like a D.A. gathering evidence from a suspect boasting of his exploits because the D.A. knows he will use that evidence against the suspect later...\n \n \n \nI was totally right about Foundit being better than Simone by the way...you owe Foundit and apology for this one...\n\n For what it's worth, you are light-years above Jyoshu....",

   "Rather's wasn't from a web-site that clearly marked its content as \"SATIRE\".\nAnd at first, neither was Rush's. It originated from a website marked Satire and was posted on another website that showed it as truth and Rush used that website until he found the one marked Satire. \n \n \nAnd as for \"not a news organization\", neither am I so I guess you'll just sit quietly next time you inaccurately think I'm not telling the truth, huh...\nIf you take it back within a few hours or just admit you are wrong than I will sit quietly. I don't care if you make a mistake..I do it all the time. Just admit it.\n \n \nWhy?\n What's the difference?\nWhat's the difference between you and Simone? Simone doesn't respond...she just repeats the same droning BS. You'll respond with something that looks like a thought...I'm not sure I can say the same about others. \n \n \nIf I had uttered the statements you had made earlier, whereby you CLEARLY demonstrated your conscious intent to side-track this thread, would you have used that hypothetical statement of mine to assess me as a troll?\nUndoubtable. \n \n \nYou just gave me the quote I will use for you for whenever you try to criticize my behavior...\nYou gotta admit, it sounded like one! Maybe you should consider it.\n \n \nKindly explain the \"That's even worse for you!\" if you weren't reaching some conclusion that coincided with your \"question\"...\nIt had a question mark so it is wrong to say I am lying when I ask a question..or rather being 'dishonest'.

I don't follow.\n \n \nHypothetically (based on the question assumption) presuming I were the source of the problem, as you would have others believe, why would it not make sense for you to agree to the situation I pose?\nBecause you would be the problem..why would we ask you for a solution?\n \n \nHow am I a \"fish on a hook\"?\n In the end, all you have done is shown I will talk to you while you play the role of a troll...\nThat's exactly what a troll does.
