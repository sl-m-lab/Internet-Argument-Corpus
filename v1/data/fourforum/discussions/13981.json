   "It appears that Toyota employees are whining about the tactics that the media and Congress have been using against the Big Three for decades. I guess outrage only occurs when it's YOUR ox being gored. \n \n \n\n Toyota's Troubles Worry Factory Town \n By GARY FIELDS \n BUFFALO, W.Va.&#8212;Workers at Toyota Motor Corp.'s sprawling operations here have a message for Congress as it digs into the auto maker's safety record: any actions against the Japanese company will be felt here, too.\n The two-million-square-foot plant, which dominates the landscape, has kept Putnam County's unemployment rate low. Its arrival prompted the state to build a new bridge over the Kanawha River and a four-lane highway that opened last year. Local schools use computers donated by Toyota, which also gave the Buffalo fire department vehicles including a fire truck, ambulance and pickup truck.\n \n Mike Lemaster, 45 years old, who has worked on the Toyota production line three years, said he was grateful for a good job. \"You can say it's a foreign company but when it's on American soil with American workers and it's run by Americans, it's an American company,\" he said.\n At 10:30 one recent morning&#8212;lunch time for the early shift&#8212;Gregory Lunsford, 31, and his wife, Chasity, 37, eat quickly at a Subway sandwich shop. Both work at the plant nearby, earning about $25 an hour each. \"I wouldn't live here in West Virginia if the plant wasn't here,\" he said.\n Toyota has recalled more than eight million vehicles globally to fix problems with gas pedals, brakes and other systems in some of its models. U.S. regulators say the acceleration problems may have caused as many as 34 deaths in the U.S. The company has disclosed it has received subpoenas from a federal grand jury and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n Mr. Lunsford acknowledged the seriousness of the problems but said he believed part of what's happening now is piling on by Congress and the media. \"They are nitpicking, taking every safety concern and turning it into national news,\" he said. \"Toyota has shut down production. It is willing to take the punches and cut sales to try to correct the problems.\"\n Toyota's Recall Problems Ripple in West Virginia - WSJ.com\n",

Life in a wheel chair, or burying a loved one because some pen pusher in a big company brags about 'saving 100 million dollars by stopping forced recalls' is something that will cause outrage too.\n \n That being said, it is going to take some major effort for the Toyota company to regain it's reputation.. which translates into sales and money.",
