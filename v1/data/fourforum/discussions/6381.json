A wise thing to do is buy lots of winter clothes and learn to deal with lower room temperatures. I visited my father's highschool teacher once one winter afternoon.

If the wood is seasoned properly before splitting, a sharp axe will handle up to 12\" diameter without sweat and a couple of wedges will split the biggest log I've got on the place. I like the really rustic lifestyle...no motors...no electricity...no natural gas. I do make exceptions for the lights, refrigerator and the TV at home, but when I go camping, there nothing but wood for heat and a flashlight or two for emergency light.",
