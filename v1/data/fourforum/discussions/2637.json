   "the sniper rifle doesn't do anything, regardless where you hit them. You're better off with a pistol at long range to get rid of their guns, and then shotgun. For the popcorn like things, the obvious weapon is the P90-like gun. \n \n Don't get close to them at all costs, on heroic to legendary, one swipe and either you're shields are gone, or you're dead. Not fun kiddies. \n \n Plasmas are good if you can do it right. stick it to one of the popcorns in the middle of the pack and run, boom, no more flood. \n \n Running them over is useful. On the last level, the hog can run them over no problem and they stay down. Rocket launchers are good only if they can't reach you, such as in the Library, you jump on one of the supporting pillar thingys and you can rocket them. Long range is bad because they'll see the rocket and move towards you. \n \n No, there isn't a easy way, short of cheating. There's a 12+ trainer that makes the game unbearably easy. One shot kill + P90 = Game finished in 2.5 hours.",
