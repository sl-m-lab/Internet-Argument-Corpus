   "It is commonplace for most Bush cultists to poo-poo any poll or media that does not favor their positions or views. Facts be damned.\n \n To be fair, many from the left do the same but not without reason, ie: FOXNews, O'Reilly, Coulter, Hannity, Limbaugh and the list goes on and on and on. Mostly, all the right seems to whine about is Moore (who is all but obsolete these days) or Dan Rather (who lost his job, unlike the rightwing political pundits who, to this day, still spew their banter on our national airwaves) and the like. The \"leftwing biased media\" claim is overall unfounded and outright rediculous when all anyone has to do is turn on their cable TV to realize that. Still, the irritating whine from the right persists regardless. These days, the very idea of the media being leftwing dominant is so insane that the claim falls on deaf ears when presented to the intelligent people of our population.\n \n In short, my TV set gets over 15 news channels and they are clearly manipulated, by far, by the right. So, by my observations, republican rightwing corporate America, dominates the airwaves. Case closed. It's so obvious to me there can be no doubt.\n \n That being said, I went on an expidition to see if I could find ONE poll that showed Bush's performance was approved of by the majority of Americans polled. I intended on including FOXNews and other pro-Bush/Republican organizations in my search. I figured if THEY reflected non-approval of Bush, maybe the diehard Bush cultists might rub their chin and go \"hmmmmmmmmm..\" After all, to hear the Bush cultist tell the story, they are iin the majority mainstream and anyone outside of their viewpoints was a liberal, traitor, homo or pinko.\n \n I am hoping to show once and for all that the majority of Americans DO NOT think like these rightwing whackos, as they claim they do.\n \n Let's see what we find......\n \n Well FOX News dares not to report Bush's failures. But I did find them making excuses for it right here. \n \n Rassmussen...Bush cultists in the minority.\n \n USA Today....Bush cultists in minority...again. Omit this poll. Old poll.\n \n A more recent Gallop....still, no help for the Bush camp. \n \n Gallup (4/05)....Bush in bad shape ...yet again. \n \n Still looking for a favorable report on Bush y'all.......... A hunting I will go, a hunting I will go, Hi-Ho the Dairy-o a hunting I will go... :p \n \n Even those dreadful commies over at CNN report Bush in the doghouse. \n \n Six states (out of 50 ) actually think Ol' George is doing a good job. Sweet Home Alabama.\n \n Even the Christian Science XXXXXX have figured out that Bush sucks.\n \n Here's one for all of you pro-war mongerers. \n \n OK...enoughs, enough. I can do this all day. I have other things to do. I just went through two pages of Google and have yet to find any evidence that the majority of this country approves of Bush or his policies.\n \n Moral of the story.... you Bush diehards are in the minority. There are LESS of you than there are of US. Read 'em and weep. It's a case of \"Everybody's out of step but Johnny. You (Bush supporters) are out of step. Next time you want to whine how everyone is attacking you guys, (yet you and your kind INSIST that you are still the majority mainstream America) just shut the hell up. That's a blatant lie. You guys are in the brainwashed minority. Either wake up and smell the coffee or deal with the REAL majority of America calling you guys XXXXXX. :p",
