   "Russia's Islamic revolt is spreading\n Mark Franchetti, Moscow , and Alexei Shvedov, Nalchik\n \n \n \n THE diehard gang of Muslim extremists responsible for last week's attack on the southern Russian city of Nalchik consisted mainly of local militants intent on creating a strict Islamic state independent of Moscow, according to security sources in the region. \n The disclosure that the gunmen were not sent from the war-torn republic of Chechnya but belonged to a group from Kabardino-Balkaria, the Russian republic of which Nalchik is the capital, will be of great concern to the Kremlin. \n \n \n \n It provides alarming evidence that far from dying down - as claimed by President Vladimir Putin - the bloody Chechen conflict is spreading. \n \n \"Most of the militants who were killed and those caught alive are local,\" said an officer with the Nalchik anti-terrorism police unit. \" The ferocity of the attacks has shocked the city.\" \n \n The onslaught, which turned the town of 280,000 into a war zone, was the most daring raid by pro-Chechen Islamic militants since last year's Beslan school siege in which 330 hostages were killed. It came less than a month before parliamentary elections in Chechnya, hailed by Putin as evidence that the region is becoming stable. \n \n The 24 hours of gun battles in which several police stations and other security forces buildings were attacked left at least 108 dead, including more than 60 militants. Nearly 30 others were detained. \n \n Most of the gunmen were thought to be members of Yarmuk, a homegrown fundamentalist group that the local authorities twice claimed to have destroyed. \n \n Composed mainly of young extremists from the region's two main ethnic groups, the Kabardins and the Balkars, Yarmuk has close ties with Shamil Basayev, Russia's most wanted terrorist, who was behind the Beslan attack and appears to be extending his influence in an attempt to open up a new front in his war with Moscow. \n \n Last week Russian prosecutors blamed Anzor Astemirov, a radical Yarmuk leader with ties to Basayev, for the Nalchik attacks. Local officials claimed they were launched to rescue a group of extremists surrounded by security forces. But the assault on the city appeared too well organised to be spontaneous. Observers believe it was a suicide mission with the aim of killing scores of officers and embarrassing the authorities. \n \n Security forces were caught off guard when about 100 militants armed with AK47s, hand grenades and rocket launchers turned up in the city centre. \n \n In near-simultaneous attacks shortly after 9am on Thursday, the militants targeted three police stations, the headquarters of the local FSB (the former KGB), the interior ministry building, the offices of the city's prison guards, a military unit guarding the airport and a counter-terrorism centre. \n \n \"Suddenly a car pulled up outside the FSB building,\" said Evgenia Sakurova, the director of a hotel opposite. \n \n \"Five or six armed men jumped out and ran towards the FSB entrance. They were carrying rucksacks. Quickly they took them off and threw them at the main doors. Explosions followed and all the windows on the ground and first floors were blown out. But the terrorists didn't manage to break into the building and officers started shooting at them from inside.\" \n \n Two militants were killed in the gun battle. Three others ran for cover into a souvenir shop where they reportedly took three women hostage. \n \n As battles raged across the city centre, 15 militants mounted an assault on a police station near the airport. \n \n \n \n \"Two cars packed with armed men drove up to the building,\" a witness said. \"One group lobbed a hand grenade into the front entrance and stormed inside. The other attacked the side entrance. \n \"There were a few officers chatting by their parked cars. The militants fired at them from machineguns and killed them.\" \n \n \n \n A firefight ensued as officers on the first and second floors fired back at the militants. \n \n As another group of gunmen was beaten back by soldiers at the airport and Russian reinforcements began to pour into the city, militants raided at least two gun shops. \n \n One police officer and three gunmen were killed at one of them. A wounded masked militant was seen crawling on the ground screaming in pain. \n \n Putin ordered the city to be sealed off and anyone putting up resistance to be shot. However, some militants are thought to have escaped. \n \n At the souvenir shop, it took until the early hours of Friday to end the standoff. \"The shop was surrounded,\" said Alexei Lavrentiev, who watched Russian special forces in gas masks storm the building. \n \n \"They fired several rockets from a grenade launcher through the window and fired from machineguns. An armoured personnel carrier smashed through a wall. Two hostages were carried out. They looked more dead than alive.\" \n \n As he stared at the bodies of two policemen and three insurgents Lavrentiev added: \"The militants are all dead now but the city is in a state of shock. The question on everybody's mind is, where and when will these terrorists strike next?\"\n \n Abramovich to run region again \n \n Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, is to serve a second term as governor of the remote far northern Russian region of Chukotka following the announcement yesterday that President Vladimir Putin has backed his candidacy. \n \n Abramovich, whose term runs out in December, had said he did not want to stay on but is now widely expected to serve until 2011. He has invested millions of dollars in the impoverished region. The announcement comes less than three weeks after Abramovich sold his oil company to the Russian state for more than \u00a35 billion.\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1349 \n \n Islamists Way or No Way\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1347 \n \n Killing from Qur'anic Piety: Tamerlane's Living Legacy \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1328\n \n Over 40,000 Islamic extremists pose threat to Europe \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1327\n \n Beslan children still tormented by Islamic Terrorists \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1051 \n Beslan, Russia & Islam \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1045 \n Self Reflection and Introspection: What a Muslim learned on Yom Kippur \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1040 \n Beslan Terrorist has link to Finsbury Park Mosque \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1033 \n Al-Qaida Using \"Successful\" Russia School Siege As Recruiting Tool \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1013 \n The Rape Jihad\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/989 \n The Whole World Is Watching\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/985 \n \"Sit tight and if you scream we will kill 20 children\" \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/981 \n They're Terrorists - Not Activists \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/979 \n Arab and Muslim Reactions to the Terrorist Attack in Beslan, Russia \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/975 \n British Imam: Targeting Children is supported by Islam \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/965 \n \"We will kill 50 children\" for every one terrorist killed \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/736 \n 57 killed in Russian border attack",

The Russian military has killed thousands of Chechens and destroyed Chechnia in order to avoid the latter gaining its independence.
