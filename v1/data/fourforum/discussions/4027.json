   "The pro-life argument quite plainly revolves around the premise that fetuses are human beings, and therefore have a right to life. However, many (if not all) pro-lifers say that they will allow abortions in the \"extreme cases\" of rape or incest. Now, what does that imply? Rape/incest fetuses aren't human beings, while others are? Pro-lifers say that they don't want the government picking and choosing who has the right to life and who doesn't, but this sounds like picking and choosing to me.\n \n I think this inconsistency effectively nullifies the pro-life argument. Of course, to get rid of the inconsistency, the pro-lifers can bring rape and incest babies into the sphere of protected beings. The result - a horribly unreasonable position I can't suport.",

   "The pro-life argument quite plainly revolves around the premise that fetuses are human beings, and therefore have a right to life. However, many (if not all) pro-lifers say that they will allow abortions in the \"extreme cases\" of rape or incest. Now, what does that imply? Rape/incest fetuses aren't human beings, while others are? Pro-lifers say that they don't want the government picking and choosing who has the right to life and who doesn't, but this sounds like picking and choosing to me.\n \n I think this inconsistency effectively nullifies the pro-life argument. Of course, to get rid of the inconsistency, the pro-lifers can bring rape and incest babies into the sphere of protected beings. The result - a horribly unreasonable position I can't suport.\n\n \n Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5% of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95%, which is better than nothing. After that they can work towards stopping all abortions. It's a step-by-step process. \n \n I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal. 95% of abortions are a result of consentual sex. We shouldn't cater to the 5% just because they've had a tough situation. I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them, but they do still need to have the baby, whether they give it up for adoption or not. This isn't a horribly unreasonable position.

Indeed it would seem irresponsible to assume that it is NOT sentient even if we suspect it may not be because if it is and we are wrong then we are determining to kill a baby.\n \n She also aruges the point of sapience. My argument is that sentience and sapience are really irrelevant when it comes to deciding about life. One would not consider an animal to be sapient (although many who argue evolution would argue that apes and dolphins are) because it cannot be considered to be wise really. Animal cruelty is still criminal as far as I know.\n \n If we start defining a human life based on sentience and sapience we would also then begin to euthanize the severely mentally retarded (IQ < 50 I believe). It would be difficult to show sapience or even sentience in those who are unable to interact with their environment in a meaningful manner.

   "A fetus before 6 months at least CAN'T be aware because awareness takes place in the Cerebral cortex which isn't fully formed and *hooked up* so to speak before 22-24 weeks.So basically you don't agree that brain death should define the end of human life?\n\n \n Please see post 64",

   " I believe my original argument with her is that one could not prove that an uborn baby was not sentient based on the definition of sentient. Indeed it would seem irresponsible to assume that it is NOT sentient even if we suspect it may not be because if it is and we are wrong then we are determining to kill a baby.\n \nYou can NOT have sentience and or sapience without fully functioning brain.Brain Waves measure the function of the brain.Fetuses before 22-24 weeks do NOT have the brain wave patterns associated with consciousness.No Consciousness ,no sentience nor sapience.So it's pretty safe to assume. Either way you are STILL killing a Zygote,embryo or fetus deppending on when you get an abortion.Killing doesn't automatically mean murder.Not to mention early abortion done with RU486 doesn't even kill the embryo,it just dispells it.\nIf we start defining a human life based on sentience and sapience we would also then begin to euthanize the severely mentally retarded (IQ < 50 I believe). \n I don't define human life by sentience or sapience but rather human personhood.The severely mentally retarded still posses sentience and sapience.\nIt would be difficult to show sapience or even sentience in those who are unable to interact with their environment in a meaningful manner.\nCould you give an example?",

   "Hmmm, sapient actually has two meanings.\n \n The first is fine, sapient meaning wise, but there is a second, satirical meaning, \"aping\" wisdom, fancied sagacity, in other words, pretending to a wisdom that is quite beyond one.\n \n Furthermore, not every human being is wise, no matter how long that particular human being studies and studies and tries to be wise. Wisdom is sometimes beyond the reach of such individuals. Nevertheless, they are not less human because of this lack of wisom. Humanity has its share of fools.\n \n Sentient, having the power to perceive. I would add that to be totally human, one must have the power to perceive and process in a reasonably rational fashion. All animals with sensory organs are sentient. They perceive through scent, sight, sound, taste, sense of movement, tactile sensations and process enough of these perceptions for survival.",

They enjoy a rich emotional and cultural existence in which they experience emotions such as fear, anxiety and happiness. They share the intellectual capacity to create and use tools, learn and teach other languages. They remember their past and plan for their future. It is in recognition of these and other morally significant qualities that the Great Ape Project was founded. The Great Ape Project seeks to end the unconscionable treatment of our nearest living relatives by obtaining for non-human great apes the fundamental moral and legal protections of the right to life, the freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and protection from torture.\n \n \nApes share more personhood than a fetus and should enjoy more rights than a fetus.",
