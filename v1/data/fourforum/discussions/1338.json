The current administration, it seems to me, has neither made any effort to balance the budget or reduce the size of government.\n \n I mean, I would assume that if a Democratic president drastically cut social programs, and weakened environmental protection policies, for example, there would be a lot of disapproval of that administration by liberals, and they would not simply say \"well, a republican administration would be just as bad.\"\n \n I don't assume that conservatives would vote Democratic in the upcoming election, I would just assume that there would be more of an outcry of the administration drifting away from conservative idealogies.",
