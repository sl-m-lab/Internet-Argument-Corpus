After all, the Chinese hold a goodly deal of the debt of the United States. If they cashed in their chips, the U.S. could pay dearly.\n\n Correct, the Chinese are financing the greatest market for their goods and will continue to do so while it is in their best interests, and they are not unaware of their power over us. \n Meanwhile our politicians are producing pork at record levels without regard to fiscal sanity or a $427 billion projected deficit (14,000 annual pork giveaways, a tenfold increase in the last decade). Republicans, who once preached fiscal conservatism, have dethroned Democrats as the prime providers of pork as they scramble to belly up to the public trough. Some examples: $350,000 for the Rock and Roll hall of Fame; $250,000 for an Alaska statehood celebration; $200,000 for a deer avoidance system in New York; $25,000 for a Nevada school district to study mariachi music; $250,000 (tacked to a defense bill) to study caffienated chewing gum; the list goes on ...... and on. To quote Pogo, \"We have met the enemy, and he are us\". In my opinion, our greatest threat does not come from China, or even terrorists, but from voters who will quietly follow to the edge of financial disaster and scream loudest on the way down.\n Dono",

I seek informed US citizens to convince me that I am wrong.\n\n \n Well, one thing to remember is that the U.S. always changes administrations at least every 8 years. Maybe not the party in power, but the administration. Regardless of how you may perceive the current people in power here, it will change because of term limits. Every president brings his own style of leadership.\n \n So that fact alone should convince you that you are wrong.\n \n I agree BTW that our foreign policy is 'strong-armish\" these days. But I don't agree with you about the Patriot Act--I think a lot of the paranoia about it \"taking our rights away\" are overblown and outrageously exagerrated. I've not noticed the least bit of repression by the Patriot Act, and I also know quite a number of people who are ethnic minorities. Even the ones who look somewhat \"Arab\" haven't really noticed much. (Unless you consider increased security at airports to be a big problem, which I don't.)\n \n What little inconveniences the Patriot Act may have caused is welcome as far as I'm concerned. We haven't had a U.S. soil terrorist attack since the Patriot Act and the Dept. of Homeland Security was put in place, and we know for a fact that a number of attempts have been thwarted. You may not like Bush, but it's hard to argue with the facts that we haven't been attacked since then on our soil, and so homeland security is something he's done right.\n \n And one other thing--there's not a snowball's chance in hell that a draft will be instated in the U.S. anytime in the forseeable future.",

   "Obviously I realise that a draft is an extreme measure to take for any country, but I am not as certain as you that it will not happen. \n In 2003, Congress brought two bills forward, S. 89 and H.R. 163, introduced by Democratic Representative Charles Rangel and Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings. Entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003, their aim is \"To provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons (age 18-26) in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.\" \n Interestingly, these bills were brought by Democrats and were soundly defeated in the House (402 to 2). Much argument was made of the fact that the whole excercise was basically anti-Bush scaremongering, so the Democrats could say \"look, if you re-elect Bush, you'll get a draft\". Their ploy failed spectacularly.\n However, I can't help but wonder what will happen if the US commits more of its forces overseas as part of the war on terror. Of course we cannot be certain if this will happen, but we can be certain of the consequences:\n The economy will suffer, poorer people will be even less able to find decent permanent employment than they are now, and will be encouraged to join the overstretched military. Once this is happening on a large scale, the step to a draft is not so dramatic. Signs of an increasingly militarised culture in the US are growing; the Pentagon's involvement in K-12 schools and curriculum-based indoctrination programs like JROTC is somewhat worrying, and while even the extremely militaristic Bush Administration is not pushing a draft, I am sure the Pentagon would be quite happy were it to happen!\n \n While I acknowledge the fact that there has not been a successful attack on US soil since 9/11 I think it has far more to do with the Dept of HS rather than the Patriot Act, which honestly just seems unecessary.Some of it is quite benign, but some of it just seems to have been an excuse to widen government powers such as Sections 206, 213 - 216, 218, 411, 412, 505 and 802. A full rundown of these sections is given at http://slate.msn.com/id/2087984/\n These sections deal with all manner of domestic \"anti-terror\" measures but in my, and a great deal of people's, opinion, go further than they need to and are simply too vague about how they can be implemented. They also have two things in common; none need any burden of proof, and none involve anyone but investigating forces being told what is going on. Therefore I feel that there is a great deal of scope for abuse in the Patriot Act by future administrations.\n \n Your point about administrations changing every 8 years and my dislike of Bush is irrelevant. In the UK, the fact that our governing body changes every few years and the fact that I dislike Blair is irrelevant. \n Change of leadership has in fact made very little difference to the direction our two countries have been taking since the end of WWII, which has been continuously aggressive globally throughout any administration you care to mention. The change in 2008 will make no great difference, even if the Republicans lose, just as change in 2009 will make no great difference in the UK. We will continue to be the world's two most aggressive countries of the post WWII era.",

   "Sir, America will fall. I am a Dr. of Political sciences at the University of Washington. Many early civilizations fell. Example, the Isrealites.

School books however say the Cast System in India has been around since as long as nine hundred years ago. But that is not true. Every country falls.

   "It's possible, but doubtful. And historically, when imbalances such as this happen, the system balances itself. And where are you getting the whole 'civil disorder' thing?\n\n \n Historically, when imbalances such as this happen, it leads to mass civil disorder (increasing over a long period of time) which leads eventually to an unviable state where the majority of the population has been disenfranchised by the elitist power monopoly. This is not marxism or any kind of idealism, this is historical fact, for example the French Revolution of 1789, the communist revolution of 1915 (which was hijacked by by people whose ideologies differ very little from today's neoconservatives), the quasi-socialist revolutions of recent times in Argentina, Ukraine, there are plenty more examples. If US economic policy continues to favour the rich over the poor, it will simply be a natural backlash that the poor will take matters into their own hands. \n An interesting parallel is the phenomenon of Islamist suicide bombers; one reason they do this is because they do not have access to a large military infrastructure, so they take revenge by the onbly means available to them. The disenfranchised majority has always existed, and has always caused major change, even though the main power bases have always to some degree maintained their pre-eminence. Any basic study of history will give you a good idea of what the future holds for the US, and indeed for the UK and other market fundamentalist cultures. It is inevitable.\n \n \nI'm going to assume you mean a further divide between political parties to the point where it's impossible to hang around the middle? If so, that's one thing I can see happening.\n\n \n You have completely missed my point. For a start, especially in US political culture, and only slightly less so in the UK, the ideological difference between the two main parties has been less and less pronounced as time goes on. No one with a knowledge of history can say that the Clinton Presidency was not an aggressive one, the only difference between that and the current one is that the Bush Administration is more direct and blunt in stating its aggressive intentions, and the Clinton Admin was not so reckless as to attempt direct regime change, preffering to stick to the tried and tested method of economic dominance combined with the assumption that the US will act militarily without hesitation, if anyone should be foolish enough not to toe the line.\n \n What I am talking about is the expansion of the computerised voting system, which in principle has nothing wrong with, were it not for two very worrying factors:\n 1) The current computerised voting system extant in some states has no verification trail and cannot be investigated because the patent laws on the software forbid it: there is no way of knowing if any fraud has taken place. You can believe what you wish about the moral intergity of the leaders you have now (God help us) but can you not see that this system inherently contains the possibility of abuse by future administrations?\n 2) The vast majority of companies who provide the software and hardware for the current computerised voting system are repulblican party affiliated ie they donated fundes to the republican campaigns in 2000 and 2004.\n \n \nLol, no. Further legislation? There has been exactly NO legislation that impedes legal forms of protest. You need to understand our system of government. Taking away legal right to protest is a violation of the constitution and that can be defended by the Supreme Court. On top of that, I don't think there is a politician in the entire country that would support it. Not all protests are legal, however. Any which are violent, obstructing public property without a permit, etc are illegal. I can't protest the administration by throwing molotov cocktails at the White House, for example.\n\n \n You need to understand your own legislation. Take a moment to read the PATRIOT act, particularly the sections I highlighted earlier in this thread. Again, it is not so much the current administration I am worried about as the scope for future abuse of this legislation. Remember, once something becomes law, that is it. The legislation is then open to interpretation by future idelogical groups. Keep this in mind as you (re)read the PATRIOT act and all its little peculiarities, most of which have been kept very vague (read it!) for no other reason that I can see other than to keep it open to interpretation. You would think that the most important security document for decades would be quite specific in its aims and intentions, but the PATRIOT act is anything but.\n \n \nAgain, no. The draft doesn't work, plain and simple. And as to your saying the Pentagon wants a draft? We lost Vietnam thanks to the draft (and massive idiocy on the part of policy makers). The entire American public is against the draft. One thing foreigners perhaps don't understand is that in the US, we take an immense pride in having an all-volunteer military. Anybody who tried to institute the draft would have precisely jack $h!t in the way of support.\n\n \n OK, I will back down on this as I have realised it is no longer in the administarion's or Pentagon's interest. You don't need a draft when the national economy is in such a bad state (eg in 10 years' time) that you have hundreds of thousands of willing recruits.\n \n \nSounds good to me. Space-based weapons would be a beautiful thing. I don't see the expanded nuke program though; we have no need for it. We already have enough radioactive things that go boom that we could probably eliminate all life from this planet in about 30 minutes.\n\n \n You accept the absurdity of having enough nukes to wipe out all life, but you think the militarisation of space is a good thing? Are you mental? Can you imagine what could happen if something went wrong in the (necessarily computerised) system that governed all these weaponised satellites? The US has already proved it can't be trusted with so-called \"smart\" weapons, let alone a lump of metal 300 miles above the earth covered in missiles!\n As for expanded nuke program, just do a google search for \"battlefield nukes\", this is a serious program with serious proponents who want funding, and there are very few ardent opponents. No legislation has been passed as yet but the idea has massive support.\n \n \nThat's not a US-caused thing, if (when, more like) it happens. The UN is a useless, corrupt, and obstructive body. It can't last. Any organization that puts countries like Syria on the security council...the very fact that you're always going to have extremely diverse nations represented that are always going to look out for their own interests first means esentially nothing gets done.\n\n \n The UN is no more or less corrupt than any other complex administrative body; do you honestly believe that the US government is entirely free from corruption? Or the UK? Or the EU? Or any major corporation? This is a feature of any complex human interactive organisation and is a major factor in the impossibility of communism; there will always be someone who wants to get as much as they can at the expense of others.\n As for useless and obstructive, it is such a well-known fact that I can't be bothered to go into it, that the US has by far the highest record of Security Council vetoes, usually on global issues that would help the majority of the world while slightly disadvantaging the US economy, therefore being unnaccepable, therefore being reported in the mainstream RIGHT WING media as the UN being \"ineffective\". I would like to make the point now that any clains that the US mainstream media is biased towards the left is the single, most obviously, laughable concept ever put to paper. Most US pundits don't even know what the left wing is.\n \n \n \n \nYep, we're Nazis. If you **** us off, we'll send the boogeymen out to eat your puppies, marry off your sisters, and drink your oil. The US doesn't have the influence over the world economy the way we do through force of arms. We have a decent sized population, a capitalist economic system, and the resources to do something about it.\n\n \n The US National Security Strategy of 17 September 2002 is surprisingly bellicose in its wording, and essentially declares what was already established (if unspoken) fact for the preceeding 50 years, that the US can and will do whatever it wants, and other countries claims to sovereignty mean nothing if those claims include specifics which contradict US economic interests. \n Obviously the US government/military does not have an overriding influence over the world economy, but US corporations do in a way that is so obvious it is not worth going in to. You are aware that the US dollar is the world's reserver currency? Of course any link between these corporations' interests and US government policy is entirely based on circumstancial evidence and biased hearsay.....HALLIBURTON ANYONE????? \n \n \nAn economic clash is inevitable. China has the world's largest population and they're starting to industrialize heavily. There's gonna be a contest for resources. They're the next world power. I wonder if people will hate them as much as they hate us now.\n\n \n What I'm worried about is another Cold War style scenario with the West and East using proxy armies to implement strategies of dominance over the vast central Asian region, destabilising this huge area of the world (twice the size of the US by any estimate) and creating a new generation of nihilistic terrorists. \n \n \nIn the words of the Marines... 'Hoo-rah.' emoticon_cool\n\n \n In the words of the Marines: \"Why the #### are we here in this godforsaken desert? Why don't these Arabs love us? Why don't they shower us with blossoms? Why don't they - KILL KILL KILL!!! That guy's got a gun! Well it looks like a gun!! OK it was a stick KILL THEM ANYWAY!!!!!\"",

   "\n Here's a question for you: is there any other nation that you would prefer as a replacement for the US in the same role ?\n \n And here's another: Do you include Jimmy Carter's presidency among the administrations that you consider aggressive (since WWII) ?\n\n \n Of course there is no other nation I would want to see in the same role; any other nation would be doing exactly the same as the US is now. It is only natural for the dominant superpower's administrative/economic elites to pursue policy to maintain that position. Unfortunatley given the US's inconceivable military supremacy there is no rational way for anyone to try to reset this imbalance of power.\n \n Carter's administration was involved in the proxy war with the Soviets in Afghanistan.",

   "1) Massive increase in wealth inequality leading to ghettoisation (if that is a word) of large urban areas and significant civil disorder\nWait, I thought you were suggesting the future! I thought this already was happening.\n \n2) Further centralisation of the electoral process to the point where it is impossible to moderate\n\n I think we have come close before.\n \n3) Further legislation aimed at consolidating the elite power bases and removing legal forms of protest, including public disagreement with policy \n\n Already happening.\n \n4) Increased militarisation; permanent reinstatement of the draft\n\n Oh gosh, I hope not.\n \n5) Militarisation of space and expanded nuclear weapons program allowing the US to forcefully intervene anywhere in the world without fear of reprisal\n\n Well, of course you non-American freak. We don't trust you. We hardly even trust our next door neighbor. Thank God for the Patriot Actemoticon_rolleyes . We can ram a nuke down your throat and call it Patriotism; especially if it was Bush's idea. Then, if you retaliate, we can call that Terrorism. Then we can declare war on you.emoticon_rolleyes \n (Please know that this is a joke. I'm not really calling you a freak and I'm also highly against the Pansy act. I mean Patriot Act. Or do I mean it?emoticon_confused :) )\n \n6) Effective dissolution of the UN leading to all countries having to make one-on-one agreements with the US on its terms or face economic isolation\n\n Well, yeah, considering that the UN has failed already. emoticon_rolleyes (Another joke)\n \n7) Further economic dominance by the US through the threat and use of aggression and regime change,rendering many national governments irrelevant\n \n Honest question: Are you talking of regime change in US or other countries?\n \n8) Economic and (God help us all) military clash with China over central Asian oil reserves\n\n Well yeah, haven't you learned yet that oil is more important to us than the fact that North Korea ever had nukes?emoticon_rolleyes \n \n9) The Eiffel Tower is melted down and reforged into the \"Freedom Cigar\", smoked forever by the Statue of Liberty\n\n We would have to burn down the Statue of Liberty too because it was given to us as a gift from the French. I just hope that we don't go to Italy and try to take down the Leaning Tower of Pisa because when you see it from a particular angle, it seems to lean too much to the Left (But I really hope the Bush administration doesn\\'t get quite that paronoid.",
