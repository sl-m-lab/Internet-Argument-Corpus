   "A begged question seems to floating in many of the threads out there. So I thought I would state it explicity.\n \n Is there an absolute authority for right and wrong? I think we have talked about this indirectly through many of the threads. Christian, wiccan, humanistic, muslim, judaism, etc. Is there an ABSOLUTE authority. Please answer with yes or no and with a supporting argument. \n \n I would prefer that people attempt to follow logically and try to be succinct. No 6 page posts or massive posting from other sites. What do you believe and why? Quotes from other sites, books, articles etc are of course allowed. \n \n By the way, my belief is that there is absolutely an absolute for right and wrong. Irregardless of what I think that authority is. Everyone must have an absolute. Even saying \"There are no absolutes,\" is a statement of an absolute.\n \n What do y'all think?",

Well I'm going to disagree with this then. I think an absolute authority cannot exist because I would say that it is alright for certain people to do things while it is not alright for other people to do certain things. For instance, is it right or wrong for a black person to say negro (or whatever) to another black person more than it is right for a white person to say the same thing to another black person? Feelings get involved in this sort of a determination. Would God say it is wrong for the black person to say that to another black person assuming it is not done in an angry way? I would say no. It doesn't hurt anyone. How about for the white person saying it to a black man in a non-angry way? It is my opinion that God would say this is wrong. It hurts the other person. It is an emotions and social thing.\n \n I think there are a lot of cases where what is right and what is wrong is simply based on how others will react to it. I would also think there are a lot of cases where there is no right or wrong answer. For instance, your car broke down and you are trying to get your wife to the hospital after she got cut and has lost a lot of blood. You see someone's car running on a few feet away unoccupied and the owner is no where in sight. Although it is stealing to just take off with the car you simply cannot do it because a life is at stake. If there has to be a right or wrong answer here, what would the answer be? Would it depend on whose car you stole? Would it depend on how hurt your wife is? How could anyone make that decision? I would suspect that God wouldn't declare it as universally right or wrong because it would be a situational thing.\n \n So it is just my opinion that God both doesn't have a check list for what is right and what is wrong and that he isn't going to have an opinion for everything on whether it is right or wrong. I don't think he would be an absolute authority on this subject. If anything I would expect that God would look at our world and see how we determine what is right and what is wrong. If he sees that it is considered wrong for us to do something and the person that did it knows that it is wrong, then regardless of what was done, it was wrong. For instance, a person who believes an abortion is wrong yet has one anyways has done something wrong. A person who thinks that abortions are not wrong has an abortion, therefore it isn't wrong. Same goes for religious beliefs. One person believes it is right to believe in God therefore he is right. One person believes it is right to believe in Allah therefore he is right. Only the people that lie to themselves are wrong.\n \n So again, I don't think there is an absolute authority.",

I would tend to believe that the societies view on what is right and wrong should have more authority on that question than the insane person. What do you think?\n\n \n in defense of sundowner... and actually this applies to your situation with the hurt wife and the car... we decide if what we do is right or wrong, but we still had to answer to society's laws. Ok your wife may be bleeding to death, and stealing a car is the only way to save her life... but you still steal a car. If the person presses charges then you will be held responsible for stealing the car. There is no amendment to grand theft auto that says \"(unless someone needs to get to the hospital)\". \n \n Now in the husband's mind he was completely justified, but the person who's car was stolen just sees a stolen car. I think the husband, after his wife was taken care of, would return the car... or turn himself in... or report what happened. This would hopefully let the guy who got robbed realize what happened, and not press charges, or maybe press charges until it can be confirmed that the husband was actually trying to save his wife's life. \n \n We have to answer to society's laws, but only in a physical sense. Society doesn't really tell us \"What you did was morally wrong\". instead it says \"you committed a crime, and this is the repercussion\". In our own minds we don't punish ourselves... but instead we tell ourselves \"What you just did is morally right/wrong\".\n \n Now, i still hold that it's difficult for humans to remain consistent in this regard. I guess this is our absolute moral authority... but i'de prefer something outside my mind to answer to. I recognize that i can make mistakes, and rationalize away otherwise immoral actions.",

   "I'm afraid I don't understand. You are asking for an absolute authority right? So even if I state something that is absolute, what does that have to do with an absolute authority? Having just one absolute that I am the authority over doesn't make me an absolute authority either. An absolute authority would have authority absolutely. That means they would be the authority over everything and in this case it would make them the authority over everything that is right and wrong. Therefore I cannot be the absolute authority even to myself.\n\n \n If I understand you correctly you are saying you have absolute authoriity over one thing and that someone else has absolute authority over another thing, therefore there is no absolute authority? Is that correct?",

   "If I understand you correctly you are saying you have absolute authoriity over one thing and that someone else has absolute authority over another thing, therefore there is no absolute authority? Is that correct?\n\n \n Sort of. We are debating whether there is an absolute authority over everything that is right and wrong. The absolute authority would have authority absolutely over everything involved with determining what is right and wrong. Personally I can be the absolute authority over whether it was right or wrong to stay up late or not. However, I cannot say that I would be the absolute authority over whether or not a person in China should stay up late or not. So although I can be an absoulte authority over a few things concerning right and wrong, there is a point where I have to say that I am not the absoulte authority over everything that is right and wrong. So I don't believe any human can be the absolute authority over everything that is right and wrong especially since they would have to know what is right or wrong for different person.\n \n I also stated earlier why I don't think even God would claim to be the absoulte authority over everything as some things can be right and wrong at the same time. There is no absolute in that case therefore there cannot be an absoulte authority that has authority absolutely over what is right and wrong.",

There is no absolute in that case therefore there cannot be an absoulte authority that has authority absolutely over what is right and wrong.\n\n \n I do believe God would claim to be the absolute authority over all things but most especially right and wrong. The fruit that Adam and Eve ate was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded them to not eat it. He claimed authority.\n \n But, I don't want to debate christianity. There must be someone who finally determines what is right or wrong. It cannot be left up to humans. We cannot know what is in another's heart. You are right that the you could not determine for another. However, someone who knew that person better than they knew themselves could. \n \n The very fact that we all know that things are right or wrong or neither indicates that an absolute authority exists. You would quickly say that it would be wrong for me to smack you with a 2X4 in the back of the head. That is because it is wrong. The easiest way to tell that people know something is wrong is that they try to hide it. Absolutes do exist. To say they don't is to deny the very way we live.",

   "I hold for 1 absolutes. \"i think\". Other than that there are no absolutes... and even that statement isn't absolute because of the whole thinking thing.\n \n As for right and wrong... ok honestly what i think about this is that there is no absolute right or wrong. But that doesn't make it arbitrary. Humans can reason what makes more sense, and what doesn't make sense... but there is still always interpretation. That's where God comes in. If a message were to be from God (real or fake) and he had a list of moral absolutes... you can't argue with that as well as you can a human. Either God is all knowing, and knows what is best, or God is so powerful he can smite you for not doing what he says (or a combination of both).\n\n \n Hmmmm..ok.

   "Yes. I believe that the absolute authority for right and wrong is within myself. By this i do not impose that I am \"god\" or \"a god\". What I intend is that I feel that only I am accountable for my actions, nobody else. I am the only one who knows the intent and thought behind each action I take, therefore I decide what is right or wrong. It is true that I base my judgement of right and wrong on lessons learned in life from others, but ultimately it is for me and me alone to decide what I feel on a particular issue. While beliefs of religion, societal law, and moral correctness may all influence your opinion of right and wrong...you still must decide for yourself what you believe...hence you must decide what is right and wrong from within yourself. I hope this did not confuse too many people...but very good question Epaphras!\n\n \n Hi!\n Intresting concept. Let me accept your view for argument sake and try to go to it's logical conclusion.\n \n I decide for myself that putting hidden cameras in womens locker rooms is right. \n I decide that it's ok to blow up abortion clinics to help save lives, even though I'll go to prison, at least lives were saved.\n I decide theres nothing wrong with gay-bashing and racial slurs.\n \n Wow...what freedom..to do as I choose! Thats very liberating for *me*",

   "Sundowner:\n \n I just read what you wrote about right and wrong. I think you may be confused about discerning right and wrong and having the authority to decide what is right and wrong in the first place.\n \n There are things that are either right or wrong, regardless of what you think of them. That is what I-wonder was trying to communicate I believe.\n \n You alone can discern that within yourself. True. However, the point I am making in asking the question is that there are some things that are just right or wrong. \n \n An authority is an agent that sets a standard. For instance when I am looking for an authority on a subject, say driving, I look at the Laws that tell me what is legal and illegal. Those laws would be an authority. A higher authority would the legislature that makes those laws. That is what I mean by an authority.",
