I mean a country like China, whose population is now well over a billion bodies, could use a llittle extra space. Don't you ever see an invasion of our soil?\n \n I kind of like emclean's idea.

We do, however, need more special forces types who are qualified to combat the enemies we now face, ie terrorists.\n\n \n I have odd ideas about that one. IMO we don't need any military outside the US and the one here should only be large enough to fend off whatever educated opinions state as being the maximum invasion force one or two other countries could muster up after we blast each other to pieces. To me, military forces have become so sophisticated that any major power that gets backed up to the wall and has nuclear capability is, one way or another, going to use it. China nor Russia will never go through another WW11, they'll take the world down with them before that happens, so we need to wait until 2010-2015 when world oil production starts the downside or we first go broke before much is going to change. Especially when considering special interests control our policies and direction.",

   "If it was me, the first thing I would do is cut our military by half. We have 2,000,000 people in our military, but only 500,000 combat troops. You do not need 2,000,000 people to support 500,000 combat troops. This is rediculous. What we need is not a bigger military, it is a more efficient one. Too many paper pushers are what is destroying the military. \n \n I, too, would greatly increase the number of SF troops, as well as changing loadout for individual soldiers to better reflect the realities of current warfare. We are not equipped to fight a modern war, which is to say a gureilla war fought in an urban environment. Our military is basically designed to fight WWII over again, and is well designed for figthing an open war in europe. It is not particularly well suited for small, regional conflicts in which the enemy employs non-traditional tactics.",

Sure, you might have nuclear capability and the worlds most powerful air force/ navy, but that dont matter too much when the enemy ninjas sneak in, blow up your ships at dock, destroy your planes on the ground and disable your nuke facilities.\n \n And the SAS/Commandos will do just that.",

Not to mention the pay problems, things like R&D, medical support...\n\n \n Most of the world managed with a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. Considering the amount of stuff the US military outsources, we should be able to beat that. The problem is that we bring in private contractors to take over jobs traditionally done by soldiers (including during peace time), but we keep those military units anyway. Essentially you end up with private contractors doing the job, and a military unit struggling to justify their existance. If we are going to use contractors to do the work, that is fine with me, we need to disband the unit they replace. If we are going to have soldiers do the work, that is also fine, but we need to quit paying the contractors. \n \n \n \nThat is the direction our (Australian) military is taking.

Once your guys get the new M8 to replace the old M16/M4 variants, life in an urban situation should become a little easier.\n\n \n I don't know if the situation will be any easier, but the soldiers will at least have a decent rifle for the situation. Our soldiers need more training in urban combat. Currently, every infantryman gets one class covering the subject. This is not enough. Urban combat is so radically different than open combat that barely any training they recieve in open combat is going to transfer.",

Especially a Christian nation with a system of government that exploits the populace into believing that they're always doing God's will?
