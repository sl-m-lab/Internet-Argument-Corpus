G-d help us.\n\n \n That's what is so scary about this; a Leiberman-McCain match might just go over big with moderates on both sides of the aisle right now. And in this Political atmosphere, add those voters to the conservatives who would vote McCain by default and it is possible they could be seen as a perfect compromise to the extreme far left politics that Obama/Hillary represents. \n \n And one more thing; I'm not ready to absolutely declare her politically dead yet, but I am so happy to see Hillary's campaign imploding as it is. Because her and Obama agree so closely on so many core issues she can't figure out how to attack him without trashing her own policies. I just love it. She also must walk on egg shells so as not to disenfranchise those blacks who do support her. \n \n I maintain though that it will be easy for the Republican Machine to very effectively define the Tax and Spend, Pacifistic, Socialistic Liberalism that Obama represents.

Cohen and Kirk Victor, National Journal\n \u00a9 National Journal Group Inc.\n Thursday, Jan. 31, 2008\n \n Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., was the most liberal senator in 2007, according to National Journal's 27th annual vote ratings. The insurgent presidential candidate shifted further to the left last year in the run-up to the primaries, after ranking as the 16th- and 10th-most-liberal during his first two years in the Senate.\n \n Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., the other front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, also shifted to the left last year. She ranked as the 16th-most-liberal senator in the 2007 ratings, a computer-assisted analysis that used 99 key Senate votes, selected by NJ reporters and editors, to place every senator on a liberal-to-conservative scale in each of three issue categories. In 2006, Clinton was the 32nd-most-liberal senator.\n \n In their yearlong race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Obama and Clinton have had strikingly similar voting records. Of the 267 measures on which both senators cast votes in 2007, the two differed on only 10. \"The policy differences between Clinton and Obama are so slight they are almost nonexistent to the average voter,\" said Richard Lau, a Rutgers University political scientist.\n Given this info, how far do you think he will go in the real World once this voting record is made common knowledge in all 50 States? Especially if he picks Hillary as his running mate. emoticon_idea",
