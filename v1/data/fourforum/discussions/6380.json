Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is-his good, pleasing and perfect will. \n 3For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. 4Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 6We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his[b]faith. 7If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; 8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully. \n \n Love \n 9Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality. \n 14Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 16Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.[c] Do not be conceited. \n \n 17Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. 18If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 19Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: \"It is mine to avenge; I will repay,\"[d]says the Lord. 20On the contrary: \n \"If your enemy is hungry, feed him; \n if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. \n In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.\"[e] 21Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\n\n \n Bassman, can you help me find where God gave authority to execute justice to the state?

Whoever you had sex with thats part of him to.

Im sry if i seemed blunt calling everyone stupid because they're are those that make one mistake and we all make mistakes including me.

I have friends that go out and do some pretty dumb stuff and I can't understand why they dont think of the consequences before they do these things. I guess its part of being young. Having a baby as a teenager doesnt have to ruin your life though. I am not closed minded in my thinking. I believe what I believe and I think what I believe is right. If that is closed mindedness then no one believes in anything. If you can't say that what you believe is right then you dont believe it. I am open to any opinions you have. I will hear them out and if I agree with them or I feel like you have proved me wrong I will say so. I shouldn't have labeled people who have unplanned pregnancies as stupid. I felt like if there was someone who had six kids and couldn't afford 1 then she was not very smart to have made the same mistake 6 times. I will continue to say that a human life inside a women is not part of her body. We all should have complete control of our bodies including women but whenever you are with child it is your body with the childs inside of you. Its not fair that women have to be the ones to bear children. Life isn't fair. Its not fair that I'm a white male born in a time period where with affirmitive action you have less oppurtunities as white males used too. Thats not fair I hate that. Because of white males before me I have to deal with things because of what they did. But thats the way it is. Im not trying to compare child birth to affrimitive action b/c their is no comparison. In this life some things are tough for women and some things are tough for men. I understand your point of view. In my opinion, you can have a girlfriend and you get her pregnant you want to have the baby and she doesnt and it doesnt matter what you think.

   "There are other options besides abortion. If a 16 year old girl has an abortion it doesn't errase what she has done. If she gives her baby up for adoption it still doesnt change what shes done. But if she has an abortion she'll question herself for the rest of her life about how she killed a life inside of her. \n\n \n How do you know she will question herself for the rest of her life? Thats not a strong enough argument. Sure there are other options then abortion, however for a 16 year old to go through pregnancy is a big deal. \n \n \nIm sick of liberals forcing abortion on young 16 year old girls as the only option because if they knew how inhumane an abortion is done they would have mental problems for the rest of their life.\n\n \n No \"liberals\" aren't forcing abortion on women. Thats what you people fail to see. \n We arent advocated abortion, we are advocating the right for women to beable to choose what they want. \n You have to understand that we arent Forcing abortion! I would love it much more if women didnt have to have abotions, that would be great, but they should be given a choice to what they want.\n \n \nI shouldn't have labeled people who have unplanned pregnancies as stupid. I felt like if there was someone who had six kids and couldn't afford 1 then she was not very smart to have made the same mistake 6 times.\n\n \n So why make her have the baby if she didnt plan and/or is unable to care for any of them? \n \n \nA baby inside of a women is not part of her body. We all should have complete control of our bodies including women but whenever you are with child it is your body with the childs inside of you. Its not fair that women have to be the ones to bear children. Life isn't fair. Its not fair that I'm a white male born in a time period where with affirmitive action you have less oppurtunities as white males used too. Thats not fair I hate that. Because of white males before me I have to deal with things because of what they did. But thats the way it is. Im not trying to compare child birth to affrimitive action b/c their is no comparison. In this life some things are tough for women and some things are tough for men. I understand your point of view. In my opinion, you can have a girlfriend and you get her pregnant you want to have the baby and she doesnt and it doesnt matter what you think. She can have an abortion and abort a baby that is half you. Does that seem right?\n\n \n Since when should the governement tell women what is Best for THEM? Since when do others decide what someone else should do? Your \"life isnt fair\" argument is good enough. Women shold have all the say in the world for that baby cause she is the one going through the labor to give birth. If she doesnt want the baby, why on earth should she go through all that pain for something that was a mistake and that she wont even beable to or want to care for it.",

   "Wow. You actually legislate being able to kill off a human life. Make it a law? How horrible.\n\n \n Please, don't put words into my mouth. Abortion does not deal with killing people, but not providing for them. Lets look at another situation where we may be required to provide care for people:\n \n At the scene of a car accident. You come across a car accident at an intersection. You are not required to provide care to any of the victims, even if you are an off duty paramedic. Not required to care for them, even if they die*.\n \n What it boils down to is what you call reasonable. I certainly don't consider it reasonable to expect a woman to go through nine months of gestation in order to support someone she may not have even wanted in the first place. She didn't or doesn't want that person there, and IMO shouldn't be required to take care of them.\n \n While it is regretable that people die as a result of this, people who through no fault of their own were put in a crappy situation, I think it is more unreasonable to expect people to go through nine months of pregnancy to support them. There is no denying that pregnancy can be fatal. It can be harmful, both mentally and physically. It's not always, but it can be.\n \n \nI gather that you want me to cite my information. Here yea go. Have fun learning interesting facts. http://www.abortioninfo.net/facts/affect2.shtml\n\n \n Hardly fun. While interesting, I see nothing that conclusively indicates that having an abortion is always or even often more mentally and physically damaging than a full term pregnancy.\n \n * - This is the case in Australia. I don't know about legal requirements to provide aid to others in other countries.",

   "Women gripe more about child birth now then they did in 1850. They had more of a reason to gripe then. \n\n \n Frankly, childbirth is the easy part. The nine months before it are what sucks. After child birth is when it gets really hard. They grow up and some of them get smart-mouthed and think they know everything. \n \n \nYes, no matter what decision you make your going to question it. That comes from making the mistake. So I guess saying that an abortion is erasing a consequence is wrong. Because no matter what you do you'll have that thought lingering in your head.\n\n \n This is a pretty damned presumptious thing to say. You think because you watched your sister go through pregnancy you know what it is all about for all women? The emotional/mental health/regret issue is barely debatable. It will completely depend on the circumstances and the woman. You have no business speaking for us all. So let me draw this line in the sand; you can stop speaking for and making such assumptions for me. I don't need your help determining what is best for me. Thanks anyway.\n \n \nThe thought of killing your own baby is more detrimental to ones health and mindset than keeping or putting the baby up for adoption.\n\n \n Pregnancy impacts women's health and is potentially more detrimental to them than abortion by a long long shot. Unless, of course, that abortion is performed in an unsanitary way by anyone who isn't a doctor.\n \n \nDon't even start to tell me about how bad labor is. My sister just had a baby. She was laughing after it telling me she wanted to go to the water park with me.\n\n \n Watch me. I have been through it. 11 years ago today as a matter of fact. My baby is ELEVEN. GAH! Where does the time go?\n \n Anyway - mine (labor) was long and sucky, but survivable. My sister in law tore from her vagina to her rectum. My friend died (they were able to resuscitate). Your sister is not the example of all women.\n \n \nLets forget the fact that the baby is not hers alone. I mean do you know how self-centered we are. I know this baby is half you but its inside me so I own all of it. Someone had to carry the baby im sry if had to be you. I know some girls who had a baby as a teenager.

Once you infringe on another human beings rights claiming you have a right to do this or that. \n\n \n How would you qualify making personal medical decisions for total strangers?\n \n \nYour rights do not go that far.\n\n \n Yes. They do.\n \n \nAgain Im sry that as humans woman have to carry a baby around for 9 months.\n\n \n Why? I'm not and remain pro-choice.\n \n Do you really have any clue why women may abort? Do really have an idea of all that a pregnancy may entail? Impacts to physical and mental health, potential loss of income if it impacts your being able to work (what if mom is already supporting children - do they matter at all?), and let's not forget - pregnancy is not free. Mine cost somewhere around $30k at least. Plus violence may play a role - was the pregnancy the result of it or will it result in it (women who are abused tend to receive MORE abuse when pregnant). Women's stories are vast and varied and so are there reasons. \n \n Quite demonzing them and find a way to help and you will save a lot more babies than your current preaching and know-it-all attitude will.\n \n \nNo one has the right to terminate another human beings life. \n\n \n But we do have the right to have an abortion.",

Cells for pre\u00ebxisting humans are just parts, but the oocyte, since it can grow into a baby, is a whole person (or maybe a half). A lung cell is just a small part of someone but an oocyte before fertilization is half of one!\nA oocyte, prior to fertilization - contains a full diploid set of chromosomes. It contains the same information as every other cell in the host body (though the information is re-ordered). The oocyte never contains half the infomation as meiosis only completes after fertilization by the sperm. I'm starting to get the impression that you throw the term \"oocyte\" about without actually understanding what it is. A human lung cell contains all the information to contruct an entire human. It is just in the wrong state to do so. An oocyte is no less \"just a part\" than a lung cell.\n \n \nThis is a tragedy, and we must work to increase zygote survival rates. How can we do this, Clive14?\nWell first of all we would have to ban all natural procreation and only create human babies by artifical procreation (ie, everyone would have to be a \"test tube\" baby\".)

   "Chloe:\n \n \nThis is the view which drives the pro life movement. I will argue that it is the view which present the highest view of human life, and thus the highest view of women. \n By forcing them to be enslaved incubators. I don't think so.\n \n \nThis view allows that there is inherent dignity within each human life and therefore everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. And, even if they aren't, their life has value. This value was not given by humans and therefore cannot be taken away by humans.\nBut you can take away that value by forcing them to do things against their will. Who gave you that right?\n \n \nThe predominate view which is at the heart of the pro choice movement is secular humanism. \n No it is not. It is the position that some things are between a wife, a husband, a doctor, a minister and God, and are none of the government's business. \n \n \nEverything has happened by chance and therefore mankind is a random wart on the face of a random meaningless chance universe. Therefore all human life is just the sum of its parts and is no better than dirt. It has no inherent meaning. Therefore, women have no value.\n \n Therefore, the view which predominately drives the pro life movement places a view of women that is exceedingly and abundantly trancendent above the view which predominately drives the pro choice movement. The pro life view of women is of a different quality and order.\nNo so. The pro-life position is to relegate woman to the role of enslaved incubators. That is what is the high value they hold women in. The pro-choice position acknowledges that woman have a free will.",

   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n What the Guru And the Philosopher Can't Tell You\n By COLIN MCGINN\n November 3, 2005; Page D8\n When people ask, \"What's the meaning of life?\" they often seek some item of esoteric knowledge that will make sense of their existence -- to be supplied by a guru, a religious leader or a Deep Philosopher. The question is taken to be asking why we are here -- what the ultimate purpose of human life is. This purpose might originate in God or evolution or even in aliens from outer space: X put us here to achieve purpose P. The question is then what to put for X and P.\n \n But that can't be right, as Julian Baggini argues in his useful and provocative \"What's It All About?\" At most we will claim to know what X's purpose was in putting us here, not what our goals and values ought to be. A deity might have created us to worship him, but this might not provide much meaning for us (we might prefer to be worshipped ourselves). Genes might have put us here to serve as vehicles of their reproduction, but why should we care about their purposes?\n \n Thus the causal origin of the human race is the wrong place to look for what gives meaning to life. And this is a good thing, because it is at best a moot point whether the universe has any purpose at all: It might simply be. If this is at least a possibility, we want to be able to find a meaning in life that issues from life itself, not from what purposely gave rise to it.\n \n We should first replace the question with its plural version: \"What are the meanings of life?\" That is, what values are worth pursuing? The altruist will say that the prime meaning in life derives from helping others. Mr. Baggini makes the excellent point that there is something inconsistent in this attitude, if it insists on excessive self-sacrifice. Helping others is good only because of the improvement that is made in other people's lives -- but then the key value is living what he calls a \"full and flourishing life.\" If it is good to promote such lives in others, then it is good to enjoy such a life oneself. So the value of altruism lies not in the helping but in the end achieved. If so, our focus must be on what makes a life full and flourishing.\n \n Happiness is the natural answer. But there are problems: What kind of happiness? That of the aesthete, the moralist or the sensualist? And what is happiness, anyway -- a momentary feeling, a lasting disposition, a mere absence of misery? How is it to be achieved? Perhaps not by pursuing it directly but by pursuing other purposes, of which happiness is an offshoot or byproduct. But then those purposes need to be identified and will constitute the underlying values.\n \n And there is this problem: What if someone offered you the chance to live inside a \"happiness machine\" that simulated the joyful life, as you understand it, but that involved no actual relationships or achievements or even truth (rather like the \"Matrix\" movies)? You would experience a lot of happiness but would be living a fake existence: Wouldn't all that pleasant emotion be hollow and meaningless?\n \n This possibility suggests that some notion of authenticity and genuine achievement is necessary for a meaningful life, not merely agreeable affect. As Mr. Baggini notes, we needn't restrict such achievement to the artist or scientist or entrepreneur; everyone strives for success in one form or another, even if it is \"just\" being part of a loving family. People need to achieve worthwhile goals if they are to feel satisfied with their lives, but the goals may vary. Above all, people need to become the kind of person they individually aspire to be.\n \n The mistake is to make one value dominant over all others, as if a single goal will confer meaning on life for all. Instead we need a list: happiness, altruism, achievement, learning, self-expression, personal relations. Such a list supplies what Mr. Baggini calls a \"deflationary\" answer to the question of life's meaning. It is not some hidden and inaccessible secret, available only to the initiated or requiring a leap of faith. Rather, it consists of things that everyone already knows, even if in an unarticulated form. It is not a matter of where we came from or where we might be going. Rather, it is a matter of the very pith and marrow of life as it is lived. We each have a responsibility to select the values we shall live by and to pursue them with vigor; we cannot appeal to some outside authority to relieve us of this obligation. We must find a meaning in life, not suppose that the meaning is conferred by something outside it.\n \n Of course, this is the standard secular approach to the question. Having accepted that human existence is itself purposeless, a mere accident of cosmic evolution, we feel obliged to find meaning within that given life -- in the values that reason identifies. Our lives will then have value to us, even if not to any external agency.\n \n Mr. Baggini is articulating such a secular view, and I am with him in dismissing other approaches -- not so much because they are false factually as because they do not really answer the question they purport to: namely, how we should live in order to have meaningful lives. God is not so much dead as irrelevant by this reckoning, at least when it comes to deciding what gives life meaning, since we have to ask which values from the religious tradition really confer value on life, by our own standards.\n \n The question that remains, not taken up by Mr. Baggini, is whether this kind of deflationary secular answer is enough. Most people will agree with the list he offers and live according to it, but they may still have a nagging feeling that more is required for life to be anything other than a brief and inglorious cosmic bleep. That may be irrational, a kind of pointless overreaching, but it may yet be what the majority of mankind is condemned to feel.\n \n Mr. McGinn's latest book is \"Mindsight: Image, Dream, Meaning\" (Harvard University Press).",

In a world where bad things happen, that can be a very comforting security blanket.\nI dunno, Sigma, I can't see why one couldn't find a redeeming purpose in life without believing in falsehoods. And, a lot of bad things happen, but most of us secular humanists believe that we should be working to fix stuff when bad things happen or try to prevent bad things from happening.",

   "Where have I implied a value for...who? And does that really matter?\n You imply a value when you say that your best friend is about a pig. When you say a fetus is less of a person then your best friend you also apply a value.\n \n \n\n I don't care about \"when the fetus is considered a person.\" I don't know how to define a person versus a human being. Nor do I assign value. Nor does it matter to me. If it's inside the woman's body gestating, she gets to do as she pleases. I do not decide what you do with your body, Steeeeve, why would you want to decide what to do with mine? \n \n First off, aren't you deciding if the fetus is a person or not anyway? If you believe that you are only doing stuff to YOUR OWN body then you have decided the fetus to not be a human/person. Otherwise you would actually be doing somethign to someone elses body (ie the fetus). Secondly, I am not the one deciding what you can/can't do to your own body...the government does and does it all the time. You can't use herion for example. So whether you think you are or not, you do assign a value to human life...whether you think this \"being' is human or not is, in fact, assigning value. Once again the question has become is the fetus a human deserving of rights or not.\n \n Look at it this way. If you knew 100% that the fetus was a person then would this change your view? If not then killing the fetus and not killing your best friend would show a value on one and not the other and thus you placed value on human life..or in this case you have ranked human life. If it does change your mind then the question is still \"is the fetus a human dersreving of rights\".\n \n \n\n Next thing you know, pro-life/anti-choice are going to start a movement on prenatal care. What's the difference? You're working on deciding that the woman has to be pregnant, it's only a small step to be able to dictate the rest of her existance. ' \"I'm sure the fetus would choose broccoli over Alpha bits\" so we must speak for the unborn!' :)\n This strawman will not due and is off topic.",
