   "Conference seeks to mobilize U.S. Catholics against global poverty\n \n SAN FRANCISCO (CNS) -- In a world where half of the population is poor and more than 1 billion people endure a poverty so harsh that their very survival is at risk daily, the notion of eliminating extreme poverty from the world in this lifetime may seem utopian. But Columbia University professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, author of \"The End of Poverty,\" said with only a little more help from the United States and other developed nations, the lives of the world's poorest people could be dramatically improved. America and other nations simply need to live up to the development assistance promises they made six years ago, he said in a keynote speech Oct. 27 at the \"Point 7 Now\" national conference on global poverty. The event was held Oct. 27-28 at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. The \"Point 7 Now\" conference title refers to goals adopted by the nations of the world in September 2000 at the U.N. Millennium Summit, aimed at reducing extreme poverty and improving the lives of those living in the world's poorest countries by the year 2015. Governments of most developed countries agreed to increase their aid to the poorest countries -- pledging the equivalent of seven-tenths of 1 percent of their gross domestic product each year for development assistance.",
