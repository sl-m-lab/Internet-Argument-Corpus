Therefore, the information will be thought of as \"fact\". \n \n Not one of you, I believe, caught this critical error in the \"Thought for the Day\"\n \n Using the article's U.S. death total of 2,112, the correct mathematical operations will show the U.S. soldiers deaths in Iraq as 720 per 100,000 per year, not 60.\n \n Any critical reader should have noticed, given a total of 2,112 deaths, that the deaths per 100,000 U.S. soldiers must be between 500 and 1,000 deaths per 100,000 per year. \n \n The \"Thought for the Day\" calculated the U.S. soldier deaths per 100,000 as follows: (2,112/1.6) divided by (22) months. This result yields the value of 60 deaths reported in the \"Thought for the Day\".\n \n But the reported 60 U.S. soldier deaths per 100,000 is per month not per year as with the D.C. statstics. To get the U.S. soldier deaths per 100,000 per year, you must multiply the 60 deaths per month times 12 months. The result is that you get 720 U.S. soldier deaths per 100,000 per YEAR. \n \n So, the real comparison is 80.6 (mostly civilian) deaths in D.C. versus 720 U.S. soldier deaths in Iraq per 100,000 per year. Not the 60 versus 80.6 that the \"Thought for the Day\" misleads the reader into thinking is the case. \n As you can see, this causes a string of tangential debates among readers without their first correcting the statistic. \n \n So, the article should conclude that you are 893% more likely to get killed in Iraq than in D.C. \n \n If too many citizens are persuaded by fallacious arguments and/or statements and their conclusions, we are doomed. It takes time, energy, research and analytical skills to have an effective political and social discourse. \n \n It is estimated that 27,000-30,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed over the past two years. At least 11,000 Iraqi civilians have died due to terrorist and war in Baghdad versus 480 civilian deaths (including any law enforcement deaths) in two years in D.C. \n \n re: http://www.iraqbodycount.org \n re: http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/dccrime.htm",
