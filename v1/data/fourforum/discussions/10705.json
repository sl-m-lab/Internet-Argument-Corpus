   "A) Let Matthew answer for himself. And\n \n 2) That argument is fallacious because nature takes care of itself. As we currently see in America with things as they are, the propagation of new life is staying just ahead of the number of people dying, and that is in spite of abortion which kills millions per year, so if what Matt suggests were instituted we would over populate and force undue pressure on all Social Agencies that would have to deal with the ensuing over population that would result. But why am I not surprised that your side would never consider the consequences of blindly instituting such ridiculous mandatory rules.\n\n \n Any species that over extends itself eventually implodes and reduces it's numbers to managable levels.\n \n As to your nuclear family jib.\n My family is one of the more cleverly blended ones made up of bits and pieces via adoptions. \n I had no intentions of reproducing (by love my biological son as the others) but had every intention of being a father.\n Do I qualify?\n \n If marriage is civil, then, as Matthew said, there is NO reason to deny it to any other consenting couple of legal age.\n All a gov't should do is provide legal framework and drop the word marriage from such contracts.\n They can issue legal civil unions and recognize any religious practice that does 'marriages' as being a legal contract also.\n Thus, your religion could desire to marry only heterosexual couples.\n Matthews could marry homosexuals too.\n Joe-bob's could desire to marry only gays.\n Billy-bob's could marry anyone including brothers and BFF's.\n And Jill's could says bah to marriages, have sex with anyone, marriage isn't what where about but if you want a gov't contract...who cares.\n \n Then we're all happy.\n And if you don't want to call Matthew's mate his spouse, then that's your choice. Same if Matt wants to discriminate and not call the woman you're contracted to your 'wife'. \n \n Gays already have children at times and no one is going around saying they can't or taking them away unless they're unfit.\n I'd rather have gays adopt than see a child aborted. \n \n While I think Matt's requirements are a little too far, IF marriage is ONLY about child rearing, then some requirements should be met.\n \n And Archy, what we're saying is that Christians who get in the business of gays over the subject of marriage issues are HYPOCRITS when they don't even police their own in dealing with GREATER sins.\n Arch, wha would your pastor say if you got a divorce and then remarried and had a child with your 2nd wife all the while you're 1st wife remained faithful to her vows and never left you but was cast aside because of 'incompatability' by you?\n In most situations the answer for many Christians is NOTHING. \n In some situations, you'd be 'counseled' for a short time before he went back to business as usual.\n In some rare circumstanes, he'd toss you out of the church on your ear.\n \n But, what would you's do?\n Would he perform the wedding ceremony for your 2nd marriage?\n \n Do you have divorced people in your church?\n \n Do you fellowship with those who've remarried?\n \n Archy, in a religious sense, deal with the plank in the eye of the Church before pointing out the speck in the eye of the non-believer.",

In my lifetime, despite the existence of millions of happy homosexuals, the world population has more than doubled to over 6 billion and is still rising fast. Population is a function of the difference between birth and death rates. It's a simple matter of arithmetic, and as long as breeding remains a favorite heterosexual pastime, it will go on no matter how many gays there are.\n \n Overpopulation happens when too many people chase too few resources, and has nothing to do with absolute numbers.
