   "two can play this game. \n \n If Kerry is a bad candidate because he flip flops, then Bush is a bad candidate because he flip flops as well. \n \n \n\n President Bush: Flip-Flopper-In-Chief\n \n September 2, 2004, Updated\n Download Poster\n \n From the beginning, George W. Bush has made his own credibility a central issue. On 10/11/00, then-Gov. Bush said: \"I think credibility is important.It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.\" But President Bush's serial flip-flopping raises serious questions about whether Congress and foreign leaders can rely on what he says.\n \n 1. Social Security Surplus\n \n BUSH PLEDGES NOT TO TOUCH SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS... \"We're going to keep the promise of Social Security and keep the government from raiding the Social Security surplus.\" [President Bush, 3/3/01]\n \n ...BUSH SPENDS SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS The New York Times reported that \"the president's new budget uses Social Security surpluses to pay for other programs every year through 2013, ultimately diverting more than $1.4 trillion in Social Security funds to other purposes.\" [The New York Times, 2/6/02]\n \n 2.

John Smithee in 1995. He... constantly opposed a patient's right to sue an HMO over coverage denied that resulted in adverse health effects.\" [Salon, 2/7/01]\n \n ...CANDIDATE BUSH PRAISES TEXAS PATIENTS' RIGHT TO SUE... \"We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage... It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people. And I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients' bill of rights, Mr. Vice President. And I want all people covered. I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.\" [Governor Bush, 10/17/00]\n \n ...PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION ARGUES AGAINST RIGHT TO SUE \"To let two Texas consumers, Juan Davila and Ruby R. Calad, sue their managed-care companies for wrongful denials of medical benefits 'would be to completely undermine' federal law regulating employee benefits, Assistant Solicitor General James A. Feldman said at oral argument March 23. Moreover, the administration's brief attacked the policy rationale for Texas's law, which is similar to statutes on the books in nine other states.\" [Washington Post, 4/5/04]\n \n 3. Tobacco Buyout\n \n BUSH SUPPORTS CURRENT TOBACCO FARMERS' QUOTA SYSTEM... \"They've got the quota system in place -- the allotment system -- and I don't think that needs to be changed.\" [President Bush, 5/04]\n \n ...BUSH ADMINISTRATION WILL SUPPORT FEDERAL BUYOUT OF TOBACCO QUOTAS \"The administration is open to a buyout.\" [White House spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo, 6/18/04]\n \n 4. North Korea\n \n BUSH WILL NOT OFFER NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA INCENTIVES TO DISARM... \"We developed a bold approach under which, if the North addressed our long-standing concerns, the United States was prepared to take important steps that would have significantly improved the lives of the North Korean people. Now that North Korea's covert nuclear weapons program has come to light, we are unable to pursue this approach.\" [President's Statement, 11/15/02]\n \n ...BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFERS NORTH KOREA INCENTIVES TO DISARM\"Well, we will work to take steps to ease their political and economic isolation. So there would be -- what you would see would be some provisional or temporary proposals that would only lead to lasting benefit after North Korea dismantles its nuclear programs. So there would be some provisional or temporary efforts of that nature.\" [White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, 6/23/04]\n \n 5. Abortion\n \n BUSH SUPPORTS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE... \"Bush said he...favors leaving up to a woman and her doctor the abortion question.\" [The Nation, 6/15/00, quoting the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 5/78]\n \n ...BUSH OPPOSES A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE \"I am pro-life.\" [Governor Bush, 10/3/00]\n \n 6.

Condoleeza Rice Testimony\n \n BUSH SPOKESMAN SAYS RICE WON'T TESTIFY AS 'A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE'... \"Again, this is not her personal preference; this goes back to a matter of principle. There is a separation of powers issue involved here. Historically, White House staffers do not testify before legislative bodies. So it's a matter of principle, not a matter of preference.\" [White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, 3/9/04]\n \n ...BUSH ORDERS RICE TO TESTIFY: \"Today I have informed the Commission on Terrorist Attacks Against the United States that my National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, will provide public testimony.\" [President Bush, 3/30/04]\n \n 9.

Department of Homeland Security\n \n BUSH OPPOSES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY...\"So, creating a Cabinet office doesn't solve the problem. You still will have agencies within the federal government that have to be coordinated. So the answer is that creating a Cabinet post doesn't solve anything.\" [White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, 3/19/02]\n \n ...BUSH SUPPORTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY \"So tonight, I ask the Congress to join me in creating a single, permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission: securing the homeland of America and protecting the American people.\" [President Bush, Address to the Nation, 6/6/02]\n \n 12.

They could have been destroyed during the war. Saddam and his henchmen could have destroyed them as we entered into Iraq. They could be hidden. They could have been transported to another country, and we'll find out.\" [President Bush, Meet the Press, 2/7/04]\n \n 13. Free Trade\n \n BUSH SUPPORTS FREE TRADE... \"I believe strongly that if we promote trade, and when we promote trade, it will help workers on both sides of this issue.\" [President Bush in Peru, 3/23/02]\n \n ...BUSH SUPPORTS RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE \"In a decision largely driven by his political advisers, President Bush set aside his free-trade principles last year and imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel to help out struggling mills in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, two states crucial for his reelection.\" [Washington Post, 9/19/03]\n \n 14.

We're engaging in a different kind of nation building, and it's resonable that Bush would change his position after 9/11.\n\n \n BS. Different kind? Oh you mean the kind that is expoential in cost in lives, money, alliances, credibility, and our future. \n \n \n\n I believe he said something to the extent of the goals were too high and it was a bad bill. Don't try to give me that.\n\n \n ....link next time. The fact is Bush shortchanged the bill by $27 billion. You can't ignore that, even though you have fuzzy math. \n \n \n\n Kerry's a law guy. He was out defending the PATRIOT Act for awhile. Now that the campaign's come along he's against it.\n\n \n Define awhile. Aka a few months after 9/11 or a 18 months? Everyone should be questioning any legislation passed during sheer hysteria. The fact that most politicans on the right aren't says much about their philosophy. write no letters in hate, and make no laws in hysteria. \n \n \n \n I already agreed that all politicians flip flop. Bush isn't the king of the sport.\n\n \n But he still does it constantly. Therefore how can you attack Kerry without attacking Bush for flip flopping? Both of them are and therefore a reason that applies to both cannot rationally be applied to just one. \n \n \n\n Even a lot of the liberals I know who want Kerry elected are ready to tear their hair out over his constant flip flops, especially on Iraq.\n\n \n Even a lot of the republicans I know who want Bush elected are ready to tear their hair out over his constant flip flops, especially on his promises. \n \n But then again, your definition of good is pretty dillusional $1.7 trillion for less then $150 million? Obviously that's a Good investment!",
