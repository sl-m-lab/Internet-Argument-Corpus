Power and Associates said on Friday.\n \n snip\n \n GM and Ford both reported 23 percent declines in their U.S. sales last month, as high gasoline prices hurt demand for their big sport utility vehicles and industrywide sales fell to their slowest pace in seven years.\n \n DaimlerChrysler was in fourth place in early November, with a retail share of 13.6 percent, while Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (7267.T: Quote, Profile, Research) took the No. 5 spot with a 12.2 percent share.\n \n Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., which suffered a 13 percent decline in October sales, appears to be in line for more disappointing results in November, according to the Power Information Network. It said Nissan's retail sales were down 15 percent from the same period last year and its share was holding flat at 7.8 percent.\n \n \n",

That will eliminate 30,000 more jobs and save $7Billion/year IIRC.\n With the recent \"GM Employee Pricing\" for all car buyers, GM showed that when they sell their vehicles at prices comparable to the imports (who don't have the high employee/legacy costs) they can compete with imports. They certainly have better designed products than ancient Toyota (Camry) and Honda (Civic) models that finally got facelifts as their sales started to drop off. \n On a level playing field, I'll take the American made car every time.\n\n \n As I posted, the investment community is giving no credibility to GM's announced restructure for several very important reasons:\n \n 1. No revenue forecast with $1-2 billion restructuring charges\n 2. No market share forecast with reduced production capability\n 3. Duplicated models\n 4. No restructuring of the corporate culture\n 5. How they'll cope with existing legacy costs without shedding them through formal reorganization\n \n At this point I don't think quality is even an issue in the overall picture; past poor quality left a bad impression on the public that will take a couple of generations to overcome.",

   "Even employees don't buy cars at \"cost\". There's always a built-in profit margin, albeit a small one.\n\n Rover, the British car manufacturer, had a scheme for selling cars to their employees at near cost prices. Many of these sales were also financed by a cheap company loan. In effect, Rover loaned money to employees who wanted to buy a car from them at a subsidised price. Not good business practice: the company went into liquidation earlier this year. \n \n Selling cars at a very low profit to their employees did not of course (by itself) ruin Rover. It's a complicated story but we can boil it down to its failure to update its models, and make attractive cars that people wanted to buy at a competitive price.",

   "I was most interested in GM's announcements in regard to their now-failed experiment: Saturn. This was suppose to be a stand-alone company able to compete head on with the Japanese in what is regarded as the entry-level market. The manufacturing plant building these in Tennessee is one of announced closings. Thus it's dead in the water, IMO, though the name might live on.\n \n Saturn marketed itself as providing outstanding service. I remember my wife Joyce wanting to buy one of these vehicles after being impressed with the TV ads. I recall arguing that if a car company makes a quality product, service should not be much of a consideration, at least not the primary one. We argued on and off, I recall, and often puzzled over GM's strategy and Saturn's appeal to some.\n \n And so it turned out to be nothing but another GM product with all the attendant problems of the company. It never did stand alone.",

   "Saturn actually died in 2000 when GM decided to take sales, service and marketing into the corporate fold; marketing being the driving force behind any consumer product. There was no way an 'independent' model such as Saturn could survive while competing for resources in GM's inbred fiefdom system.",
