   "4 of 5: What is odd is that these early followers of Jesus did not get together to celebrate His teachings or how wonderful He was. They came together regularly for ONE reason: to remember that Jesus had been pubicily slaughtered in a grotesque and humiliating way and was now alive.\n \n If a group of people loved John Kennedy, they might meet regularly (as many fan clubs do) and remember his confrontation with Russia, his promotion of civil rights, or his charismatic personality. But they are not going to celebrate the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald murdered him!\n \n However, that is analogous to what early Christians did. How do you explain that? They realized that Jesus' slaying was a necessary step to a much greater victory. His murder wasn't the last word...the last word was that He had conquered death for us all by rising from the dead.

The reason for it was to prove that Jesus was the son of God. If his other miracles and preaching didn't then the resurrection was the cherry on top. If the resurrection didn't happen there wuld just be less evidence that he was who he said he was. \n \n The crucifixion seems to always be portrayed as second, but of everything it is the most important event. Jesus' birth, baptism, teaching and resurrection can all happen or not and as long as he is crucified man is given salvation (and belief that he died for that purpose)\n \n I think you give the people of 2000 years ago a lot of credit. People today have far more explanation concerning the world, but we still have people who are extreme in their views and actions. People who will do any number of things for a charismatic leader. Look at Jim Jones, Charles Manson or any number of others through history who have found a willing audience. \n \n They tapped into the poor, tired, uneducated who would have been happy to have a miserable life. They promised them someone cared about them would look after them and didn't want anything from them except to believe. Small price to pay for hope, what did they have to lose?",
