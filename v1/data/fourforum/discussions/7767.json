   "African bad guy and his American bad guy friend:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/international/africa/17cnd-liberia.html\n \n \nMarch 17, 2006\n Liberia's Leader Asks Nigeria to Extradite Warlord \n By WARREN HOGE\n UNITED NATIONS, March 17 -The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said today that she had asked Nigeria to extradite Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president, to face war crimes charges in Sierra Leone.\n \n Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, who became Africa's first elected woman head of state two months ago, told the Security Council that she had made a formal request to Olusegun Obasanjo, the president of Nigeria, where Mr. Taylor has been living in exile.\n \n Mr. Taylor took asylum in Nigeria in August 2003 as part of an internationally brokered peace settlement forcing him to leave office and end 14 years of civil war in Liberia.\n \n He was subsequently indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a United Nations-backed court in neighboring Sierra Leone.\n \n Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said she was not seeking Mr. Taylor's extradition to Liberia because he was not under indictment there.\n \n Mr. Taylor, 58, a warlord turned president, rampaged through his own country and much of West Africa during the 1990's, unleashing a cycle of ruthless campaigns of torture, rape and dismemberment that convulsed civilian populations.\n \n Even in exile, Mr. Taylor remains influential in Liberia, with thousands of young combatants still loyal to him, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said, making her decision to bring him to justice \"courageous but risky\". . . .\n\n \n But, it must also be remembered:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A7124-2001Sep21\n \n \nPat Robertson's Gold\n By Colbert I. King\n Saturday, September 22, 2001; Page A29 \n Last week's terrorist attacks brought out the worst in televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Three days after hijacked jetliners slammed into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center and the Pennsylvania countryside, Robertson posted a statement on his Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) Web site announcing that pornography, rampant secularism, the occult, abortion, the absence of prayer in schools and insults of God \"at the highest level of our government\" had sent the Almighty over the edge. America was attacked, Robertson asserted, \"because God Almighty is lifting His protection from us.\" . . .What, pray tell, does the Good Lord make of Pat Robertson's gold-mining venture in Liberia with Charles Taylor, international pariah and one of the most ruthless, greedy and terror-producing heads of state in all of sub-Saharan Africa? \n \n What? He didn't know? \n \n Well it probably slipped Robertson's mind, busy as he is in getting people to send in those checks, money orders and love offerings to support his cause. How the reverend found time to hook up with Taylor, I'll never know. \n \n But in May 1999, Robertson, through Freedom Gold Limited, an offshore company registered in the Cayman Islands but based at CBN headquarters in Virginia Beach, signed an agreement with Taylor and key cabinet members allowing the for-profit Freedom Gold to explore and receive mining rights in southeastern Liberia, where gold is believed to be in the ground. \n \n It's a great deal for Liberia, which is now an economic basket case thanks to the long civil war and Taylor's corruption. It's also good for Freedom Gold, which was formed by Robertson in 1998. Liberia -- and for all practical purposes we're talking Taylor -- gains 10 percent ownership of Freedom Gold. \n \n As The Post's Douglas Farah reported in January, huge amounts of the country's funds have been siphoned off by a small group of Taylor's associates and relatives. Taylor \"has his hand in everything and gets a cut of everything,\" a businessman told The Post. Other Liberians, probably Taylor's gang, are entitled to buy at least 15 percent of Freedom Gold's shares after the exploration period. . . .\n",

To spread the good news is not only to talk to people about it, which I do in appropriate situations when people are actually listening and I'm not going to push them further away from God; but also in actions, in campaigning for peace and justice, in helping those who are in need, my witness (I hope) is in my actions in the world, not in a legalistic repetition of aphorisms and quotes. That way is that of the pharisees, the living word, Jesus Christ, is not found in dead text, but in the world, in people.\n\n \n Please answer the question I posed for you earlier, Jo: Is Jesus Christ your Lord God and Savior for the remission of your sins?",

In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge: \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n I Corinthians 5:13: \"Are you not to judge those inside (the church)? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you.\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:4: \"Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church.\"\n \n (also note 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15).\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?\n \n \n Think about EZ you have turned soul's away from Christ in effect you are doing the Devil's work.\n\n \n I'll have more for you on this shortly.\n \n Get Christ before you perish, Big Bear!",

   "Hey that is MY story! And Easyrider will always be special to me because he helped me reach my decision.\n\n \n For you and Big Bear Scot:\n \n God's Little Troublemakers\n \n A few years back if you'd been watching any sports events on TV, you probably saw this one commercial for Lite beer. And there was this one guy - I think his name was Bob Eucker - who always liked to sit down in the stands and stir up trouble. He'd sit down between two guys who were drinking Lite beer and gently nudge one of them in the ribs and say something like, \"That guy sitting on the other side of me just said that Lite Beer is less filling.\" Well that would get the first guys attention and he'd say, \"Oh yeah?\" Then he'd turn to the other guy and tell him the first guy said that Lite beer tastes great. And that guy would then get up and look at the first guy and yell, \"Tastes great!\" And the other guy would yell back, \"Less filling!\" And the war would be on. Then the camera would pan back at Bob Eucker and he would just be sitting back there yucking it up at all the trouble he'd caused.\n \n Well, I'm here today to tell you that God has his own little troublemakers, and once you start to tell other people about Jesus Christ, you're likely to be labeled a troublemaker too. Be thinking about Bob Eucker here when you read the following passage from the Book of Acts:\n \n \"Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin (the members of the Jewish\n ruling council who were trying to sentence Paul to death) and\n said, \"My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good\n conscience to this day.\" At this, the high priest Ananias ordered\n those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. Then Paul \n said to Ananias, \"God will strike you - you white-washed wall!\n You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourselves\n violate the law by commanding that I be struck!\" Then Paul,\n knowing that some of them were Sadducees (who didn't believe\n in the resurrection and afterlife of man), and the others Pharisees,\n called out in the Sanhedrin, \"My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son\n of a Pharisee, and I stand on trial today because of my hope in the\n resurrection of the dead.\" When he had said this, a dispute broke\n out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was\n divided. And there was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of\n the law who spoke out who were Pharisees stood up and argued\n vigorously.....The dispute became so violent that the Roman\n commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them.\n He ordered the troops to go down and rescue him by force, and\n take him back to the barracks.\" The council was in an uproar.\n (Acts 23)\n \n Less filling! Tastes great! That's the kind of thing you sometimes run into when you're preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You know, an English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth once said, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the Apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n We are not called out to appease a lost and sinful society, but to give them the Word of God. You have to remember that, generally speaking, the world hated Jesus. He often made people feel uncomfortable. Like the prophets before him, He exposed sin and rebuked unrighteousness. He wouldn't compromise the word of God to make friends with the world. He was looked upon as a radical; he was accused of having demons, and he was rejected by his own people and nailed to the cross. Now we like to think that Jesus came into the world to bring peace and tranquility, and certainly those who receive him receive an inner peace and tranquility, but what was it that Jesus said in the Gospel of Luke?\n \n \"Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth? No, but\n division. From now on there will be five in one family divided\n against each other - three against two and two against three.\n They will be divided, father against son and son against father,\n mother against daughter, and mother-in law against daughter-\n in law.\" (Luke 12:51-53)\n \n It's a confrontation of good against evil, light against darkness; the doctrine of God versus the doctrine of man. What does the Gospel of John say?\n \n \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and \n the Word was God.....In him was life, and that life was the light of\n men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not\n understood it. He came to those which were his own, but his own\n did not receive him.\" (John 1)\n \n Why didn't the world receive him? Because he often preached a confrontational message. And what is a confrontational message? It's a message that preaches Jesus Christ, exposes sin, superficial faith, and lets people know that unless they have Christ as their savior they're lost. It's a message that in many ways is in conflict with worldly thinking. \n \n Now, how many times have we prayed for the Holy Spirit to bring conviction into the hearts of the people? You want to know something very fundamental? Unless the Holy Spirit brings people into conviction for the things they've done in their lives, they will have absolutely no reason to think that they need a savior. Without conviction there is no conversion, and without conversion the cross of Christ makes no sense at all. \n \n Why was John the Baptist beheaded? Was he a reed swayed by the breeze of political correctness? Was John one of those guys who wanted everyone to be his buddy? Was he someone who sought after his own well being and personal enhancement? John the Baptist spoke out strongly against the corrupt pharisees and leaders of his day. He went after King Herod and reminded him he was living in sin for taking his brother's wife and making her his own. He wasn't playing the world's game and looking out for his own welfare. He was preaching the word of God, trying to turn someone to repentance and salvation, and for that he was labeled a troublemaker and eventually put to death. Why was Paul persecuted? Why was James put to death with the sword? Why were the prophets and the apostles martyred? They preached the word of God and gospel of Jesus Christ. They were God's little troublemakers, so to speak.  At least that's the way the world looked at them.\n \n If anything has become apparent, it is that the world will try to twist and discredit, and ignore the word of God so that people can remain unconvicted of their sinful nature. They don't want to hear it. They don't want to give up those areas of their lives that are in conflict with the word of God. It's only natural for people to be this way, because the carnal nature is emnity towards God. People want to continue indulging in the passions and pleasures that they think are bringing them happiness, when the end result is that these same ungodly pleasures are often keeping them in bondage and misery. T. S. Elliott once said, \"Intemperate men can never be free, because their passions give rise to their bondage.\" The things that they think are pleasurable are the same things that are keeping them in captivity.\n \n You may remember God's little troublemaker, Stephen. You see him in Acts chapters six and seven. Stephen was \"a man full of God's grace and power, and he did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.\" But the Bible says that opposition arose against him. Why? Because his message was a threat to the religious establishment of his day - an establishment that rejected Jesus Christ and those who proclaimed his message. Here again was a man who would not compromise with the things of the world. He was wholly and totally committed to God. He was on fire for the Lord. And he was brought into the council of the Sanhedrin to account for his testimony. And I'll read to you what happened next: After a long littany of historic review, Stephen said to the members of the Sandhedrin,\n \n \"You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears!\n You always resist the Holy Spirit. Was there ever a prophet\n your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who\n predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you\n have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the\n law that was put into effect through angels, but have not\n obeyed it!' When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this\n they were furious, and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen,\n full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory\n of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 'Look,'\n he said, 'I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at\n the right hand of God.' At this they covered their ears, and \n yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed him....and\n they dragged him outside and stoned him to death.\" \n (Acts 7:51-58)\n \n They were furious! They gnashed their teeth and screamed at the top of their lungs. The council was in an uproar. One of God's little troublemakers had struck again! And looked at what happened when Stephen rebuked those obstinate people for their sins - the Glory of God appeared! Imagine if Stephen were standing here today and spoke out against the unregenerate, and said, \"You stiff-necked and rebellious people - you, who continue to resist the Holy Spirit and reject Christ. What hope can there possibly be for you? When are you going to get yourselves right with the Lord?\" How popular would that be? \n \n Even as I speak, the church of Jesus Christ in this country is at a crossroads. Over one hundred years ago, Catherine Booth said, \"It is a bad sign for the Christianity of this day when it provokes so little opposition from the world. When the Church and the world can jog along together side by side comfortably, you may be sure there is something wrong.\" Remember what Jesus said in John 15:18 - \"If the world hates you, remember that it hated Me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as it's own.  As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.\" \n \n For many years the church has taught salvation without self-denial; we have been shown the crown without the cross; and we've compromised the word of God in order to make friends with the world. In Matthew 16:26 Jesus asked His disciples, \"What does it profit a man if he gains the entire world, but loses his very soul?\" If you're truly a Christian, then Jesus promised that the world would hate you. So you're going to get it either way. Either the world's going to get you or God's going to get you, so you might as well make friends with God because He is your eternal security. \n \n \n And where is the fear of the Lord in this forum? Psalms 111:10 says, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Job says the same thing - \"The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding\" (Job 28:28). Men may fear their fellow man, but how often does the church fear the wrath of God? It was because of the fear of man that: Joseph of Arimathea was only a secret disciple of Christ, and came to Him by night. And it was because of the fear of man that Peter denied the Lord three times. It was also because of the fear of men that the disciples met together behind closed doors before they knew that Christ had risen! \n \n Fear gives rise to cowardly acts. Faith gives rise to boldness and declaring the Lord Jesus Christ to all who will listen, no matter what it costs them. I submit that the man who has the Lord as his rock and his fortress will never have man as his master. The man who trusts in the Lord will never fear his fellow man. In Matthew chapter 10 Jesus said, \"Don't be afraid of those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both body and soul in hell.\" In other words, don't be afraid of man, but fear God, and fear His mighty hand.\n \n We've been brow-beaten into believing that we should keep our faith to ourselves, and not speak out. The Lord says in Revelation 3:15 \"So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth.\" We don't need a watered down Gospel message that sends people to hell. \n \n I'll close with these words from C. H. Mackintosh, who once said, \"No Christian is in a right condition if he is not seeking, in some way, to bring souls to Christ.\" ",

   "For you and Big Bear Scot:\n \n God's Little Troublemakers\n \n A few years back if you'd been watching any sports events on TV, you probably saw this one commercial for Lite beer. And there was this one guy - I think his name was Bob Eucker - who always liked to sit down in the stands and stir up trouble. He'd sit down between two guys who were drinking Lite beer and gently nudge one of them in the ribs and say something like, \"That guy sitting on the other side of me just said that Lite Beer is less filling.\" Well that would get the first guys attention and he'd say, \"Oh yeah?\" Then he'd turn to the other guy and tell him the first guy said that Lite beer tastes great. And that guy would then get up and look at the first guy and yell, \"Tastes great!\" And the other guy would yell back, \"Less filling!\" And the war would be on. Then the camera would pan back at Bob Eucker and he would just be sitting back there yucking it up at all the trouble he'd caused.\n \n Well, I'm here today to tell you that God has his own little troublemakers, and once you start to tell other people about Jesus Christ, you're likely to be labeled a troublemaker too. Be thinking about Bob Eucker here when you read the following passage from the Book of Acts:\n \n \"Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin (the members of the Jewish\n ruling council who were trying to sentence Paul to death) and\n said, \"My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good\n conscience to this day.\" At this, the high priest Ananias ordered\n those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. Then Paul \n said to Ananias, \"God will strike you - you white-washed wall!\n You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourselves\n violate the law by commanding that I be struck!\" Then Paul,\n knowing that some of them were Sadducees (who didn't believe\n in the resurrection and afterlife of man), and the others Pharisees,\n called out in the Sanhedrin, \"My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son\n of a Pharisee, and I stand on trial today because of my hope in the\n resurrection of the dead.\" When he had said this, a dispute broke\n out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was\n divided. And there was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of\n the law who spoke out who were Pharisees stood up and argued\n vigorously.....The dispute became so violent that the Roman\n commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them.\n He ordered the troops to go down and rescue him by force, and\n take him back to the barracks.\" The council was in an uproar.\n (Acts 23)\n \n Less filling! Tastes great! That's the kind of thing you sometimes run into when you're preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You know, an English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth once said, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the Apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n We are not called out to appease a lost and sinful society, but to give them the Word of God. You have to remember that, generally speaking, the world hated Jesus. He often made people feel uncomfortable. Like the prophets before him, He exposed sin and rebuked unrighteousness. He wouldn't compromise the word of God to make friends with the world. He was looked upon as a radical; he was accused of having demons, and he was rejected by his own people and nailed to the cross. Now we like to think that Jesus came into the world to bring peace and tranquility, and certainly those who receive him receive an inner peace and tranquility, but what was it that Jesus said in the Gospel of Luke?\n \n \"Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth? No, but\n division. From now on there will be five in one family divided\n against each other - three against two and two against three.\n They will be divided, father against son and son against father,\n mother against daughter, and mother-in law against daughter-\n in law.\" (Luke 12:51-53)\n \n It's a confrontation of good against evil, light against darkness; the doctrine of God versus the doctrine of man. What does the Gospel of John say?\n \n \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and \n the Word was God.....In him was life, and that life was the light of\n men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not\n understood it. He came to those which were his own, but his own\n did not receive him.\" (John 1)\n \n Why didn't the world receive him? Because he often preached a confrontational message. And what is a confrontational message? It's a message that preaches Jesus Christ, exposes sin, superficial faith, and lets people know that unless they have Christ as their savior they're lost. It's a message that in many ways is in conflict with worldly thinking. \n \n Now, how many times have we prayed for the Holy Spirit to bring conviction into the hearts of the people? You want to know something very fundamental? Unless the Holy Spirit brings people into conviction for the things they've done in their lives, they will have absolutely no reason to think that they need a savior. Without conviction there is no conversion, and without conversion the cross of Christ makes no sense at all. \n \n Why was John the Baptist beheaded? Was he a reed swayed by the breeze of political correctness? Was John one of those guys who wanted everyone to be his buddy? Was he someone who sought after his own well being and personal enhancement? John the Baptist spoke out strongly against the corrupt pharisees and leaders of his day. He went after King Herod and reminded him he was living in sin for taking his brother's wife and making her his own. He wasn't playing the world's game and looking out for his own welfare. He was preaching the word of God, trying to turn someone to repentance and salvation, and for that he was labeled a troublemaker and eventually put to death. Why was Paul persecuted? Why was James put to death with the sword? Why were the prophets and the apostles martyred? They preached the word of God and gospel of Jesus Christ. They were God's little troublemakers, so to speak.  At least that's the way the world looked at them.\n \n If anything has become apparent, it is that the world will try to twist and discredit, and ignore the word of God so that people can remain unconvicted of their sinful nature. They don't want to hear it. They don't want to give up those areas of their lives that are in conflict with the word of God. It's only natural for people to be this way, because the carnal nature is emnity towards God. People want to continue indulging in the passions and pleasures that they think are bringing them happiness, when the end result is that these same ungodly pleasures are often keeping them in bondage and misery. T. S. Elliott once said, \"Intemperate men can never be free, because their passions give rise to their bondage.\" The things that they think are pleasurable are the same things that are keeping them in captivity.\n \n You may remember God's little troublemaker, Stephen. You see him in Acts chapters six and seven. Stephen was \"a man full of God's grace and power, and he did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.\" But the Bible says that opposition arose against him. Why? Because his message was a threat to the religious establishment of his day - an establishment that rejected Jesus Christ and those who proclaimed his message. Here again was a man who would not compromise with the things of the world. He was wholly and totally committed to God. He was on fire for the Lord. And he was brought into the council of the Sanhedrin to account for his testimony. And I'll read to you what happened next: After a long littany of historic review, Stephen said to the members of the Sandhedrin,\n \n \"You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears!\n You always resist the Holy Spirit. Was there ever a prophet\n your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who\n predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you\n have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the\n law that was put into effect through angels, but have not\n obeyed it!' When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this\n they were furious, and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen,\n full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory\n of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 'Look,'\n he said, 'I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at\n the right hand of God.' At this they covered their ears, and \n yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed him....and\n they dragged him outside and stoned him to death.\" \n (Acts 7:51-58)\n \n They were furious! They gnashed their teeth and screamed at the top of their lungs. The council was in an uproar. One of God's little troublemakers had struck again! And looked at what happened when Stephen rebuked those obstinate people for their sins - the Glory of God appeared! Imagine if Stephen were standing here today and spoke out against the unregenerate, and said, \"You stiff-necked and rebellious people - you, who continue to resist the Holy Spirit and reject Christ. What hope can there possibly be for you? When are you going to get yourselves right with the Lord?\" How popular would that be? \n \n Even as I speak, the church of Jesus Christ in this country is at a crossroads. Over one hundred years ago, Catherine Booth said, \"It is a bad sign for the Christianity of this day when it provokes so little opposition from the world.

So you're going to get it either way. Either the world's going to get you or God's going to get you, so you might as well make friends with God because He is your eternal security. \n \n \n And where is the fear of the Lord in this forum? Psalms 111:10 says, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Job says the same thing - \"The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding\" (Job 28:28).

   "If you can't dazzel them with facts, ... Baffle them with bull !\n\n \n Bull yourself! \n \n Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n 2\"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 4\"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 5\"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n 8\"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11\"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13\"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' \n 14\"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only: Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. \n \n There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\" Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14",

   "DamEtel: 1) the one in Matthew (13:28-30) where Jesus talks about God's inability to weed out the evil ones from amongst the good ones while they are still alive, and so the weeding out has to wait until harvest time. \n \n\n \n \n \nEasyRider: It doesn't say God is unable to weed out the evil ones earlier, rather it's his choice.\n\n \n Nope, sorry, the Bible doesn't say that it's a choice. The most straightforward reading of the reason Jesus gives is that doing so while they are still alive might cause some of the good ones to be mistakenly weeded out.\n \n \nJesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.\n \n \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'\n \n \"'An enemy did this,' he replied.\n \n \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'\n \n \"'No', he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into the barn.'\"\n (Matthew 13:24-30)\n \n",

   "http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A30274-2005Mar12\n \n Casino Bid Prompted High-Stakes Lobbying\n Probe Scrutinizes Efforts Against Tribe\n By Susan Schmidt\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Sunday, March 13, 2005; Page A01 \n When a ragtag band of Louisiana Indians won their governor's support for a casino three years ago, they never could have fathomed the powerful cast of characters who would collaborate to flatten them. \n \n Jack Abramoff, one of Washington's most prominent Republican lobbyists, tapped into the gambling riches of a rival tribe to orchestrate a far-reaching campaign against the Jena Band of Choctaws -- calling on senior U.S. senators and congressmen, the deputy secretary of the interior and evangelical leaders James Dobson and Ralph Reed. \n \n The story of what Abramoff did for the Louisiana Coushatta tribe provides the most complete picture yet of the role of the lobbyist at the center of a widening federal corruption investigation in Washington. It was reconstructed through interviews with tribal leaders, government officials and former business associates, as well as through Interior Department and other documents and e-mails obtained by The Washington Post. \n \n Abramoff arranged for Dobson and Reed to pressure federal officials to reject the Jenas' bid on anti-gambling grounds. He and his partners drafted anti-Jena letters that were then signed by congressional leaders, some of whom have received thousands of dollars in donations from tribes represented by Abramoff. One ally inserted language opposing the casino into a bill late in the legislative process. . . .Meanwhile, Abramoff opened a second front to bring outside pressure on Interior against the Jenas. \n \n He looked to Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader who operated several consulting companies. Reed has acknowledged receiving as much as $4 million from Abramoff and his associate, Scanlon, to organize grass-roots anti-gambling campaigns in Louisiana and Texas. The money came from casino-rich Indian tribes, including the Coushattas, but Reed said that although he knew of Abramoff's connection to the tribes, he did not know until media accounts surfaced last summer that his fees came from gambling proceeds. \n \n Reed then turned to Dobson to marshal his vast network of evangelicals, Abramoff's e-mails show. \n \n Abramoff wrote to Scanlon in a Feb. 20, 2002, e-mail that Dobson would make radio ads against gambling. Reed \"may finally have scored for us! Dobson goes up on the radio on this next week!\" He suggested giving Reed $60,000 for the ads to run in Louisiana and Texas. \"We'll then play it in the WH [White House] and Interior,\" he told Scanlon. \n \n The prospect that Dobson would become involved had an immediate impact at Interior. His regular radio show had a huge audience, and his Colorado-based Focus on the Family actively campaigned against gambling as a social evil. \n \n One of Dobson's top aides, Tom Minnery, wrote to Norton saying Louisiana \"already has an alarming number of gaming establishments\" -- a letter he copied to White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. The Interior Department's White House liaison, Doug Domenech, sounded the alarm. \n \n \"Doug came to me and said, 'Dobson's going to shut down our phone system. He's going to go on the air and tell everyone who listens to Focus on the Family to call Interior to oppose the Jena compact,' \" said a former senior Interior official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. . . .",

   "So, EZ, you think threatening people with eternal damnation is the way to show them God's love? How effective is that strategy? How is it not a betrayal of Christ's teaching?\n\n \n I present to them the same options that Jesus did, Jo. Certainly I prefer if they came to Christ based on his love and salvation, but good preachers don't ignore the other end of the spectrum like it appears you conveniently do in your discussions. And what did Jesus say along these lines? \n \n \"If you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\"\n \n In Luke 16, Jesus Christ gives a frightening picture of hell: \n \n 22 . . . the rich man also died, and was buried; \n 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. \n 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. \n 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\n 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. \n 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:\n 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. (Luke 16:22-28)\n \n In Matthew 13:42, Jesus says: \"And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says: \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting FIRE,. . .\"\n Jesus Christ says in Mark 9:43-47, \n \n 43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n 45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n 47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:\n \n WHAT JESUS CHRIST SAYS ABOUT HELL! \"fire\" Matt 7:19, 13:40, 25:41 \"everlasting fire\" Matt 18:8, 25:41 \"eternal damnation\" Mark 3:29 \"hell fire\" Matt 5:22, 18:9, Mark 9:47 \"damnation\" Matt 23:14, Mark 12:40, Luke 20:47 \"damnation of hell\" Matt 23:33 \"resurrection of damnation\" John 5:29 \"furnace of fire\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"the fire that never shall be quenched\" Mark 9:43, 45 \"the fire is not quenched\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"Where their worm dieth not\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 8:12, 22:13, 25:30 \"torments\" Luke 16:23 \"tormented in this flame\" Luke 16:24 \"place of torment\" Luke 16:28 \"outer darkness\" Matt 8:12, 22:13 \"everlasting punishment\" Matt 25:46\n \n Jesus Christ gave a solemn warning in Matthew 7:21-23\n \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. . . MANY will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" \n \n Jesus also said, \"Do not fear those who can kill the body, but fear Him who can kill the body and soul in hell.\"\n \n Are these passages in your Bible, Jo? If so, why in the name of God don't you want to warn people like Jesus did? Have you created your own feel-good theology apart from Christ? I'd really like to know.",

We are not facing the same situation today, we trust by faith that Christ is our Lord and saviour, and it is foolish to pretend that people today who do not believe are rejecting an obvious truth, as the pharisees did then. What we know is that belief is sufficient for salvation (John 3:16), once someone believes then the threat of hell is irrelevant, as it does not apply to them; but if they do not believe then the threat of hell has no meaning, except to chase them away from ever wanting to try and meet God, because the picture you have painted is not one that reflects God.

You're conveniently ignoring them. If Jesus thought it important enough to warn people about these issues, why do you seek to minimalize them?\n \n \nThree things shall outlast all others: faith, hope and love, and the greatest of these is love. \n\n \n You need to look at that in context with everything else in the New Testament. According to that alone, Hitler and people like him get a free pass. And even James said the demons believe - and shudder (James 2:19). \n \n I'm afraid yours is thus a \"feel-good,\" pick-and-choose theology that presents a watered-down Gospel message which runs the risk of sending people to hell by not warning them of the eternal consequences of non-repentance and rejecting Christ.",
