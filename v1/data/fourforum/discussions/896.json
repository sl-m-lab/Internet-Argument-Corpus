   "I think it's about time to invade Alabama. That state has been getting on my nerves for some time now.\n \n Personally, I see nothing wrong with the Ten Commandments monument. Presumably, the Chief Justice wasn't referring to the tablets when writing his court opinions, in which case the monument is nothing more than a piece of decoration. It has a message, but it's a harmless one.\n \n Now.. as for directly disobeying an outranking federal court's order, that's a bit of a different issue. As much as I think it was a bad move by the federal court, it's not like the Chief Justice is being given a set of options. I don't mind if he orders someone else to do it, but it'd be a dangerous precedent to ignore a court order.",

Besides, God didn't give rights to the state. He gave them to the people. So, let the people acknowledge God. Second, the dec. of independence doesn't supercede the constitution, it is subservient to it. The dec. of ind. declares why the colonies would seperate from Britain. The constitution declares under what type of govt. we live in. Very different purposes and effect.\n \n \nJudge Myron Thompson in essance said that this is not a case about a Ten Commandments Monument, but can the State acknowledge God. To this he said that the Establishment Clause says no. Do you agree that the State can't acknowledge God?\n \n \n First of all, I agree, no the state can't. That is favoring religion over irreligion, which the state can't do. The establishment clause does apply to the states, see Wallace v. Jaffree, and prevents them from \"establishing\" a state religion, or for that matter, a religious doctrine (theism over atheism or polytheism). The state cannot \"lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma\" (Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith, citing Presbyterian Church v. Hull Church). In this case, the Alabama Supreme Court, an agent of the state Alabama, is using its authority to support a specific religious dogma, namely, theism.\n \n \nThe First Amendment states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion\". I have to ask you, what law did the Chief Justice make? What religion did he establish by law?\n \n The establishment clause has been significantly expanded beyond mere literal \"laws.\" Surely, if President Bush announced an executive order declaring the US a \"Hindu Nation,\" the 1st amendment would still be breached, despite that this is not a \"law\" per se. The courts have interpreted the 1st amendment to apply to state ACTION, and in this case C.J. Moore is acting as an agent of the state of Alabama in affirming theism over atheism, and according to him, specifically affirming judeo-christian theism over any other forms.\n \n The idea that the state cannot endorse theism may seem odd. But as UC-Davis Law Professor Tobias Wolff warns us, \"think of the implications of that statement. Could a government office post a sign that says 'this is a God fearing office'? Could every welfare check come with a note that says 'this assistance comes by the grace of God'?\" This would seem to cross far beyond the line the Supreme Court has drawn for church-state issues.\n \n Personally, I can affirm that I believe in God without the state's help. I'm sure Judge Moore can as well. If his faith is so tenuous that it can't survive without a 2 1/2 ton state endorsement, then there is little we can do to help him, I fear.",

   "Then where, may I ask, do we get our laws from? What is the source?\n\n We get our laws from the legislatures and other government with the power to make laws. About the only two commandments tht could be claimed to have anything to do with our laws are about killing and stealing. Since you probably do things like shop, go to movies and entertain yourself in various other lawful ways on Saturday, I don't think that the prohibition against activity on the Sabboth made it to law. I can have graven images or worship trees if I want and I won't be breaking any laws. In fact, the Constitution gives me the right to do so without government interference. And I can covet too. And there are some who have abandoned their parents to wellfare, which isn't my idea of honor. It just shows so little thought to claim that your religion is the basis of our law.\n \nThe Declaration, which is the \"genesis\" of our Constitution, says that we are \"endowed by [our] Creator with certain unalieanable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuite of happiness.\"\n\n The Declaration isn't the \"genesis\" of the Constitution. The United States was first governed by the Articles of Confederation, passed in 1777 and ratified in 1781. In 1787 a convention was held to amend the unworkable Articles of Confederation. Instead, the convention wrote the Constitution. The began on May 25, 1787 and submitted it to the 13 States for ratification on Sep 28. The ninth state ratified it in June of 1788. The new government began operation under the Constitution on March 4, 1789.\n \n Moreover, the Declaration isn't a statement of government but a list of grievences to justify the rebellion. As it says in the Declaration, \"...a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\" The document was written out of respect for the opinions of mankind, not God.\n \n But I am puzzled by the connection you seem to make between laws of ancient Hebrews and a phrase that expresses the essence of humanism. Perhaps a little more of the context might help.\n \n \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n \n Notice that the truths are not revealed, not taken from the Bible, but are self evident. And christianity hasn't historically respected all men as being equal. And certainly christians have always been more than willing, eager in fact, to take those unalienable rights of life and liberty from anyone who disagreed with them. Of course, Thomas Jefferson and many of the founding fathers were deists, so the Creator isn't the Christian God. That phrase, with a bit of an edit, came from John Locke (friend of Newton), the humanist philosopher who stated it as \"life, liberty and property.\" But there isn't any connection to the 10 commandments, the Constitution or to our laws.\n \nThe entire Justice system of Alabama was set up \"invoking the favor and guidance of ALmighty God\".\n\n No it wasn't. The original Constitution of Alabama mentioned God twice. Once was in the prescribed oath to be taken by state officers. The other was in section 3 of the Declaration of Rights.\n \n \"No person within this state shall, upon, any pretence, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in the manner most agreeable to his own conscience; nor be compelled to attend any place of worship, nor shall any one ever be obliged to pay any tythes, taxes, or other rate, for the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry.\"\n \n The phrase you quote was from the Constitution of 1861 that operated when while Alabama was a Confederate state. That phrase was retained in the Constitutions of 1865 and 1868, the wording was changed in the 1871 Constitution but the current Constitution, that of 1901, like the U.S. Constitution doesn't contain the word \"God.\"\n \nJudge Myron Thompson in essance said that this is not a case about a Ten Commandments Monument, but can the State acknowledge God. To this he said that the Establishment Clause says no. Do you agree that the State can't acknowledge God?\n\n Yes. That is not a function of government. The problem is that the monument clearly favores one of religion. The state may not take a position wherein it either approves or disapproves of a religion or just religion in general. You don't have a problem with it because it approves of your religion. However, if this were a monument to Allah I'll bet we would hear from you about the violation of your rights.\n \nThe First Amendment states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion\". I have to ask you, what law did the Chief Justice make? What religion did he establish by law?\n\n Again, you leave off context. Let's add it back, shall we?\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n \n By the way, the 1st Amendment has been incorporated against the states under the 14th amendment. That is the equal protection under the law amendment. Essentially what Moore is doing is using his position as a state official to impose his religion on anyone who enters the Alabama Supreme Court Building. That is unconstitutional - so says a U.S. District Court Judge and so say the other 8 Justices of the Alabama Supreme Court. Many of the lawyers who must enter the building as a function of their jobs have complained. They have no choice in the matter and are therefore subjected to the imposition of Moore's religion by the state.\n \n Besides, it is a foolish claim that our laws are based on the 10 Commandments.",

   "Putting the ten commandments in a building does not respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise of religion.\n \n \n In of itself, no it doesn't. The Supreme Court decor is an excellent example in point. It has the 10 commandments (and the greek goddess) as part of an overall picture of where I laws came from (of which the 10 commandments are undeniably an influence).\n \n In this case, like in all others, context is everything. The 10 commandments is not part of any overriding, secular/historical \"theme.\" It's purpose is clearly not a historical educational. As the court found (and note it expressly reserved judgment on whether the 10 commandments in any case would be unconstitutional), this particular method of showing the commandments was clearly meant to cast them in a holy, spirtual light. Employees found the monument to be a like a shrine, an appropriate, even compelling, place to pray. Regardless of whether the 10 commandments in any case are unconstitutional (as a public monument), in THIS case it is clearly crossing the line.\n \nWell, I may not be a good debater like yall, but I do have my opinion on this subject. I believe that the judge should be aloud to have the ten commandments in the court room. Why take it out...is it hurting anybody? I dont think so. Its his right to put those ten commandments in that court room. I know what yall are gonna say, seperation of church and state. Thats not even in the constitution. That was first heard in a letter from President Jefferson to a pope because the pope was scared that they would make a national religion and hes saying he cant because there is a seperation of church and state. He wasnt saying that the church cant do anything to the state (or government) he was saying that the government cant do anything to the church. PLUS, seperation of church and state is not even in the constitution.\n\n It is \"hurting\" people who aren't judeo-christians, or don't believe that religion is an area where the government should claim expertise. harms don't have to be tangible to exist or be claimed, requiring me to pray to jesus (I'm jewish) is not a tangible harm, but it is still present and very, very real.\n Now as for sep. of church and state. The letter you refer to (To the Danbury Baptists, NOT the Pope :) ), does provide the historical basis, this is true. But the 1st amendment protections have drastically been expanded since then. If Mr. Jefferson felt seperation between church and state is the best way to enforce the 1st amendments establishment clause, I am hardpressed to see why we should not defer to his judgment. The courts seem to agree. You claim that the 1st amendment only protects religion from government intrusion, not vice versa. First I (and the supreme court for that matter) don't buy it, second, it is government interference with church affairs in that it is taking religion from its normal purveyors (the church), and making it into a state issue. They are intruding on the church's turf here. Third and finally, this action is downright dangerous to the church, albeit indirectly. As Justice Hugo Black wrote in Engel v. Vitale \"A union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion. The establishment clause thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the founders that religion is too personal, too sacred, too holy, to permit its 'unhallowed perversion' by a civil magistrate.\" Religion is something that is fundamentally personal, and so it should remain. By adding government to the mix, we run the risk of commoditizing religion, stripping it of what makes it holy, and destroying the very essence of its appeal.",

I dont think so.\n\n This is not a matter of a little display in the Judge's courtroom, although that might also be considered unconstitutional. This is a huge, 5,000 lb granite monstrosity in the rotunda of the supreme court building.\n \n Isn't it funny how fundamentalist christians are so willing to impose their religion on everyone because they think it isn't hurting anyone? I'll as you the same question that I asked Jim. What if the plaque said, \"Allah is the greatest. There is no God but Allah?\" That's not hurting anyone either. What if Judge Moore had put that monument in the rotunda?

He is violating the rights of other citizens of Alabama, even those who don't object.\n \nI know what yall are gonna say, seperation of church and state. Thats not even in the constitution.\n\n But that is the intent of the First Amendment. The phrase actually comes from Thomas Jefferson who responded to the Danbury Baptists when they expressed concern about government interference in their right to worship as they saw fit. Jefferson declared that the 1st Amendment established a \"wall of separation between church and state.\"\n \n You have to remember, if the state has the authority to support your religion, it also has the authority to supress your religion and to dictate how you will worship.\n \nThat was first heard in a letter from President Jefferson to a pope because the pope was scared that they would make a national religion and hes saying he cant because there is a seperation of church and state. He wasnt saying that the church cant do anything to the state (or government) he was saying that the government cant do anything to the church. PLUS, seperation of church and state is not even in the constitution.\n\n You are just so informed. It was a pope? Well I wrote the above about the Danbury Baptists before I read your comments that followed. How could I have been so wrong?\n \n If you would actually learn what you are talking about, you might read what Jefferson wrote about the topic and what others, like James Madison (the father of the Constitution) wrote. You might actually begin to grasp the intent of the framers of the Constitution by doing so. Jefferson called it a \"wall of separation\", not a semi-permeable membrane of separation.\n \n But in spite of your faulty knowledge of the topic, you don't even realize that you are presenting arguments against Judge Moore. Judge Moore represents the government and it is he who is establishing a state religion. He is imposing his religion on others against their will.\n \n Are you interested in actually reading some material on the 1st Amendment? Are you interested in the constitutional principles?\n \n I'm curious. Where did you ever get the idea that \"a pope\" was interested in the political events in the Unites States in 1802?",

   "He is not imposing his religion upon anyone else.\n\n That question is moot. It has already been decided by a Justice of the U.S. District court that he is. The other eight justices of the Alabama Supreme Court say he is. Moore used his position as Chief Justice (now suspended and under investigation for ethics violations) to cause a symbol of his religion to be placed in a public building. Not just a public place, mind you, but in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building. Moore has placed the state of Alabama in the position of approving a single, minority religion. The government may not approve or disapprove of a particular religion or religion in general.\n \nIf people are offended by it, then they shouldn't look at it. (That's what I've been told about other things.)\n\n That seems to be a tenet of fundamentalist christianity. I've heard that opinion a lot. My bet is that when you heard it it wasn't a matter of someone violating your rights but rather it was a matter of them exercising theirs. And of course, christians are reluctant to actually grant others equal rights. Always has been that way.\n \nThe first amendment states \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....\" I agree that the fourteenth amendment extended this to the states.\n\n Doesn't matter if you agree or not. Just like it doesn't matter whether you agree that Moore is imposing his religion on others. It is another moot question. The Supreme Court of the United States has said that the 14th Amendment extends the prohibitions of the 1st Amentment to the states and their divisions.\n \n By the way, the SCOTUS denied Moore's request for a stay while they consider whether or not to consider his appeal. This is probably a pretty good indication that the SCOTUS will deny cert in the case and let the decision of the Federal District Court judge stand, especially since the other 8 justices of the Alabama Supreme Court also agree with the Federal judge.\n \nJudge Moore did not make any law respecting or prohibiting any religion.\n\n That has already been explained to you. And yet you harp on another moot question. Moore's actions as an official of the state make it appear that the State of Alabama approves of his religion. The Supreme Court has said the even the appearance of such approval is enough to make the action unconstitutional.\n \nIf I were in a predominantly Muslim country and I saw a granite monument with that on it, I would not be offended becuase that is the predominant religion of the country.\n\n Judge Moore's religion is not the predominant religion of this country. He is a member of a minority religion. But it is clear that you would be offended if Moore had put up the plaque I described. I didn't ask about predominant religions or other countries. Do you feel that if a government official in your town placed a plaque that said, \"Allah is the greatest. There is no God but Allah\" in your town hall, would you object? Would you think that your freedom of religion was being violated? Obviously, your efforts to duck the question make the answer apparent.\n \nThe government works on behalf of the people. I will say the same thing that I said with the Confederate Flag in South Carolina: If the people want this monument, and it is not illegal, then they should have the right to display it.\n\n It is illegal. It has been declared illegal by a U.S. District Court and the other 8 justices of the Alabama Supreme Court. What does it take to for you to get the point? By the way, the 1st Amendment was included just to prevent what you advocate. In practice the 1st Amendment means that the majority may not use the power of the state to impose any religion on the minority. The people of Alabama can put the thing any where that they want as long as it is not on government land. The issue is not related to the flag issue in South Carolina. That was not an issue of government approval of religion or the imposition of religion on others by the state.\n \nWho says it has to be current? The constitution doesn't.\n\n Well, that's true but I was making the point that the statue isn't a religious symbol. It is one of mythology. The gods of Olympus aren't worshiped any more. Of course, if you wish to argue that the 10 Commandments monument is merely a symbol of an ancient mythology, you might have a point. But I don't think it will fly.",

Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n 19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n 20 But the firstling of an XXX thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n 21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n 23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.\n 24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\n 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.\n 26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\n 27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.\n 28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water.

Exodus 34:28  does specifically mention Ten commandments. Deuteronomy 4:13  and Deuteronomy 10:4 also mention Ten commandments (actually \"10 words\" in the original).

   "dsadevil,\n \n You are too kind in your response to ringworm. You didn't even quote his shallow comments. I will correct that for you and respond to specific remarks.\n \nI think that dsadevil protests too much.\n\n I am amazed. Does there exist a creationist who has actually read Shakespeare? It boggles the mind.\n \nRepeat, the posting of the Ten Commandments does in no way establish a state religion.\n\n That question is moot. A U.S. District Court Judge has said that it does exactly that. All eight justices of the Alabama Supreme Court have agreed. The Supreme Court of the Unites States refused to grant a stay on appeal. This is a sign that the SCOTUS will deny cert and refuse to hear the case. That being the case, the decision of the District Court stands. Judge Moore's actions violate the 1st and 14th Amendments in his attempt to establish a state religion.\n \nYou do not even have to look at it.\n\n Irrelevant. The Constitution does not place the obligation on me to ignore the efforts of the state to impose a particular religion. The obligation is upon my government to avoid approval of a particular religion (in this case, fundamentalist christianity) or any religion. By the same token the government is prohibited from expressing disapproval of religion.\n \nThere is no punishment if you chose not live by them.\n\n That's not what most fundy christians have told me. Moreover, \"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me\" seems a bit strange to me. I have never been to Egypt nor have I been a slave. What does this mean to me?\n \nI would suspect that you are also anti-smoking, anti-gun, and anti-anything that someone does that you do not agree with.\n\n I don't know about dsadevil, but I smoked for 37 years. My father and mother smoked and both of my brothers smoked. Only my mother still smokes, and nobody's about to tell an 85 year old to quit.\n \n If you set a foot in my house uninvited, I'll put a bullet between your eyes. I have no problem with shooting those who threaten me. I've done it before. How does any of that relate to the topic of this discussion?\n \nTry to shorten your comments. You use a lot words to say nothing.\n\n On the other hand, you use few words and reveal your utter ignorance and stupidity. How sad.",

   "Do you mean with the above statements that there is only one reference that the commandments given to Moses were numbered ten? Or do you mean that there has never been a Biblical reference to \"ten\" numbered commandments? Is your claim that Exodus 34 lists some commands that have subsequently been numbered by Jews or Christians but that they were not numbered in the Bible itself? Or do you mean that there is no reference in the Bible of the 10 commandments outside of the single reference in Exodus 34? \n \n Either claim is erroneous. Exodus 34:28 does specifically mention Ten commandments. Deuteronomy 4:13 and Deuteronomy 10:4 also mention Ten commandments (actually \"10 words\" in the original). Deuteronomy 5:6-22 restates the commandments of Exodus 34 and their preeminence in standing to the other 612 commands in the Old Testament are referenced in other places of scripture.\n\n The first two you gave me are just mention of the ten commandments. They are not listed. I presume that they are references to the place where the ten commandments are named and listed. The third reference in Deuteronomy 5 is a listing that is similar to Exodus 34 in a couple of the items but is clearly not the same. Exodus 34 is the story of the tablets and Moses on the mountain and is specifically called in the Bible the \"ten commandments.\" And yet, it is Deuteronomy that is reproduced by most christians as the \"ten commandments.\" So which is correct. Exodus 34 lists some commandments and specifically calls them the \"ten commandments\" and says that they were carved on two tablets of stone by God. Deut 5 lists some commandments and only says that they were carved on tablets of stone. I guess by the time Deut 5 was listed the author had decided to edit the commandments given by God or God listed 20 commandments on 4 stone tablets and everyone chooses to ignore one set.\n \nYes, they were written by God on stone tablets according to the Bible. That's why you find so many Christians claiming it. See Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 5:22. (Exodus 34 states that both God and Moses wrote the tablets).\n\n None of them ever mentions the prohibition against seething a kid in its mother's milk or the requirement to present oneself to God \"thrice\" in a year, or the observance of the feast of unleavened bread.\n \nI wonder if what is written on the monstrosity is more similar to the 10 commandments stated in Deuteronomy??\n\n Exactly my point. They are 10 commandments but not \"THE ten commandments. Those are listed in Exodus 34. That's what the Bible says.\n \nWhat is English common law based on?\n\n It goes back to the Anglosaxons.\n \nI wonder if Sunday laws prohibiting selling of certain goods and closing bars at a certain time was related to keeping holy the Sabbath as held by Christians on the day of the Lord? I also wonder if perjury could relate to the commandment on lying? What about I swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I also seem to remember some state prohibitions against adultery but I may be incorrect on that. Just thinking out loud on these last few sentences.\n\n Let me repeat so that you don't miss what I actually said. \"...only two are even enacted into law everywhere,...\" Blue laws are an example of religious zealots using the state to impose their religion. The Sabbath is Saturday, by the way. Technically it is Friday sundown to Saturday sundown. Perjury is a matter of legal proceeding. You can tell since punishment comes from the state and not God. It is necessary for the orderly conduct of the courts. I've never lived in a state where adultery was prohibited when I lived there. Of course, the Puritans imposed their religion by law on everyone who lived in Massachusetts Bay Colony for a time. I'm sure that it was the example of the early christian settlers and their religious intolerance that inspired the founding fathers to found a government not based on any religion.",

   "=lurch]Take a deep breath and calm down. All of your shrill screaming makes you look a bit irrational. It is irrelevant what Exodus 20 sounds like to you. The Bible doesn't use the words \"ten commandments\" in reference to Exodus 20. The only place that is referred to as the ten commandments in the Bible is Exodus 34.\n \n \n And the ones you put was the ten commandements? If you look at the top of the book( Exodus: 20) by the page number, perhaps next page- it will say The Ten commandments(KJV)\n \n Moses broke the FIRST commandments- Exodus 34 is virtually the same commandments as Exodus 20 (Whats the BIG diffrence?) with a couple extra ones, more detailed, likwise, is guidance being given to Moses on how to handle the Jews and how they should observe God\n \n Read Exodus- all of it \n \n \n \nThe \"commandments\" on the monstrosity are not from Exodus 34.\n \n \n Where are they from? And whatever do these evil words say? Words so wicked even Satan's shaking?\n \n \nAre you having a bit of cognitive dissonence? That doesn't make sense in the constext of my comment.\n \n \n O.K.\n \n \nTake another deep breath. Perhaps a glass of warm milk would help you control all of this shrill screaming. That 5,000 lb. chunck of rock in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court is a monstrosity.\n \n \n Is it the words that irritate ?Is Alabama like Salem?\n \n \nI'll give you a clue. Hitler was a christian. In fact, christians have never been reluctant to kill in spite of the commandment.\n \n \n A Roman Catholic?(The Headquaters of Satan)... Hilter did all that killing because he thought he was going to purgatory\n \n \nExactly. They are 10 religious prohibitions. None of them are actually Alabama law. So finally you are grasping the point?\n \n \n Are the people bursting into flames as they read them?\n \n \nNow you are being stupid. Only a fool or a maniac would claim a right to steal. By the way, I misspoke. Even those two \"commandments\" aren't part of law. The laws are a bit more precise and meaningful. The point is \n that almost every society has \"laws\" similar to those commandments. There is nothing mystical, magical, or god given about them.\n \n \n So not stealing/killing is a bad or good prohibtion?I'm confused by you? Anyways How can you get more meaningful than Don't steal accept adding the consequences thereof.\n \n \nI'm sorry. I thought you were a chistian.\n \n \n What makes you think I'm not?\n \n \n \nMy mistake. The point is that Judge Moore doesn't have the right to impose icons of his religion on the citizens of Alabama.\n \n \n Are the citizens forced to read or abide by it? Does he go outside the law when people come in his coutroom? People just need something to fuss about.(Frivelous) \n \n \n If you really believe state and church can be divided you are niaeve.

   "Traditionally is was the christians in this country who opposed the ratification of the Constitution and the ratification of the Bill of rights. For example, Patrick Henry in Virginia. Henry was ever the political opponent of Jefferson and Madison. It was after Madison lead the opposition to Henry's bill that would impose a tax on all citizens to \"...pay teachers of the Christian religion.\" Madison's famous essay, \"Memorial and Remonstrance\" was written in opposition the Henry's bill. It was of course, defeated. Capitalizing on the spirit of the Assembly, Madison reintroduced the The Virginia Act For Establishing Religious Freedom originally written by Thomas Jefferson. This time the bill passed against the opposition of Patrick Henry.\n \n So it doesn't surprise me that fundamentalist christians argue against the religious freedom. It is a tradition in this country. They have always tried to impose their religion on others by force of law, and then they claim that others don't have to look, or don't have to participate.\n \n But in spite of the attack on the religious freedoms clauses of the 1st Amentment by christians, the courts have consistently upheld the Constitution. This case is clearly unconstitutional because it give the appearance that the government endorses or supports religion. This monument violates all three prongs of the oft used Lemon test: 1) it has no secular legislative purpose, 2) the effect is to advance religion, 3) it has excessively entangled the state with religion.\n \n Moreover, this monument is not a long standing tradition, nor is it's reference to God incidental. It is a display with a religious theme on state property without any other surrounding context that is primarily secualr.\n \n Judge Moore should know better.\n \nAre the citizens forced to read or abide by it?\n\n How is that relevant. The constitution is violated by the fact that the monument gives the appearance that the state of Alabama endorces a particular religion. I know.

   "Lurch,\n \n \nExactly my point. They are 10 commandments but not \"THE ten commandments. Those are listed in Exodus 34. That's what the Bible says.\n\n \n When reading about THE commandments in Deuteronomy and Exodus it is clear that there was one set of ten commandments that were primary. The description of how the commandments were handed down in Deuteronomy after the listing of the commandments is sufficient to link it to the passage in Exodus. But notice that the commandments in Deuteronomy are the same as those listed in Exodus 20. These were the original commandments until the tablets were broken. Also notice what is written in Exodus 34  \"The Lord said to Moses, 'Cut two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which you broke.\" The Lord would write the same commandments as on the first tablets. So if the commandments in Exodus 34  are the 10 commandments (as stated in 34:28) then so too are those in Exodus 20  and Deuteronomy. So how does one explain the contrast of Exodus 34  and Exodus 20/Deuteronomy? It could be that Exodus 34  is a more elaborate (or more abbreviated) description of the Covenant that was re-instituted than was originally described in Exodus 20. I'm not sure. \n \n I suppose that you were addressing fundamentalists. In Catholic teaching, one is not restricted to the Bible as the sole proof or rule of authority as is a fundamentalist. So the variance between the passages and the acceptance of the commandments in Exodus 20  and Deuteronomy as the Ten Commandments does not pose a problem. Proper Tradition is as important as legitimate scripture. Let me illustrate: \n \n It is probable that when one spoke of \"the commandments\" in Jewish culture in Old Testament times it would be like telling school children in America to say \"the pledge.\" No one would ask \"What commandments??\" because they would know by oral teaching and other aspects of life in addition to scriptural teaching. Just as the school children know that the pledge they were asked to say would be The Pledge of Allegiance.\n \n \nLet me repeat so that you don't miss what I actually said. \"...only two are even enacted into law everywhere,...\" Blue laws are an example of religious zealots using the state to impose their religion. The Sabbath is Saturday, by the way. Technically it is Friday sundown to Saturday sundown. Perjury is a matter of legal proceeding. You can tell since punishment comes from the state and not God.

Of course, the Puritans imposed their religion by law on everyone who lived in Massachusetts Bay Colony for a time. I'm sure that it was the example of the early christian settlers and their religious intolerance that inspired the founding fathers to found a government not based on any religion\n\n \n I realized that you said \"enacted everywhere.\" That's why I made the disclaimer that I was thinking out loud. I was not attempting to refute what you said. I was wondering about the other influences Christianity had on law. I also understand that the Sabbath is Saturday. But the Christian observance of the Sabbath is usually on the Lord's Day--Sunday. The Day of the Resurrection is seen as a fulfillment of the Sabbath. That's why I mentioned the blue laws on Sunday. \n \n Now, I do not quite remember what purpose our tangent had in this debate. I was disputing some of your assertions on the Bible but I'm not sure how it tied in. I yield so that the debate may be furthered.",

   "Maximus, which 'catholic' church?\n \n I am an Orthodox and we say the Nicence Creed* which has \"we believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church\"... which is us!\n \n Catholic means 'universal'. Even the Anglican churches say the creed with these words in it.\n \n *the original one, not the one the Roman Catholic Church unilaterally altered by adding the filioque.\n\n \n Montalban,\n I apologize for the tardy reply. \n \n Let me say that I believe that the differences between Catholic and Orthodox originated politically rather than theologically. \n \n I cannot find the source or the exact quote but Pope John Paul II stated something similar to this, \"the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church are two lungs of the same being.\" The Second Vatican Council stated, \"The Catholic Church holds in high esteem the institutions, liturgical rites, ecclesiastical traditions and the established standards of the Christian life of the Eastern churches, for in them, distinguished as they are for their venerable antiquity, there remains conspicuous the tradition that has been handed down from the Apostles through the Fathers and that forms part of the divinely revealed and undivided heritage of the universal Church.\"\n \n I approach the Orthodox Church with great repsect and friendship. I approach it with hope of a reunion in the near future. I believe that the filioque is not the dividing force that it once was: \n \n The quotations below show that the early Church Fathers, both Latin and Greek, recognized the same thing, saying that the Spirit proceeds \"from the Father and the Son\" or \"from the Father through the Son.\" \n \n Eastern Orthodox Bishop Kallistos Ware (formerly Timothy Ware), who once adamantly opposed the filioque doctrine, states: \"The filioque controversy which has separated us for so many centuries is more than a mere technicality, but it is not insoluble. Qualifying the firm position taken when I wrote [my book] The Orthodox Church twenty years ago, I now believe, after further study, that the problem is more in the area of semantics and different emphases than in any basic doctrinal differences\" (Diakonia, quoted from Elias Zoghby's A Voice from the Byzantine East, 43). \n \n *from www.catholic.com, the Catholic Answers website.\n \n In regard to the word \"catholic\" as applied to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches...I do not think it holds. St. Ignatius of Antioch first used the word to describe a church that was under the authority of a pope, one that was distinguished from all other groups. \n \n St. Augustine wrote this, \"We believe in the 'holy catholic Church,' that is the Catholic Church; for heretics violate the faith itself by a false opinion about God; schismatics, however, withdraw from a fraternal love by hostile separations, althought they believe the same things we do. Consequently, neither heretics nor schismatics belong to the Catholic Church.\" (Faith and Creed  10:21, A.D. 323)\n \n I believe that Holy Scripture and Holy Tradition strongly support the primacy and succession of Peter. We can discuss this in further detail if you like. Peter is the glue of unity that makes the Church \"one\" in addition to being \"catholic.\" The Church must be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. I do not think the Orthodox, without coming under the authority of the pope, meets these requirements. \"Holy,\" yes. \"Apostolic,\" yes. \"Catholic,\" I'm not sure. \"One,\" I'm not sure.

He didn't even ask if I needed his guidance at this time. His lack of pastoral care has really got me miffed!",

   "Montalban,\n \n \nWe would be glad to have the Pope as first amongst equals, as he was, but never as the head of the Church.\n\n \n Scripture and Tradition say otherwise. Do you believe that a man should be the head of a Christian household? (Scripture tells us he should-the presentation of God the Father, Jesus taking the form of man, Adam being the first human creation and woman being created from man, etc.) (This is not misogyny either--Ephesians 5 is the foundation).\n \n If you answered yes to the above question then think about this: Why would God do anything less with his own household, the Church? It has been so throughout the history of the world of Judaism and Christianity. God always put someone in charge of his people to be his voice and administrator on earth. He always placed a father to lead the household of God-Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon...Jesus...then Peter...then the Popes...the fathers of the household. This is a simple explanation that couples with the overwhelming scriptural evidence for Peter's primacy that shows us the nature of God and his plan for his kingdom. More on scripture later.\n \n \nReferences? You do know of course that the first bishop of Antioch was Peter. So, the current bishop there claims through Apostolic Succession from St. Peter.\n\n \n Yes, I am aware that Peter was the Bishop of Antioch. Reference: Ignatius spoke of the Catholic Church in his Epistle to the Smyrneans  8, \"See that you all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\" \n \n Ignatius as Bishop of Antioch acknowledged the authority of the Bishop of Rome:\n \n \"Ignatius . . . to the church also which holds the presidency, in the location of the country of the Romans, worthy of God, worthy of honor, worthy of blessing, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy of sanctification, and, because you hold the presidency in love, named after Christ and named after the Father\" (Letter to the Romans  1:1 [A.D. 110]). \n \n \"You [the church at Rome] have envied no one, but others you have taught. I desire only that what you have enjoined in your instructions may remain in force\" (ibid., 3:1).\"\n \n I hope and pray that your mother will make a quick recovery. Try not to give up on your Church or your priest. Perhaps he wanted to let your mother have some peace and quiet??",
