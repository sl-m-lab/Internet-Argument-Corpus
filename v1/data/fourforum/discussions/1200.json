I'm not suggesting you were 'lied' to by five different doctors in this case. Just making a point. (The American Medical Association states that medical mistakes cause somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 deaths per year. That's the number that they are admitting and publishing! That makes 'medical mistakes' the third leading cause of death in the U.S.A. right behind heart failure and cancer.)",

   "It is very true that the facts on abortion can be misleading at times. Many pro-abortion groups tend to spread lies and lead people to having false understandings about the issue. For example many people have been lead to believe that during the first trimester, an embryo is no more than a mass of tissue, though some would be surprised how far they have developed in a period of just 8 weeks. Some examples of these pictures can be found on my website at:\n http://vek.rrnet.net/gallery/Abortion\n For those who don't believe that these picture are accurate, you may also view www.abortionno.org for a second viewing and their statement of credibility. If this is still not enough you may just want to do some research in a reliable educational resource such as an encyclopedia or a textbook. On several occaisions, the pro-life Centre for Bio-ethical Reform has had to pursue lawsuits against desperate pro-abortion community groups who have made false accusations against the group in hopes of supporting their cause, this can be found also at www.abortionno.org\n It really does make one wonder though, if there is really nothing to hide, why are pro-abortionists so desperate to hide and mask the truth about abortion?",

   "\"I've heard that quoted countless times by abortion-rights advocates. Can you give me ANY evidence that that happened at all, even to a small number of women, let alone to thousands?\"\n \n Do you seriously think not a few women have died? \n For starters, more then 8,000 women died from criminal abortions in Romania. One of the most well documented cases of pro-life incompetence in Eastern Europe besides the 1993 referendum in Poland. Just about every thing was utilized under the corrupt Ceausescu regime to enforce coercion childbirth but with little success. The criminal abortion rate sky-rocketed and passed the previous legal abortion rate. Orphanages swelled with 400,000 more abandoned children. Because the state couldn't handle the influx many children were easily captured into sexual slavery...again a dirty legacy of the \"pro-life\" movement in Romania that is heavily censored.\n Unfortunately there are no winners when it comes to Romania's abortion policies. Romania mimics how abortion laws were like in the 1940s here in the USA. \n Regardless, this was reported by the Montreal Gazette back in October 6th in 1992 in their article, \"Abortion Ban Led to Deaths of 10,000 Romanian Women.\"",
