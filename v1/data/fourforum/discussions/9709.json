The question is...why is the value placed on the unborn different based on the situation of another? Seems crazy to me.\n\n I agree that most people tend to go by gut feeling in their views on abortion, without thinking things through. Many polls ask about specific exceptions but this is the only one I've seen so far that addressed abortion vs time in a pregnancy and, as such, it was very telling. It means that most people's views are not at the extremes (of abortions always or never) but somewhere in the middle. Indeed, I have heard of pro-choice advocates that would outlaw abortion in the second and third trimester and have met a person who called themselves pro-life because he only allowed abortion in the first trimester - i.e. the same stance labelled two different ways. There are a lot of shades of gray in this abortion debate. Do most people have a clear picture why they place limits at certain points? Probably not, but their gut reactions themselves might be an indication about what they value.\n \n In asking the question that defined this thread, I was mostly curious what gut feelings made them want to outlaw second trimester abortions while leaving first trimester abortions untouched. My guess is that things start getting more unclear in the second trimester (with respect to higher order development) and that is why they would outlaw abortion in the second trimester. \n \nThe only two positions on abortion that make any sense and are even remotely consistent are your opinion and mine. These exceptions for rape, health, etc etc are just weird and inconsistent with itself.\n\n I think that, on the pro-life side, many people give an exception for rape or incest since they view women with unwanted pregnancies as morally deficient, so there is very little sympathy for them, whereas there is a lot of sympathy to those who have experienced rape or incest. It is not a consistent point of view, as you say. \n \n On the pro-choice side, we generally allow for a far wider range of reasons for abortion because we place so much value in a woman's right to her body and because we don't automatically place a lot of value on life at conception but view other criteria (ex. mental existance) as being critical. In posing the question of this thread, I was also wondering if other developments are critical to people (ex. when the heart starts beating, or when most organs start functioning to some level, when it starts to look like a human, when it starts to move, etc.) - and why. \n \n Anyway, where exceptions are concerned in situations where we grant fetal rights (third trimester, in my case), then I think that risk to mother's life and health are justified exceptions from the point of view of self-defense. In real life, people are grudgingly allowed to protect themselves violently (by force of arms or other means - even to the point of killing) when they risk death or severe injury by someone's actions. I don't see it being that different for abortion. I admittedly don't have a good feel for where to set the limit on the health exception (which is why I started a thread on it) but I think that extreme health risks (ex. of paralysis, etc.) are sufficient reasons.\n \nRoe vs. wade doesn't apply anymore. Casey changed this and 2nd trimester abortions are not illegal in any fashion in any state I am aware of.\n\n Time for me to read up on Casey then.",

I personally find the gut reactions also enlightening - in that they give some impression about what people generally value - but agree that the gut reactions are not well thought out. However, this can also be said to be true of those on the pro-life side whose only arguement is \"because my religion tells me so\". You, jyoshu and others have put a lot more thought into your arguements than that, but there are many on the pro-life side that do not try to find any reasons behind their religious beliefs. I think everyone, on both sides, needs to think about what they value, what they don't, and how specifically that applies to abortion.\n \nThis seems different though.

However, I think self-defense still applies. It reminds me of the book / movie \"Of Mice and Men\" by Steinbeck where a big strong dumb mentally challenged man was accidentally killing people in various situations where he intends them no harm because he did not have a grasp of his own strength and its consequences.

There is a lot one can learn about what people value from their gut reactions. I think the main problem with gut reactions is that they don't look at the whole picture - so there are a lot of subtleties and understanding of consequences people might miss if going by gut reactions.\n \nI realize this but it my example of the speeder you would be killing them as self-protection eventhough you 1) only have a chance of being harmed (hasn't happened yet) and 2) are not activily going to be harmed...its more passive at this point.\n\n The speeder going 200 miles per hour still has a relatively low chance of getting someone killed (assuming he has any skill whatsoever). Perhaps a drunk speeder going 200 miles per hour has a lot more of a chance. Either way, if a chance that he is going to kill you is fairly high, then I think you have a right to self-protection - even killing if necessary. For example, he could be driving at 200 miles per hour straight at you since he doesn't see you. Again, I think that other measures should be tried first to stop the threat without killing the one who causes that threat (and this applies to the fetus as well) but sometimes there just is no choice.\n \ni'll admit these are harder questions but lucky for us they only make up 3-4 cases a year (not that it makes it any easier).\n\n Do you have any links to show that abortion due to risk of mother's life only constitutes 3-4 cases a year?

   "Polls indicate that the majority of Americans - 68% - think that abortion should be generally illegal in the second trimester. This is compared to 28% thinking it should be generally illegal in the first trimester and 84% thinking it should be generally illegal in the third trimester. These statistics come from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll (Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3) from the link: http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm (most of the way down the page). This is the only poll which I have found which asks about individual trimesters.\n \n This 68% who would generally outlaw second trimester abortions presumably constitute mostly pro-life supporters but would also include some pro-choice supporters. My own views are based on mental existence / mind being the important criteria in determining fetal rights, which neurologists say does not exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion in the first and second trimester and strictly limit it in the third. \n \n If you support strict limits on abortion in the second trimester, could you outline your reasons? I am particularly interested in the views of those who are pro-choice and hold these views since the views of those on the pro-life side are well known. If you are pro-life and wish to contribute, then it would be preferable if you contributed something new (not the same arguements used in all other threads) by, for example, outlining developments that happen to the fetus in the second trimester that you consider morally important.\n\n \n My views (as a lifetime pro-choicer) on this are pretty much the same as yours. I base it on mental existence. One of the ways I view it like that is : if you are mind ceases to exist, you are dead, therefore, the beginning of mental existence determines the actual life of the person.\n \n I do not support limits in the second trimester, except maybe late in it. I think Steeve has a point, however, that we should divide it into weeks. I'll have to take a look at exactly how many weeks mental processes begin in foetuses, but that is where I would start imposing restrictions. Before that point, no restrictions whatsoever should be applied: every woman should be free to get an abortion no matter the circumstances. \n \n After that point, I would limit abortions after mental existence to situations where a woman's life or health is in danger (I think I saw a thread for that somewhere, so if you like I can go more into the cases there). I also think that for cases after mental existence it is best to go on a case-by-case basis rather than making strict guidelines: judge each case by its own merit.",

I agree that weeks would give the more precise definition since, as I mentioned to Steeeve, the references I have seen (on sufficient development of the cerebral cortex for a mind to exist) range around the beginning of the third trimester - meaning that the earlier references lie in the late second trimester. I think a full survey of the literature, and potentially a group debate between neurologists knowledgable on the subject, would best be able to determine that point.\n \n As for the mother's health exception, I would be interested in hearing your views (as well as the views of anyone else who is reading this) about what would be reasonable specific health exceptions and what would be unreasonable - preferably in the thread that I had set up for that purpose.",

Also, when I occasionally read discussions between others, where I am not involved, I tend to stop listening to the discussion once it becomes too angry and/or illogical. So, I do not have a good way of judging ShooterandProud's approach to pro-life debaters. I can only say that, in those posts that I have read of ShooterandProud, I haven't seen anything like the tactics with the frequency of use of those tactics of the poster \"___\". It is the constant, unrelenting use of these tactics that eventually drove me nuts.\n \n That being said, I agree that, when we notice a particularly irresponsible poster on our own side, we should call them on it. I admit that there is some bias in protecting one's own side and having a double standard about what we openly criticize. It is hard to avoid some of that bias. However, I agree that, if a poster is particularly bad and we notice, we should say something. I would leave it up to the offended party to be the one who actually reports. All I can say is that I will try to be more on the lookout for any tactics of that sort from my own side as well.\n \n As for occasional arguements presented by one's own side of the abortion debate that one does not agree with, I have occasionally had debates with people on the pro-choice side to address such points. For example, as you know, I do not think that a woman's right to her own body is paramount over everything else since, once a fetus gains mental existence, its rights also need to be taken into account. Also, I agree (and have written so in a few posts) that pro-life proponents views on restricting abortion does not necessitate them to personally give support to poor mothers and the like.",

If it gets really bad just block their posts...I've done it for a few posters and it works. And I understand it is very tempting to just try and \"fight back\".\n \n Those that put thought into a response are the ones most respected here ;) Those that insult and give responses that have no meaning or thought will never be taken seriously.
