They are nearly 200,000-year-old skulls from Ethiopia, dating back almost to the time when modern people evolved in Africa from earlier beings. The date means they are more than 40,000 years older than what anthropologists thought were the oldest human remains. Experts say the finding provides new information about early humans who roamed the earth.\n",
