   "Is an belief in Gravity faith based?\n \n Archangel has claimed this about what a theory means:\n \n \nAnd here is the definition of the word theory, no where does it imply anything has been proven at all. And notice below that a theory is also referred to an assumption, presupposition; opinion, view, belief, contention. None of those words infer evidence of anything real or concrete. So whether you accept it or not, you too are living by faith. Only your faith is in a man made science.\n\n \n Post 76\n \n So is a belief in gravity, since it's a theory faith based?\n \n Or does the Earth just suck?",
