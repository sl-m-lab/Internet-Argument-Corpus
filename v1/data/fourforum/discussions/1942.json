   "Why do Jehovah's Witnesses say that 1914 was the year that major Bible prophecies were fulfilled? Were they all wrong?\n (1) Why do Jehovah's Witnesses say that the \"appointed times of the nations\" ended in 1914?\n (2) Why do they say that this was the year in which God's kingdom was established in heaven to bring peace to the earth?\n (3) Why do they say that this was the year that Satan and his demons were hurled out of heaven to the earth?\n (4) Why do we say this year was the start of the \"last days\"?\n \n (1) Appointed times of the nations\n The only city in all the earth upon which Jehovah placed his name was Jerusalem.\n 1 Kings 11:36\n 36 And to his son I shall give one tribe, in order that David my servant may continue having a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there. \n It was also the capital of a God-approved earthly kingdom typical of God's coming heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 607 B.C.E. was very significant. This event marked the beginning of a lengthy interruption of God's direct rule over his people on earth. Some six centuries later, Jesus indicated that this period of interrupted rule was still in effect, for he said:\n Luke 21:24\n \"Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.\"\n The prophecy in Daniel chapter 4 Shows that this prophecy had a fulfillment upon Nebuchadnezzar. But it also has a larger fulfillment. How do we know that? Daniel 4 Verses 3 and 17 show that the dream that God gave to King Nebuchadnezzar deals with the Kingdom of God and God's promise to give it \"to the one whom he wants to . . . even the lowliest one of mankind.\" The entire Bible shows that Jehovah's purpose is for his own Son, Jesus Christ, to rule as His representative over mankind. (Ps. 2:1-8; Dan. 7:13, 14; 1 Cor. 15:23-25; Rev. 11:15; 12:10) The Bible's description of Jesus shows that he was indeed \"the lowliest one of mankind.\" (Phil. 2:7, 8; Matt. 11:28-30) The prophetic dream, then, points to the time when Jehovah would give rulership over mankind to his own Son.\n During this \"appointed times of the nations,\" worldly governments would be allowed to interrupt rulership approved by God. That period began with the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., and Daniel indicated that it would go on for \"seven times.\" (Daniel 4:23-25) How long is that? The Bible shows that three and a half \"times\" equal 1,260 days. (Revelation 12:6, 14) Twice that period, or seven times, would be 2,520 days. But nothing noteworthy happened at the end of that short period of time. By applying the \"a day for a year\" rule found at Numbers 14:34; and Ezekiel 4:6. to Daniel's prophecy and counting 2,520 years from 607 B.C.E., we arrive at the year 1914 C.E.- \n CALCULATING THE \"SEVEN TIMES\"\n \"Seven times\" = 7 X 360 = 2,520 years\n A Biblical \"time,\" or year = 12 X 30 days = 360. (Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:6, 14)\n In the fulfillment of the \"seven times\" each day equals one year. (Ezek. 4:6; Num. 14:34)\n Early October, 607 B.C.E., to December 31, 607 B.C.E.= 1/4 year\n January 1, 606 B.C.E., to December 31, 1 B.C.E. = 606 years\n January 1, 1 C.E., to December 31, 1913 = 1,913 years\n January 1, 1914, to early October, 1914 = 3/4 year\n Total: 2,520 years\n (2) Kingdom established\n The entire point was that people of the nations would no longer trample on Gods true people. By saying \"Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled,\" was Jesus suggesting that the earthly city would eventually be restored to divine favor? No. After the murder of God's beloved Son, earthly Jerusalem lost its special status forever and has been replaced by a far superior \"city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.\"(God's kingdom)-Matthew 23:37, 38; 27:50, 51.\n Paul reminded Hebrew Christians that;\n Hebrews 13:14.\n \"we do not have here a city that continues, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come.\"\n So it wasn't established in his day. \n The expression \"heavenly Jerusalem\" is used in the Bible to describe the indestructible heavenly Kingdom that is to come.\n Hebrews 11:9-10\n 10 For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and maker of which [city] is God.\n So it's not a physical kingdom.\n Hebrews 12:22\n 22 But YOU have approached a Mount Zion and a city of [the] living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels,\n It's God's Kingdom.\n Hebrews 12:28-29\n 28 Wherefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.\n A kingdom that is indestructible.\n Daniel 2:44\n 44 \"And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite; \n if you read the context of this verse you'll see that this Kingdom was to be established in a time of political divisions and uncertainty. Sounds like our time! Not only that but it was to bring to an end all the earthly kingdoms that did not uphold Jehovah's sovereignty, i.e. America, Britain, France, Russia, China, infact all nations on earth that have human government.\n (3) Satan hurled to the earth \n Revelation 12:7\n 7 And war broke out in heaven: Mi'cha\u00b7el and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled 8 but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. \n at the birth of God's Kingdom in 1914 and at the end of \"the times of the Gentiles,\" war broke out in the heavenly domain of Jehovah God. Who authorized that war? Jehovah God himself. He sent his enthroned Son into the field of battle to remove Satan and his followers from the heavenly realm, this was the first act of Jesus Christ as the enthroned king, what was now to follow was a worldwide preaching and teaching campaign. Matthew 24:14. \n \n (4) The Last Days\n 1914 was the start of the \"last days\" or \"the end times\" of the ancient system under the control of Satan the devil, all God and Jesus had to do now was to tell as many people as possible what was going on and when it was going to end.\n 2 Timothy 3:1-5\n 3 But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3 having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4 betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.\n Credits;\n Knowledge that leads to everlasting life pg. 96-7\n Watchtower magazine 1990, 10/15 pgs.17-18\n Watchtower magazine 1990, 7/1 pg. 26\n Reasoning from the scriptures, -dates.

I was looking for you input because you don't have any religious conviction, which is often the best way to be because you're not tied down with emotional blackmail or 'praise the lord' antics. Think of the Bible as just another book and tell me if you think this prophecy/s is right, true JW's have been wrong in the past, although this is often very much blown out of all proportion, misunderstood or quite often just stuff someone decided to make up. Anyway 1914 wasn't predicted by JW's it was spoken to Daniel over 2000 years ago in a vision given by God.",
