   "He admits this when he says that he will \"never stop thinking about new ways to harm our people\"\n\n \n \n You decided to open up a whole thread to point out a quote that was misstated by Bush, but either way, I think everyone on this forum has heard it 100 times. Making a whole thread pointing out a grammar mistake by Bush is pretty dumb; we could fill this whole forum with thim. \n \n However, Kerry, a lawyer who sued the hell out of people, doesn't even know what a gynecologist is. In the 2nd debate, he called them OG-BYNs. He used one of the worst campaign statements of all time in saying, \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.\" He used the term \"global test\" to refer to getting approval before going to war, and then said he didn't mean the whole world. What exactly are you trying to prove by pointing out that comment by Bush?\n \n \n \n \n By the way, shouldn't you be busy trying to take crosses off of every public building, amending the pledge, and creating a new currency without \"In God We Trust\"?",

So it's natural to say that one might never stop thinking about ways to harm America. I do it on occasion, but with no ill intent. I'm certain Bush meant it in a good way, regardless of whether he misspoke or not.\n \n Bush puts the interests of the country above his own, unlike John Boy Kerry!\n \n A well known newscaster recently referred to Rumsfeld as \"the Secretary of State\" as did Bush in a speech. I think they both know better.",
