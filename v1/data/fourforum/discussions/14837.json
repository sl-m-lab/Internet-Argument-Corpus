   "This case talks about how the government must justify their laws after Heller and McDonald. \n  Ruling on right to arms and DV cases \n  United States v. Chester,  handed down by the Fourth Circuit today. Defendant had been convicted of firearm possession after a misdemeanor DV conviction, and appealed. The Fourth Circuit initially vacated the conviction in an unpublished opinion that rejected the argument that the prohibition was justified under Heller's reference to \"long standing\" forms of gun regulation, and remanded, instructing the trial court to determine if there was any other justification. The Circuit then granted rehearing and entered this published decision.\n \n The court initially deals with Heller's \"long standing\" regulations that are \"presumptively lawful.\" It concludes that the first inquiry is whether the practice regulated lay outside the right to arms as originally understood. If it did not, then determine standard of review. The Court notes that scholarship is divided even as whether felons were outside the original right to arms, and there is no reason to believe misdemeanants were.\n \n As to standard of review, the court notes that First Amendment restrictions are sometimes assessed under strict scrutiny and sometimes under intermediate review. Here, it rules, as one convicted of a violent misdemeanor, the Defendant is not within the core right which pertains to the law abiding, and the bar should be assessed under intermediate scrutiny.\n But the court takes that seriously:\n \n \"Although [the various forms of intermediate scrutiny] differ in precise terminology, they essentially share the same substantive requirements. They all require the asserted governmental end to be more than just legitimate, either &#8216;significant,&#8217; &#8216;substantial,&#8217; or &#8216;important&#8217; . . . [and] require the fit between the challenged regulation and the asserted objective be reasonable, not perfect.\"). Significantly, intermediate scrutiny places the burden of establishing the required fit squarely upon the government.\"\n \n \"We cannot conclude on this record that the government has carried its burden of establishing a reasonable fit between the important object of reducing domestic gun violence and \u00a7 922(g)(9)&#8217;s permanent disarmament of all domestic violence misdemeanants. The government has offered numerous plausible reasons why the disarmament of domestic violence misdemeanants is substantially related to an important government goal; however, it has not attempted to offer sufficient evidence to establish a substantial relationship between \u00a7 922(g)(9) and an important governmental goal. Having established the appropriate standard of review, we think it best to remand this case to afford the government an opportunity to shoulder its burden and Chester an opportunity to respond.\"\n \n Judge Day concurs, but argues that the relevant standard should not be whether DV misdemeanants in general can be barred arms, but whether this particular defendant .... who was quite violent, and went beyond the bare \"offensive touching\" minimum of battery ... can be barred. \n",

   " Ohio Sup Ct upholds pre-emption law \nCity of Cleveland v. State of Ohio, Ohio Supreme Court, Dec. 29, 1010. Conflict between Cleveland's enactment of a number of gun regulations, and Ohio's statewide pre-emption law. The City contended that the pre-emption law was unconstitutional under the State constitution's provision of home rule for incorporated cities. The test there was whether the State statute deals with matters of Statewide, general, importance, or tries to dabble in local matters, and the Supreme Court majority held that it was a statute of general importance. It was a statute that sought to make legal standards uniform throughout the State, it applies uniformly to every location in the State and not just this city, it involves the police power.\n \n This seems to me rather obvious. In proof, however, that some courts apply different rules when gun regulations are at issue (witness how in Heller the Court's \"liberal wing\" suddenly became the strictest of strict constructionists for an hour), the Court of Appeals had struck down the statute, and even held that its provision for attorney fees should a person challenge such ordinances and win was unconstitutional because it &#8220;invite[d] unwarranted litigation and attempt[ed] to coerce municipalities into repealing or refusing to enforce longstanding local firearm regulations.&#8221;\n",

   "The ruling explained\n  Ohio Supreme Court shoots down local gun control \n The Ohio Supreme Court today dealt a fatal blow to local efforts to regulate firearms, concluding that a more permissive state law should trump restrictions on guns in cities.\n \n In a 5-2 ruling, the state's top court struck down Cleveland's assault-weapons ban and registration requirement for handguns.\n \n Cleveland was the last city to press for tougher local firearms regulations after the Supreme Court voided a smaller town's law against guns in public parks in 2008.\n \n In that ruling, as in today's, justices said lawmakers were within their rights when they enacted a uniform set of gun regulations for the entire state in 2007.\n \n Cleveland had argued that the state law infringed on its home-rule authority.\n Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton, the author of today's majority opinion, noted that the Constitution allows for general laws to regulate public safety.\n \"The city acknowledges that its firearm ordinances are an exercise of municipal police power,\" Stratton wrote.\n \n Chief Justice Eric Brown and Justice Paul E. Pfeifer, the court's two most liberal justices, dissented. They contended that lawmakers couldn't simply wish away municipalities' home-rule authority. \n",

   " Does Ohio Supreme Court ruling send signal about Seattle parks gun ban case? \n Seattle&#8217;s anti-gun administration may have gotten a strong signal about the city&#8217;s chances of winning a court battle to skirt Washington State&#8217;s 1983 preemption act, courtesy of yesterday&#8217;s ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that upholds the Buckeye State&#8217;s 2006 preemption statute.\n \n Washington&#8217;s law has served as a model, and a benchmark, for similar statutes adopted by legislatures across the country over the past two decades. The Ohio case, City of Cleveland v. State, involves a challenge of Ohio's preemption law by the City of Cleveland that was filed in 2007, about three months after the Ohio legislature passed its statute.\n \n Seattle officials lost the first round before King County Superior Court Judge Catherine Shaffer in their attempt to defy state preemption earlier this year by banning firearms in city park facilities &#8211; a case this column mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s round-up of the top gun rights stories of 2010 &#8211; and is now preparing for a hearing before the State Court of Appeals, Division I. The city was successfully sued by Bellevue&#8217;s Second Amendment Foundation and Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, the National Rifle Association, Washington Arms Collectors and five individual plaintiffs.\n \n The Ohio Supreme Court ruling is significant because of the strong home rule tradition there. The decision was important enough to get the attention of the New York Times and Associated Press. It is also discussed this morning by blogger Eugene Volokh. Oho Attorney General Richard Cordray hailed the ruling, as did the NRA and Ohioans for Concealed Carry.\n \n &#8230;.. Writing for the 5-2 majority, Ohio Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton, noted that &#8220;absent a uniform law throughout the state, law abiding gun owners would face a confusing patchwork of licensing requirements, possession restrictions, and criminal penalties as they travel from one jurisdiction to another.&#8221;\n \n This logic must infuriate anti-gun Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and his predecessor, Nickels, and their allies at Washington CeaseFire. They would love to undo state preemption in order to establish their own gun laws within the Seattle city limits, essentially creating a &#8220;city state&#8221; where otherwise law-abiding gun owners might find themselves in big trouble for doing something that is perfectly legal everywhere else on Evergreen State soil (does Open Carry ring a bell?).\n \n &#8230;. Cleveland had adopted a series of gun control ordinances prior to enactment of the 2006 preemption statute, including a ban on so-called &#8220;assault weapons.&#8221; The ordinances also mandated handgun registration and banned open carry;\n \n &#8230;This year&#8217;s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court incorporating the Second Amendment to the states &#8211; listed here yesterday as the most significant civil rights story of 2010, and perhaps the decade &#8211; adds an additional roadblock to Seattle&#8217;s attempt to set itself above the law and the state and federal constitutions. \nAntis. You can't just do whatever the heck you want to do just because you HATE the 2nd amendment. The Constitution is a legally binding document! Obey the Law!",

   "Here is how I read this case. It does not declare the law unconstitutional. It does say there is no evidence the founders intended to deny the RKBA to a person convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence crime. Therefore, the law does not get a free pass&#8212;it does not make the list of &#8220;presumptively lawful&#8221; regulations described in Heller&#8212;and that to survive it must meet an &#8220;intermediate scrutiny&#8221; test. The case is remanded to the district court to take evidence on the issue of passing this test.\n \n The first issue the court confronted was how to address the &#8220;longstanding prohibitions&#8221; language from Heller. Here is the Heller language again: \n \n Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of [Slip Op. 55] arms. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 54-55 (2008)\n \n And, in a footnote to the above:\n \n We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 64 (2008)\n \n Lower federal courts are trying to figure out how to apply this language. SCOTUS says the list of &#8220;presumptively lawful&#8221; regulations it provided is not exhaustive. The temptation exists for some courts to declare that any law currently on the books fits within this &#8220;presumptively lawful&#8221; list. The 4th. Circuit rejected this view, and even said (correctly, in my view) that making the list does not automatically mean the law is constitutional: \n \n Some courts have treated Heller's listing of &#8220;presumptively lawful regulatory measures,&#8221; for all practical purposes, as a kind of &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for unlisted regulatory measures, such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), which they deem to be analogous to those measures specifically listed in Heller. See, e.g., United States v. White, 593 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2010) (&#8220;We see no reason to exclude \u00a7 922(g)(9) from the list of long-standing prohibitions on which Heller does not cast doubt.&#8221;). This approach, however, approximates rational-basis review, which has been rejected by Heller. See Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2817, n.27. In fact, the phrase &#8220;presumptively lawful regulatory measures&#8221; suggests the possibility that one or more of these &#8220;longstanding&#8221; regulations &#8220;could be unconstitutional in the face of an as-applied challenge.&#8221; United States v. Williams, 616 F.3d 685, 692 (7th Cir. 2010).\n \n The Court also noted that the prohibition against possession by persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors only dates back to 1996. The Court refused to assume this law is &#8220;presumptively lawful&#8221; just because it has been on the books&#8212;it is, after all not a &#8220;longstanding prohibition.&#8221; But then how do you resolve the question?\n \n Heller described its exemplary list of &#8220;longstanding prohibitions&#8221; as &#8220;presumptively lawful regulatory measures,&#8221; id. at 2817, n.26, without alluding to any historical evidence that the right to keep and bear arms did not extend to felons, the mentally ill or the conduct prohibited by any of the listed gun regulations. It is unclear to us whether Heller was suggesting that &#8220;longstanding prohibitions&#8221; such as these were historically understood to be valid limitations on the right to bear arms or did not violate the Second Amendment for some other reason. See United States v. Rene E., 583 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2009) (concluding that Heller &#8220;identified limits deriving from various historical restrictions on possessing and carrying weapons,&#8221; including the felon dispossession provision, that &#8220;were left intact by the Second Amendment&#8221;). Federal felon dispossession laws, for example, were not on the books until the twentieth century, and the historical evidence and scholarly writing on whether felons were protected by the Second Amendment at the time of its ratification is inconclusive. But even if the listed regulations were not historical limitations on the scope of the Second Amendment, the Court could still have viewed the regulatory measures as &#8220;presumptively lawful&#8221; if it believed they were valid on their face under any level of means-end scrutiny applied.\n \n The 4th. Circuit hits on a point. Historical analysis only goes so far. If a regulation widely existed when the Amendment was passed then that is evidence the RKBA historically did not extend to the area regulated, and thus the regulation would be deemed constitutional. But what happens when laws are passed after the amendment was ratified that carry regulations which did not exist at the time of the Amendment? Here it is important to note that the government did concede that the defendant in this case had a claim to the 2nd. Amendment RKBA: \n \n The government has not contended that \u00a7 922(g)(9) is valid because Chester, having been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, is wholly unprotected by the Second Amendment. Based on this and the lack of historical evidence in the record before us, we are certainly not able to say that the Second Amendment, as historically understood, did not [Slip. Op. 15] apply to persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. We must assume, therefore, that Chester's Second Amendment rights are intact and that he is entitled to some measure of Second Amendment protection to keep and possess firearms in his home for self-defense. The question then becomes whether the government can justify, under the appropriate level of scrutiny, the burden imposed on Chester's Second Amendment rights by \u00a7 922(g)(9).\n \n Here the Court is saying there is no evidence (and the government agrees with this) to show the founders would have denied a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence his RKBA. Therefore, this defendant still has a claim to the right, and the question now becomes which test to use to determine whether the law violates his RKBA. \n \n And this is where the Court does the RKBA a great service by equating the 2nd. Amendment with the 1st. Amendment&#8212;in my view giving the RKBA the same protective view that it does for 1st. Amendment rights:\n \n Our task, therefore, is to select between strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny. Given Heller's focus on &#8220;core&#8221; Second Amendment conduct and the Court's frequent references to First Amendment doctrine, we agree with those who advocate looking to the First Amendment as a guide in developing a standard of review for the Second Amendment.\n \n Now a disclaimer: Remember the right of free speech is not absolute, and some conduct that is speech is less protected than others. As an example, commercial speech does not get strict scrutiny protection, but political speech does. This is because SCOTUS has held that commercial speech does not lie at the core of the right. So be aware that this court will not elevate the RKBA above other rights. Indeed, it suggested it would treat it no differently than other Constitutional rights when it quoted with approval a recent 7th. Circuit case to say:\n \n The Second Amendment is no more susceptible to a one-size-fits-all standard of review than any other constitutional right. Gun-control regulations impose varying degrees of burden on Second Amendment rights, and individual assertions of the right will come in many forms. A severe burden on the core Second Amendment right of armed self-defense should require strong justification. But less severe burdens on the right, laws that merely regulate rather than restrict, and laws that do not implicate the central self-defense concern of the Second Amendment, may be more easily justified.(citing United States v. Skoien, 587 F.3d 803 (7th Cir. 2009), vacated, 614 F.3d 638 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc))\n \n And so, like 1st. Amendment inquiries, the question the Court asks next is does the regulation invade the core of the right. If it does, then it faces strict scrutiny. The Court declares that this case does not involve the core of the right, and therefore the lower standard of intermediate scrutiny is to be applied:\n \n Although Chester asserts his right to possess a firearm in his home for the purpose of self-defense, we believe his claim is not within the core right identified in Heller &#8212; the right of a law-abiding, responsible citizen to possess and carry a weapon for self-defense &#8212; by virtue of Chester's criminal history [Slip. Op. 17] as a domestic violence misdemeanant. Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2821. Accordingly, we conclude that intermediate scrutiny is more appropriate than strict scrutiny for Chester and similarly situated persons. (emphasis in original)\n \n (Note also the court says &#8220;possess and carry&#8221;&#8212;which suggests to me that the right is about to also break out of the home and be extended to carry outside the home. This, in my view, is the logical extension of Heller) \n \n Here is how the Court explains the &#8220;intermediate scrutiny&#8221; standard:\n \n Accordingly, the government must demonstrate under the intermediate scrutiny standard that there is a &#8220;reasonable fit&#8221; between the challenged regulation and a &#8220;substantial&#8221; government objective. Fox, 492 U.S. at 480; see Marzzarella, 614 F.3d at 98 (&#8220;Although [the various forms of intermediate scrutiny] differ in precise terminology, they essentially share the same substantive requirements. They all require the asserted governmental end to be more than just legitimate, either &#8216;significant,&#8217; &#8216;substantial,&#8217; or &#8216;important&#8217; . . . [and] require the fit between the challenged regulation and the asserted objective be reasonable, not perfect.&#8221;). Significantly, intermediate scrutiny places the burden of establishing the required fit squarely upon the government. See Fox, 492 U.S. at 480-81.\n \n And, of course, no one at the trial court created a record to solve this issue because no one knew this would be the standard. Therefore, the Court sends the case back down to the trial court to allow both sides to present evidence and re-argue the issue before the trial court:\n \n We cannot conclude on this record that the government has carried its burden of establishing a reasonable fit between the important object of reducing domestic gun violence and \u00a7 922(g)(9)'s permanent disarmament of all domestic-violence misdemeanants. The government has offered numerous plausible reasons why the disarmament of domestic violence misdemeanants is substantially related to an important government goal; however, it has not attempted to offer sufficient evidence to establish a substantial relationship between \u00a7 922(g)(9) and an important governmental goal. Having established the appropriate standard of review, we think it best to remand this case to afford the government an opportunity to shoulder its burden and Chester an opportunity to respond. Both sides should have an opportunity to present [Slip. Op. 18] their evidence and their arguments to the district court in the first instance. (emphasis in original)\n \n So the district Court will re-hear the constitutionality argument all over again. Each side (and the judge) now knows the standard, and each side will have an opportunity to present evidence (studies by Kellerman, for example&#8230;.) to convince the district court judge to rule one way or the other. Regardless of the outcome, expect to see this case again at the 4th. Circuit as the side which loses the re-hearing will undoubtedly appeal again.",
