Far too many people play games, and have been plaing them for a long time to say that everyone does. Just take a look at the sales numbers and then at the numbers of perpetrators.\n \n Much rather than what the guy played I'd pay attention to the outcast loner bits. Those are present everywhere - I have yet to hear of a popular cheerleading squad leader, or whatever the current male equivalent would be, going on a shooting spree. It's always the loners, the ones that don't mesh with the rest of the generation. Hell, I have yet to hear of a grieving current girlfriend among them - only parents.\n \n \n Second, regarding advertising. Even the advertisers realize that advertising is not omnipotent. You can't make a guy with no pets buy dog food no matter how much advertising you direct at him. What you can achieve is to implant yourself into his mind as a name associated with it - so that when he does get a dog, he's AWARE that Pedigree Pal or whatever is a notable pet food maker.\n \n The whole point is that there's a huge crowd of sellers and advertising only makes you stand out of the crowd. After all, on the fresh produce market, where everyone sells the same seasonal fruits, the guy with the stall right next to the entrance has a marked advantage when it comes to the lost customer who just want a kilo of oranges for the weekend.\n \n Claiming that advertising will make you buy is false.",

Based on the GAM, it was hypothesized that exposure to video game violence would be positively correlated with trait hostility. This hypothesis was generally confirmed. Hostility was correlated significantly with three measures of violent content: the amount of violence adolescents like to have in video games, whether they like more or less violence now compared to 2 or 3 years ago, and the amount of video game violence they expose themselves to.\n It was hypothesized that exposure to video game violence would be positively related to aggressive behaviors, such as arguments with teachers and physical fights. This hypothesis was confirmed. Students who play more violent video games are more likely to have been involved in physical fights and get into arguments with teachers more frequently. The relation between violent video game exposure and physical fights is stronger than that between violent game exposure and arguments with teachers. There are several possible reasons for this, including (1) arguing is less aggressive than fighting, (2) the target of arguing is an authority figure, rather than peers, and (3) there is very little arguing modelled in violent video games whereas there is a great deal of physical aggression modelled in violent games.\n --Journal of Adolescence 27 (2004) 5&#8211;22\n \n Discussion\n The significant results of this experiment were as expected. Listening to violent music has an effect on aggression. This information is useful for parents of young children who are growing up watching these music videos. This specific study&#8217;s results and that of previous researchers reveal a serious problem. Our society as a whole should consider this a severe problem, especially with all of the school bombings, the high rates of angry, gang affiliated, weapon carrying young people, and the millions of dollars being spent on this violent and degrading (mostly to women) kind of music When the angry, violent, aggressive, vulgar videos were shown, participants portrayed a massive amount of hostility; their moods were changing as the video continued as did their behavior.--Journal of Undergraduate Psychological Research 2006, Vol. 1\n \n Discussion\n In 2001, two meta-analyses on the relationship between violence and video games were conducted. Anderson and Bushman's (2001) meta-analysis of thirty-five studies found a positive correlation between violent video games and aggression ( r = .19). In addition, violent video games were found to be negatively correlated with pro-social behavior ( r = -.17) and positively correlated with physiological arousal ( r = .22). Also, a positive correlation ( r = .18) was found for both increases in aggressive thoughts and affect. Sherry's (2001) meta-analysis of twenty-five studies calculates the correlation between video game play and aggression as r = .15, which is smaller than the correlation, found for television and violence ( r = .31) (Paik & Comstock, 1994). This study also found that fantasy and human violence resulted in greater aggression than sports violence. Interestingly, effect size was negatively related to playing time when comparing a playing time of 10 minutes to a playing time of 75 minutes. This brought up issues of arousal and catharsis. Does playing a video game initially cause arousal, and then result in catharsis of those emotions?

   "Several of the studies which observed before and after exposure to the video games and images showed an increase in hostile behavior. You really should read the studies, do some objective research if you are interested in anything more than defending the gaming industry.\n\n \n I don't need to do the research. I have played video games for over 2 decades. If anything, I am LESS violent that I was as a kid. I know a whole bunch of people who play video games who aren't violent.\n \n I can look up statistics and see that the gaming industry is a billion dollar machine that is only growing and growing. I can also see that there aren't any drastic increases in murders or violence as a result of this growth. In fact, when people can sit down and play Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty 4, it's my opinion that this is actually a stress reliever and will reduce violent tendencies as a result.\n \n I find that most people who attack video games are age 40 and older. They didn't have video games and they seem foreign to them. It's just like parents who grew up listening to the Beatles and were horrified when their kids started listening to heavy metal or rap. It was new and unknown.\n \n With the amount of violence in movies, music, TV, and video games, we should basically be seeing a never-ending war in the streets if all of these forms of media directly cause violence. We don't see that, because none of these things cause violence.",

We don't see that, because none of these things cause violence.\n\n \n I think that you are expecting me to over-simply state an obviously complex situation. However great or small it pans out in daily life, exposure to violence such as in games and images does have an adverse affect on behavior.\n \n Your (and CUNx's) expectation that it's an all or nothing \"cause and effect\" take it or leave it conclusion to be made is absurd.\n \n The truth is somwhere in the middle. \n \n But it's like a fresh glass of water,.... how much dirt are you willing to let someone add to it before you will no longer believe it to be fresh or clean? How can you be a \"little bit pregnant?\" to put it another way?\n \n The studies are showing that there is an adverse affect. If that is true ON ANY LEVEL,... it's grounds enough for basing the claim that there is an adverse affect. It's self evident.\n \n Your appeals to ridicule saying that with an increase in gaming we should have mayhem on the streets,... does NOT diminish the effects which have been studied and noted.\n \n But I digress,... food happens.",
