   "Ah, so it then becomes the womans fault... how predictable you make that point. To use your view the consequences of illegalising abortion for a woman who dies from an illegal one is is 2 deaths for the price of 1... great economy don't you agree?\n \n At least when abortion is offered within the law a woman can have a safe abortion and may then have a child/childen later in her life that is/are born and raised.\n\n \n I would say it is the womans fault for getting an illegal abortion..whos fault would it be? When I go to the store it is my \"fault\". \n \n Yeah, with abortion we can safely kill people. So much better emoticon_rolleyes",

   "As I have said before, I am still up in the air on the whole abortion thing. for years abortion was illegal in the US. How many women died yearly as the result of illegal abortions? How many of the illegal abortions that killed women the result of medical necessity, and how many of them were simply becuse the woman did not want to have the baby? I ask becuase I have tried to research this before, and keep coming up with rediculously low numbers (i.e less than 50 per year dyign from illegal abortions) and am trying to figure out if this is a legitimate argument, or a baseless emotional appeal. I saw another thread here where somebody claimed that there were secret abortion procedures passed down from mother to daughter that were used before aboriton was legal. I asked almost every woman I know, including the older ones, and they all thought this was pretty rediculous.\n\n \n From the evidence I have seen and the Congressional hearings (which we have posted on these forums if you wish to search) There weren't that many deaths due to illegal abortions. It was something like 50 a year, however, I don't know if these deaths were for more then anything besides women not wanted to have a baby as a lot of states had it so you could get an abortion if your life was in danger or rape/incest.\n \n This site says 500-1000\n http://www.thinkaboutitonline.com/choice/A0000021.cfm",

But probably not passed directly from mother to daughter, and much further back in the past.

I asked almost every woman I know, including the older ones, and they all thought this was pretty rediculous.\n\n This just made me laugh.\n \n So \"how to abort\" is passed from a mother to her daughter. Obviously the method wasn't very effective.;)\n \n \nTo carry on Daewoo's point, I don't think I've ever managed to see conclusive evidence that legal abortion is significantly safer than illegal abortion. Certainly such evidence could exist, but on the face of it the legality or illegality of abortion procedures seems to be tangential to the actual safety of the procedure.\n\n It's somewhat hard to collect data on something that's illegal. How are you going to go about collecting it? Even if there were stats, I don't see them being accurate.\n \n My stance on abortion is still: \"It's not a person until it can survive outside of the womb\". As such I'm for abortions except if the baby can survive outside the womb without great physical/mental disabilities (this doesn't apply if the woman's life is in danger however).\n \n @Original topic: If it's not illegal, I don't mind. They have a right to tell me this stuff, just like I have the right to tell to \"**** off and stop wasting my time:p\". If it's illegal and it really bugs you, you know who to call;)\n \n -Wez",
