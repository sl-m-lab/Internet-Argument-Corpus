   "As I see it, Turkey deserves the EU does not feel like accepting it. After Justice and Development Party of Turkey came to power in 2002, it became clear that Ankara began to deal its foreign policy issues through the prism of religion and that Turkey was heading for intimacy with its Moslem neighboring states. Moreover, this process is of mutual nature. \n Thus, EU administration and government of Turkey do not only differ in their attitude toward the problem of Iran and Syria but they also treat terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah with inequality. Besides, Turkey is positioning itself leader of Moslem world, which does not correspond the idea of European Union. All these odds make Turkey actually incapable of entering the EU. I think it is time European Parliament dismisses the subject of Turkey's entry into EU. The more so as Turkey is evidently not very much interested in it since it does not even try to make advances for Europe. In support of this you only need to recall Turkey's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide.",
