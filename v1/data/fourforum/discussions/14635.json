   "Well, well, what do you know...I just came up with something that was defined a long time ago as: Hard Determinism. emoticon_xhoho :)\n \n Here is a good argument on Determinism; Hard, Soft and Indeterminism:\n \n Free Will and Determinism\n \n 'When I think about how to behave, I consider reasons. I never think about causes, because insofar as I am an agent, they are never relevant. I have to make choices, and I choose on the basis of reasons. In other words, the model of physical causation does not fit at all when you try to apply it to human choices. Even if all human choices were determined, the HD model would still be completely inadequate to describe the perspective of the agent, which is what really matters for morality. The HD position is simply at odds with human experience because it continually asserts that as far as human experience is concerned, things are not what they seem. (What seems voluntary really isn't, for example.)'\n \n I disagree...\n 'Reason' is the human expression of the awareness of the unconscious process of cause and effect....not unlike the expression or feeling of 'free will' is to explain the unconscious decision-making process. Both 'reason' and 'free will' are abstract descriptions of a real physical process based on cause and effect.\n \n Or, in more technical terms:\n \n 'In his 1990 book The Non-Reality of Free Will, Richard Double claims that \"there can be nothing that answers to the deep senses of free will and moral responsibility.\" \n I shall argue that there can be no such thing as free will and moral responsibility. My argument is a metaphilosophical one that holds that neither concept can have discrete reference, Instead, these terms are merely honorific and subjective; they cannot be legitimized by appeal to the nature of extralinguistic reality, Free will and moral responsibility, as they are viewed in philosophical discourse and everyday life, are not to be counted as candidates among the class of real entities.' http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/double/",

   "What makes this argument peculiar is that we start off on the presumption of proof of a negative. We declare that free will cannot exist. Then begins the process of patching together a case for determinism. In such a situation, we start off with a conclusion and are completely biased against any evidence that suggests otherwise. We make the defense that all evidence is an illusion, a plot, a malicious trick of nature. \n \n What follow is a total downfall of the scientific method. \"Scientific studies\" are inherently lop-sided and usually lacks any type of control because rather than a test to determine what variables might come into play, the tests are designed with the assumption that there are no other possible variables. \n \n Imagine if other areas of scientific study were treated this way. What if we studied geology with the presuption that the earth is 6000-10000 years old, and that any evidence that suugest otherwise must be a feature of the design of the planet that makes it appear to be millions or billions of years older than it really is? Wouldn't that conveniently wipe out any possible hope of finding out the truth about the age of the planet? Where is the scientific integrity? Can we really call this truth if we deny it the opportunity to be rigorously tested and scrutinized?",

   "I'm finding the entire subject of Philosophy 'peculiar'. emoticon_wow:xbanghead\n \n I just finished reading about 'Process Philosophy'. emoticon_confused\n Process Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n and in between chapters, I'm reading about the various philosophers and their theories. All new to me.\n \n What I've found out, so far, is that I concur with portions of certain theories but, feel that none of them are right on the money.\n \n I've been taking notes and have some ideas but, haven't been able to put it all together yet where it makes sense as a whole.\n \n I think Determinism applies but, not completely or, I should say, only at specific moments in time - not in a continuous path from beginning to infinity.\n It exists in the past (memory stored) and applies as far as our possible options for decision making are concerned and exists the moment after the act is done but, at the instant the choice is made, the clock is re-set, so to speak, and new possibilities (available causes) are created. This is happening Universally and effects us constantly, it's not just what's going on inside us.\n \n Imagine your mind as a pantry: you have butter, eggs, flour, sugar stored in there but, you have the potential to make cookies, cakes, pancakes and muffins.

The choice is an illusion that seems to preceed the action of making one of those things, but the choosing process in reality is irrelevant. All that matters is the action. Let's say you make cookies, in a deterministic model you make the cookies because your knowledge, skills, physical state, environment, genetic makeup, emotional state and the state of the electrical and nervous impulses in your brain at the particular point in time all dictated that you would make cookies. The other options weren't ever really options, because based on all the factors I mentioned above, you were never going to make anything but cookies.

Even though you are consciously aware that the other options exist, and even though you percieve yourself anylizing the options and deciding on cookies, its all an illusion, and had nothing to do with your resulting actions. \n I agree...but, I still think there is a moment when determinism is 'shut off', 'reset' or, simply the available options are increased from what they were 'before' - changed from what they were before. If this is true, then determinism is not a constant flow. It may happen at the moment of awareness of making a decision. It may also be an illusion. It has been shown that there is brain activity seconds before that moment (Libet) and I think this is when the brain processes all available internal information stored and external consequences, to determine the best possible choice for the required action 'to do' that has been detected by the senses. All possible options , including all possible combinations of those options computed...in fractions of a second.\n As you say, it appears you have chosen but, in reality, there was ever only one possible 'best' choice.\n It's as if at every moment there is only one possible thing to do but at the same time, there are an infinite number of variables.\n \n \nWas it really impossible? If you were offered $5000 to strip in public wouldn't you? If your mother's life depended on it wouldn't you? If it was a social norm wouldn't you? \n Yes, it really was impossible. Give it a try yourself and see what happens. The next time you are sitting in a vehicle, in public, try to tell yourself to strip naked and run around the vehicle...no other conditions - just to do it. I'll bet you can't. :p (if you do, I want to see proof!) By adding your conditions, you have changed the circumstances, also changing the causes that would have led to the moment of decision. Under different circumstances, there would have been other causes for the situation and other available options and a different result/effect. You are correct but, so am I. ;)\n \n \nI don't think impossibility is a scale. Its either something is impossible or not. If something can be done, its not impossible. Everything you can do today was once something you never did before. Be careful not to confuse what is impossible and what is improbable.\nRight you are. I should have used the word, 'improbable'.\n \n I've also been thinking about dreams. I think they are a glimpse into that mental process that occurs before we have the awareness of making a decision...a place where Time is not limited by our physical, 3-D world -a different Time and Space.\n You know how you can doze off for just a few minutes but, you can be dreaming about something that would take an entire day or week to actually do? That's just a sample of how quick our subconscious mental functioning can be. It's entirely possible for our brains to compute every possible bit of information stored and every possible outcome in just the few split seconds before we are aware of the 'decision'.\n \n You know what else? You know how going without sleep (dreaming) can slow down your mental processes when you're awake? Dreaming may be to humans what 'defragging' is to a computer!",

In that sense, free will is an illusion (according to the determinist standpoint). \n \n I don't see a belief in free will as prerequisite for doing any action, whether under a determinism model or not. There's a difference between \"I believe I have the ability to make my own choice about stripping naked in public\" and \"It is possible for me to strip naked in public\". In fact, in some cases the opposite is true, where the belief that the person DIDN'T have free will made the act more probable. \"I'm telling you, she had a gun to my head! That crazy sandy chick made me strip in public against my will!\" By believing (or not believing) that an individual has free will, the possible actions that the individual has the ability to do doesn't change.

   "We are talking about the act of making a decision, not the act of doing the action. Free will is the ability to decide whether or not we will do an action. You are saying that a lack in the belief in free will (as I defined) equates to a lack of ability to do the action. If I understand you correctly, you are also saying that the belief in free will (not free will itself) is, as a state of the brain, a contributing factor among the internal factors that cause the doing of the action. It seems that you are implying that the belief in free will exists and has an impact on reality, but that free will itself doesn't. In that sense, free will is an illusion (according to the determinist standpoint). \n \n I don't see a belief in free will as prerequisite for doing any action, whether under a determinism model or not. There's a difference between \"I believe I have the ability to make my own choice about stripping naked in public\" and \"It is possible for me to strip naked in public\". In fact, in some cases the opposite is true, where the belief that the person DIDN'T have free will made the act more probable. \"I'm telling you, she had a gun to my head! That crazy sandy chick made me strip in public against my will!\" By believing (or not believing) that an individual has free will, the possible actions that the individual has the ability to do doesn't change. And neither does a belief or lack of belief in free will suggest that free will is indeed an illusion in reality.\n\n \n Agreed. emoticon_xgood\n 'And neither does a belief or lack of belief in free will suggest that free will is indeed an illusion in reality' ...please elaborate on this. emoticon_confused\n \n Well...did you try the experiment??

If I don't pray for their return and they are returned, who is responsible then?\n \n It all (god and free will) has to do with assigning responsibility for events that would naturally happen on their own anyway. We take responsibility for our actions and assign it to others who do the act and when we can't identify the responsible party, we assign it to god.

'Mental masturbation' (I hate that phrase) would be a non-theist endlessly discussing religion with a theist, not actual problem solving.\n \n\n \n Sandycane? &#8216;Scuse me while I clarify what I mean by mental masturbation.\n (I am the expert when it comes to mental masturbation as my old buddy Winston is so very fond of pointing out. Hi Darlin', how you feeling today?) \n \n Thinking of a &#8216;Net Forum&#8217; as an outgrowth of Forums of earlier times. A Forum can be many things, can take many shapes if you will? Imho they can exist as a nexus of ideas or thoughtviews. A point from which ideas are born. The birthplace of ideas, so to speak.\n \n & there are thoughtviews & then there are thoughtviews! \n \n Sometimes it seems as if a thoughtview is terminated in its infancy, an abortive on the parts of those who will not even bother to consider its implications but are ready to terminate because it doesn&#8217;t &#8216;fit&#8217; their framework or ideology. Most times I think fear is the underlying or root cause.\n \n Other times there are the same o lame o thoughtviews lingering on & limping along for what seems like forever. Mutating like viruses, baffling with bs, & producing little more than a maze of quibbles & a fog of words. Most importantly, with no or very little benefit to humanity. People often seem to want to prolong the misery of these ideologies, or bring them back to some sortof pathetic life. Others, seeking progress or pragmatically seeking to move forward in a more beneficial direction, seem to want to give these ideologies a 'death with dignity'. & move on. Dr. Kevorkian where are you?\n \n There&#8217;s nothing wrong (imho) with going on & on, ad nauseum ad infinity, if the aim is problem solving & delving into creative & critical thoughtviews leading to solutions but when they lead nowhere? Their aim seems to be inertia.\n \n Who benefits?\n \n \nI think it was Ben Franklin who said:\n Vision without implementation is hallucination.\n\n \n People often have long & inspiring discussions about all kinds of Art, Music, Literature, Sciences et cetera. Where the aim is NOT to destroy life but to share opinions, thoughtviews, frameworks about this life. These discussions tend to inspire new, original, creative thoughtviews rather than anaesthetize the minds from thinking further. \n \n & when the aim, intention or implication is a birth or moving forward of ideas? Progress vs. inertia? Action or behavioral change seems necessary to achieve goals or objectives leading toward progress. \n \n Back on this topic: \n \n When it comes to these kindsof questions (& more) I tend to favor the Evolutionary Psychology framework. Darwin hinted at further  implications:\n \n \nIn the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.\n -Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, 1859\n\n \n Evolutionary Psychology in a nut shell: \n [*]Human beings (including & especially the human mind) are still evolving.[*]Evolution (of all life forms) takes a long time.If you can give these premises a shot?\n \n There are many books & some of my favorites are by Stephen Pinker. If anyone is interested, the following is an interview with Eric M. Gander, author of On Our Minds: How Evolutionary Psychology is Reshaping the Nature versus Nurture Debate.\n \n Eric Gander Interview - The Department of Communication Studies - Weissman School of Arts and Sciences - Baruch College\n \n The interview is a good introduction, the book is better, reading further is best! (sorry for all the enthusiasm but I'm sincerely hooked!) :( :) \n \n \nSomeone said this either here itt or in another related one:\n First, by declaring that free will is an illusion, we are admitting that we don't know enough about free will to make a conclusion about it, but are doing so anyway. \n\n \n I agree. & one can say the same thing about so many things in this life. We can admit we don&#8217;t know enough about (fill in the blanks here) to come to a conclusion. \n \n I agree the focus is on learning more about (fill in the blanks here) through the tools available.\n \n The Discordians say something like, \"A conclusion is when you have stopped thinking.\"\n \n Why stop thinking?\n \n I believe there's more flexibility in our minds & thought processes than ever before in human history.",

It doesn't even know what \"best\" is.\n \n A brain that operated as you describe it - dedicating huge resources to trivial problems in order to consider every possibility before acting would be malfunctioning, there may well be some kind of mental disorder involving a process much like that.\n\n But don't we do that sometimes? Don't we consciously simulate possible outcomes, write down proposed plans, deliberate actions, collaborate with others and dedicate huge mental resources before taking action? Perhaps not on what you consider trivial problems (which is relative), but we do it on a regular basis. All of this premeditation, according to a determinist, is the brain tricking us into thinking that we are thinking. As for trivial problems, such as making a sandwich or tying your shoes, was at one point a major task, requiring your undivided attention and mental faculties. They are trivial problems now because we've overcome them so often that we can perform the actions subconsciously while putting our attention to something else. There is no need for deliberation to perform an action we're accustomed to, unless something in the brain stops us from memorizing or subconsciously processing it, and makes it seem as if we're doing it for the first time, which would be a brain malfunction.",

   "I keep coming back to the \"near-infinite pachinko game\" theory.\n \n (For those of you who don't remember or weren't alive at the height of its popularity, pachinko is a non-electronic Japanese arcade game that had a brief fad here during the 80s: you flip two levers on each side of an upright machine, sending hundreds of tiny balls bouncing around a sort of vertical, pinball like board, but without the strategizing of the pinball single-ball flippers. Some bb's bounce into holes that have scores, most end up in columns at the bottom that resemble statistical bell-curve graphs. I don't recall any prize/replay being given for a high score. The main appeal seemed to be some sort of pleasure in watching hundreds of bb's bounce rapidly off posts and each other like Tokyo commuters at rush hour, until all the balls have been flicked and the noisy chaos settles down into a kind of inertia.)\n \n Assuming the Big Bang theory to be the correct model: everything goes blooey, atoms bounce off other atoms, causing further reactions, molecules form, elements come into existence, stars, planets, galaxies congeal as a result. Ultimately life forms evolve as a result of that, eventually what we perceive as consciousness (and eventually the very concept of \"choice,\" which has not been part of this enormously complex equation till now) develops on some worlds, these conscious life forms are influenced by everything else going on, including the actions of other life-forms as well as random non-biologic occurences, etc., etc., etc., etc.... till we wind up where we are today.\n \n \"Determinism\"? \"Free will\"? I think the problem here is primarily one of categorization, which is something we (relatively) developed homo sapiens seem to feel the need to do, because those trillions of cosmic pachinko balls happened to fall into those trillions of holes billions of years ago and \"determined\" we should do so. And that these names, these concepts, are--when it gets down to it--ultimately meaningless.\n \n As I said before, it's fascinating to consider and part of our evolution that we should do so for whatever \"purpose\"--another term I consider basically meaningless in this context. But my personal attitude, having to cope with daily realities in an increasingly stressful external environment... in the words of James Thurber: \"I say it's spinach, and I say the hell with it!\"\n\n We may have to agree to disagree on this one. What we define the mechanism that animates us as is utterly significant. There would be an enormous impact if the population at large were led to believe that deterministic forces beyond their control, and not their own consvious choice, make them do all the actions they do. Nothing but their nature compelling them to do whatever they did. For years gays have been searching for evidence to support the idea that their behavior is a result of forces beyond their control. If behavior is a result of nature rather than choice, then there is no need to justify or rationalize one's actions, and one cannot be held responsible for their actions. \n \n The deterministic view, that we cannot will ourselves to act or choose, has no evidence to support it except the argument that free will requires a soul of some sort, which cannot exist. The rest of the argument is structured on this foundation. Whilst there is no evidence that our actions are predetermined and plenty evidence that we consciously decide our actions, determinists are still bent on proving that their view is right. \n \n Frankly, I don't want to live in a world where people feel that they aren't responsible for the choices they make.",

Someone determind by their own beliefs and desires is much more free than some kind of schizophrenic individual who behaves without cause.\n\n So why assume that if our will is not predetermined then it must be random? I see a third option. Our will is developed by our choices. The will, like any other intellectual faculty, can be developed in the same manner that we develop our bodies: through practice and exercise. When you learn something, it affects multiple aspects of your mindset. The formation of a habit almost always begins with conscious effort. Your behavior is mainly a sum of your habits and your beliefs, both of which we can be changed. \n \n Have you ever considered how vegetarians can literally become physically sick (goose bumps, throwing up, tearing) from eating meat, the smell of meat, and sometimes just the thought of eating meat. How is that possible? Is vegetarianism genetic? A product of one's environment? A random anomaly? Or is it a result of a person's conscious decision to refuse to eat meat? I have never seen a study that links this preference to any predefined factors. So how do we explain this phenomenon?",

   "If we are operating with an infinitely complex script, the only way we could actually make a decision in a finite period of time is if our brains can process with infinte speed. In reality, the scripts must be finite, because the info the scripts are built with is finite, and so is our brain power. \n \n The other thing we have to bear in mind is that both the script and the processor are dynamic. The script modifies the processor by increasing its decision-making experience and the script is modified when we input new external data or make bad decisions. \n \n So our compatibilist model ends up being a very complex computer system, akin to self-sustaining artificial intelligence, that operates automatically through dynamic adjustments. With this model, the question of \"magic soul\" is somewhat taken care of: we can function without it. However, we really don't have any \"control\" over our actions, our \"script\" is a product of external data inputs and operations of the script itself, and possibly of our genetic \"bios\". \n \n The other thing about this model is that it doesn't explain why we possess consciousness. Being aware of ourselves acting according to an internal complex system that is out of our direct control seems pointless. We could be not aware of our actions and operate in exactly the same manner. The only workaround I can think of is that \"consciousness is also an illusion\" in that what we call \"consciousness\" is just the sum of the mental faculties of memory, creativity, emotions, etc that are necessary operations in the overall scheme of our functionality. We appear to have awareness of self, but this \"awareness\" may just be a by-product of these other dynamic functions. I don't know,the thesis needs a bit more work I think. \n \n Finally, this model ignores the evidence of free will itself, as a separate function of our identity, and independent of the operations of data and processes. We have the ability to make long term decisions based on imagined realities not sourced from the environment or current event. We don't have to wait for an event to trigger a decision. We can recall memories at will with no external prompting. We can act contrary to what would be the common or default response to a situation, or ignore the situation entirely. There is a lot of evidence that suggests that we do not abide by a input-process-output\" rule, and the compatibilist, or any other deterministic-based model, does not address that. \n \n By the way, what I described here isn't what any other compatibilist definition describes it as. I'm not even sure if it is the same thing. And I'm not sure if, as compatibilists (symbiote and mrwritela), this is also how you see it. \n \n If, under the compatibilists view, there is no difference between determinism and free will, then I can understand why mrwritela sould say it doesn't matter what label we give it.
