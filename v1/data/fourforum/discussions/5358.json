I suggest leaving the 20% cash and restructuring the legacy portion as a note equal to your salary for 10-years to be serviced at by minimum 25% of annual pre-tax operating income before extraordinary expenses (the debt service will lower his tax exposure). Three years is normal, five at the outside.

Good luck.\n Dono\n\n \n Oddly enough, I am having similar feelings. I am selling my baby. That is part of the reason that I am willign to work with this guy some as opposed to selling cash only. first, he wants to fold his current business into mine (make it a subsidary) as opposed to doing it the other way around. Second, he is an individual, not a large corporate entity, which mens he actually cares about the business. I also know he will be good to my employees. \n \n not going to let the effect the bottom line, of course.\n \n \nso Daewoo, I take that as a yes.

I am so burned out it is not even funny. I have been running 18 to 20 hours per day for the last 12 years and I am sick of it. I have now acquired some of the finer things in life, and enough cash to ensure I can keep acquiring them. I just want a little time to enjoy them.

He suggested a 5 year decaying payment schedule based on pre tax net. His idea is essentially 70% of pre tax net first year, 60% second year, 50% third, etc... with full auditing rights and fixed salary for himself, and prior to extraordianry operating expenses, but with an option for him to buy out of the arrangement at a pre agreed price. HE is apparently not that worried about turnign a great profit for the first few years, or at least not pocketing much profit, since his own business that he will be merging with mine is already fairly profitable. \n \n This seems attractive to me for the simple fact that I have several large, long term contracts that I KNOW will deliver more than enough in the next 5 years to make my take a substantial sum.\n \n Going to have to run this by my numbers guy to see for certain, but in a quick phone conversation he said he had some ideas on that could be positive for both parties. \n \n \n1.

   "May I ask what is your plan after?\n\n \n I already said. I am going fishing.\n \n \nLong term investment in.....?\n\n \n Too early to tell for sure. For the short term, I think liquidity is the key. Inflation is coming, there can be no mistake. the only question is are we looking at massive inflation, or hyper inflation. Current strategy involves massive liquidity (cash sitting in an offshor bank account at 12%, in a mixed basket of currencies to protect against a weakening dollar as well as maximise return). I still have maybe 20% of my investment capitol out there working (investment capitol=50% of total equity). I want to ensure that I can move quickly on anything that comes up in the next year or two.\n \n In the long run I am looking at AAA insured municipal bonds as george suggested in another thread, though I doubt I will tie a whole lot of money up in them. I like to actively manage, and I like liquidity. Personally, I like to see a slightly higher ROI than typical for that type of investment. \n \n I see a real problem currently in the US, one that we do not have financial models or past experience to really guide us through. Besides the de-industrialization of the US, we have the dollar falling off a cliff, which is leading to higher poil prices, which is leading to increased trade deficits, which is leading to a weaker dollar, which leads to higher oil prices, which leads to increased deficits, which leads to a weaker dollar........ you see the problem I am sure. There is a good article at http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P100650.asp by Jim Jubak about such a cycle.\n \n With real estate heading to the crapper (I have yet to find a pro which is not jumping ship or heading that way on the real estate market in anticipation of a bursting bubble), and increased inflaiton at both the consumer and treasury level, it just seems like a good time to be liquid and keep on the lookout. George would be the guy to glean investment tips from right now. I am playing the wait and see game.\n \n \nAs I recall one of my finance teachers has something like $10 million tied up in tax free semi annual 30 year munibonds.\n\n \n Sounds liek a waste of 10 million bucks to me, unless they have $50 million. There is just too much money out there to be made to tie up a lot of cash in low yield investments, no matter how safe.",

If he does, listen to him. \n \n My money that is currently out in equity investments is primarily in foreign stocks that pay dividends. This was a pretty decent strategy for 2004, but things may chage a bit this year. \n \n For example, I bought 10,000 shares of Bank of Montreal (BMO) last june at 53.5 canadian. Currently it is running around 56. Not a huge profit (6 percentish) BUT, the looney apprecited roughly 10% in that time against the dollar, which makes my profit 16 percentish. Additionally, BOM pays a 3% dividend, which makes that 19%. And they pay it in loonies, as opposed to dollars. You see where this is going. \n \n This year may be different (which is why I am dumping the stock) since canadians went nutso with their newly revalued loonies and screwed up their import/export numbers (using their valuable new money to buy chinese junk) which is resulting in a drop in the loonie. They are not alone. The australians and a few others did the same thing.\n \n If you would empty your freaking PM folder I would shoot you my email addy and send my latest and greatest stock picks if you are interested.

   "That is my current plan, and George may drop in and disagree. If he does, listen to him. \n \n\n \n I use the KISS formula. With the exception of some commercial real estate with long-term, government guaranteed leases, some development LLCs and a mistake, I'm liquid and short-term. I use bonds rather than money market accounts simply because yields are currently higher with almost identical accessibility. I do keep two money market accounts, one to feed our household accounts and the other to feed business accounts, all on zero balance basis. Bond redemption feeding the money market accounts as required while they feed the checking accounts and putting it in at the top. Secured construction cash flow financing is still my favorite short-term investment. One to six-month exposure, three average, with yields of 10-15%. That's hands-on stuff, but I like it because I can see economic changes coming from a long distance. I've also been fortunate in that our last residence and this one are located in very high-growth areas that attract primarily retirees and others with a few bucks and that will continue with increases when baby boomers cash it out. \n \n I left equity markets well before the dot.com crash (even a blind man could see that coming). I even paid early withdrawal tax penalties to get out of 401k participations from my days of employment, but did make one mistake by participating in a large, rollover LLC development fund about that time. The return is good, but I'm stuck in it until 1-2007 because of the 10% withdrawal rule. I don't see it going south, but would prefer to be totally liquid. Short term investing is much less taxing and, in this day and age, provides me with a better comfort level than anticipating returns from publicized economic growth that doesn't exist. I did learn my lesson and never go in on anything where I'm not at or near the top of the withdrawal list. And IMO cash, liquidity, is now king. Nothing else matters.",
