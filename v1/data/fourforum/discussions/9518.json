He was to give a speech about it, and immediatly before him was a religous wack job who was arguing that it was immoral to give because it would encourage girls to have \"sinful relations\" since the potential consequences would be decreased.\n \n So, this guy gets up there after this fire and brimstone speach from the religous nutter (and he was not just a religous person, he was a nut job) and says \"What this gentleman seems to be missing is that I do NOT think we should give HPV immunizations so young girls who choose to have sex are protected from cervical cancer. Those girls are obviously DIRTY WHORES and deserve whatever plague god chooses to visit on them! The problem is those DIRTY WHORES use the same restrooms as the good girls, and a small percentage of the good girls might get the virus from the toilet seats if they are not careful. We have to protect our daughters from these filty women. We have to protect them from the WHORES OF BABYLON and this injection is a good way to do it!\n \n I don't think there was a straight face left in the room when he was done. The religous nutter stomped out half way through. This is how we need to spin it in the religous states. Not \"protect sexually active girls from cervical cancer\". The religous right will never go for that, they would rather see them die. We need to spin it as \"protect the virtuous from the dirty whores\". THAT will sell.",

Either way, there probably is a good reason to have easily transmitted diseases vaccinated as you don't want people in your school all getting TB as this is a more harmful disease than cervical cancer (although cervical cancer is admittedly pretty bad). Things like a flu shot aren't required though as the flu is normally not deadly to children in school. Finally, I don't know how easy it is to spread cervical cancer at school but I doubt you can spread it by sneezing or even on the toilet very easily. Something that doesn't benefit the overall school environment should probably not be mandatory and is better off being offered for free by the school like the flu shot should be. That's just my opinion because making it mandatory is too big of a cost for not a real benefit to the school. \n \n Who is paying for all of this by the way?",

The Amish very nearly pulled that off with polio. We made a HUGE effort to wipe polio off the face of the earth and since the Amish had never really had problems with polio, they didn't get vaccinated. Years later, after we had stopped vaccinating children for polio because, we get a new patient zero for polio in the Amish community.\n \n Then, to add insult to injury, when we quarantined the Amish they complained about being discriminated against. Some XXXXXXXX there felt that their body was sovereign and they should not be forced to get vaccinated and they very nearly sparked off an epidemic that may well have killed millions. \n \n It was actually the court case following the near miss on the polio outbreak that solidified the precedent for forced vaccinations. The courts (including the supreme court) essentially ruled that while the government could not force you to be vaccinated, if you refused to be vaccinated they could prohibit you from socialization or appearing in public if you refused. The courts basically ruled (and rightly so) that refusing vaccination was analogous to refusing to keep your child home from school when they were sick. While your child has the right to attend school, they do not have the right to do so if it endangers the health and well being of their classmates, and by refusing vaccinations for common deadly diseases, people were endagering the health and well being of their fellow humans.\n \n Ultimatly the amish were given a choice....take the vaccinations or we throw you in concentration camps somewhere and you never see another human being. They chose the shots. \n \n While I would certianly agree that you have the right to decide what happens to your body, just like any other right, you may not endanger others in the practice of that right. By refusing vaccinations, you endanger others. I do not really care if somebody who refused to be vaccinated dies of some horrible disease. That is kind of the ultimate case of getting exactly what you asked for. I DO care if they pass that horrible disease onto others.",

   "Assuming that is typical, that is a mortality rate of about 38%, which is far higher than polio. \n\n If not treated the death rate is 28% and if treated early with regular pap tests it is 92% success rate (8% death rate). There are around 160 million women in the US. 80% of them will get the HPV virus with almost all of them not getting cervical cancer. So what is that, .006% or so will actualy get cervical cancer. \n \n I probably shouldn't even bring up the fact that the vaccine is not even known to prevent HPV 16 in the long term which accounts for 50% of cervical cancer case s caused by HPV. \n \n And like you said, you won't get rid of cervical cancer altogether but you will help. Evenso, the argument is that cervical cancer is not a problem...it is. The argument is on whether or not people should be required to get treatment. You have a disease that can be prevented with pap tests plus this vaccine that should be offered like the flu shot or any other shot that doesn't hurt others at a school. TB and others can easily be spread at a school which is a good reason for the school to require the treatment. There is no good reason for a school to require it in this case. You just make some people mad for religious reasons or cost reasons. Doesn't seem worth it. \n \n I really find it ironic that Jitobear who thinks \"you can't tell me what to do with my body\" support the government telling you what to do with your body... Odd.",

   "It was actually the court case following the near miss on the polio outbreak that solidified the precedent for forced vaccinations. The courts (including the supreme court) essentially ruled that while the government could not force you to be vaccinated, if you refused to be vaccinated they could prohibit you from socialization or appearing in public if you refused. The courts basically ruled (and rightly so) that refusing vaccination was analogous to refusing to keep your child home from school when they were sick. While your child has the right to attend school, they do not have the right to do so if it endangers the health and well being of their classmates, and by refusing vaccinations for common deadly diseases, people were endagering the health and well being of their fellow humans.\nYou realize this disease is not spread by going to school. This is the reason it is different from smallpox or TB or polio. Surely this difference is obviously...and comparitivly the cervical cancer virus is not even close to the harm smallpox or TB can cause.\n \n At some point you have too much cost for little benefit. I think that is reached here. Surely even you would say a vaccine to prevent a disease that 2 may get in 100yrs is not worth giving to everyone even if airborn. So what is the rate where you say the benefit is worth it?",

   "If the vaccination were as effective as ye hold that it is, I could not spread the disease to ye or anyone else enlightened enough to cow to mandatory vaccination. My being a \"XXXXXXXX\" thus endangers no one. So if you exercise your right to not be a \"XXXXXXXX\", and I indulge the \"XXXXXXXX\" angels of my nature, well, neither of us is harmed. \n \n Would you be so kind as to provide a link to the Amish Supreme Court Case in question? I do not doubt your sincerity; I simply can't find immediate reference to it. I am willing to grant for the sake of argument that the events transpired exactly as ye have related; however, 48 States have since affirmed the right of religious or philosophical objection to mandatory vaccination. \n \n The first polio \"outbreak\" in 26 years occurred in 2005 when four, count em, four Amish children contracted the non-paralytic form of polio. Four kids in Minnesota doth not an epidemic make, moreover, it certainly does not convince me of the need to conduct mass forced government medical procedures on those unwilling to participate. \n \n For all the years I have walked the earth I have not contracted polio, mumps, measles, cholera, rubella, or typhoid, be it the Mary variety or otherwise. Perhaps I am THE statistical anomaly, but that is not what concerns me. By refusing vaccination I cause ye no danger because you were clever enough to get the shot. By refusing vaccines I endanger only those like-minded individuals who have also refused. If the danger is as great as ye hold, presumably we ignorant few would have died horribly by now, starting with my Grandfather.\n \n It is curious that someone as eloquent as ye who freely quotes Sam Adams would favour government chains over individual choice, But I sincerely respect your argument and your point of view. I merely disagree with it.\n \n Respectfully,",

   "I'm not sure what the requirements are here but I think TB is actually not one of them oddly enough.\n\n \n Depends on the state. Still, I'm willing to bet money that it's more or less a standard for most. \n \n \nEither way, there probably is a good reason to have easily transmitted diseases vaccinated as you don't want people in your school all getting TB as this is a more harmful disease than cervical cancer (although cervical cancer is admittedly pretty bad).\n\n \n True. But there's the side that the cost of treating TB is chump compared to the cost of treating cervical cancer. Few people in the US (mostly homeless) die from TB, cervical cancer on the other hand....\n \n \nThings like a flu shot aren't required though as the flu is normally not deadly to children in school. Finally, I don't know how easy it is to spread cervical cancer at school but I doubt you can spread it by sneezing or even on the toilet very easily.\n\n \n Perhaps, but we have to think about the decreasing age of sexual activity. Highschools are some of the breeding grounds for this, even if they aren't the actual places of disease transfer. \n \n \nWho is paying for all of this by the way?\n\n \n Good question. Rather good question seeing how the primary push for this in Texas was by a pharm company who had strong ties to the Governor. Most likely suspect: taxpayers.",

   "Considering the fact that we cannot in any way guarantee that these vaccinations will eradicate the virus I think it's completely over the top to force people to be vaccinated.\n \n Throughout the whole of human history there is only one known case where mankind has completely wiped out a virus (smallpox), but that was only possible because unlike HPV there were no symptomless carriers of the virus.\n \n Forcing Amercan kids to be vaccinated will do nothing with regards to eradication of the disease. I mean, even if you managed to vaccinate literally every American, what about the 500.000 illegal aliens that come to the US each year (or the 6 billion people that live outside the US)?\n \n To eradicate a virus completely, the following criteria must be met:\n \n 1. No other carriers of the virus apart from humans\n 2. Tried and tested vaccine (not the case with the HPV vaccine since the FDA will approve just about anything these days)\n 3. Carriers of the virus always have symptoms (so that way carriers can be quickly and easily indentified)\n \n When it comes to HPV, criteria #3 has not been met, so you'll never know for sure if someone has the virus or not and this makes it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to eradicate the virus completely.\n \n Also, at the risk of sounding callous, we are talking about a disease here that \"only\" claims 4000 people per year in the US. Compare that to the 17000 that die of AIDS.\n Are these 4000 deaths worth taking away everybodies liberty and basic human rights?",

   "Sorry to resurrect this topic, however, I'd like to add something to the general debate:\n \n I know a little bit about vaccines, I did some translating on the topic once, and I still remember much of it.\n \n Different vaccines for different diseases vary greatly both in efficiency and in the side effects that they may cause. Some vaccines may only offer protection in 50% of cases (thus only administered in areas where risks are high), while some (the mandatory ones, mostly) reach effectiveness of 99%.\n \n Also, ALL vaccines have a chance of causing side effects. The listings usually went from 1/10 suffering from redness near the injection spot, with the area being sensitive, to even 1 in a million fatalities.\n \n Vaccines are not completely safe. They never will be. Also, the quality of the vaccine matters.\n \n \n HOWEVER, I still support mandatory vaccination. The diseases against which the vaccinations protect also have rare complications, which more than make up for the vaccine side effects.",
