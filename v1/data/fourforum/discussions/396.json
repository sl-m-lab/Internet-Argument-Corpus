Now they are talking with Mugabe about how to avert the disaster. What a joke!\n \n They impede or war in Iraq, claiming diplomacy and inspections are the only answer. At the same time, they refuse to discuss the North Korea's brazen moves.\n \n U.N. ignores more human rights abuses. This time in Iran.\n \n U.N. takes over in East Timor, and then drops the ball leading to further violence and anarchy.\n \n Remember those Buddist statues in Afghanistan that the Taliban destroyed? Well, you guessed it. The U.N. failed to save them.\n \n The U.N. fails to protect those displaced by a civil war in Angola.\n \n That's right. The U.N. failed in Kashmir, too.\n \n The U.N. failed in Somalia.\n \n The U.N. failed in Bosnia.\n \n The U.N. failed in Israel.\n \n The U.N. failed in Columbia.\n \n The U. N. failed in Iraq.\n \n Bottom line, the U.N. is a failure, and it is time to dissolve that money sucking waste of time and energy.

So although they can both agree on the future of Iraq and it would be helpful for both to work together, it will take time to iron out their previous differences. It's just a political game in my view so even if it doesn't make any sense logically, this is the way politics work.\n \n But I better add that the UN and US do have slightly different ideas on Iraq such as who should get the contracts for the country and what will be done for the past contracts with the country. Some UN nations were getting pretty rich off deals with Iraq and want their contracts to stand.\n \n I don't know what to expect with the UN now coming in and helping out in Iraq. The US still expects to keep most of the control there and will also have the most units there. I would guess that the instability will slowly tapper off but the UN alone isn't going to be the deciding factor. It has to be the people of Iraq that decide that they are ready to move forward.

Hopefully it will not end as the League of Nations did dissolving in the conflict of a world war.

I love how these things get twisted around.\n\n \n \n Considering all the people working to undermine the UN, it's amazing they've got anything done.. aid programs",

For the murder rate by the way, what is the percent?\n \n In any case... \n \n the point we have been straying from is that while america is marginally better at some areas, and other countries marginally better then america, their is nothing so radically diffrent to create such idol worship of the american flag, goverment and country. We have established (as two of my points you have proven wrong, and two proven right) america is about even with other areas of the world, as well other areas of the world have virtually the exact same legal conditions, similiar if not better people, and per captia about the same industrilization. So why are you willing to fight wars and murder people you don't know to defend a country that is simply defined by lines on a map? \n \n Besides, as I have been trying to say before we got distracted, people who preach patriotism will kill mankind. The people looking out for the best interests of their countries instead of the best interests of the human race will lead to our downfall. Patriotism is a major cause of war. Come on, you think people in Iraq don't think just like you, thinking their country is being invaded, and doing as you would, whatever it takes. My main issue is that we are taught from birth to honor our country, live their and worship its flag, for no other reason then the fact our parents let us be born in said country. To honor ones country is pointless, to love ones country is stupid, this is going to catch flack, but seriously, when we really think about it, the goverment needs us to be patriotic, they need red-blooded americans fighting in Iraqi hell-holes all day to keep the oil flowing, for no better reason then \"defend they country\". Funny how many people you can get into the patriotic catogry when you say their way of life is being threaten, when all they have to do to aviod that threat is move east or north (hell, over half of all immigration to canada comes from the states). If we weren't patriotic the whole system would fall apart, our countries would fail. I am surprised no one has ever thought about it before (and if they have, I wish I would have heard about it), but patriotism is not good, in fact it is degenerate to the evolution of mankind. Hell, nuclear winter? Bio-chemical threats? How many supporters do you think these rouge factions would have if people weren't patriotic, didn't think saudi arabi is truly going to be destroyed?\n \n P.S. Productive in what? Intellegence? Beaten by britian, Exports? Beaten by China? \n \n (All actual countries, peoples, places and events are dramitizations to prove my point, and their factuality is now stated as false, though they may coloborate to actual events, they are other debates not important to this one and therefore we shall say are examples and not true)",

The fact that we were 'touched' gives us the authority to mete out just retribution wherever it it's justified. The U.N. is a bunch of American-hating socialists (like yourself) who will NEVER be sympathetic to our needs. The organization that you are so enamored with has Libya and, I think, Syria on the Security Council? Yeah, they're a legitimate organization all right. LOL!\n In general, I do not think that the UN tries to meddle in domestic affairs of memebr nations, nor should they. The UN was designed to aid in the implementation of international policymaking. Without the UN, we loose certain tools, such as trade sanctions, that have in the past proven valuable in resolution of conflicts without having to resort to military action.\n Wrong again, fruity! The U.N. is CONSTANTLY trying to meddle in country's affairs. You better do some research in this area before you go running off at the mouth because you don't know what you're talking about. The U.N. is actively pursuing 'global gun control' (right up your alley) among other things. So, you might want to consult your U.N. representative and alert him or her to the fact that they are not following your instructions.\n If we are going to judge the efeectiveness of an organisation based on their performance in kilitary conflicts, let's take a good, hard look at the last several wars the US has fought (and please don't give me a bunch of XXXX about the difference between \"wars\" and \"police actions\").\n \n Vietnam.....Lost\n Korea......Lost\n Afghanistan......Lost\n Iraq........????? don't know yet, it's not over.\n All wrong, again. We withdrew from Vietnam because of the unwillingness of a democRATic president and democRATic controlled Congress to commit the resources to WIN that war. A nice example of why you don't allow politicians to dictate military strategy. Nixon, in spite of Congress, tried to win but in the end caved to public pressure and withdrew. It's not the kind of 'loss' that you imply. Korea? Your beloved U.N. was calling the shots there. At one point we actually had troops across the border into China. Then we fell back to what is the DMZ. Nevermind the fact that MacArthur was relieved after suggesting we drop a-bombs on several targets some of which were in China. Korea was won at one point, but your buddies in the U.N. put a stop to that. Give communism a chance was the battle cry wasn't it? Afghanistan? Funny, where's your beloved Taliban government? Iraq? Where's your boy Saddam? Is he in power? \n Now, in Afghanistan, we did manage to displace the Taliban, break up the Al-Queda units, and install a puppet government. Of course, the puppet government has turned out to be impotent, Warlords still rule the majority of the country, and there still seems to be plenty of resistance fighters running around. In the words of one Afghan guy \"I thought that when they declared that the war was over the fighting would stop\" (as quoted by Pravda). Not excactly a decisive victory. \n Is there no end to your rabid hatred of the U.S.? Displace? Then, why did you say 'lost'? Can't keep your propaganda straight? Sorry, but you are again either misinformed or a bald-faced liar. I know for a fact that Special Forces are in control and making progress everyday. Eventually, your buddy Osama will be found. Warlords don't rule the 'majority' of the country. That's just BS. Most of your claptrap is just a bunch of America-bashing garbage and is meritless.\n Even if we class Afghanistan as \"not over\", The war record of the US doesn't look that hot lately.\n\n \n Btw.. what are your buddies at the U.N. doing for Haiti?",

There was no real concept what to do with the several \"irregular\" armies and how to organize the country as a real nation. \n We still got much work to do if we don't want to betray the Afghani people again.",

   "the \"United Nations\", my thoughts\n \n 1. the UN claims \"unique legitimacy\" but when you fail repeatedly, even at acting on your own resolutions (haw many resolutions have gone un-enforced) i think it says plenty at the \"unique\" claims to be just another poseur in a crowd of losers\n \n 2. the appeal of the UN has always been the concept of \"united\". but what has become clear is that the UN is a \"collection\" of nations, not united at all! not only that, but people have misconstrued \"nations\" for \"people\". How many ethnic/peoples have gone on suffering at the hands of the governments that are recognized members of the UN? people like the copts, the romas, the kurds, the tibettans ... the list go on. As long as the UN continue to recognize and put the interests of nations over people, it will never attain any \"moral legitimacy\" to be better than anyone nation in particular. an organization that supports regimes like NK, Myanmar, or any other \"recognized\"/\"legitimate\" authoritarian and oppressive regimes cannot be better than a free and open democratic nation that does the best it can for its citizens.\n \n 3. I will always support my democratically elected government, whether i agree with its policies or not, over the UN. i have no power with the UN and the UN is never accountable to me. I have the power of vote, dissent and legal recourse with my own government, and my government is accountable to me as a citizen.\n \n 4. the humanitarian works of the UN is great and all but can be duplicated and probably carried out much better by most other aid organization. the UN is but just one of many such programs and is not indispensible. not only that, on any scrutiny the UN aid program has its own political agenda and its success rate (at least with funding spent) is spotty at best.\n \n 5. the UN should be revised but as is, i believe a huge and dissappointing failure.",

   "Most ofd the point broughts up by the rabid UN-haters are not valid or ignreo some facts.\n \n Why did the UN fail? Because in most cases some nation let the UN down with a crucial contribution causing other nations willing ti help leave the cause as well.\n \n Why is the UN powerless? Because it was never designed to be powerful and because it was abused by certain nations (I'm looking at the US and the former Soviet Union) during the cold war to be a forum for their petty political/ ideologoical conflict.\n \n Why is the UN helpless? Because not enough nations are willing to support the UN - whatever comes. Most of them decide to chicken out. The UN has the goal to end conflicts PEACEFULLY and not in a flag-waving \"Bring them on!\"-fashion. Are you willing to send your troops to fight for a cause which does not serve you?\n \n And where's the UN's even longer list of success? UN aid programms improved AND saved the lifes of billions, has eradicated several diseases from the world, provided food and shelter for refugees, long term programms will ensure better lives for lots of people - especially in the third world - UN environmetnal protection plans have the potential to ensure a safe and clean world for generations to come.\n \n Everyone who argues the UN is a failure is simply wrong - the only failure is, that the UN cannot force natzions to provide the means and the money the UN needs. The UN has been let down countless times by member nations and without their aid the UN CANNOT act. \n \n The UN works on the basis of consensus - some of you (especially the ones who don't come from a one-party nation) might have a idea how long it can take for a consensus between political parties in ONE nation. and now think of it on global levels - you shouldn't be suprised the UN takes a lot of time to do anything, because all the nations taking part need to organize their own affairs BEFORE they can do anything. Just take a look how long NATO needed to agree on some minor issues...\n \n The UN also needs to be the pinnacle of patience on all issues, enforcing a resolution by force has to be the very last resort and NOT a ad-hoc option just because some guy who needs a re-election badly wants the UN to authorize anything he wants to do... \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n The UN is not about \"force it down their throats\" - the UN is about \"We'd like you to, please...\".

   "More America-bashing? What a surprise! You liberals are so predictable. Do continue with your unsubstantiated hyperbole and conjecture\n\n \n You are right. What could be more liberal than wanting lower taxes, a smaller government, and more freedoms. The founding fathers would definatly roll over in their graves if they knew that there were Americans out there who want a small government without overly restrictive laws. They would also be outraged that I want lower taxes (keeping in mind that these are the same folks that sparked a revolution over a 3% tax increase).\n \n \nOf course, a socialist like yourself would praise the U.N. The fact that we were 'touched' gives us the authority to mete out just retribution wherever it it's justified. The U.N. is a bunch of American-hating socialists (like yourself) who will NEVER be sympathetic to our needs. The organization that you are so enamored with has Libya and, I think, Syria on the Security Council? Yeah, they're a legitimate organization all right. LOL!\n\n \n First, if you are gong to be outraged, know what you are outraged about. Libya and Syria are neither one on the security council. THe security council is composed of 5 permanent mebers and 10 elected. Currently, the elected nations are Chile, GErmany, Pakistan, Phillipines, Romania, Spain, Algeria, Angola, Benin and Brazil. The pemanent mebers are China, France, Russian Federation, United Kindom, and the United States\n \n Is it really that much to ask that you do just the tiniest bit of research? I am not saying you need to read a book, or subscribe to some periodicals, just watching the news would go a long ways, or you obviously have internet access (unforunate as that may be), look some stuff up. try www.google.com you will be suprised what kidn of stuff you can find on the internet! The UN even has a web page where you can look up who is on the security council. pretty nifty. They also have a newsletter you can subscribe to, which lists things like this.\n \n As far as my statement, maybe you are right, maybe we shouldn't try to maintain an international body to address grievances with other nations. Instead, we can just start blasting away at whatever country we have a problem with. Of course, the cost in lives and dollars will be enormous, but you don't mind paying more taxes or re-instituting the draft, right? We don't need no stinkin allies!\n \n \nWrong again, fruity! The U.N. is CONSTANTLY trying to meddle in country's affairs. You better do some research in this area before you go running off at the mouth because you don't know what you're talking about. The U.N. is actively pursuing 'global gun control' (right up your alley) among other things. So, you might want to consult your U.N. representative and alert him or her to the fact that they are not following your instructions.\n\n \n Your ignorance flag is flying again. The UN has had several confrences regarding the TRAFFICKING of weapons and pursued interantional treaties that would help regulate the rafficing of weapons between nations. There have been a couple of times that domestic gun control has come up. At no time was it ever suggested that domestic gun control fell within the powers of the UN. Lots of things come up at the UN. All it takes is a memo from amember nation to go around the general assembely and there can be a discussion on almost any issue. The UN has also discussed the existance of extra terrestrials. That does not mean that they trying to ban them. \n \n In order to meddle in the internal affairs of a country, a motion has to introduced to do so. The motion is voted upon, then sent (if sucessful) to the appropriate comittee, which will design a course of action they deem appropriate. In some cases, it has to go back to the general assembly to be voted on again, sometimes not. The point is, the UN has no power on its own. It is through a democratic process that ideas and proposals are presented. THe UN is like the US government. They only have one agenda. In the case of the US government, it is to represent and protect the interests of the American people. In the case of the UN, it is to facilitate communication between nations. Of course, in both cases there is a buch of XXXX going on over on the sidelines, but the single, primary agenda is unchaging.\n \n This is all available on their web page, and I would suggest that YOU do some research before spouting off. I will class this with Libya and Syria on the security council, as an example of your meticulous research and deep understanding of current global affairs.\n \n \nAll wrong, again. We withdrew from Vietnam because of the unwillingness of a democRATic president and democRATic controlled Congress to commit the resources to WIN that war. A nice example of why you don't allow politicians to dictate military strategy. Nixon, in spite of Congress, tried to win but in the end caved to public pressure and withdrew. It's not the kind of 'loss' that you imply. Korea? Your beloved U.N. was calling the shots there. At one point we actually had troops across the border into China.

Where's your boy Saddam? Is he in power? \n \n \n Withdrew fom Vietnam without accomplishing the objectives we set forth. Ok, I guess that's not a loss if you say so. In korea, we never had the war won. We had a spearhead into north korea and china. This is vastly different than having control of the entire country. In Afghanistan, the taliban is apparently hiding in the mountains and organizing attacks, if the pentagon is to be believed. If the CIAs estimates as far as how much of the country they control are correct, they are calling the shots in a much greater area of the country than we are.\n \n \nIs there no end to your rabid hatred of the U.S.? Displace? Then, why did you say 'lost'? Can't keep your propaganda straight? Sorry, but you are again either misinformed or a bald-faced liar. I know for a fact that Special Forces are in control and making progress everyday. Eventually, your buddy Osama will be found. Warlords don't rule the 'majority' of the country. That's just BS. Most of your claptrap is just a bunch of America-bashing garbage and is meritless.\n\n \n \n Cite a source. I would assume that you have gotten your information on this the same place you get your information on other current events, that is, you make it up as you go. Most of my statements can be backed up, sourced, and footnoted. I have yet to see you cite a verifiable source, provide a single shred of rational or anecdotal evidence, or point towards anything that would back up your postion on this or any other thread.\n \n YOU are one of the fascists I warn about. You view people who see the United states as anything but an untarnished jewel as \"anti american\". You are unable to view the actions of the United States government with anything but love and adoration. You are unable to examine the actions of our country with a critical eye. People make mistakes, the difference between a free man and a mindless drone is the ability to see those mistakes for what they are. \n \n The fact that America has made mistakes in the past does not mean that it is a bad or evil country. It simply means that it is run by PEOPLE, who can be expected to make mistakes from time to time. The fact that there is an expanding population of fascist out there (like you) who are unable to see the mistakes, and unwilling to hold our leadership accountable for those mistakes, is the greatest danger to the cause of freedom that America has ever faced.",

The issue of how it cannot be representative because of some of its memebers is INDEED relevant. You may have bought into the whole \"lets include everyone\" scheme but within the U.N. that was to be a selective thing and rigthly so. The U.N. created by U.S. and Britian was to be an organization run and supported by governments \"not hostile\" to democracies and seeking an end to all wars and developing a greater understanding between peoples. Saying that Syria and Libya aren't permanent members of the Security Council and that its okay is a fallacy. They are nations that support terrorists, harbor terrorists, are not democracy friendly, and often have glaring human rights violations. Should this disqualify them from entry into the U.N.. YES! Why? Because it was understood from the agencies inception that only governments dedicated to democracy should have a voice in U.N. matters. Unfortunately years of compromise have rendered this decision inert and now we have these petty dictatorships from all over the planet becoming vocal opponents to peace and democracy from within the U.N. itself like a metastasesizing (sp?) tumor.  \n \n All this gives me the impression, that no authority should have the right to control or \"advise\" other countries.\n So why are you in favor of a world-wide US domination? Isn't it possible that some 3. world country thinks \"I don't want America to decide, I won't listen to them. And I need WMD because of XYZ.\"\n What would be your agument against such a behaviour?\n \n I wouldn't say that no authority should be in control but I do think it should be one that consistantly more dedicated to peace and democracy then the U.N. and definately uncompromising in these respects. I also think it needs to be self supporting in a fashion. This does not mean I am in favor of U.S. dominating the world but I wonder is it really that way or is it that the U.S. feels it should uphold the concepts of the U.N. on its own regardless of the U.N.'s intransigence. I think it is just that ideal that makes the U.S. strike out on what alot of people are calling \"unilateralism\". The example you gave was exactly what happend and while I would have loved the U.N. to show a little spine and send peacekeepers to Iraq to yank Saddam, I knew it would never happen that way and I am glad the U.S. and what partners it was able to get to go went. It may flaunt the system of the U.N. but I believe moraly it was the right thing to do and to me that is more legitimate than any organization making up rules and then sitting back and not enforcing them. Ligitamacy comes from the legal and moral foundation for action of which the end result is usually with the people, the ones fighting oppression. It may sound like vigilanteism but for some, it was time to act, Lord knows Saddam got away with it long enough. And for those saying \"yeah, and the U.S. let Saddam get away with it for a time.\" You are right, but how does that absolve the U.N. from not rising to the cause to help Iraq? The U.S.' behavior doesn't justify anyone elses and the U.N. could have taken the moral and legal action against us and personally helped Iraq but they didn't now did they? Which of course is unexcuseable.\n \n See the problem that many people have with the current US administration? It only respects international laws and organizations when it it helpful. Otherwise they are in the way and have to be ignored.\n \n I think that is a cynical and simplistic P.O.V. Every instance of the U.S. \"disrespecting\" international law has a parallel to the U.S. being justified in taking action. Iraq is the greatest example: Most people opposed to the war have been beating the legality and legitimacy of it based on Geneva conventions and U.N. law, however the case can be made that based on Saddam's breach of 17 U.N. Security Council resolutions and the inherent right of self-defense, which is embraced in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, Operation Iraqi Freedom was legal given the operations moral imperitive. Not even Hans Blix can refute this ideal of course that won't stop him from scoffing, the man has visions of Nobel you know. There are many nations other than the U.S. that are guilty of this and most do it for their own personal gain. Its seems like its only worth mentioning when the U.S. does it, as if other nations don't have to be held accountable, perhaps a double standard? Only Superpowers get scolded for disagreeing with international law? So were practically back to square one becuase when you involve the U.N. on the expectation they will right the wrong and use every ounce of their charter to make the \"rogue\" adhere to the rules of international law, what do they do? They drop the ball. Take a look at what is going on in North Korea or better yet; Hathi. Now that Hathi has exploded in a violent revolution, what are they doing to stop and soothe the damaged egos there, oh and didn't they see this coming? Why not, they were there when Aristide was stuffing the ballot box and they didn't see fit to exercise international law then? The U.S. has had many a disagreement with alot of International Law through the U.N. because it violates the Constitution and peoples rights in the U.S. and alot of other nations do not care or are beligerently happy to try to ruin or damage the concepts guaranteed to U.S. citizens. This is why you have the U.N. human rights council trying to punish every state in the US for Capitol punishment. So what if its not accepted nationwide. There are many times the U.S. has tried to work with the U.N. on certain legal issues and of course every country has the right to ingore or ratify U.N. treaties, the current U.S. admin not withstanding you might want to level some of the blame at Congress, after all they are the ones who decide weather or not the Pres ratifies any treaties. I think merely saying we don't cooperate and then walking away is a cop out. Most people who make that claim never consider the process of international law and brinksmanship they just claim these things out of hand.\n \n And to the Afghanistan war:\n It isn't over yet. But there is little success in it until now. Kabul is more or less secure, and imprtant and large parts of the country are still in the hands of warlords. And among those are guys like Dostum and Khan, who are as much as a manslaughter for the people there as the Taliban were.\n Imo the war on Afghanistan was poorly planned (maybe not the fighting itself, but a war isn't over as soon as the last bullet gets fired). There was no real concept what to do with the several \"irregular\" armies and how to organize the country as a real nation. \n We still got much work to do if we don't want to betray the Afghani people again.\n\n \n \n I'm not worried about us \"betraying\" the Afghani's as much as I am afraid of them betraying themselves. The thing about Iraq is that we have alot of the people wanting to fight for their country and help it stay a democracy. This is not overwhelmingly the case in Afghanistan. Alot of the freedom fighters on our side their are dwindling and wearing out.",

   "Most ofd the point broughts up by the rabid UN-haters are not valid or ignreo some facts.\n\n \n Okay, but so do alot of people supporting the U.N. such as yourself Dwight.\n \n \nWhy did the UN fail? Because in most cases some nation let the UN down with a crucial contribution causing other nations willing ti help leave the cause as well.\n\n \n WRONG! This is a common fallacy that a domino effect of disenters is leaving the U.N. unable to function. False. How so? Nations let the U.N. down all the time, they still manage to get monies for their causes. The reason why the U.N. fails is because it has allowed to many \"divergent\" viewpoints to hold sway in important councils. The U.N. was created by and for countries dedicated to democracy and who were interested in using their like mindedness of government to foster a bastion of peace willing to fight those against democratic ideals. Well those ideals have fallen by the wayside because of personal greed and compromise within the U.N.. This has however created a dichotomy of unparalleled proportions within the U.N. as Nations ruled by extremists vie to have their ideals placed above the ideals set forth by the original charter of the U.N.. Example, years ago (more than 20) the U.N. couldn't agree whether the massacre of Israeli atheletes at the 1972 olympics in Munich was an act of terrorism. The issue still exists today with Islamist members of the U.N. holding up the General Assembly on treaties until language is added to differentiate \"bad\" terrorism from \"good\". The \"good\" terrorism of course being the type directed at Jews and the \"bad\" being anyone who retaliates (especially the the jews) against those that have committed the \"good\" terrorism. You read it right, the Orginization of Islamic States is offended that the language of the treaty objects to all terrorism. So there you have it. The U.N. gets hamstrung all the time by nations with divergent views but especially these undemocratic theocracies which should have never been allowed within the U.N. body and were specificly forbade by its charter.\n \n \nWhy is the UN powerless? Because it was never designed to be powerful and because it was abused by certain nations (I'm looking at the US and the former Soviet Union) during the cold war to be a forum for their petty political/ ideologoical conflict.\n\n \n WRONG! The U.N. was indeed designed to be powerful but you are kinda right about it being abused by certain nations. The Soviets in particular did their best to drag communisim into the body kicking and screaming. In the 70s they enabled Communist China to usurp the seat on the council that was once occupied by democracy friendly Taiwan. An act illegal according to its own charter and death knell of the cause for Ayn Rand. Then you have the addition of the Organized Islamist States which should have never been added due to their democracy hostile ideologies and human rights issues. Any petty political infighting during the Cold War days would give way to the petty idelogical conflict of the Islamists and their need to foment hate for Israel and democracy within the U.N. a place not sanctioned for their ilk. You can blame the U.S. for any cold war arguements if you want, but I think you know how futile that is, considering during the cold war it was USA or the RED Way and nobody wanted to be part of the Red Star. Even France and England quit their bitching about Regan era cold war maneuvers once they realized we were really on the same side. They just didn't like us the Americans being the ones to tell them it was right. Afterall we were the younger nation, why should we get any play in geopolitics. Because they abdicated it and they can hate us for it but we put steel in their spine when they were about to fall and they came out better than Mother Russia along with the U.S. as reward. A fact that kills them to this day. That is why they joined with the U.S. in the U.N.. Good thing too, because pride goeth before the fall. Its the lack of purpose in promoting democracy that is robbing the agency of its power, not the U.S. \n \n \nWhy is the UN helpless? Because not enough nations are willing to support the UN - whatever comes. Most of them decide to chicken out. The UN has the goal to end conflicts PEACEFULLY and not in a flag-waving \"Bring them on!\"-fashion. Are you willing to send your troops to fight for a cause which does not serve you?\n\n \n FALSE! The U.N. was created to promote democracy and end all war with or without force. Why do you think the peacekeepers exist. Because even though they agency wants to promote peace they aren't naive enough believe that peace may not have to be secured with the barrel of a gun. Hitler and WWII taught them that much. The U.N. is helpless because it allows themselves to be. By accepting nations that do not share in the ideals of the charter, for democracy and peace they have hamstrung themselves. They think they are wise giving all these nations a forum to come and be one with the civilized world. WRONG, they only gave those with dangerous ambition and toxic theocracy the power they should have never been given until they cast off the idealogy of hate and totalitarianism. So where you are worried over nothing about \"flag waving and Bring them on!\" you have ignored those that wave another flag and yell words like Jihad or that think there is both good and bad terrorism.\n \n \nAnd where's the UN's even longer list of success? UN aid programms improved AND saved the lifes of billions, has eradicated several diseases from the world, provided food and shelter for refugees, long term programms will ensure better lives for lots of people - especially in the third world - UN environmetnal protection plans have the potential to ensure a safe and clean world for generations to come.\n\n \n Oh please, interventions from other organizations have been better at supporting other nations with food and disease issues. Its not like the U.N. is the only one and in certain cases which you probably don't know about because you sound like a blind follower of the U.N. and not one to really immerse yourself in its history, they have made matters worse. The current AIDs crisis is part their doing, all the years they kept infected mothers in third world countries from using formula and forced them to breast feed. Yeah, they hushed that up real good. Oh and enviromental protection. Well Kyotos a sham kiddo. All the data they said the scientists agreed on, well they lied. The consensus on how to fix the problems with the enviroment are still \"up in the air\" no pun intended and bascially all the treaty does is try to force a bunch of nations into paying millions to the UN for false assurances on how to fix the enviroment while making some of these treaty nations pay for third world countries who are just sooooo poor they don't have to bear any responsibilities for their pollution. Oh and if you are one of the lucky nations like Australia or New Zealand then you get pollute more to make up for certain countries polluting less. Makes sense huh? Yeah, well thats the logic of the U.N. make the wealthy give all their money to the poor and then let far away countries break the rules when everyone should be cutting emissions.\n \n \n \nEveryone who argues the UN is a failure is simply wrong - the only failure is, that the UN cannot force natzions to provide the means and the money the UN needs. The UN has been let down countless times by member nations and without their aid the UN CANNOT act. \n\n \n Once again false. The U.N. never had a problem raising money for ANYTHING it needed. Its always managed to fund its ventures and good thing too becasue the way they keep records I doubt those books are gonna be any help to anyone trying to find lost funds. Like I said before the U.N. failures are the result of internal politics and straying from the charter. If they adhered to the charter, they wouldn't be victims to the whims of a bunch of misintropic theologues that spend most of their time trying to sanction democracies that are friendly to Israel and indicte Ariel Sharon in the international court of Justice. And that is why they are a failure, this and the simple fact that they haven't had an Attorney General with balls enough to weed out the rif raf and get the organization back on its charter. Then perhaps people would take it seriously and support it much more lovingly.\n \n \nThe UN works on the basis of consensus - some of you (especially the ones who don't come from a one-party nation) might have a idea how long it can take for a consensus between political parties in ONE nation. and now think of it on global levels - you shouldn't be suprised the UN takes a lot of time to do anything, because all the nations taking part need to organize their own affairs BEFORE they can do anything. Just take a look how long NATO needed to agree on some minor issues...\n\n \n Well you started out great but then you once again got on the whole \"blame the USA\" jag. You are right, the U.N. tries to work on a consensual basis the only problem is you are blaming time for the disconnects within the U.N. when it is the consensus itself that is the error. Simply put, you got the wrong people in the consensus. Knock out all the nations that are hostile to democracy and the U.S. and peace and then take out all the nations that are not hostile to democracy but are not democracies themselves and then what you have left is your new consensus. Let only those dedicated to democratic ideals hold sway and have a voice in U.N. councils then you'll see some progress. \n \n \nThe UN also needs to be the pinnacle of patience on all issues, enforcing a resolution by force has to be the very last resort and NOT a ad-hoc option just because some guy who needs a re-election badly wants the UN to authorize anything he wants to do... \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n Well that is a pretty cynical arguement and I don't by it. Why? Because once again those that keep bashing Bush for doing the job the U.N. didn't are ignoring the moral imperative once again which has led to this long drawn out process. Everyone knew how bad Saddam was, now sure the U.S., Britian and France and others used to be allied with him and we looked the other way at his indescretions. Well the U.N. could have said something about that and they didn't. Then when we saw the mistake we made an cut out on Saddam and he became genocidal the U.N. sat there like the Roman senate in the colliseum and gave a thumbs down blessing for us to spank him on behalf of Kuwait, when they should have joined us and been on the scene to yank Saddam into one of their brilliant and crafty \"Tribunals\". So once again they put their seal of \"okay\" on us bombing Saddam and with a few sanctions that really only hurt the citizens of Iraq, basically ignoring all the **** he was doing during the entire Clinton era, up until Bush finally says lets deal with him and stop pretending all these years of sanctions and \"coffee talk\" are actuallly making a difference, so they come up with all these resolutions and then do absolutely nothing once again and Saddam thinks he's gonna get away with it. Wrong. So if you want to have that attitude about Bush go ahead you still cannot explain the reason why the U.N. let the people Iraq get screwed for so long when the U.S. and other nations wanted something final and powerful done. The moral imperative was there, its not our fault the U.N. ignored it once again and I think they are paying for it right now and deservedly so. If any organization would be righteous in storming another country to save it from a leader that is killing them it would be the U.N.. It has the military might and could build a financial nest egg for rebuilding a nation faster than any single nation could. But they dropped the ball. They got disenterested in doing what is right and they left it once again to history and they didn't count on Bush calling their bluff. Now they appear irrelevant and justly so, as who would follow a politically corrupt organization unable to manage itself fully in a multinational forum and they are champing at the bit to get into Iraq and declare themselves worthwhile but people aren't easily fooled anymore. They know the U.N. screwed them, they aren't just going to wave them in to Iraq without the U.S. being there to make sure this organization can be trusted. Its the U.N.s own fault.\n \n \nThe UN is not about \"force it down their throats\" - the UN is about \"We'd like you to, please...\". Maybe the so called western civilized world should be a good example and actually support the UN and NOT abuse it?\n \n - Dwight\n\n \n The U.N. used to be about \"Lets rise not just to the challenge of peace but the challenge of fighting evil.\" Then they started compromising the charter and allowing a bunch of malcontent idealogues from the East in and the entire thing went to hell in a furor of competing ideals. Its time the left and the idealistic anti-Bush cadre opened their eyes to the reality that being \"polically correct\" is killing the U.N.. It was never meant to be an organization where anyone with any type of ideals can join. The Charter makes it perfectly clear who the U.N. is really looking for, however when you have a Secretary General not willing to adhere to the charter for the sake of more monies then you cannot expect any type of solidarity to remain. Not to say the choices made by Ameriican leaders are always the best, but I would indeed take the choice of following my leader more serieously than the U.N. without a doubt and all politics aside. It was the U.N.s job to call out the axis of evil. It had no problem doing it way back when, and if you are truely dedicated to democracy and peace then you don't falter on that issue and you keep that strength through the times. Political correctness has no place within its walls, that is not what the organization was made for but we now see the compromise it has lain down for and its dying in the eyes of the world is its own fault, not the U.S., not Russia. Its all the U.N.s fault for compromising. It just shows when you stand for nothing you fall for anything.",

It was then formally created when the above mentioned countries ratified the charter that was a product of the various proposals, along with roughly 50 other nations. \n \n \n Not a notion, a charter and a history. The UN was devised by U.S. President Roosevelt as a means to bring 26 separate nations and their governments together to continue the fight against the Axis Powers. That was January 1st 1942 and it woud be almost 3 years before the charter and organization was ratified as you mentioned, but their is more to the history than you mentioned. Keep in mind it doesn't say in the charter anything about being dedicated to democracy, I did flourish in that respect. The language instead reads and this is from Chapter 1, Article 1 line 2 which states: \"To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;\" Sounds like promotion of Democracy to me. It was the resistance of many nations within the UN to keep Nazi and Communist Ideals from flourishing that spawned the \"cold war\" sentiment that pervaded the arena for more than 30 years. What Ideal do you think they were promoting? Not Communism thats for sure. To futher underscore my point the 26 separate nations that met in D.C. in 1942 were sworn to uphold the principles of the Atlantic Charter which as a clause states that: Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. This is a requirement of any nation wishing to enter the U.N. even to this day and how many member nations do you know really aspire to rule their lands in this manner? As well the charter stipulates it is membership is open to \"peace loving\" with entry by two thirds vote. Our current war aside how many nations involved in the U.N. are really and truely dedicated to peace? How many nations have started wars whilst having U.N. membership? The charter states those that break the rules shoud be dismissed. How many times have we seen nations break the rules and fail to be dismissed? Yeah, you could make a case of me wanting to see the U.N. change but once you examine the real history and credo of the U.N. you cannot fault me for being disilllussioned. Sorry, you can't come to a barganing table of the like-minded when more than half of them really aren't.\n \n \nNow, promoting democracy and human rights is an important role for UN, but not the most important role.

One were dealing with a system of rights through governmental order. Stranger even when you consider that the U.N. isn't supposed to be a government per se and deny that they are in their own historical literature. However they are and you need to read the charter becuase its a little more involved than westphalian ideals. There is a grain of what you say in its charter but its more vague than grandiose. The agency is empowered to act on any threat to ANY member nation whose sovereignty is threatened through war by another sovereign nation or by any situations being clear indicators of Aggression. Politics amongst the permanent 5 can often be a source of inaction but that is where the Secretarry General should and most oftenly fails to act on behalf of the U.N.. In impasse type situations he can cast the deciding action on the behalf of the U.N. and this affects all councils. It doesn't give him license to ingnore the charter but he can use to affect change that would normally not happen because of political indecision and strife. You know when the last time we saw a secretary General act on behalf of the U.N. against the wishes of a member nation or decision? Only once, when the Soviets didn't want Trygve Lie to have a second term as Secretary General and they vetoed the decision. He overturned their veto giving himself the seat for another term only to resign half way through due to their continued and vocal opposition to him and the Korean War.\n \n \nI think the reason why you believe UN to be such a failiure is based on a false assumption about UN and its purpose. Now, I can understand that you want UN to be more than it is today, but it doesn`t mean that UN has failed in its current role as a promoter of international peace and stability, nor that it has failed with its role with promoting democracy and human rights with \"soft\" meassures.\n\n \n Um, No. I know the U.N. is a failure because of the history surrounding the failure of its mission, its charter and its policy which have been corrupted and ingored for decades and were talking on a level that goes beyond the petty bickering of the permanent 5. That could be essentially eliminated with a Secretary General willing to exercise constraint for the betterment of the body as a whole. Which if you take a look at the history of the U.N. has been done before by Secretary Generals that were interested in empowering the U.N. and not merely paying lip-service to its failings and shortcomings. You have yet to prove that the U.N.s purpose is consistantly being achieved, and believe we all can see that it is not. Their charter demands that they act in defense of peoples unable to defend themselves from these gross assaults and they invariably falter or fail to act in a timely fashion. Hence Rawanda, the Sudan, Iraq and I could go on, but why risk sounding redundant. Were dealing with an agency that is more worried over the legality of overthrowing a dictator that not only robbed them blind but played them like a cheap fiddle for more than a decade whilst committing gross crimes against humanity, instead of acting on the behalf of said humanity. Were talking about an agency that has the crimes of many a dictator on record and yet they manage to drag their heels through the process of trials, with lame judical standards and shadowy truths. How long has it been to try Milosevec? 3 almost 4 years? Maybe he'll get a sentence of life imprisionment on some obscure island at which point he will escape and fail to ever be recaptured like a good majority of those they convict. But even that is looking doubtfull now that the vaunted World Court has allowed him to \"talk\" his way out of his savagery. God only knows what will happen with Saddam within the U.N. justice system. Which of course is the saddest story of all because, they could have tried him 10 times over for his crimes against humanity by now and spared everyone this war we have now and for so many reasons. Lets talk enviroment. They consistantly bang the gavel at the U.S. for being a major polluter, nevermind the fact that Saddam's destruction of the marshlands and waterways in his recent wars have topped the UNESCO enviromental crimes list. What were they waiting for to react? We have a human rights commission that is constantly persecuting the U.S. over issues of slavery from past ages, Israel for actions against Palestinans and yet the machinations and attrocities from Saddam and others seem to go overlooked for years, the victims mere footnotes in a history that could have been changed with the U.N.'s intervention. What peace are we talking about here? Is that the peace that allows Cuba to sit on the human rights council when they have been killing and jailing any that fail to escape the living hell their country has become? I wasn't aware that paying lip service in councils was keeping the peace and promoting democratic ideals is promoting a sense of false equality with nations, that are nowhere near equal in their governance to say nations that don't kill or imprision their citizens in order to keep totalitarian control. If it wants to be seen as being more of a tool for peaceful means then it needs to at least look as though it capbable of more than soft means and I don't think that is unreasonable to expect either considering the amount of support and \"authority\" they wield. For far too long the U.S. has been the wallet and mercenary to the agency supporting it and acting on its behalf whenever the powers that be are too lazy to get the \"Beasts in Blue\" involved. What is their reason for all the failed diplomacy and failure to prevent a single war? Blaming it all on a handful of nations or a singular superpower is too easy, its a cop out. The agency has historically been stingy with the power it has and has done so by committee. \n Some wonderful history of the U.N. for you to ponder.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3512951.stm\n \n http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/UN/Urquhart/urqchat00.record.html\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/wm438.cfm",

   "First piece from your second link:\n \n \nOver the years there have been many failures to act which the UN should be ashamed of. For example, the complete failure to do anything about Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980. Although this was a clear case of aggression, which is precisely what the UN was set up to deal with, for their own political reasons, the five permanent members of the Security Council refused to react in any significant way. This certainly gave Saddam Hussein the impression that the Security Council was a paper tiger, and very probably encouraged him to invade Kuwait ten years later. \n\n Well, which nation did deliever weapons to Saddam and to the Mullahs as well.\n Guess that might be one reason for the \"useless UN\".\n emoticon_rolleyes",

To develop friendly relations between nations and to take appropriate meassures to strengthen universal peace is far from promoting democracy. And even if we equated \"nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples\" with \"democratic nations\", it would still only mean that friendly ralations between democratic nations should be developed and universal peace should be promoted. Not that democracy should be fought for.\n \n \n\n It was the resistance of many nations within the UN to keep Nazi and Communist Ideals from flourishing that spawned the \"cold war\" sentiment that pervaded the arena for more than 30 years. What Ideal do you think they were promoting? Not Communism thats for sure. \n\n \n \n I don`t see the connection between cold war and Nazi ideals. And I wasn`t aware of that UN was anything more than an arena (albeit with interests of its own) where individual nation-states fought one aspect of the cold war. And even though many individual players on the arena choose a side, far from all of them choose the US side.\n \n \n\n To futher underscore my point the 26 separate nations that met in D.C. in 1942 were sworn to uphold the principles of the Atlantic Charter which as a clause states that: Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. This is a requirement of any nation wishing to enter the U.N. even to this day and how many member nations do you know really aspire to rule their lands in this manner? \n\n \n \n Do you have any links to that particular requirement. I have not been able to find it. The only texts about requirments for UN membership is:\n \n \"Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.\"\n \n - Chapter 2, article 4\n \n \n \n\n As well the charter stipulates it is membership is open to \"peace loving\" with entry by two thirds vote. Our current war aside how many nations involved in the U.N. are really and truely dedicated to peace? \n\n \n \n Define dedicated to peace and please show the \"UN definition\" of dedicated to peace and then show which nations that do not apply to this definition.\n \n \n\n How many nations have started wars whilst having U.N. membership? \n\n \n \n Not that many as far as I know. \n \n \n\n The charter states those that break the rules should be dismissed. How many times have we seen nations break the rules and fail to be dismissed? \n\n \n \n No it does not, it states that state may be suspended if they break the peace:\n at the disgression of the security council \n \n \"A Member of the United Nations against which preventive or enforcement action has been taken by the Security Council may be suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The exercise of these rights and privileges may be restored by the Security Council.\"\n \n Chapter 2, article 4\n \n \n \n\n Yeah, you could make a case of me wanting to see the U.N. change but once you examine the real history and credo of the U.N. you cannot fault me for being disilllussioned. Sorry, you can't come to a barganing table of the like-minded when more than half of them really aren't. \n\n \n \n There is nothing wrong with being disillusioned. UN has not been very succesful at promoting democracy, I give you that. But I just don`t agree that democracy should be promoted at the cost of national soverignity. In fact, I fear this idea. \n \n \n\n And if you really believe that then you should ask yourself this: In the history of the U.N. who was the only country that ever asked its permission to declare war on another country? One were dealing with a system of rights through governmental order. Stranger even when you consider that the U.N. isn't supposed to be a government per se and deny that they are in their own historical literature. \n\n \n \n What do you mean by \"government\"?\n \n \nHowever they are and you need to read the charter becuase its a little more involved than westphalian ideals. There is a grain of what you say in its charter but its more vague than grandiose. The agency is empowered to act on any threat to ANY member nation whose sovereignty is threatened through war by another sovereign nation or by any situations being clear indicators of Aggression\n\n \n \n You mean like article chapter 7, article 39\n \n 39. \"The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n \n And chapter 1, article 1\n \n 1. \"To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace\"\n \n Note that it is threats of peace, breach of peace and acts of aggression (towards another soverign nation) that is the criteraia for armed intervention. \n And suppressing acts of aggression and threats of peace is as the first and firmost goal of UN\n \n And then we have article 2\n \n 1. The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. \n 2. All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter. \n 3. All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered. \n 4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. \n 5. All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action. \n 6. The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security. \n 7. Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll. \n \n Which basicly recognises the westphalian order as the framework that UN should operate within. I`m not saying that UN isn`t anything more than these principles. But UN opreates within the framework of the westpahalian principles of soverign nations. \n \n \n \nUm, No. I know the U.N. is a failure because of the history surrounding the failure of its mission, its charter and its policy which have been corrupted and ingored for decades and were talking on a level that goes beyond the petty bickering of the permanent 5. \n\n \n \n Failiure is of course a subjective term unless the criteria for failiure and succes is stated. And even then, the criterias are subjective. I have no illusion that I can change your oppinion on this matter, but I want to point out that the matter is hardly so black and white as you express it. Have there been failiures? Yes, of course. Have there been succeses? Yes, definatly. But most importantly, this is where yours and my view of UN responsibilitities matter. \n \n That could be essentially eliminated with a Secretary General willing to exercise constraint for the betterment of the body as a whole. Which if you take a look at the history of the U.N. has been done before by Secretary Generals that were interested in empowering the U.N. and not merely paying lip-service to its failings and shortcomings. \n \n \nYou have yet to prove that the U.N.s purpose is consistantly being achieved, and believe we all can see that it is not. \n\n \n \n I don`t have the ambition to do so. My stance is that the UN system might be ripe with flaws, but the base of westphalian principles (that forbids armed interventions to install democracy) is essentially something \"good\" and the UN organisation fills an important purpose.\n \n \nTheir charter demands that they act in defense of peoples unable to defend themselves from these gross assaults and they invariably falter or fail to act in a timely fashion. Hence Rawanda, the Sudan, Iraq and I could go on, but why risk sounding redundant. Were dealing with an agency that is more worried over the legality of overthrowing a dictator that not only robbed them blind but played them like a cheap fiddle for more than a decade whilst committing gross crimes against humanity, instead of acting on the behalf of said humanity. \n\n \n \n And this is where I disagree. I don`t agree that UN is primarily an organisation for humanity, but for the soverign nation-state. It is very sad that Saddam has been able to do all these things, but it is not up to UN to allow the use of force because of domestic problems in Iraq. Nor can UN allow use of force because of \"him robbing them blind\". Petty revenge is not an aspect I want an international organisation to be involved with. \n \n \nWere talking about an agency that has the crimes of many a dictator on record and yet they manage to drag their heels through the process of trials, with lame judical standards and shadowy truths. How long has it been to try Milosevec? 3 almost 4 years? Maybe he'll get a sentence of life imprisionment on some obscure island at which point he will escape and fail to ever be recaptured like a good majority of those they convict. But even that is looking doubtfull now that the vaunted World Court has allowed him to \"talk\" his way out of his savagery. \n\n \n \n I guess we`ll have to wait and see about that. \n \n \nGod only knows what will happen with Saddam within the U.N. justice system. Which of course is the saddest story of all because, they could have tried him 10 times over for his crimes against humanity by now and spared everyone this war we have now and for so many reasons. Lets talk enviroment. They consistantly bang the gavel at the U.S. for being a major polluter, nevermind the fact that Saddam's destruction of the marshlands and waterways in his recent wars have topped the UNESCO enviromental crimes list. What were they waiting for to react? \n\n \n \n And once again we come back to the issue where UN has no ability of topple a dictator in his own country because they lack the right to use military force to do so. Had saddam cared about if he had been charged or not? Not very likely.\n \n \nWe have a human rights commission that is constantly persecuting the U.S. over issues of slavery from past ages, Israel for actions against Palestinans and yet the machinations and attrocities from Saddam and others seem to go overlooked for years, the victims mere footnotes in a history that could have been changed with the U.N.'s intervention. \n\n \n \n Do you see any Swedish armed forces in the US grabbing your president? Do you see any Russian armed forces in Israel shooting Sharon and his cronies? Do you really want a world where foreign armed forces can invade your country because some states in the US have the formal ability to lawfully execute mentally handicaped and children? \n \n \n What peace are we talking about here? Is that the peace that allows Cuba to sit on the human rights council when they have been killing and jailing any that fail to escape the living hell their country has become? I wasn't aware that paying lip service in councils was keeping the peace and promoting democratic ideals is promoting a sense of false equality with nations, that are nowhere near equal in their governance to say nations that don't kill or imprision their citizens in order to keep totalitarian control. If it wants to be seen as being more of a tool for peaceful means then it needs to at least look as though it capbable of more than soft means and I don't think that is unreasonable to expect either considering the amount of support and \"authority\" they wield. \n\n \n \n What do executing and jailing dissenters have to do with peace?\n \n \n For far too long the U.S. has been the wallet and mercenary to the agency supporting it and acting on its behalf whenever the powers that be are too lazy to get the \"Beasts in Blue\" involved. \n\n \n \n I don`t know if the US is the wallet. It is admitedly thesingle largest payer and pays 22% of the UN budget. But Japan is not so far behind with 19%, and if you would count EU as a single entity, it would be the largest payer (pays more than 26% of the UN budget, and I`m only counting the four largest countries in EU). \n \n Source http://www.un.dk/swedish/FN/intro/vem_betalar_for_det_fn_gor.htm\n \n As for being the muscle. I`m not so sure about that. Currently Pakistan is the country with most military and civilian personel in UN peace keeping operations.\n \n Source http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0862135.html\n \n \nWhat is their reason for all the failed diplomacy and failure to prevent a single war? \n\n \n How do you know that UN has failed to \"prevent a single war\"? Heres a list of current and past UN peace keeping operations:\n \n http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0862135.html\n \n \nBlaming it all on a handful of nations or a singular superpower is too easy, its a cop out. The agency has historically been stingy with the power it has and has done so by committee. \n Some wonderful history of the U.N. for you to ponder.\n \n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3512951.stm\n \n http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/UN/Urquhart/urqchat00.record.html\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/wm438.cfm \n\n \n Nothing new. The oil for food programme was pretty emarassing. Allthough I find it funny that that particular editorial \"forgot\" to mention the reason why american oil firms failed to take advantage of the situation. They simply got to greedy. After being caught with smuggling large quantities of unregistered oil, Exxon (american oil company) was outright banned from the dealings...",

   "Hey everyone,\n I'm a 16 year old Junior. I'm on my schools debate team, actually I pretty much founded it. This years debate is over the United Nations and whether the US should increase support or not. Working with the negative, I can go as far to say that the US should leave the UN. And I am doing so. But in order to prove some points, I could use some factual information on UN failures. I've found some, but I need some hard stuff and it sounds like some of you know this stuff. If any of you can help me I'd appreciate it. Thanks,\n Will Sergent",

Everything they asked fo and several tons that they hadn't. Blix, who had really not asked for any kind of intervention as far as cooperation went, reported that they had unrestriceted access and the only bumps in the road were disputes of who should payt for communications towers for the UN inspectors. \n \n Blix issued several reports showing that Iraq was disarmed, we simply chose not to believe them.
