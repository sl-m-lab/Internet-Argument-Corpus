   "Time for the bell.\n \n The answer from land and sea:\n \n From land:\n \nThe situation looked hopeless when, all of a sudden, at about 10 a.m., a destroyer loomed out of a sea swarming with dozens of landing craft and amphibious vehicles. She was headed straight toward me. Even though she wasn't listing or smoking, my first thought was that she had either struck a mine or taken a torpedo and was damaged badly enough that she was being beached. While I was coming up with my reason for the destroyer to head in, she started to turn right and before she completed the turn to be parallel to the beach, all her guns opened fire. At the same time I saw smoke leave the gun barrels, shells landed a few yards above my rock cover. As the destroyer proceeded toward the western end of the beach, I continued to watch her and wondered how she could be so close without taking any artillery or mortar hits. I watched her go farther and farther from me and expected to see her pull out to sea any minute, when suddenly I realized she was backing up and her guns had yet to pause since commencing fire. She backed up almost to where she had started, went dead in the water for the second time, still to my knowledge without taking a hit, and again headed toward the other end of the beach with all guns still blazing. When she reached the western section of beach, she pulled back out to sea. \n\n \n From sea:\n \n \nI was the gunnery officer of the USS Frankford when she took part in the initial operations at Normandy on 6 June 1944. The Frankford was the flagship for the screen commander and was commanded by LCDR James Semmes. Her activities passed into memory until the reunion group started receiving letters from soldiers such as James Knight who were on the beach. Let me give a little background from the seaward side. Initially the Frankford was engaged in setting the screen. Most of the other destroyers in the screen were released quite early to augment the gunfire support at the beachhead. About midmorning, they had expended their bombardment ammunition allowance and returned to the screen. Obviously, the job was not over. The Frankford was released from the screen and ordered in to provide support wherever it was needed on Omaha Beach. We proceeded in to probably 1000 yards and tried to contact our shore fire-control party. For reasons that became obvious later, we never had clear targets on the beach. Unfortunately, German camouflage was excellent, so from that distance we could not see who was where or pinpoint anything to shoot. Then LCDR Semmes decided we should go in for a closer look. The tide was in our favor at the moment. Navigating by fathometer and seaman's eye, he took us in close enough to put our optical rangefinder, ranging on the bluff above the beach, against the stops -- 300-400 yards away. The camouflage on the beach was still good. We could not spot a target -- and frankly we did not know how far our troops had advanced. Then one of our light tanks that was sitting at the water's edge with a broken track fired at something on the hill. We immediately followed up with a five-inch salvo. The tank gunner flipped open his latch, looked around at us, waved, dropped back in the tank and fired at another target. For the next few minutes he was our fire-control party. Our rangefinder optics could examine the spots where his shells hit. By this time, we knew none of our troops was on the hill, so we used the rangefinder to pick out targets, including apparently at least one artillery emplacement. We did have the satisfaction of seeing our soldiers take some prisoners out of one of those bunkers. When we had expended our limit, we returned to our screen station, but not before seeing our troops moving up the hill toward the crest.\n",

I have been too busy and couldn&#8217;t get back as soon as I would like.\n But the answer I was looking for is:\n In 1939, a pilot plant for Tabun production was set up at M\u00b8nster-Lager, on L\u00b8neberg heath near the German Army proving grounds at Raubkammer. In January 1940, the Germans began construction of the full scale plant, code named Hochwerk, at Dyernfurth-am-Oder (now Brzeg Dolny in Poland), on the Oder River 40 km from Breslau (now Wroclaw) in Silesia. The plant covered an area 1.5 by 0.5 miles and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, Tabun. The facility had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz (now Krapowice) in Upper Silesia. An IG Farbenindustrie subsidiary, Anorgana GmbH, operated the Tabun plant, as well as all other CW agent production plants in Germany. Hochwerk was completed in 1942.\n The British code-name for Tabun was Trilon-83.\n NOTE: It has been reported that production at Dyernfurth resumed in 1946 under Russian auspices.\n \n Now, back to the Russian general&#8230;",
