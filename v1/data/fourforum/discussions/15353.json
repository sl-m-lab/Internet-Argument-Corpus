   "Just thought I would throw it out there for anyone who likes a good cold (or warm as it may be) beer. Maybe I can get some ideas on a few to try. \n \n As a general disclaimer...please drink responsibly and do not drink and drive! I was at 2 fatal accidents last month with a total of 3 killed due to drinking and driving. The last thing anyone wants is me looking at your lifeless body saying \"yep...he dead jimmy\". \n \n Personally, I really don't like hops. I tend to avoid anything that makes me pucker as hops tend to do. \n \n Coors Light: Refreshment on hot days when I get done mowing the lawn.\n \n Budweiser: My standard beer for watching sports or going out. Good taste and not too heavy.\n \n Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout: Simply fantastic.\n \n Guinness: A meal in a glass.\n \n Any good unfiltered wheat beer served at about 60F.",
