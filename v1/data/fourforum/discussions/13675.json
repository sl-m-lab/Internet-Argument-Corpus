You need help. \n \n Let's look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify your illicit gay sex sin:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n &#8220;Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson\n \n Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments",

Just because people are Gay don't assume we're all positive or that HIV is a \"gay\" disease... Need proof?

Jeez either they ended up with some guy cheating on me, or me being treated like dirt. I guess nice guys do finish last...\n \n But hey man straits got their issues too. I mean fine job you guys have done with white weddings lol. Over a 50% divorce rate I mean jeez you might as well swing a Pinata and hope a faithful partner comes out or maybe a tootsie roll...\n \n And hey I'm not asking you to believe I mean you can just you know cover your ears and ignore me I don't care.\n \n \n Oh funny thing you brought that little tidbit up cause I found out he DID cheat on me a couple days ago. He told me so yeah it hurt. I cried and all that typical oh no my hearts been crushed drama... Gave him one hell of a scream to on the phone.\n \n Funny thing is he assumed I was doing the same thing which was wrong.. Not to mention the fact that it was his best friend who well kind of took advantage of him cause he was drunk at the time...\n \n But hey you know we talked about it and all that and we're still together. I forgave him and plus he about died when I basically told him to F off and said he threw away someone that would take a bullet for him and would go to the ends of the earth and back or would drop their life at the drop of a hat for them...\n \n So hey all relationships take work and most couples don't realize that. I guess at the ripe old age of 21 I've learned quick which is disturbing. By all rights I should be at a kegger and getting drunk with a funnel down my mouth.

I still love him and I know he loves me and that he messed up BAD. But hey you know we're all human and we all make mistakes. I wouldn't be a Christian if I didn't forgive him right?\n \n All he could say is he didn't deserve me and I was too good for him. Shut him up with no one deserves anyone.

   "\n I mean hell if you had countries making laws to kill you would you think it's a blessing? \n\n \n I do have countries making laws to kill my people schmuck! More christians are persecuted for their faith in Christ on Earth, than homosexuals each year. And YES, it is a blessing to give ones life for Christ. For ultimate and absolute truth! \n \n \nBut hey man straits got their issues too. I mean fine job you guys have done with white weddings lol. Over a 50% divorce rate I mean jeez you might as well swing a Pinata and hope a faithful partner comes out or maybe a tootsie roll...\n\n \n Great point. Now if I can only get you to accept that this current social reality and breakdown was caused by 50 years of feminism and liberalism. When traditional values were in place in this country these problems didn't exist.\n \n \nOh funny thing you brought that little tidbit up cause I found out he DID cheat on me a couple days ago. He told me so yeah it hurt. I cried and all that typical oh no my hearts been crushed drama... Gave him one hell of a scream to on the phone.\n \n Funny thing is he assumed I was doing the same thing which was wrong.. Not to mention the fact that it was his best friend who well kind of took advantage of him cause he was drunk at the time...\n \n But hey you know we talked about it and all that and we're still together. I forgave him and plus he about died when I basically told him to F off and said he threw away someone that would take a bullet for him and would go to the ends of the earth and back or would drop their life at the drop of a hat for them...\n \n So hey all relationships take work and most couples don't realize that. I guess at the ripe old age of 21 I've learned quick which is disturbing. By all rights I should be at a kegger and getting drunk with a funnel down my mouth. At least that's the typical thing a guy my age would be doing...\n \n At any rate I'm flying out still to see him hopefully before new years. I still love him and I know he loves me and that he messed up BAD. But hey you know we're all human and we all make mistakes. I wouldn't be a Christian if I didn't forgive him right?\n \n All he could say is he didn't deserve me and I was too good for him. Shut him up with no one deserves anyone. We all give our hearts freely to those whom we love. No one deserves another persons heart and it's a gift given freely from within.\n \n I should send that little tidbit into hallmark...\n\n \n Oh yeah, I forgot that you have a long distance relationship. Now let me tell you the rest of the story my naive leftist; your so called boyfriend has been out running the clubs and getting laid 3 times a week. He just admitted to one time in case you find out about one partner while you're visiting him for the holiday. Like I have said to you before Jason, get a clue. Your boyfriend is a whore monger and you're risking your health every time you have sex with him. You do realize you're having sex with everyone he's been with when you do him, don't you? Think about that my gullible friend.",

   "Really? What do you find funny about the bolded statement, because I find it very telling indeed; After decades of marriage I still haven't seen my wife's naked southern exposure in a picture, although I have personally been intimately involved with it! Don't you get it Jason? In the real world, seeing your male partners souther exposure in photos or film isn't an example of a private or a moral relationship in any way. But why would i expect you to get that when it is obviously normal enough to you to mention here. \n \n Oh, and also, it's too incredible to believe that you've seen his lower half in pictures but not in person. If he's getting photographed naked, there's no way he has even a modicum of modesty, so once again you tell a nice sounding, but very incredible story. Stop parroting politicians Jason, and tell the truth rather than what you think we as straiGHts want to hear.\n\n \n Huh? I have seen it in person but not in nearly over a year and a half Arch. I mean hell I know that my dad took pictures of my mom in exposed ways because I stumbled upon them a long time ago and about puked cause well yeah it's my mom so.. \n \n Anyways what I'm getting at is I was just trying to lighten the mood a little here. I mean Jeez Arch all you do is analize every little tidbit like if you dare to laught at something it would kill ya.. \n \n And what do you want to hear Arch? I mean should I flap my wings on my perch and cry heterosexual! Or maybe Vagina! or maybe even NFL? I mean come on... \n \n If you really want my opinon here I think your really uptight especially considering it's almost Christmas. And jeez Archie it's a picture not even actually it's on my cell phone. Well was... I mean jeez no one said we didn't have our intimate moments talking on the phone and such. But thats how long distance relationships go sometimes...",

I'm well aware of the persecution of Christians seeing as I donate to Voice Of the Martyrs every year as I've done for almost 3 years now.. I'm well aware but this wasn't a shouting match to cry who is more persecuted.\n \n I mean I didn't jump down your throat so do me a favor and refrain from jumping down mine OK?\n \n \n \n \nGreat point. Now if I can only get you to accept that this current social reality and breakdown was caused by 50 years of feminism and liberalism.

Secondly I know when someone is XXXXXXXXting me and trust me this is the only time he's done it. And FYI the Navy screens you for STD's so he'd know if he caught something.\n \n Oh and seeing as how his best friend was a GIRL and he wore a condom i bet he didn;t catch anything... Funny how that workd right?\n \n Oh and theres no gay bars in arkansas they were all burned down in the late 90's. The closest one is memphis maybe little rock but I doubt it. So before you run off calling my bf a whore and before you run your jaw kindly have some respect for other people? \n \n I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate me calling your wife an unpleasant name or insinuating that she's a whore so don't do it to me got it?",

   "How incredibly dishonest, yet typical of your style of condemning a complete belief system based on assumptions which have no basis in fact at all. Just read the text to see how twisted simones thinking is. First it says this, and places blame on every american christian for what is being considered in the Ugandan Parliament: Nothing illustrates the danger we face from our own Taliban better than the way American \"Christians\" are now tangled up with the homophobic ---Ugandan Christian/political leadership. Now potentially gay murdering --- The Ugandan Parliament is considering a bill that would impose the death penalty on gays.\n \n Only to then go on and post that it is being cheered by only a dead man: One American must be cheering from the grave. Yet in your total and complete dishonesty, you attribute this to the whole of the american christian belief system as if we all have some personal investment in Uganda adopting the death penalty for homosexuals. You are not only despicable in the lies and propaganda you will post simone, but your corruption and dishonesty knows NO bounds at all. emoticon_rolleyes Although I have no qualms in saying I absolutely hate what it is that you represent, I have nothing but pity and sympathy for the spiritual emptiness and intellectual shallowness that is you. :xbanghead\n\n \n \n \n Well it is what your own holly book commands. Since you believe that every word in the Bible is the literal word of God then you have to support the killing of gays because your God commands it. Don''t try and back out of this since you throw the Bible in our faces, use it as a weapon it would only be hypocritical of you not to support what you believe is the word of your God.\n \n Leviticus 20:13 calls for the death of gay people since your believe that Leviticus chapter 20:13 is the literal word of God then you must by your own belief system support the killing of gays.

At this time the punishment for these \"crimes\" was death (so those that say that Jefferson's position was too extreme are, in effect, saying that they believe they should have continued to execute homosexuals). Jefferson sought to make the punishment less severe. He did not propose castration where no law had existed before.\n \n http://www.ronstringfield.com/?r=l&d=2&e=168\nConsidering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient Israelites, it's not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality. Jefferson's suggestion, however, was merciful by comparison.\n \n And we also know that, having revised the Bible by editing out all the supernatural events (including, especially, the Resurrection) and having referred to Paul (author of the NT's allegedly anti-homosexual \"clobber\" passages) as \"the great Coryphaeus... the first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus,\" that he would likely have been repelled by with Archangel's views, on both God and homosexuality. In fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration. \nFix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.\n --Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, Aug. 10, 1787\n",
