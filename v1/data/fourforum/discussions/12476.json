   "O.K. I'm willing to listen. For those of you who tout the wonderful be all/end all wonder cure for violence called gun control, please tell me what law you want that would have prevented the Oakland killings.\n \n After all, according to you, gun control is the remedy for gun violence.\n \n A small list of laws broken by the killer:\n \n Murder - Oakland Code, CA law, Federal law\n Possession of a firearm by a felon - Oakland Code, CA law, Federal law\n Assault with a deadly weapon - Oakland Code, CA law\n Possession of an \"assault weapon\" - Oakland Code, CA law\n Possession of a high capacity magazine - Oakland code, CA law\n Assault on a police officer - Oakland Code, CA law, Federal law\n Discharge of a weapon in City limits - Oakland Code, CA law\n \n These are just a few. I'm sure there are more counts according to Oakland Municipal Code, California State Law, and Federal Law.\n \n Now. For those of you who believe that MORE gun control will solve this sort of thing.....\n \n Please inform me what law would have prevented this. I mean, everything the killer did was illegal. Laws were in place banning almost everything he did. He was on parole, and probation for Armed Criminal Action or something......\n \n ...so explain exactly how this wonderful gun control that is supposed to keep this exact thing from happening works. I mean, your argument is that we need more of it.....\n \n ...what more than complete 100% illegality of everything he did will stop this?\n \n How do you get MORE illegal than 100%? Can you make muder 120% illegal? What about adding a 20% MORE ban to the 100% complete ban on assault weapons in California that is already in place?\n \n That way it can be 120% completely illegal to possess an assault weapon in California. After all, if more gun control is what will cure this, we'll have to make things MORE than completely illegal, right?\n \n This complete 100% gun control isn't doing to well, yet I keep hearing the same ol' tune - \"More gun control! More gun control!\"\n \n So tell me what new law will suddenly cause criminals to obey it. The one against killing people seems pretty serious, yet still is being ignored. Please inform me of what wonderful new law will help. That's what you want. Explain how it will work. I'm listening.",

I'm listening.\n\n \n First off, my condolences to the family and friends of these Officers who lost their lives to a POS. Oakland is such a ******* up city, I don't know where to start. Some people were even cheering because of the deaths of these officers. I'd like to see them cheer when gangs start extorting them. California has the strictest gun control laws in the nation. Heck even the Brady campaign gave them an A. emoticon_frazzled Yet a PAROLED felon was able to get a hold of a gun and kill 4 cops. The Justice system failed, miserably. I have no doubt in my mind that this guy was one of those people released due to the budget crisis...funny how they won't release those who did nothing wrong (like Phil Dominguez read the thread about LAX and assault weapons).",

   "And I wish to offer my condolences also. In my state we have had a few cases, these were years ago where the criminal justice system let down our brave officers also. One case was where a police officer was gunned down by criminal that had less than two months earlier had taken a couple of pot shots at a drug dealer. This indivdual was arrested and then released with no charges filed by the DA. The public found out later that this guy had a warrant out for his arrest in connection with a murder. The DA never even checked to see if he had any pryors or warrants before letting him go. Another one was where a state trooper was gunned down by a guy that had beaten someone to death served 4 years and was released. He was out on the street for less than two mo's before killing the trooper. And these are not the only examples.",

   "..and to further prove my point on what kind of city Oakland is...emoticon_angry\n \n CNSNews.com\n Suspected Oakland Cop-Killer Hailed As A Hero\n Thursday, March 26, 2009\n By Terry Collins, Associated Press\n \n Oakland, Calif. (AP) - As the city prepares for a massive public funeral for four police officers slain in the line of duty, dozens took to the streets in a show of support for the man authorities say was their killer.\n \n Organized by International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement, the march Wednesday evening took participants near a police substation within sight of the two locations where Lovelle Mixon allegedly shot the veteran officers before being slain himself.\n \n Loved ones and supporters walked through the streets chanting, \"OPD you can't hide, we charge you with genocide!\" There were no officers patrolling the march route.\n \n \"I don't condone what he did, but it's bringing to light the frustrations between the community and the police,\" said Uhuru Movement member Kihad Deen. \"This gives people a chance to speak their minds.\"\n \n Mixon's cousin, Dolores Darnell, 26, addressed the small crowd, calling him \"a true hero, a soldier.\"\n \n \"This is the real Lovelle,\" she said, holding a picture of a smiling Mixon with his wife. \"We do apologize for what he did to the officers' families. But he's not a monster.\"\n \n Authorities say a day before the shooting the 26-year-old fugitive parolee was linked by DNA to the February rape of a 12-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint.\n \n The event took place a day after a city-sponsored gathering drew about 1,000 people to the crime scene to honor the slain officers: Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40; John Hege, 41; Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43; and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35.\n \n Police said Hege and Dunakin were gunned down Saturday when the two motorcycle officers pulled over Mixon. In a manhunt that followed, Romans and Sakai died when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where Mixon was hiding. Mixon also died in the gunfire.\n \n Speaking at the event honoring the officers Tuesday night, Acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said the department was being sustained by an outpouring of public sympathy that included flowers, food, donations for the officers' families and more than 3,000 e-mails, cards and calls.\n \n \"It speaks volumes for us. To see so many people here today, in the very same community we lost four officers, means so much to us,\" Jordan said, noting that the condolences have far exceeded any hints of criticism. \"We're going to get through this, with the support of our families and with the support of you, the community.\"\n \n Meanwhile, the state inspector general said Wednesday that Mixon was properly monitored by corrections officials after he was released from prison in November. Mixon was wanted on a parole violation when the shootings happened, although it is not yet known whether that was the reason Hege and Dunakin pulled him over on Saturday afternoon.\n \n Sgt. Dom Arotzarena, president of the Oakland Police Officers Association, said Wednesday that the rank-and-file is trying to cope with the tragedy while preparing for a public funeral Friday that is expected to fill the arena where the Golden State Warriors play.\n \n \"Everyone is devastated,\" Arotzarena said. \"Everyone is trying to seek answers to it all, including, 'Why did this happen?'\n \n \"Our reaction is no different than anyone else.\"\n \n According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 133 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty in 2008, a 27 percent decrease from year before and the lowest annual total since 1960.",

   "I marvel that this crowd of protesters felt justified in defending this shooter after his DNA was matched for the rape of a 12 year old since being released on Parole. Their claim that he isn't a monster based on a photo of him smiling is a pathetic joke on common sense and rational thinking.\n \n The larger concern for me, beyond what he did in killing 4 cops is the utter and complete blindness of the larger black community which has the poor judgment to see him as any kind of victim of police brutality at all. Let's face it, had those first 2 motorcycle cops approached him with their guns drawn and aimed at him when they stopped him, they might still be alive today. This fact shows that they didn't approach him with malice of any kind which justified them being shot without any warning.",
