   "President Bush's Accomplishments while in the Oval Office:\n Character & Conduct as President\n \n 1. Changed the tone in the White House, restoring HONOR and DIGNITY to the presidency.\n\n Only if you think that total secrecy and mass deception is dignified and honorable.\n \n \n2. Has reintroduced the mention of God and faith into public discourse.\n\n He did this? For the first time and by himself? I distinctly remember Alan Keyes running for the ministry, I mean presidency, in 2000. Don't forget about the ENTIRE religious right who won't relent mentioning god in public discourse. Besides how is this an \"accomplishment\"?\n \n\n 3. Handled himself with enormous courage, dignity, grace, determination, and leadership in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 hijackings and anthrax attacks. He almost single-handedly held this country together during those searing days:\n \n Just three days after the attacks, in his address at the National Cathedral, the President reassured the nation when he said: \"War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing.\"\n \n \n On Friday, September 14, 2001, President Bush visited Ground Zero. Standing on a crushed and burned fire engine atop the smoldering pile at Ground Zero, he put his arm around a retired firefighter who had volunteered to help, and began speaking to the crowd. Rescue workers shouted that they could not hear him. Someone handed him a small American flag and bullhorn. The President spontaneously shouted: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" The crowd roared with cheers and chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" Then he raised that American flag and rallied a nation.\n Defense & Foreign Policy\n\n That was pretty courageous how he sat there reading \"My pet goat\" after being told we were under attack. Anyway, ANY president can hug a firefighter, wave the flag, and come out looking like a hero (except Bush, who made it look cheap).\n \n \n1. Successfully executed two wars in the aftermath of 9/11/01: Afghanistan and Iraq. 50 million people who had lived under tyrannical regimes now live in freedom.\n\n Successfully?!?!? HA HA HA HA HA HA! Wow, some freedom. Afghanis have to live under the rule of Unocal, I mean Karzai. Or at least the parts not under taliban or war lord rule. And Iraq (once we have killed everyone not loyal to us and then some) will be just a US/UK colony (again).\n \n\n 2. Saddam Hussein is now in prison. His two murderous sons are dead. All but a handful of the regime's senior members were killed or captured.\n\n Great, and we killed thousands of innocent people in the process. \n \n \n3. Leader by leader and member by member, al Qaida is being hunted down in dozens of countries around the world. Of the senior al Qaeda leaders, operational managers, and key facilitators the U.S. Government has been tracking, nearly two-thirds have been taken into custody or killed. The detentions or deaths of senior al Qaeda leaders, including Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, the mastermind of 9/11, and Muhammad Atef, Osama bin Laden's second-in-command until his death in late 2001, have been important in the War on Terror. \n\n After 9/11, don't you think that the CIA/FBI would be doing that no matter who the president was?\n \n \n4. Disarmed Libya of its chemical, nuclear and biological WMD's without bribes or bloodshed.\n\n Oh, I'm sure they relinquished everything. ;)\n \n \n5. Continues to execute the War On Terror, getting worldwide cooperation to track funds/terrorists. Has cut off much of the terrorists' funding, and captured or killed many key leaders of the al Qaeda network.\n\n Except in the two most enabling states, our \"allies\" Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.\n \n\n 6. Initiated a comprehensive review of our military, which was completed just prior to 9/11/01, and which accurately reported that ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE capabilities were critical in the 21st Century.\n\n That wasn't Bush, that was Rummy and Wolfy who were pining to spend half the national budget on the military for 10 years. I think we are up to 40%.\n \n \n7. Killed the old US/Soviet Union ABM Treaty that was preventing the U.S. from deploying our ABM defenses.\n\n Clinton initiated changes in the treaty, but Yeltsin wanted to keep the language the same. It wasn't until Putin came along until the US got what CLINTON started.\n http://www.acronym.org.uk/44abm.htm\n \n \n8. Has been one of the strongest, if not THE strongest friend Israel has ever hand in the U.S. presidency.\n\n This is an accomplishment? Screw Israel. What have they done for us? Oh yeah, spy on us.\n \n \n9. Part of the coalition for an Israeli/Palestinian \"Roadmap to Peace,\" along with Great Britain, Russia and the EU.\n\n We still have that, right? Everyone is still following it, right?\n \n \n10. Pushed through THREE raises for our military. Increased military pay by more than $1 billion a year.\n \n 11. Signed the LARGEST nuclear arms reduction in world history with Russia. \n \n 12. Started withdrawing our troops from Bosnia, and has announced withdrawal of our troops from Germany and the Korean DMZ.\n \n 13. Prohibited putting U.S. troops under U.N. command.\n \n 14. Paid back UN dues only in return for reforms and reduction of U.S. share of the costs.\n \n 15. Earmarked at least 20 percent of the Defense procurement budget for next-generation weaponry.\n \n 16. Increased defense research and development spending by at least $20 billion from fiscal 2002 to 2006.\n \n 17. Ordered a comprehensive review of military weapons and strategy.\n \n 18. Ordered a review of overseas deployments.\n \n 19. Ordered renovation of military housing. The military has already upgraded about 10 percent of its inventory and expects to modernize 76,000 additional homes this year.\n \n\n Ok, so beefing up the military was far from his idea. Then to spread out beefing up of the military into several separate \"accomplishments\" is just trying to jack up the numbers. Why don't you list that he wiped his butt after taking a dump?\n \n \n20. Is working to tighten restrictions on military-technology exports.\n\n NOW THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT (in progress).\n \n \n21. Brought back our EP-3 intel plane and crew from China without any bribes or bloodshed.\n\n Sure about the bribes part?\n \n .",

Good job. \n \n \n\n 2. Saddam Hussein is now in prison. His two murderous sons are dead.

Libya offered to give up it's weapons to the Brits in the 1990s, and they gave up their programs to the Brits AGAIN, after the brits shoved us away in the talks, not to mention the spike in oil before the war accumulating with the massive lost of income after the sanctions. Ignorance abounds here. \n \n \n\n 5. Continues to execute the War On Terror, getting worldwide cooperation to track funds/terrorists. Has cut off much of the terrorists' funding, and captured or killed many key leaders of the al Qaeda network.\n\n \n Right....except leaving Saudi Princes to freely donate, helping massive recuritment drives, giving them a new playground, kicking out a secular leader who persecuted them and failing to secure nuclear materal, as well as letting them walk off with 450 tons of explosives to use aganist US troops. \n \n \n\n 6. Initiated a comprehensive review of our military, which was completed just prior to 9/11/01, and which accurately reported that ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE capabilities were critical in the 21st Century.\n\n \n You sure this was him or a long term pentagon initative? Sounds like they have been doing that long before Bush came into power. \n \n \n\n 7. Killed the old US/Soviet Union ABM Treaty that was preventing the U.S. from deploying our ABM defenses.\n\n \n And this is good how? Starwars is a joke, not to mention nukes will come in backpacks, on ships and in suitcases, not missiles. \n \n \n\n 8. Has been one of the strongest, if not THE strongest friend Israel has ever hand in the U.S. presidency.\n\n \n This is good how? \n \n \n\n 9. Part of the coalition for an Israeli/Palestinian \"Roadmap to Peace,\" along with Great Britain, Russia and the EU.\n\n \n Look how that's working out. \n \n \n\n 10. Pushed through THREE raises for our military. Increased military pay by more than $1 billion a year.\n\n \n Do you have stats or just lies? \n \n \n\n 11. Signed the LARGEST nuclear arms reduction in world history with Russia.\n\n \n While supporting building new nuclear weapons. \n \n \n\n 12. Started withdrawing our troops from Bosnia, and has announced withdrawal of our troops from Germany and the Korean DMZ.\n\n \n We were planning on getting out of Bosnia before Bush came into power. Taking credit for something he didn't do or plan. As for Germany, that was planned as well. The DMZ is because we need those 37,000 in Iraq. \n \n \n\n 13. Prohibited putting U.S. troops under U.N. command.\n\n \n So you're saying that none of our troops in any of the peacekeeping missions currently ongoing are not under UN command?\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_UN_peacekeeping_missions\n \n HAHAHAHAH. Really. Lies. \n \n \n\n 14. Paid back UN dues only in return for reforms and reduction of U.S. share of the costs.\n\n \n We haven't paid the UN a dime in 5 or so years. \n \n \n\n 15. Earmarked at least 20 percent of the Defense procurement budget for next-generation weaponry.\n\n \n Links or lies? \n \n \n\n 16. Increased defense research and development spending by at least $20 billion from fiscal 2002 to 2006.\n\n \n Something tells me this includes the private sector. \n \n \n\n 17. Ordered a comprehensive review of military weapons and strategy.\n\n \n Who hasn't? \n \n \n\n 18. Ordered a review of overseas deployments.\n\n \n Who hasn't? \n \n \n\n 19. Ordered renovation of military housing. The military has already upgraded about 10 percent of its inventory and expects to modernize 76,000 additional homes this year.\n\n \n While cutting overall military benefits. \n \n [quote]\n 20. Is working to tighten restrictions on military-technology exports.[/quiote]\n \n This is pretty vague. \n \n \n\n 21. Brought back our EP-3 intel plane and crew from China without any bribes or bloodshed.\n\n \n \n .....\n \n this ignores all of thousands of screw ups.",
