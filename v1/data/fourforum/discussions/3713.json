It hink it will be interesting to see how the 2 upcoming supreme court cases (one has already been accepted, the other is pretty much a shoe in) regarding the commerce clause will be handled, since the majority of the laws that congress passes are tied to it. \n \n \nThe first portion, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\" is a qualifier to what follows \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" It seems pretty clear to me.

The current interpretation is clear. We look at the last portion of the statement only. I don't think that, as I said before, a little common sense, is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way.\n\n \n We look at the last portion of the statement because that is the actionable clause. The first portion is the justification clause, and the actionable clause is not dependant on the justification clause. This is the way it was taught back then, and it has not really changed. The accepted rules for the usage of the english language are pretty well documented.\n \n Several states have similarly worded provisions in their state constitutions. the Rhode Island constitution contains this:\n \n \nThe liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish his sentiments on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty \n \n \n Reading it the way many of the anti gunners read the second ammendment would suggest that liberty of the press may only be enjoyed in situations where it is somehow related to the security of freedom in a state. This si simply not the case. Free speech is ensured in rhode island even if it has NOTHING at all to do with security or freedom in a state. You have the right, under the constitution of rhode island, to write and print recipes, novels, personal letters, poetry, or just about anything else youw ould like,regardless of their connection to the security of a free state. That is becasue the justification clause adds no controls to the actionable clause.\n \n \nAfter all, I could easily argue (if I was totally stupid) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon. We both know that isn't going to fly. Just where does the armament argument end. With a cannon? Or with a Nuc. Let's face it. They said arms and they meant arms. Not guns. They'd probably let me have the cannon. The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we'd have available today or what they'd be used for. That's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended. Since we will always draw the line someplace, why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me.\n\n \n Many of the founding fathers had their own arsenals including heavy cannons and even artillery. These were the most destructive devices on the planet at the time. they certainly werte aware that even more devestating items would become available as time drew on. Keep in mind that most of the foudnign fatehrs were alive to see the transition from the musket (with an accurate range of rougly 30 ft) to the rifle (with an accurate range of over 200 yards). \n \n The \"that means you could own a nuclear weapon\" argument is nonsense brought about by anti gunners in order to provoke an emotional response. First off, there are no nuclear weapons available on the civilian market. If you do find one available, it is stolen. It is a crime to buy stolen goods. The second reason that the argument is rediculous is that nuclear weapons are offensive weapons. the founding fathers were VERY clear that the second ammendment recognised an individual right, and on that SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. They also made very clear that the purpose of the ammendment ws to provide for the defense of the people, even if it was against their own government. Nuclear weapons, as offensive weapons, would certianly not be protected under the second ammendment.\n \n The supreme court puts a great deal of weight on the original intention of the founders when interpeting the constitution. Here are some quotes from the founders to ponder:\n \n They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. \n ---Benjamin Franklin, Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759. \n \n I think we would do well to heed Franklins words, not only in regards to the issue of gun control, but in all matters political right now.\n \n To model our political system upon speculations of lasting tranquility, is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character.\n ---Alexander Hamilton \n \n [The Constitution preserves] the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation...(where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\n ---James Madison,The Federalist Papers, No. 46. \n \n Here is one that I think is a favorite among pro gunners. I have seen bumper stickers that say \"Fear the government that fears your gun\". I think there may be a certain amount of truth to this. What exactly do they plan to do that is so bad they are afraid you are going to shoot them for it?\n \n Here are some quotes by constitutional commentators of the day:\n \n Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive. \n ---Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (Philadelphia 1787). \n \n \n I think that he hit the nail on the head here. We see it argued that private citizens should not be allowed to be armed with military weapons. The founders disagreed, and Webster has explained quite well here why. In an age where every PD has a swat team armed with everything from handguns to grenade launchers, the intention of the founding fathers was that the citizenry be able to effectively resist the government if needed.\n \n Many peopel scoff at the idea that this may ever be needed. Think back to RUby Ridge and Waco. Put aside the automatic respect and fear that we are supoposed to feel for law enforcement and look at what happend those two places. Government agents murdered innocent people who were unable to defend themselves effectively. These are people who were never sharged with cromes following the massacres at those 2 places. At Ruby ridge, federal marshals murdered a 14 yr old boy, and an FBI sharpshooter took down a mother who was holding a baby in her arms. At waco, people were shot from helicopters, tanks and flammable tear gas were used against women and children, and there is some pretty compelling evidence which shows that as the structure burned, those who tried to escape the blaze were shot down.\n \n Granted, randy weaver would not have been able to beat the feds at their game regardless of how well aremed he was, but those people who were protesting on the road could have. The Branch Davidians could not have beat the ATF, but again, their neiborghs certainly could have if they had access to modern, powerful military weapons as our forefatehrs intended. It seems that the idea was that the American people didn;t have to just lie down and take it. We were meant to be able to fight back. \n \n Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American...[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people. \n ---Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788. \n \n \n The whole of that Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals...[I]t establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no majority has a right to deprive them of. \n ---Albert Gallatin to Alexander Addison, Oct 7, 1789, MS. in N.Y. Hist. Soc.-A.G. Papers, 2. \n \n (note that in saying \"some rights\", he is not alluding to only some fo the rights in the bill of rights, he is referring to the fact that people have many more rights than are recognised there, the ones in the bill of rights are being made unalienable)\n \n I think that it is clear why the second ammendment was included in the constitution, and exactly what the founding fatehrs meant by it. Ther easons for its existance are no less pressing today than they were at its inception.",

I refuse to join the throng who say America is so far gone, the best way to proceed is to be prepared to kill at a moment's notice.\n\n \n So you are somehow in a morally superior position if you are laying dead on the ground than if you are standing with a smoking gun and your attacker is dead? \n \n I may be a little old fashioned, but I believe that, as the man of the house, part of my responsibility is to protect my wife and my children. I would be remiss in my duties if I did not seek out and ensure that I posess the absolute best tools available to me to that end. \n \n We certinaly live in strange times if taking responsibility for your own safety and that of your family is \"lowering yourself\". I would argue the exact opposite. I think it is sad that we live in a society where a large portion of our society is so insecure and so unwilling to take on any personal responsibility that they won't even take common sense steps to protect themselves. \n \n People like that are WHY crime is so high. Criminals know that those who are unwilling to take responsibility for themselves have pushed very hard to ensure that the rest of us cannot (apparently on the assumption that since they are too incompetent to handle a gun, so are the rest of us). Cops don't stop crimes and they don't prevent them. They show up afterwards, clean up the mess, and capture the bad guy almost 20% of the time! \n \n \nSecond, if I did have one, should I ask this criminal to wait patiently while I take it from my purse. Or should I get a Quick Draw McGraw holster -- in multiple colors to coordinate with my outfits?\n\n \n You should carry your weapon in a manner that makes it quickly and easily available. By your logic, police officers shouldn't carry guns because they can't get to them in time anyway.\n \n \nThird, the best chance of survivability is to give them what they want!!!!\n\n \n What would make you think that this person, who is obviously lacking in moral fibre, deservs your trust? Is there really something that leads you to believe that somebody who is willing to rob you is not willing to kill you? \n \n I think you would have a great deal of trouble finding a self defense instructor who would not tell you that in a dangerous situation, it is far better to be proactive than reactive. Even the feminazis who come around once a year and try to teach the college girls around here that scratching people with your keys is somehow a good defense agree on this point. \n \n \nFourth, I'm not a fearful person. And I'm not the type to crumble if I were ever to be the victim of a crime. You see, my Dad was a feminist before it was fashionable.\n\n \n Not a fearful person? You are apparently afraid to go to an ATM at night. You are apparently afraid that if you did carry a gun you couldn't handle it effectively. You are apparently so unsure of your ability to defend yourself (which almost certianly is born of fear) that you prefer to give a criminal waht they want rather than stand up for yourself. And you say you are unafraid?\n \n Wahy if what the crimainal wants is your children? Do you still give them what they want? What if they want to rape your wife? stand by and politely ask them to use a condom? \n \n We live in a society where people are killed for their tennis shoes. People are fairly routinely killed during the course of robberies that involve less than $20. Quit being afraid. Step up and take responsibility for your own safety. You will feel better.",

   "Well you may be right when you generalize that all armed robbers want is your money. You must remember, however, that all of them are prepared to offer you violence to achieve that goal, and that being unarmed and/or physically unresisting is certainly no guarantee that you will not be seriously injured or killed. I don't know where you get the belief that robbers only kill when \"forced\" to do so (which you imply they are forced to do by the victim's resistance). That view does not accord with the reality of armed robbery. I can give you many examples of unarmed and unresisting victims being killed or seriously wounded by a robber.\n \n I do not believe that women are a weaker sex, but since we are talking about armed robbers let me say that my views are not shared by them. Rightly or wrongly, they perceive women as weaker and easier targets for robbery. If all else is equal, the man who wants money for another rock of crack and who sees both of us exit a store at night will choose you over me. He will do so because he thinks that you are less able or willing to resist him. He may also have another motive to choose you which would exclude me: he may wish to make you the victim of a sexual assault. \n \n Having said this, however, I live in the real world where I know that being a man is no shield against assault and or robbery. I see a lot of violent crime involving all manner of victims. I carry a gun because I know what's out there in the real world, and I wish to be as prepared as possible to deal with it should I ever be targeted for victimization. Yet, if a man ever gets me into a situation where he has a gun pointed at me while demanding my wallet, I would be unlikely to try and outdraw his trigger pull. The fact that I carry a firearm does not mean that I will automatically use it if confronted by a robber. It merely means that I am better prepared to defend myself if the opportunity to do so presents itself. The law of self defense is the first law of nature, and I fail to see the logic in condemning those who lawfully and peacefully arm themselves with the ability to choose not to be a victim wherever possible. \n \n ------------------------------------\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

   "kickin50, i should appolige, i had thought that you were some one who I could try to understand the anti-gun point of view. \nYou and I were having a perfectly civil conversation until some changed the subject from target shooting and hunting and what impact this has on society as a whole, to why I should be packing. Just when did it change from why do I want to take your guns to how come I don't have one? Me carrying a gun. That's just not going to happen.\n \n And there is no way I can say it's a good thing to arm anybody and everybody on the street who steps up and says they'd like one. It's not only unnecessary, it's dangerous. There's way too many people walking our streets, carrying a gun, that aren't wrapped too tight. No amount of firearm training is going to turn an overly aggressive paranoid into a person with good judgment. They got that gun because they're an overly aggressive paranoid or just plain a trouble maker. It won't be a robber the vast majority of them pull that gun on. It will be a fight over a parking space. Crazies get legal guns too. And I don't mean the technically diagnosable kind. These aren't people who want to take their target pistol out and around with them. They never owned a gun at all until they could keep it in their glove box. They're the same loud mouth that got bounced out of the bar last Saturday. And every one of them makes our lives a little more dangerous.\n \n \nRightly or wrongly, they perceive women as weaker and easier targets for robbery. He may also have another motive to choose you which would exclude me: he may wish to make you the victim of a sexual assault. \nMore scare tactics. Life is odds. Just like Vegas. I could get run over by a bus, too. Bad things happen to good people. There's just no guarantee no matter what. 6 possibilities:\n \n 1. Without a gun - I won't be a victim.\n 2. Without a gun - I'll be a victim. I'll survive.\n 3. Without a gun - I'll be a victim. I won't survive.\n 4. With a gun - I won't be a victim.\n 5. With a gun - I'll be a victim. I'll survive.\n 6. With a gun - I'll be a victim. I won't survive.\n \n You're focusing in strictly on 2 of the 6 possibilities -- #3 and #5. Chances are 4 out of 6 that I'm right. So long as I don't have a gun at all, the odds are 2 out of 3. I like my odds way better.\n \n As for rape, yep. Could happen. That's #2. Hope I don't get a disease. I wouldn't crawl in to a hole and pull it in after me. Life goes on. A woman's reaction to that is based totally on her personality. I can see how it would be tougher on a young girl - teen or inexperienced. But I for one, stopped taking that quite so seriously after a few trips to the delivery room. Mind if I look, they say? He.. no. Everybody else has. :) We're a teaching hospital you know. Yeah. I figured that out. We'll talk after you've been in the stirrups more times than you can count. Scooch down they say. Just a little more they say. About the time you have your knees in your ears, you begin to realize that you're just not that special. It's time to get over yourself. More than you wanted to know? :) :) :) \n \n \nYet, if a man ever gets me into a situation where he has a gun pointed at me while demanding my wallet, I would be unlikely to try and outdraw his trigger pull.\nExactly. I think I said that a long time ago. So, I should have this thing handy at all times why? For a preemptive strike? I'd never do that anyway, (so much for #5) and it would make my purse way too heavy for no good reason. Also, I eliminate the #6 possibility where I didn't survive because I had the gun. Logic people. Logic. Play the odds. They're on your side if you leave the gun at home.\n \n \nif you are looking for sexism, you will find it.\nI already did. Read above. I wondered how long it would take for the rape warning. Ever since the topic changed to self protection, the tone has been all about me and why it's just not safe for me to walk out the door. This woman thing is just another strike against me. So how come I'm the one having the nice peaceful life. Not all the rest can say that.",

Evidently, they were only looking for cash, there wasn't any to be found so they literally took the piggy bank. Get a grip.\n\n \n That is good. Have you ever had a fire? Do you have smoke detectors? If you have never had a fire, smoke detectors are a waste of time, right (joking, of course, only an idiot wouldn't have smoke detectors). How often do you wreck you car? Do you still carry insurance? I haven't had an accident in 15 years. My insurance is up to date. I even carry full coverage. \n \n \nIt's that go get 'em attitude and irrational fear that I refuse to lower myself to.\n\n \n Your attitude is one of fear, not mine. I refuse to live in fear of the occasional socially maladjusted individual. This is MY TOWN and I will not have criminals dictate to me where I can go and when. Apparently they have actually scared you to the point that you plan your activities around them. \n \n so sad.\n \n \nBy the way, told my husband last evening about our conversation. Told him somebody said \"as the man of the house\". His answer, \"Oh my God.\" He thinks it's all pretty amusing. You had his ire up for about 10 seconds with the \"trained\" remark. Briefly considered replying himself, but he got over it. He just walked away laughing and saying how much he loves to sig me on the world.\n\n \n \"Man of the house\" is just like \"woman of the house\". It is a lable which explains who I am (generally, \"Man of the house\" would be the oldest male). You are looking for something sexist that simply isn't there. Sorry. Like I said, I know who is in charge around here, and it isn't me. \n \n As far as the \"trained\" remark, the was Emclean, not me. He has a point, though. He was trained by the military to kill. In my book, that certianly makes him a better defender than his wife, who most likely has not had the same training. Of course, if she HAS had the same training, I would still prefer to have emclean between me and trouble, since he is almost certainly bigger, more agressive, and stronger than his wife. \n \n \nThey got that gun because they're an overly aggressive paranoid or just plain a trouble maker.\n\n \n Please back this statement up with facts or statistics that support it. the DOJ has always said that people who have a concealed carry permit are far, far LESS likely to engage in criminal behaviour or initiate hosatile confrontations. \n \n If you actually have backing for this, you may have discovered a new argument fro the antis to use.",

I don't live in the wild wild west. Here I sit in the big bad city never having been the victim of anything. Nor has anyone in my family. The worst thing that happened was 20 years ago when somebody robbed my inlaws house while they WEREN'T HOME. Evidently, they were only looking for cash, there wasn't any to be found so they literally took the piggy bank. Get a grip.\n \n Several, huh? What is it about you that makes you a repetitive victim? Maybe you should rethink where you're hanging out - and possibly your behavior while you're there.\n \n First, 9/11 had nothing to do with gun ownership. Second, why then, oh why, is every cashier and teller trained to give just 'em the money. Why is it that the only ones that make the news are the ones where the guy behind the counter pulled a gun. Frequently, it's his blood on the wall. Armed robbery, that's about the only thing that I seriously envision myself being the victim of. Armed robbers want the money, not me. They're not looking to commit murder unless forced. Nobody has a vendenta against me personally. I can promise you that noone is out there planning my demise. And may I point out, the only reason the armed robber is armed is because of guns. If he wasn't armed he'd pick my pocket, just like in Europe.\n \n Oh goodie. Can't wait to have a fender bender with one of you and get shot as we argue over whose fault it is. Next thing you know, I'll be one more of those \"situations\".\n \n [QUOTE]\n \n Macho men? Gee, let's stick to the topic and avoid the barbs please.\n \n I'm glad you have only had a robbery when you weren't at home. You are very lucky. A friend of mine lost her parents when a man broke the law and brought a firearm into a restaurant and killed quite a few people. You may have heard of the incident, it was the Lubby's Diner in Killeen, Texas. My friend went on to become a state legislator. With her help, the state law was changed to prevent such a tragedy from occuring again.\n \n I used to work in a place that was located in a very bad area. Since Virginia has enacted the right to carry laws, that place has changed dramatically. It is no longer the crime haven it once was. The reason I was put in these situations was due to my job duties. I'll leave it at that.\n \n 9/11 has a lot to do with gun control. Had anyone on those planes been armed with a handgun, 9/11 would not have happened. Yet, the zone of disarmament continues there and other places. Ever notice that violent crimes always happen were guns are forbidden? Like schools? Office buildings? planes? You never see a mass shooting at a gun show...\n \n I disagree with the notion that tellers and counter workers should give over the money. It encourages robbery and crime overall. Twenty years ago, that tactic was okay, today, the criminal mind is more violent and they do it for kicks. It's a mental control thing for them. \n \n As for a fenderbender, again, let's stop with the inuendo and barbs and stick to the topic. Your comments are typical of those who cannot articulate a proper argument for their stance and must result to attempting to ridicule your opponent.

   "Macho men? Gee, let's stick to the topic and avoid the barbs please.\nThis is exactly what it's about. Women and SOME men see problems and how to solve them very differently. Left brain, right brain. There are lots of us out here that just don't find that type of male train of thought logical. Men look for ways to fight back. Women look for ways to not start it in the first place. Luckily there are lots of men out there who share my point of view. That's how they get the girls, too.\n \n Women live in a different culture. We just don't encounter the same kinds of conflict. That's not my weakness. That's my advantage. We're on the outside watching the guys do this testosterone thing. Frankly, some of us are wondering. And can you honestly tell me that there aren't men out there who want a gun just to get that masculine \"edge\"? Those are just the ones that shouldn't have it.\n \n Story from my son this morning. He's 23. 6' 3\". Last night he was at a country western bar/dance hall. Can you imagine. A city boy who loves to line dance. Goes every week. Well, last night he met a girl. Somebody else had his eye on her too. The girl whispered to my son, \"get this guy away from me.\" So, he stepped up behind her and kissed her neck. He was signaling, without saying a word, that he had dibs - thinking the other guy would just back off and give up. Nope. The other guy reached out, grabbed my sons arm and twisted it. My son twisted his arm back the other way - only much harder. Then he let go - looked down at the other guy by about 8 inches and swooshed at the air for the other guy to leave. Said don't make me hurt you. The bar tender was watching and had the bouncer throw the other guy out. That short guy was carrying his broken masculinity in a basket. Now are you going to tell me that the world would be a better place if that short guy had a gun in his car and was waiting for my son in the parking lot? That's the real danger in handing out guns willie nillie. There's no way to put an end to that macho man behaviour. That's exactly what it is - macho men. I'd just prefer it to go down the way it always did. A punch in the mouth. Guns aren't an improvement. Dentists made good money the old-fashioned way. I'm more than willing to take my chances with the armed robber - whom, if I had my way, would have a very hard time being armed in the first place.\n \n We did, however, find a girl who likes hiding behind one of those big strong men. I could give her lessons in how to dump a guy on her own. She didn't need any help. 50 ways to leave your lover. Just get on the bus, Gus. Make a new plan, Stan. la la la la There are much easier ways than starting a bar fight.\n \n Reminds me of a story from a few years ago. My other son who's also 6'3' - except this one is a body builder besides. He belongs to the my body is a temple club. Was in a city traffic jam one day - driving a little Escort. Guy in front of him watching in his rear view mirror mistakenly thought my son flipped him the bird. So he got out and came back to my sons car door. Tried to start something. My son got out of that little car, looked down on my him by, again, about 8 inches, and said - Get back in your car little man. He did. Should somebody have had a gun that day?\n \n Then there's one of that son's friends who got a kick out of starting something just to watch my son finish it. My son had to tell him next time he was on his own. That put an end to that.\n \n I never cease to be amazed at the number of guys that try to take on my big boys. It's not unusual. They go out of their way to do it. What the :xcensored are they thinking. It almost looks like 6'3\" makes them targets like climbing Mount Everest - because it's there - bragging rights for years. What goes on out there amongst the men is not to be believed. Nobody's been successful with my boys yet but maybe if we give guns to everybody else......\n \n \nI'm glad you have only had a robbery when you weren't at home. You are very lucky. A friend of mine lost her parents when a man broke the law and brought a firearm into a restaurant and killed quite a few people. You may have heard of the incident, it was the Lubby's Diner in Killeen, Texas. My friend went on to become a state legislator. With her help, the state law was changed to prevent such a tragedy from occuring again.\nI heard about it. What law could possible stop a nut with a gun? What he did was illegal before and after he did it. He knew that. He didn't care. A new law isn't going to make him care. That's just something extra or different to charge him with after the bodies are picked up. So what was the solution? Metal detector at the restaurant door? How about take away the guns. Now there's a real solution.\n \n \nI used to work in a place that was located in a very bad area. Since Virginia has enacted the right to carry laws, that place has changed dramatically. It is no longer the crime haven it once was. The reason I was put in these situations was due to my job duties. I'll leave it at that.\nThen you always had the right to a carry permit. Every state has always had the availability to people with a valid reason. Everything is a give and take. There's a downside to everything. I'm glad your bad neighborhood is better - but now there could be that guy in the parking lot last night. Nothing got cured. Just spread around.\n \n \n9/11 has a lot to do with gun control. Had anyone on those planes been armed with a handgun, 9/11 would not have happened. Yet, the zone of disarmament continues there and other places. Ever notice that violent crimes always happen were guns are forbidden? Like schools? Office buildings? planes? You never see a mass shooting at a gun show...\nI'm pretty sure that guns on planes is just what they're trying to avoid. And have you noticed that forbidding them isn't having the desired effect? Thank you for making my point.\n \n \nI disagree with the notion that tellers and counter workers should give over the money. It encourages robbery and crime overall. Twenty years ago, that tactic was okay, today, the criminal mind is more violent and they do it for kicks. It's a mental control thing for them. \nSo what are you saying. The average cashier or teller should risk it for the betterment of society? Count me out. Them. Them. Them. The chances of me encountering the THEM criminal is highly unlikely. The chances of me encountering the upstanding nut with a gun is going up every day.\n \n \nAs for a fenderbender, again, let's stop with the inuendo and barbs and stick to the topic. Your comments are typical of those who cannot articulate a proper argument for their stance and must result to attempting to ridicule your opponent. I'll give you a bit of advice, it didn't work for Kerry or the rest of the Democrats and it doesn't work for you. \n \n Mike\nThe fender bender thing. Don't we both wish it wasn't a true story. About as big as the Lubby's Dinner story. Did you hear that one? Couple years ago. Alabama? Louisiana? Woman in the driver's seat pulled her gun and shot the other woman in the face.

Most of the women I know would laugh at your statements. I suggest you look at organizations such as the Second Amendment Sisters, the LibertyBells, and other pro-gun female groups. Also look at the fact that hand gun sales to women are growing at an exponential rate across the nation. \n \n As I stated earlier, I'm very glad you haven't been put in a situation that may mean your life or death. Many people don't have that luxury. Let me tell you about the one time I had to actually fire my handgun in self defense.\n \n About eight years ago, I was on my way home during the early morning hours from a friends house who lived about an hour's drive from my house. On the way home, I ran over something in the road and got a flat tire. I stopped my car and began changing the tire. Bear in mind that I was outside of a town and it was dark and quiet. The nearest house was about a mile away. Just as I got the last nut off the lug, I heard a noise behind me. Turning, I shined the flashlight on three dogs that were approaching me. The dogs appeared to be in very poor health and they were very aggressive. I was in fear for my safety. I shot all three dogs. \n \n To make a long story short, I contacted the local sheriff's dept. once in town, met a deputy, showed him the scene and left once animal control arrived. I got a call a few days later from animal control asking me if the dogs had come in contact with me. Luckily for me, they hadn't. All three dogs were rabid and had attacked several people in the area. \n \n As hard as I might have tried, I don't think reasoning with these animals would have brought about any kind of solution that would have been better. Basically, the point I want to make with this is, you can't reason with many of the dangers you are likely to face in the world. I am prepared for as many of them as I can be in the fullest extent of my abilities. I carry a fire extinguisher, a shovel, a tow strap, and other vital tools in my vehicle... my handgun is just another tool.\n \n However, a handgun has a distinguishing difference from other tools, it also is a guarantee of freedom from oppression.\n \n Is this to say I'm anti-government? Not at all. I've used my handgun to assist an officer in need of help until other deputies arrived to help. \n \n If you choose to not be prepared and not own a gun, that is your choice, you do not however have the right to tell me that I may not. Self defense is the ultimate civil right. I cannot know the intentions of a criminal and I will not allow myself to become a victim of a criminal, government or anyone else without having an opportunity to defend my own life and property. \n \n Your blanket statement about how women think is very untrue and misleading. I know many would find offense by your words. \n \n As for your remarks about automobile accidents... I've been in a couple. Never did as you claim I would. But then again, we were all told that when the semi auto rifle ban expired, the streets would run red with blood. That hasn't happened yet either. \n \n I suppose gun ownership is a matter of mental and emotional maturity. Those who are not as mature assume everyone is like them and shouldn't have guns. Most of America is more mature than that.\n \n Mike",

For one thing, there are plenty of women that carry a gun. not just \"macho men.\" Also, you have to view guns in the context of weapons in general. That other kid could have been waiting for your son in the parking lot with anything deadly--a knife for instance. Or even just to jump him unexpectedly and beat him to death with his fists. No gun law is going to protect your son from being jumped in the parking lot. Even if there were more gun laws, it still doesn't guarantee that a criminal isn't going to get a gun.\n \n There is an odd way of thinking that has arisen since people started fighting against gun ownership so hard that says that guns are to blame for crime and that somehow eliminating that one weapon is going to stop crime. It makes more sense to say that criminals commit crimes, regardless of the weapon. If it's not a gun, it could just as easily be a knife.",

That would be the least of my concerns. Rape is a highly underreported crime. You've successfully listed many reasons why - but you missed one.

Would it surprise you to know my husband had one? 1970s New York State. He had a pistol and he liked to target shoot. But had to get a permit just to transport it back and forth to the firing range. It wasn't a carry permit. It was only to transport it. Took 6-8 weeks for a THOROUGH investigation just to get that. In order to get a carry permit, you had to prove need. What's wrong with that. He got it. He had his fun. He had to wait a little while. So what. I see nothing wrong with discouraging every Tom, Dick, and Harry. And that gun was NEVER going to fall into the hands of a criminal. It was registered. He was fingerprinted. He, personally, was responsibile for that gun -- and he knew it. Not a chance he'd sell it, give it away, pawn it.... Had it ever come up missing, he'd have been on the phone pronto reporting that his gun, serial # ------ was gone. That's responsible gun ownership - when you make somebody truly responsible and answerable.\n \n \nNow if you want to get away from the slippery slope of individual self-protection, then let me ask your opinion of what lies at the heart of the gun control debate: Do you believe that the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual right to keep and bear firearms?\nWhy does everything have to be so black and white. Why does everything have to be taken to the extreme. I just described responsible gun ownership in the last paragraph. But that requires all 50 states to get on board. No buying it down South and bringing it across state lines. My father had guns. He loved to hunt ducks. Kept dogs to do it with.\n \n Do I believe that it should be interpreted so broadly as to put one in every pocket and have it alter the face of our society? No.",

   "One more thing. I'm not naive in case that's what any of you think.\n \n My feminist dad started teaching me early on how to not be the easiest target. He wanted me to be free to move around the world and live my life. He raised all daughters and was determined that we shouldn't let anybody or anything stand in our way.\n \n Example: my daughter-in-law (before they were married) was apartment hunting. I went along. Looked at one apartment. It's the one she got by the way. Had 4 apartments to a building. Big glass front - 2 story floor to ceiling so that the entire foyer was visible from the street. The stairway had open backs so that nobody could hide under the staircase. And I suggested a second story apartment because it's harder to break in to. I pointed out those positives. She looked at me like I was nuts.\n \n That's not something I work at doing. It's an unconscious evaluation of my surroundings. It's automatic for me. Like defensive driving. Not something that gets turned on and off.\n \n So no. I don't think I'm just lucky. Nor am I afraid. It's street wise. A few more women would do well to learn what I was taught. They'd feel less vulnerable. It will probably serve them better than a gun. How to not be the easiest target. My dad used to say, just make it easier for them to pick somebody else. That's all you need. So you can gather that the world wasn't such a wonderful place back then either.",

   "Now see Kickin50, there are probably a lot of things we can agree on. Rape is a horrible crime which is underreported (and you would be truly surprised at how many victims hesitate to report the crime out of fear at how their family and friends will react to the news). It also sounds like you and I can agree that firearm ownership in and of itself is not a bad or evil thing. It seems certain we agree that responsible firearm ownership should be taught and encouraged to those who own firearms (believe it or not, this is what the NRA primarily does).\n \n I'm not here merely to try and score cheap debate points with you. I'm not trying to be your enemy. You shouldn't assume that every question has to be so starkly black and white. I just want to talk with you and share opinions on the private ownership of firearms. For example, I'd like to talk with you about some of the current issues involving firearm restrictions, such as the recent expiration of the AW ban, the ban on possession by convicted felons, etc. To do so, however, I think that we must start with expressing our views on what the Constitution says. My question was: Does an individual right exist? Once we answer this question, then we can move to: What is its scope-what does it protect-which restrictions on the right can survive a constitutional challenge-if they cannot, and if you still wanted the restriction, then could you re-write the law so it could be upheld? (Note that I assume the answer is \"yes, an individual right exists.\" But if you disagree, and want to take the Brady Campaign \"collective\" right interpretation, then I'll gladly discuss that with you as well) In any event I think it was only your fear that I was trying to lay a trap to catch you and run off an \"extreme\" direction which prevented you from answering the question with anything other than \"no\" out of a fear that a \"yes\" answer would \"put one in every pocket and have it alter the face of our society.\" \n \n I recognize that this is a tremendous fear in the \"anti-gun\" community. I'm not trying to lump you into that group, but I do know that too many people within it fear that if they acknowledge an individual RKBA then all restrictions on the right will have to be dissolved and we will see people rushing out to buy their full-auto machine guns and private tanks. I don't know where this knee-jerk reaction comes from in the anti movement, but it does not come from any rational interpretation of constitutional law. In my poor opinion this fear leads to a tremendous amount of Orwellian \"doublethink\" to avoid accepting what the Second Amendment says. But merely admitting that the individual right exists does not spell the doom of all possible regulation of the right. As I have said before, the right cannot be absolute. After all, your rights to free speech and to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures are riddled with exceptions. Likewise, the 2nd. Amendment cannot be free of all limitation.

It was the sport of matching wits with the fish that he loved.\n \n As I've said in so many posts, guns have always been a part of somebody's life in my family. I don't hate them as such.\n \n But...... rifles and shotguns and even pistols, and concealed weapons are just not the same animal. And certainly, there are those carrying concealed weapons that just shouldn't be. Not every gun owner is as stable as we'd wish. \n \n Here's a cut/paste from a post I wrote on 11-19. I was talking about pistols:\n \n As I said before, there has always been allowances for those who truly had a valid reason. Would it surprise you to know my husband had one? 1970s New York State. He had a pistol and he liked to target shoot. But had to get a permit just to transport it back and forth to the firing range. It wasn't a carry permit. It was only to transport it. Took 6-8 weeks for a THOROUGH investigation just to get that. In order to get a carry permit, you had to prove need. What's wrong with that. He got it. He had his fun. He had to wait a little while. So what. I see nothing wrong with discouraging every Tom, Dick, and Harry. And that gun was NEVER going to fall into the hands of a criminal. It was registered. He was fingerprinted. He, personally, was responsibile for that gun -- and he knew it. Not a chance he'd sell it, give it away, pawn it.... Had it ever come up missing, he'd have been on the phone pronto reporting that his gun, serial # ------ was gone. That's responsible gun ownership - when you make somebody truly responsible and answerable.\n \n -------------------------------------------------------\n \n I don't honestly understand what's wrong with that system. I don't see an infringement of anybody's rights - at least not anybody we care about. The problem lies in getting the unauthorized ones off the street - and getting the cooperation of people who are willing to be as responsible as in the last paragraph. And with each day, that problem only gets worse.\n \n It's not a slippery slope. It's a system used for many years - in some places.\n \n At the risk of being called an elitist :) some of this problem may come from the migration of population in the last few decades. The population density has shifted to cities and states that never coped before - with everything that a large population means - from traffic jams to crime. There's a culture clash going on. Those \"new\" big cities and states are dealing in the way that has historically served them well. As the method \"catches on\" to cities that never did, we're not taking to these ideas so well. We're saying, hey, we've got generations of practice and our methods work, too. The concept of readily available hand guns and concealed weapons is changing OUR long standing way of life.

My wifes grandfatehr was all for the assault weapon ban, stating \"nobody needs something like that\" until I pointed out that he owns 3 of them.\n \n The label \"assault weapon\" is something that was pushed off on us by the anti gunners. It is not something that people generally familiar with firearms EVER used in conneciton to any semi automatic only weapons until the Anits changed its meaning with the Assault weapon ban.\n \n \nBasically, the problem comes in when we hear about bullets designed to go through bullet proof vests and huge clips that can mow down trees.

They are generally not available on the civilian market. This is another of those technical problems. A .17 will go through a bulletproof vest easily. That is a reound commonly used for furbearers. A jacketed .308, 30-06, or a 7MM magnum will also go through a bulletproof vest easily. Those are the most popular deer hunting rounds in the country. In my state (kansas) the only round legal to hunt deer with that would not penetrate a bullet proof vest is a .30-.30, and that is not a very popular deer round anymore (many people consider it underpowered).\n \n \nI don't honestly understand what's wrong with that system.

It is not logical. you are still arguing that by regulating law abiding citizens, you are somehow going to effect criminals. This doesn't make sense. How is making the guy who has never had any mental problems, any kind of criminal tendancies, jump through a bunch of hoops, going to effect people who are not inclined to follow the law? This is just a logical fallacy. It is non linear reasoning. \n \n \nAt the risk of being called an elitist :) some of this problem may come from the migration of population in the last few decades.

Bet you never thought of it that way. So you see, it's not about you as much as it's about me.\n\n \n But you are incorrect when you say that your methods work. Crime has always been much higher in cities. Always, no exceptions. This would imply that the problem is not with us country bumpkins, or in the way we do things, but with you all city folk and the way YOU do things. Your methods have never worked well, ever. Cities have always been crime ridden, and the polices they enact in an attempt to alleviate the crime problem have always backfired. Elitest? I think not. You folks have social problems that the rest of us cannot even fathom, and frankly, to a lot of the country, it seems that you all are a bunch of XXXXXX. You pass up common sense answers to simple problems, instead preferring to complicate the hell out of everything and base policy decisions on a bunch of idealistic garbage.\n \n I live in the country in a fairly rural community. Over 90% of the people in my county own guns. I know for a fact that everybody on my road has at least 2 guns in tehri house. We have MUCH lower crime that just about any city you might care to list. On my road, there has NEVER been a violent crime, despite the fact that we have more guns per capita (by SEVERL orders of magnitude) than most places in the US (this is largely due to my personal collection, which is extensive).\n \n I am not sure where these peopel come from who are not able to look at a problem and come up with a solution, but instead view a problema nd come up with something that is not only NOT a solution, but does not even remotely touch on the problem. \n \n This is the problem with most gun control legislation. Most of it has absolutly NO crime control element built into it, despite the fact that crime control is almost always stated as the problem that they are tryign to address. Having stringent requirements for weapn permits has NOTHING to do with crime control. It is completely lacking in any type of crime control element. It is simply annoying those who are already inclined to follow the law.\n \n An example of a GOOD gun control law, that being one that DOES posess a crime control element, can be found in many states (my own included). Here in Ks, if you are caught in the comission of a burglary, and you are armed with a firearm, you recieve an automatic 5 years in jail. This is a GOOD gun control law. It is enforcable, it targets criminals, not law abiding citizens and it addresses a problem. States and cities that have similar laws experience a significantly lower level of armed burglaries. Oddly enough, New york state and New york City do not have such laws. LA does not have such a law, nor does the styate of california. They have instead chosen idiot measures that have NO effect on criminals, but TARGET law abiding citizens. This is lunacy.",

I, too was originally from a big city. It wasn't until I had been out of there for several years that I realised that they are full of XXXXXX and I had been one of them. One day I just kind of woke up and realised that the folks we kind of looked down on as country bumpkins were applying comon sense a lot more liberally than us sophisticated city folk did. \n \n To be entirely honest, I used to make the same arguments that we see here. It sis just kindof what you are raised to believe or maybe it is more social prjudice that you pick up along the way. It took me quite a while to realise that it was a completley rediculous viewpoint.\n \n I think a lot of this has to do with the differnce in the level of independance you see between country folk and city folk. If you have a problem uin the city, you call the cops, and eventualyl they show up. BUT, you see them all over the place (mostly writing tickets) and that makes you feel secure (despite the fact that nationwide conviction rates are abysmally low, and most cities test their cops to ensure that they are not very smart). In the country, you have aproblem, you call the cops, and then you deal with it as best you can for the 15 or 20 minutes it takes for them to get there. Same goes with an ambulance, or a fire truck. You get a flat in the city, you wander up to the nearest gas station or house and use the phone to call for help, or you use your sell phone. If you are out in the sticks, you chuck the cell phone in the back seat (odds are you don't get reception) and get the spare on before you freeze to death. \n \n If you have never lived in abig city, I would higly recommend you try it, but move away before you loose all your common sense. It really helps you understand the governemtn nanny mentality, because folks there are so dependant on the syatem and on having a bunch of service types running around doing things for them that they never really have to think.\n \n In the coutry, even today, you do for yourself or you do without.",

I don't know why they bother with background checks at all. They're just a sales tool used to convince people like me that the pro-gun community is attempting to compromise. They're obviously not doing any good. The problem with guns is that they're cheap. Relatively. You can quote the $1000 dollar model that you bought and love dearly - would never let out of your sight - but they're also available for much less. A murder weapon, a criminal tool, is so inexpensive that it can be considered a disposable item. No matter how much it cost or didn't cost, no matter what's the individual invested emotionally or didn't invest emotionally, it's still a gun. That's the link that ties. You're forever tied to that other kind of gun owner, whether you like it or not. Gun ownership is your commonality.

You folks have social problems that the rest of us cannot even fathom, and frankly, to a lot of the country, it seems that you all are a bunch of XXXXXX. You pass up common sense answers to simple problems, instead preferring to complicate the hell out of everything and base policy decisions on a bunch of idealistic garbage.\nFirst, it worked fairly well for many many decades. You're choosing to ignore the WHY it broke down. Because we're states not countries. We have no border security. Back in the day, before interstates and fast cars and lots of money to made in the gun industry, there just wasn't that much importing of guns between states - from states that weren't regulating them. The day came when we were swamped in them because they had been illegally transported across state lines. It didn't sneak up on us. We knew it was happening and we knew it when it was happening. There just was no way to stop it.\n \n I'll glady address \"policy decisions on a bunch of idealistic garbage\" at the end.\n \n \nI live in the country in a fairly rural community. Over 90% of the people in my county own guns. I know for a fact that everybody on my road has at least 2 guns in tehri house. We have MUCH lower crime that just about any city you might care to list. On my road, there has NEVER been a violent crime, despite the fact that we have more guns per capita (by SEVERL orders of magnitude) than most places in the US (this is largely due to my personal collection, which is extensive).\nThis one you're ignoring the WHY we have crime. High population areas are what they are. It's never going to change. It's an environment where people who can't afford to live in your neighborhood reside. They simply don't have the assets to head out to the open sky and buy themselves a plot of land. But we'll glady build some low income housing in your town. Can you just imagine the town hall meeting that would bring. What's your logical solution to that? We seem to have missed it here. Everybody there has a gun so you'll teach 'em a lesson or kill 'em off? Problem solved. Do you have jobs there for them to pull themselves out of poverty? Barring those, what are you going to do with those hungry kids?\n \n It's an environment where we bump elbows and it's possible to offend each other's space minute to minute. Arming ourselves certainly doesn't solve that. It makes it worse.\n \n Speaking on non-linear. You're out in the country where there are no opportunities for the segment of the population that has the social problems. Frankly, they have no reason to even visit there. You knew that. That's why you went there. Then you argue that you don't have these problems BECAUSE of your guns. NO. Guns didn't solve it. It never existed.\n \n \nI am not sure where these peopel come from who are not able to look at a problem and come up with a solution, but instead view a problema nd come up with something that is not only NOT a solution, but does not even remotely touch on the problem.\nWhat I just said. We have the problem. We have the solution. You don't have the problem but won't allow us to institute the solution.\n \n \nHowever you did say above \"You folks have social problems that the rest of us cannot even fathom\".\n Admittedly, you can't fathom it but you're pretty sure you have the solution.\n \n \nThis is the problem with most gun control legislation. Most of it has absolutly NO crime control element built into it, despite the fact that crime control is almost always stated as the problem that they are tryign to address. Having stringent requirements for weapn permits has NOTHING to do with crime control. It is completely lacking in any type of crime control element. It is simply annoying those who are already inclined to follow the law.\nWe're not about crime control. We're about crime prevention. The jails are full.\n \n \nAn example of a GOOD gun control law, that being one that DOES posess a crime control element, can be found in many states (my own included). Here in Ks, if you are caught in the comission of a burglary, and you are armed with a firearm, you recieve an automatic 5 years in jail. This is a GOOD gun control law. It is enforcable, it targets criminals, not law abiding citizens and it addresses a problem. States and cities that have similar laws experience a significantly lower level of armed burglaries. Oddly enough, New york state and New york City do not have such laws. LA does not have such a law, nor does the styate of california. They have instead chosen idiot measures that have NO effect on criminals, but TARGET law abiding citizens. This is lunacy.\nIt's not a gun control law at all. It's a punishment law.\n \n \nBasically, the problem comes in when we hear about bullets designed to go through bullet proof vests and huge clips that can mow down trees. We don't see the sport to be found in those things.\nAs usual, no answer to the sporting aspects of guns. I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt. You could at least pick up on it. I'm trying to find some reason for your thinking OTHER than dictating to us how to solve our problems and run our lives. You won't let me.\n \n \nthe problem is compounded by the media, all you hear are inflated clames desined to scare people into watching the news.\n \n personaly i do not see a problem with something like this, but the problem is the politishins who say that redstration is just the first step, to be folled by banning the guns (Dian Finstine {i know it is spelled wrong} is an example of one)\nWe're not falling victims to scare tactics. We fully understand when a statement is designed to inflame. Do you? This is just an argument that's ramping up using any possible lame argument. Including politishins who say that redstration is just the first step But gun crime is real. We're so totally caught up in the BS catch phrases that the real debate is lost.\n \n \nwho gets to decide if i need one? i drive through Gary In. every working day (#5 of the worst for crime), how can some one sitting back in my home town know weather or not it is a need? also the Indiana Constitution tells me i have a right to self defence.\nYep. Gary In. isn't a nice place. Agreed. Why is just driving through such a hazard? Is there something special about you that makes you different from the other hundreds or thousands of cars around you? Do you have to carry cash? Do you have to leave the beaten path? Are you driving a $100,000 car? Do you have to do this in the middle of the night? Are you visually offensive? :) Sorry. Couldn't resist that last one. Just trying to have a little fun.\n \n \nreporting it stolen would not keep it out of the hands of criminals, they do not care about the SN, they scrach it off. \nYou're jumping ahead to the world we do live in rather than the one we could create. It's not about what the police would do. That's up to them. It's would be about (1) him recognizing that he alone was authorized to posses that gun, (2) taking a vested interest in making sure that it wasn't stolen to begin with and (3) protecting himself from being held criminally liable for what was done with that gun after it left his possession. These are the elements of responsible gun ownership. Not the NRA (and I'm quoting from Bryan here) --- It seems certain we agree that responsible firearm ownership should be taught and encouraged to those who own firearms (believe it or not, this is what the NRA primarily does). --- \"Encouraged\" isn't the word we want to hear.\n \n \nand daewoo, we need to jump on her, she may be ignorant of the word games we see all the time,but i do not think she is stupid, she was just resed in a big city.\nSo much for wanting to understand my point of view. But I do appreciate the not stupid part. As for the big city, you couldn't drag me out of here kicking and screaming.",

   "Surprise. I actually did know that these descriptive names aren't all that useful - although I couldn't quote the .17 .308 30-06 etc. It doesn't alter your PR problem.\n\n \n It is absolutly a PR problem, but not one that is easy to solve. We have the antis preying on peoples ignorance here, and in order to straighten things out you have to convince people that it is important enough to bother learning baout such things.\n \n \nOf course it makes sense. In order to make them readily available to you, they're readily available to everybody. I don't know why they bother with background checks at all. They're just a sales tool used to convince people like me that the pro-gun community is attempting to compromise. They're obviously not doing any good. The problem with guns is that they're cheap. Relatively. You can quote the $1000 dollar model that you bought and love dearly - would never let out of your sight - but they're also available for much less. A murder weapon, a criminal tool, is so inexpensive that it can be considered a disposable item. No matter how much it cost or didn't cost, no matter what's the individual invested emotionally or didn't invest emotionally, it's still a gun. That's the link that ties. You're forever tied to that other kind of gun owner, whether you like it or not. Gun ownership is your commonality. Every step to protect your rights enables them.\n\n \n But illegal guns are cheaper than legal ones. I bought my wife a little H&K .40 last year to carry. It is what our local KBI agent refers to as a \"grey market item\". It was smuggled in from mexico to be sold on the streets. I gave $400 for it, brand new in box, and had the local sheriffs department run a make on the number just to be sure it had never been stolen, etc... In a gun shop, that is a $1000 item. This is an entirely untraceable weapon (or at least was before I had the local sheriffs department check it out) and was less than half the price of the same item at a gun store, which is fairly tracable. \n \n \n \nFirst, it worked fairly well for many many decades. You're choosing to ignore the WHY it broke down. Because we're states not countries. We have no border security. Back in the day, before interstates and fast cars and lots of money to made in the gun industry, there just wasn't that much importing of guns between states - from states that weren't regulating them. The day came when we were swamped in them because they had been illegally transported across state lines. It didn't sneak up on us. We knew it was happening and we knew it when it was happening. There just was no way to stop it.\n\n \n No, it didn't. It NEVER WORKED. There has NEVER been a time in our nations history where cities had less crime than suburban or rural areas. This has been true in America since the 1800's. At one time people farily routinely carried firearms in NY city. It was decided that gun crime wa a problem, so they put restrictions on guns. Crime went UP in response as the criminals realised that they could now prey on their victims without any real fear of reprecussions. Instead of recognising that the plan was flawed, the fine libs running the place came to the conclusion that they just hadn't gone far enough. So they tightened restrictions more, and crime went up again. Still didn't get the point, that you cannot legislate the actions of criminals and having a completely defenseless society, full of citizens who are unable to effectively defend themselves from crime, is NOT the way to curb crime, they tightened them AGAIN and crime went up AGAIN.\n \n Places with very tight gun control laws in the US have higer crime. That is all there is to it. It is indesputable. The argument that this is only the case because theya re being brought in across the border holds no water. You really think that by limiting guns to law abiding citizens you are going to effect criminals? Drugs are illegal. They bring them in from OTHeR COUNTRIES, and there seem to be plenty of them. You don't think the same would be true with guns if they made them illegal? Theya re already smuggling them and they aren't even illegal, and the smugglers find it so easy to do that they can sell cheaper than the gun shops. Unlike drugs that you can use a dog to find, guns have no distinctive odor. They ar just hunks of metal. Stick them in a crate labeled \"machine parts\" and mail them. I know a couple of guys in the home gunsmithing community who routinely do this with parts and part kits for guys in canada, and it is no big deal. You take a parts kit for an AK-47 or an uzi, break it into 2 seperate packages, and put \"lathe parts\" or \"mill parts\" on the customs paperwork and it si good to go. Customs watches small shipments like that a LOT closer than they watch containers or trucks. The guy I bought that pistol from for my wife had hundreds of them.\n \n \nThis one you're ignoring the WHY we have crime. High population areas are what they are. It's never going to change. It's an environment where people who can't afford to live in your neighborhood reside. They simply don't have the assets to head out to the open sky and buy themselves a plot of land. But we'll glady build some low income housing in your town. Can you just imagine the town hall meeting that would bring. What's your logical solution to that? We seem to have missed it here. Everybody there has a gun so you'll teach 'em a lesson or kill 'em off? Problem solved. Do you have jobs there for them to pull themselves out of poverty? Barring those, what are you going to do with those hungry kids?\n \n\n \n I live abotu 10 miles from the biggest low income housing development int eh state. Emporia kansas is the proud home of IBP (Iowa beef packers) it is the ONLY non union packing plant in the coutnry and it is almost entirely staffed by illegal aliens. Emporia is like a mecca to illegals coming over from mexico because they know they can get a high paying job here if they simply provide a randomly chosen social security number. If you follow I-35 south through texas and make your way to any of the mjor border crossings, on the mexican side, there is invariably a sign showing the distance to emporia, Ks. I have seen them. Unfortunatly, we end up with about 3 times as many illegals as IBP can provide jobs to at one time, so we end up in a situation where we have a whole bunch of fresh across the borde illegal aliens running aorund who can't find work and often as not have their entire family in tow.\n \n Illegal aliens commit BY FAR more crime than any other group, especially the ones who are newly arrived. I have heard that this is because they are used to rural mexican law, which is close to non existant. I am told by those who harvest our pecan orchard (who are all mexican, but not illegals) that one of the warnings they get when they come here from the other mexicans that are laready here is that everybody has a gun. They know that if they tryt to break into somebodies house, there is a better than average chance they will be shot. If they try to carjack somebody, there is an excellent cahnce that they will end up with a bullet between the eyes.\n \n There are not really many shootings around. You don't have to shoot anybody. The guy who is willing to steal from you when there is little or no risk to himslef is certainly not willing to do it when there is a good chance he will be killed. \n \n \nIt's an environment where we bump elbows and it's possible to offend each other's space minute to minute. Arming ourselves certainly doesn't solve that. It makes it worse.\n\n \n Can you prove that, becasue the numbers certainly disagree with you. You seem to be living in the fantasy world created by the antis where you get in a fender bender and people start blowing each other away, or youhave a dispute with the guy next door about blowing leaves in your yard and he takes you out with a bazooka. Sorry, just doesn't happen.\n \n \nSpeaking on non-linear. You're out in the country where there are no opportunities for the segment of the population that has the social problems. Frankly, they have no reason to even visit there. You knew that. That's why you went there. Then you argue that you don't have these problems BECAUSE of your guns. NO. Guns didn't solve it. It never existed.\n\n \n Bull. The coutry is full of poor white trash. As far as no reason for the criminal element to visit, bull again. Occasionally some mron will get the bright idea that farm houses are a good polace to burglarise. They are isolated, nobody is generlly home during the day, none of them have alarms, and if you screw up and do one where somebody is home, you can be long gone before the cops show up. They learn before long that we take an interest in our neiborghs. If I see a strange car at the house down the road when I don't think anybody should be there, I will go down and check on things to make sure everything is OK. If they pick the wrong house, one where people are home, they don't ahve plenty of time to get away before the police arrive. They catch a load of buckshot in the face and lay there dead until the coroner takes them away. Who ever heard of a farmer that didn't have a gun??\n \n \nWhat I just said. We have the problem. We have the solution. You don't have the problem but won't allow us to institute the solution.\n\n \n But your \"solution\" impacts me, and has nothign to do with the problem. Not only that , you folks have been trying your \"solution\" a little at a time for years, and every time you institute a little more of your \"solution\" the problem gets worse. This heavily suggests that your \"solution\" is not a \"solution\" to the problem at hand. If you are not going to deal with the problem, why should I have to suffer through your idiotic \"solutions\"?\n \n \nAdmittedly, you can't fathom it but you're pretty sure you have the solution.\n\n \n I don't have the solution. You folks have destroyed your cities to the point that a bulldozer and starting fresh may well be the solution. I do know, because we have data from the DOJ, that your solution certainly does not work. I know it never will because it never has, mostly because it is entirely illogical. \n \n \nIt's not a gun control law at all. It's a punishment law.\n\n \n No, it is gun control. It attaches penalties for the use of a firearm in a burglary. And IT WORKS. I can show with statistcs that IT WORKS. you, on the other hand, can only show that your gun control concepts are an utter failure everywhere they have been tried, not only here in the US, but in the rest of the world. In south Africa, posession of an illegal firearm can get you the death penalty, and they STILL have major problems with crime related gun use. \n \n \nAs usual, no answer to the sporting aspects of guns. I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt. You could at least pick up on it. I'm trying to find some reason for your thinking OTHER than dictating to us how to solve our problems and run our lives. You won't let me.\n\n \n The sporting aspect of guns are well known and I don't think in debate here. \n \n \n I really don't care how you solve your problems, as long as I don't have to pay for the solution or be inconvenienced by it. You guys created the problems, go ahead and solve them, but do it witouht penalising me or infringing on my rights, and for gods sake, this time around, try to actually solve the problem instead of simply making it worse like you have in the past.\n \n It hardly seems that I am the one here trying to dictate to others how to live their lives. I want people to be as free as possible to live their lives as they see fit. I am not telling you \"go out and get a gun\" I am telling you to keep your nose out of other peoples business, and if THEY want to gou out and get a gun, let them do it.

   "OK. So I went to the DOJ website and found out what I expected to find out. There has been a drop in crime over the last ten years. However, it's widespread and fairly consistent. There has been similar drops in states that allow carrying to the states that don't.\n \n Also, we're both correct on one thing. We do live in different worlds.

   "1. The Question of the NRA's image problem\n \n Does the NRA have an image problem? Absolutely. Does the NRA turn this image problem to its own advantage? You bet. It is no secret that for years the NRA has been given a negative treatment by \"mainstream\" media outlets. Sometimes the anti-NRA bias is subtle. For example, consider how often you have read an article and glossed over the different phrasing used to convey either sympathy for or opposition to remarks by spokesmen---The Brady Campaign spokesman who \"shows,\" \"demonstrates,\" and \"points out the fact that\" as compared to the NRA spokesman who \"complains,\" \"whines,\" or \"would like us to believe.\" Other times the anti-NRA bias is more blatant, as evidenced by the adoration and praise heaped upon Michael Bellesiles' work Arming America, which was immediately followed by cries of an NRA \"smear campaign\" when scholars started questioning the facts behind the book, only to be followed by a collective silence when the author's research was indeed proven to be fraudulent. Consider also the media's treatment of Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine as it blanched and fell silent when confronted with absolute lies like Moore's assumption that the NRA and the Klan have some common past and/or common goals, and his portrayal of then NRA president Charlton Heston as a racist. \n \n Far more interesting, however, is how the NRA not only survives but thrives in this negative media environment. Indeed, the NRA has several times the membership of the Brady Campaign. And oh, if I had only a nickel for every time the NRA successfully pointed out an example of the media bias against it and used it to try and foster a \"your rights are under siege\" mentality in its membership drives. So yes, I believe that the NRA does have a negative media image, but I also believe that the NRA has proved adept at using this kind of media preaching to \"keep the pews full on Sunday.\" \n \n 2. Do arguments in support of an individual RKBA \"enable\" those who seek to use firearms in crimes of violence? \n \n That's a very interesting argument, and I confess I gave some thought to how I would answer this indictment if it were ever leveled at me. I think my answer would be \"maybe,\" depending on your point of view. Those who would say \"yes\" assume that I oppose a particular effort to ban or restrict the possession of firearms which, if enacted over my objections, would guarantee a significant reduction in gun crime. Before I am tagged with this label, however, I request that someone first show me such a law and then provoke me to oppose it without just cause. \n \n This obviously lead me to another question: Without doing what I suggest above, can someone still rationalize the belief that I am an \"enabler\" of gun-toting criminals merely because I argue that the 2nd. Amendment's \"right of the people\" is an individual right? Perhaps, but it depends on how the reader answers the following questions: When the ACLU lawyer stands up and defends the 1st. Amendment's \"right of the people\" to peacefully assemble, march, and petition the government for a redress of grievances, would you hail him as a defender of our liberties or label him an \"enabler\" of the hate-filled klansman he represents? When another lawyer writes a brief requesting the Supreme Court to rule that the 4th. Amendment's \"right of the people\" to be free of unreasonable search and seizure prohibited the police from establishing a drug checkpoint on your highway, do you applaud his tireless defense of your right to be free from further governmental encroachment, or do you condemn him for \"enabling\" drug dealers to enjoy a greater freedom to traffic their poison free from governmental interference? And, for those who are pro-choice, if a lawyer representing NARAL argued before the Supreme Court against further state encroachment on the currently recognized individual right to abortion, would you crown the lawyer as a defender of a woman's right to chose, or would you condemn her as an \"enabler\" of \"baby killers\"? If the reader is ready to condemn them, then I can see how he or she could also consider me an \"enabler\" of gun crime. In the end, it all depends on the reader's own bias for or against firearms. In particular, does the reader feel that the worthy law enforcement goal of eliminating gun crime justifies the sacrifice of the individual right to keep and bear them? If so, then am I to be my brother's keeper? Would you ignore my consistent history of the peaceful exercise of my RKBA when you unilaterally decide that another's criminal misuse of this individual right excuses the attempt to eliminate mine? If your answer would be \"yes,\" then do you feel that the end justifies the means for this right only, or can this logic be applied to other civil liberties? \n \n --------------------------\n \"[I]t is . . . immaterial that the intrusion was in aid of law enforcement. Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\"-Justice Louis Brandeis, from Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 479 (1928), explaining his belief that evidence from a wiretap obtained in violation of the 4th. Amendment must be suppressed.\n \n \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming its not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard don't see the danger of the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" Alan Dershowitz, quoted in David T. Hardy, The Conceptual Foundations of Anglo-American Jurisprudence in Religion and Reason, 62 Tenn L. Rev. 759 (1995).",

   "Amendment's \"right of the people\" to peacefully assemble, march, and petition the government for a redress of grievances, would you hail him as a defender of our liberties or label him an \"enabler\" of the hate-filled klansman he represents?\n\n \n \nWhen another lawyer writes a brief requesting the Supreme Court to rule that the 4th. Amendment's \"right of the people\" to be free of unreasonable search and seizure prohibited the police from establishing a drug checkpoint on your highway, do you applaud his tireless defense of your right to be free from further governmental encroachment, or do you condemn him for \"enabling\" drug dealers to enjoy a greater freedom to traffic their poison free from governmental interference?\n\n \n \nAnd, for those who are pro-choice, if a lawyer representing NARAL argued before the Supreme Court against further state encroachment on the currently recognized individual right to abortion, would you crown the lawyer as a defender of a woman's right to chose, or would you condemn her as an \"enabler\" of \"baby killers\"?\n\n \n \nIf the reader is ready to condemn them, then I can see how he or she could also consider me an \"enabler\" of gun crime. In the end, it all depends on the reader's own bias for or against firearms. In particular, does the reader feel that the worthy law enforcement goal of eliminating gun crime justifies the sacrifice of the individual right to keep and bear them? If so, then am I to be my brother's keeper? Would you ignore my consistent history of the peaceful exercise of my RKBA when you unilaterally decide that another's criminal misuse of this individual right excuses the attempt to eliminate mine? If your answer would be \"yes,\" then do you feel that the end justifies the means for this right only, or can this logic be applied to other civil liberties? \n \n \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming its not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard don't see the danger of the big picture.(1995).\nEach of the \"rights\" you've quoted above have been limited in some way. We can assemble - if we can get a permit. And we can't sue the government. The Patriot Act pretty well finished off unreasonable search along with a few others. And the \"right\" to abortion - well, we'll talk after the new Supreme Court.\n \n Each of those could be rightfully debated individually. Each of them is under attack for the same reason - the need to protect one citizen from another.\n \n The peaceful assembly could turn in to a riot. There's the disruption to traffic and commerce, cost of police protection which must be born by all and the possible looted businesses to consider if it gets out of hand.\n \n The Patriot Act - obvious. I could be a terrorist?!?! So they simply redefined \"reasonable\" I guess. Who do I seek rederess from about that? I'll bet they didn't refund the cost of Cat Steven's airline ticket.\n \n Abortion. Can't believe you even used that example. The issue here is the rights of the unborn. Can I declare a fetus as a tax deduction? Yeah. Why not. Gave it full support and took it to the doctor.\n \n The solution always lies in compromise. One persons right often infringes on anothers. Every \"right\" has consequences to another. Gun control is no different. A little common sense. At the moment, that's completely lacking. As the NRA wants to interpret, it does enable. That's not necessary.\n \n Why do all the honest, upstanding, law abiding gun owners fight so hard to keep from proving that they are just that with true registration laws. Why do they fear taking true reponsibility for their own gun? Could the answer be the obvious one. They're not willing to guarantee that every day, for the rest of their lives, they will continue to be honest, upstanding and law abiding. They can't guarantee they're not going to OOPS! Shot the wrong guy. If it comes down to it, they want the option of throwing that gun in the river. They can mask it all they want, but the bottom line is always the same. When somebody (or in this case a group) fights that hard, the reason is always self serving - not a desire to protect the Constitution.",

   "1. That&#8217;s a very interesting argument, and I confess I gave some thought to how I would answer this indictment if it were ever leveled at me. I think my answer would be &#8220;maybe,&#8221; depending on your point of view. Those who would say &#8220;yes&#8221; assume that I oppose a particular effort to ban or restrict the possession of firearms which, if enacted over my objections, would guarantee a significant reduction in gun crime. Before I am tagged with this label, however, I request that someone first show me such a law and then provoke me to oppose it without just cause. \n\n \n To me, this is the big question in the debate. With the tens of thousands of firearms related laws on the books, nobody has yet to show that a single one of them has significantly impacted crime related gun use or ownership. I fail to see how, lacking any evidence that these laws have been effective, we can possibly justify passing any more such laws without some kind of reasonable expectation that it will work.\n \n Gun bans do not seem to work. They have been tried, and have failed. The rational that \"they haven't worked because they are still legal in other states\" seems like it could be easily expanded, in the event that the anti gunners fondest dreams to come true, to \"It hasn't worked because they are not banned in other countries\".\n \n Bans have failed miserably in the attempt to control gun violence. Registration has shown itself to be entirely ineffective. Regulating what type of weapon people may have has proven to be a worthless endeavor, as have, apparently, tens of thousands of other firearm laws we have in this country.\n \n Lacking any evidence of these firearms laws actually being usefull, I fail to understand the mindset that we need more. Do people actually believe that there is some magic silver bullet gun legislation out there that will convert gun toting criminals into disarmed model citizens?\n \n Show me a gun control law that has a reasonable chance of reducing gun crime, and I would support it. Unfortunatly, no such law has been suggested. Onstead we get a bunch of foolish laws that are based on requirements that only law abiding citizens are going to be inclined to obey anyway.",

   "You know, I've never understood why we kept Cat Stevens out of the country to begin with. It didn't sound like he was wearing Richard Reid's spare set of sneakers or anything dangerous like that. \n \n You are absolutely right when you point out that all the other rights I used as examples are subject to rational limitation. I used them because they are no different from the RKBA. They are all individual rights. Each of these, just like the RKBA, is under attack from a powerful lobby which champions the need to protect one citizen from another. The abortion right I spoke of there was not a right of a fetus, but the Roe v. Wade right of a woman to chose to terminate her pregnancy. (and this, by the way, is just an analogy. I am not trying to open up an abortion debate here. If I ever chose to do so, then I'll go visit the abortion page)\n \n Whenever anyone wants to debate the RKBA, the first issue is to define whether it is an individual right. This is where the main battle is currently being fought. We can talk all day about extremists in the \"no compromise\" pro-gun crowd, but the debate is not one-sided, and at the other end of the street we find the \"no compromise\" gun ban crowd. There is a very vocal minority in the gun control movement which argues for the abolishment of all private firearm ownership. Members of this minority have held leadership positions in gun control organizations in the past, and it is this crowd which stirs up emotions in the entire pro-gun crowd. Quite frankly, these fringe elements on both side of the isle spend so much time yelling at each other they prevent any meaningful debate. If you read anything written by either side of this extreme you see how they feed off each other. \n \n For example, it takes only a limited search of no compromise gunny statements to see how they complain that organizations like the Brady Campaign have tried to cut and past the RKBA out of the Constitution with the imagined \"collective rights\" theory of the 2nd. Amendment. They have seen that the BC's interpretation of the amendment would replace the phrase \"the right of the people\" with \"the right of the states\" or \"the right of the states to provide arms for their militias.\" They saw officials of the previous presidential administration argue before our courts that the individual citizen has no right to possess any firearm for any reason at any time (except for a government issued weapon while on active duty with the military/national guard). They also decry the deliberate misinterpretation of cases like U.S. v. Miller. The gunny saw John Kerry stage a photo op at which he was given a Remington semi-auto shotgun, and then he reads in his NRA magazine the facts that Kerry voted to ban the very gun he was given as well as his support for a law that would make it a crime for the man to give him the gun without a background check. \n \n Is the no compromise gunny concerned about registration? You bet. He complains all the time about how registration is a punishment imposed only upon the law abiding. He constantly complains about how registration has been a stepping stone to ban and confiscation in other countries. He broadcasts statistics to prove how ineffective registration has been in preventing crimes with firearms, and he gleefully points out the mass resistance which is destroying Canada's registration scheme. He claims there is a gun ban \"hidden agenda,\" which he finds in the following quote from the founder of the CPHV and former HCI chairman Nelson T. Shields: \n \n \"We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal.\"\n \n In short, he doesn't trust the BC talking heads who assure him they won't take away his guns, but on the other hand tell their friends that guns are immoral and have no purpose in our society, that the world would be better off without guns, and that they could ban his guns if they wanted to because he had no right to have them. To quote (which he often does) Senator Boxer, who said that if she could have gotten the votes she would have been saying \"Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.\" \n \n You see, there is an inherent dishonesty in the gun ban movement which raises the ire of the entire pro-gun side of the debate, myself included. This in turn leads the fringe absolutist wing of the pro-gun camp to try and fight fire with fire, which leads the gun ban crowd to accuse them of being dishonest, etc. \n \n I can muster arguments all day long for why the RKBA is individual, but I don't suffer fools gladly and I get tired of arguing with people who have a deliberately imperfect memory when they argue for the collective rights theory of the RKBA. The gun ban advocate will simply chose to ignore any fact, either historical or otherwise, which is cited to him if that fact dares contradict his personal opinion of the RKBA. How can I try and offer any rational view of a properly limited individual RKBA to such a person, particularly when the pro-gun fanatic sees his dishonesty cries \"See, see, I told you so! Give him an inch and he'll take all your guns!\"? \n \n I would much rather talk with you, Kickin50, because you seem to agree that the right is individual. This is why I offered my olive branch. The real issue for me (and, I hope for you) is how to define the scope of the individual RKBA? What does it protect, and what regulation will it permit? Is there a framework for interpreting the right which can be used to test the constitutionality of laws which restrict or regulate the right? I think I have been able to come up with one. My view of the right is probably going to be more expansive then yours, but that's OK. I choose to talk with you because I think we could discuss the issue and even disagree with each other while acting like adults without having to resort to shouting at each other.\n \n --------------------------------------------\n \n \"Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?\"-Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at p. 386.",
