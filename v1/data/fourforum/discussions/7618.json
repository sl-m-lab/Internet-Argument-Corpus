   "I'd be described by many as \"right wing\", although considering all the baggage that goes along with that title, I'd prefer not. Regardless, both the internet hackers as well as those defacing the posters (from the above link) are committing criminal actions. \n First, the hackers: if they truly are conservatives that believe what they are doing is right, they are quite wrong. By going outside the law to fight for their beliefs, they essentially forfeit their position. They do more harm, overall, to their supposed right wing brethren than good. I would like to point that out ESPECIALLY in light of our society, which loves to side with people it sees as oppressed or the underdog (in this case, the liberal webmasters) and further if this hits the news-well, you can imagine these sites will get a spike in web traffic. \n Second, the posters: we have the right to free speech in America, but that right is not extended to the destruction of property, in this case, the property of the Catholics who put up the posters (fyi, I'm Catholic). If they wish to fight these posters, they can either put up their own posters next to them (with their own money) or simply ignore them.",
