   "I disagree, plenty of governments in western countries do more than the US government does but with more efficiency. \n Government is an inefficient operation. That is just the truth of it. Furthermore, my point was that you and others were basically saying the US federal government is just playing politics too much. I stated that this is a direct result of relying on the federal government. The more power you give them the more \"important\" they become and the more power they get. You end up with a power struggle. The natural consequence of this is to obtain and hold the power over anything else. State governments who don't meet often and have delegates who's primary job is something other than government tend to have less annoying political battles (not saying they don't have them...they are just on a smaller scale so it doesn't hurt as much).\n \n Other governments act the same way. In fact Europe might face a big challenge after their governments tried to control currency too much. Other examples of this hold true. \n \n This isn't to say government won't achieve something or provide a service. For example universal health care run by the government will undoubtable give health care to all. You will get the political ramifications of the government running it though. \n \n \nAbsolutism in free speech, meaning anyone with money can blitz the airwaves with their point of view at election time, resulting in government of the highest bidder, and worse than that, all mainstream candidates have views skewed to those monied interests.\nWell this is an all or nothing coin. The US has the first amendment which, with out a doubt, states congress can't regulate political speech ever. And yes, I purposely said political speech. The consequences of trying to regulate are worse and there is nothing to say this would even help if you could regulate it. \n \n \nThe odd status of the party system whereby individual congressmen and senators can have a big influence on legislation (and are not subject to party control like British MPs tend to be), but almost no-one can get elected outside of the party machine, so true independents are rare. This means huge spending on the pet projects of the members of congress.\nOdd you state a problem and then give the only actual benefit of the problem. The pet projects are not as expensive as you might think and at least benefit the citizens. Even so, this problem is exactly what I am saying. You ask the government to do everything and they will appease you to get reelected. \n \n \nNo permanent civil service. This means that there is no-one to take a long term view, everyone's job rests on the re-election of their patron. Of course there are disadvantages, with a permanent service, as anyone who has seen Yes Minister knows.\nI think the opposite is true. Permanent civil service is the problem. You can get elected for forever and it is your permanent job. It should be part time or term limits.\n \n \nSeparation of powers. Having separate executive and legislative branches can mean a lack of responsibility over taxation and spending. The sort of long term deficit spending the US has engaged in, and the long term problems with social security would have been impossible elsewhere.\nYou mean like Great Britain who has debt about 62+% of GDP which is roughly the same as the US? You are kidding yourself if you don't think other countries have entitlement problems. I'm not sure how this is a separation of powers problem. If anything separation of powers helps stop this and the fact that congress and the president are too meshed now has caused a lack of responsibility. We should go back to the president being elected by the senate anyway or a one term president of 6 years.\n \n \nEverything is politicised. There doesn't seem to be anything in the US that escapes the hue and cry of the media on both sides. Abortion, for example, is not a party political issue in the UK, it is always a matter of personal conscience when regulations are debated in Parliament.\nThe UK is the same if not worse. I watch the parliament on CSPAN often and to think it is different is delusional.\n \n I just find it odd that you correctly identify a problem which appears to be a problem of too much power and yet your solutions seem to be to INCREASE their powers. I feel the best method is to make them more inefficient and less power as called for by the US constitution.

The only thing our founders failed at was finding a way to make sure people don't ignore the constitution.

   "Yes and no. There needs to be a balance in government and that balance needs to be effectively managed. \nWell, we can dream big but the reality is government will never be effectively managed. It just isn't possible. The very nature of government is built about the premise of being inefficient.\n \nCapitalism running rampant leads to instablity and classes and loss of protections for the citizenry. The opposite stagnates economic growth driving down the ability to provide effective but ever increasing social services demand due primarily to the lack of economic growth.\ncapitalism punishes those who abuse the laws of economics....so in that sense they don't protect the citizen but frankly you shouldn't protect these people. The downside is that you have some damage to people who weren't acting incorrectly (see Enron). As we have seen though regulation doesn't change this downside and if anything makes it worse. Regulation disproportionately hurts small businesses why big businesses are the ones acting bad. A good example is Sarbanes Oxley. A huge regulation that basically killed small business because of the cost to document internal controls and have them audited. This regulation plus a few others also led to the big 8 going to the big 4 auditing firms. You have 4 auditing firms auditing basically everyone. They charge for fortune with almost no benefit to the shareholder. They are in bed with the company more and more and most of this is thanks to regulation. It is too expensive for a small audit firm to complete all the audit standards at a given fortune 500 company. \n \n \nWhat we have now is a group of representitives who are aware that while in office the only vote that matters is theirs.\nThey are also aware that people feel it is their job to fix everything and do everything for them.\n \n \nSmaller government doesn't guarantee better government\nNo, but it does guarantee they do less. In fact, I would venture to say a smaller federal government would be as efficient as they are now...they would just do less of what they currently do which, at the end of the day, means they screw things up less.",

   "It's not placing blame when your vote is irrelevant to big money being spent by lobbyists on both sides to secure their special interests....\nYou ever wonder why lobbyists exist? Well before you think of that perhaps you should think about whether or not you could ever ban lobbying. The answer to that one is you couldn't short of turning our country into a Big Brother state.\n \n More importantly is why lobbying exists and if it serves a good purpose and how it got out of control. In my state the colleges have lobbyists who go to the state. This is one example. Now they are there basically saying if you cut funding x,y,z will happen. This serves a great purpose in that it lets delegates know of possible consequences for their actions. The delegates are extremely limited in what they can do in a given year.

The drug company could go out and try to compete on the free market and have consumers decide if they are worthy. It is hard to bribe 300 million people.

   "jazyjason and others here want to blame the people in office but keep in mind that blaming those people is really a reflection of what the people truly want. When you want the government to do everything for you the product is inevitable. Small limited government is by definition limited power and the problem you guys are describing is nothing more than a power problem.\n\n \n The American public is fickled. We yammer about wanting a smaller government but the first time the government tries to actually reduce spending, we cry about it. \n I'm sure that you've all heard Social Security being called the \"third rail of politics\". That relates to the third rail of a subway which carries high voltage, electrocuting anyone foolish enough to touch it. \n We have many groups with divergent goals competing for their cause. Seniors continue to suck the lifeblood out of the American economy for one reason, AARP and other senior lobbying efforts. If Seniors weren't organized, their impact on our Federal Budget would be much smaller.\n Working people want their taxes reduced, but don't want to lose any of the benefits that they get now. The difference is they don't vote as a united block the way Seniors do, so Congress has ignored them. \n Now, the Middle Class is waking up, thanks in part to the Tea Party Movement and Congress is taking note that it is a force to be reckoned with just like Seniors. We're likely to see more and more candidates from both sides of the aisle listening more to the Middle Class workers.\n Socialized medicine, which doesn't do a damn thing for those of us gainfully employed, is dead. We can thank the Tea Party for that. The next targets will be Cap and Trade, bailouts and, hopefully, illegal immigration.\n Politics is getting interesting again.

Socialism puts control of the means of production in the hands of the workers, whether on a collective basis or a democratically controlled state basis. State support gives people the freedom to switch jobs. Support doesn't mean less freedom. If you provide someone with a car or a bus pass, then you increase their freedom of movement, for example. You have to twist words in knots to avoid seeing that. Ask the British pensioners who now get free bus travel and cheap train travel paid for through taxation, ask whether they feel more free. The effect on the rest of the population is miniscule, particularly as we have a progressive taxation system so the money comes from those whose freedom is least affected by a loss of money, as they still have plenty.

   "Jo Bennett this country has already tried socialism as you described it long before Marx was ever born. Under the leadership of William Bradford, the Pilgrims experimented with socialism.

Here is an excerpt of Bradford's diary.\n \n\n .

Now that will cause prices to rise at Wal Mart and if another store has lower prices almost always people will abandoned Wal Mart in favor of the lower prices. So the market really doesn't want people at Wal Mart to be paid more. In other words, they get exactly what the market feels they deserve. If it wasn't worth it, no one would work there and Wal Mart would have to pay more. \n \n No one thinks capitalism works but ultimately it always works and it is always used whether you try to get socialism to mitigate this or not. \n \n When you get down to it socialism is just government trying to regulate capitalism in an attempt to achieve some societal goal.

I know which country out of Norway and the US I would want to be born in, given the choice.\n\n \n As usual, you are wrong. Here's a paper written in the mid 90's on the topic.\n \n\n Reforming Welfare\n Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst, The Heritage Foundation\n \n Center of the American Experiment\n \n Presented at a workshop for officeholders and candidates sponsored by the Center as part of its two-year project, \"Reconceiving Minnesota Conservatism\"\n \n April 6, 1994\n \n \n Introduction\n \n It was almost 30 years ago that Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty. At the time Johnson told us one thing: The War on Poverty would be an investment that would return its cost to society -- its cost to the taxpayer -- manyfold. He said it would be a short-term investment.\n \n Well, since 1965 when the War on Poverty began, we have spent over $5 trillion on welfare. When I'm talking about welfare, I'm not talking about Social Security and Medicare. I am talking exclusively about programs for low-income Americans. (Five trillion dollars. That is a gargantuan amount of money; after adjusting for inflation, it is greater than the cost of battling Germany and Japan in World War II.)\n \n Today, again after adjusting for inflation, we are spending nine times as much on welfare as when the War on Poverty began in 1965. Last year we spent $324 billion on 78 different federal welfare programs. This was 5 percent of the gross national product. We are now spending more on welfare as a percentage of the Gross National Product than we were in the middle of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when a quarter of the labor force was unemployed. \n \n The typical family of four in the United States today pays $2,000 every year in taxes to support the welfare state. If you're an upper-middle income family, it's closer to $6,000. As investors in the War on Poverty, as Lyndon Johnson called us, we're all sort of stockholders in the welfare state; I think we ought to have a stockholders meeting and see exactly what we've gotten for our $5 trillion investment. \n \n ........\n What are the other consequences of the War on Poverty? Well, today, one out of every seven children in the United States is being raised on the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, with Uncle Sam's welfare check serving as a surrogate father. Of those AFDC children, half will remain in the system for over 10 years. Even when they're off, they're likely to receive benefits from other welfare programs besides AFDC. \n \n One of the key causes for this tremendous increase in welfare dependency in the last 30 years has been the rise in out-of-wedlock births. Back when the War on Poverty was starting, the percentage of children born out of wedlock was about 5 percent. Today it is over 30 percent. Three out of 10 children in the United States are born without a lawful father. If you look at Black communities, the out-of-wedlock birth rate went from about 25 percent up to an astonishing 68 percent. If you look at all other social indicators during this period, in particular violent crime, we find that as the War on Poverty kicks in and as we push more money into the system, the more violent crime we have, the more social, psychological and behavioral problems we seem to have. \n \n As a stockholder in the War on Poverty, the typical tax-paying family of four can look forward to investing about $35,000 in the welfare state over the next 10 years. You can think what the opportunity costs of that investment are in terms of your own family. We ought to legitimately ask: After we each have put in our $35,000 over the next 10 years, will the well-being of American children be any better than it is today? The answer is no, it will almost certainly be significantly worse. Will our society be a better place to live in as a result of our $35,000 future investment in the War on Poverty? No, almost certainly it will be a worse place. Will dependency go down? Will we have fewer people on welfare? No, almost certainly not. We are likely to have a dramatic increase in welfare. \n \n So maybe we ought to back up and ask the question, \"Why does it seem that this enormous $5 trillion contribution has backfired? What was wrong with this investment?\" If we can identify what was wrong with it, perhaps we can fix this system in the future. \n \n \n What's gone wrong?\n \n The answer is that in welfare, as in most other things in life, you get what you pay for. Welfare pays for three things: non-work, divorce and illegitimacy, and we have achieved a dramatic increase in all three things in the last 30 years as a result of this system.\n \n Welfare insidiously creates its own clientele. The more that is spent under this current system, the more people will line up for services and the more people we have in need of aid. The effect of the system is far-reaching and penetrating, it actually removes the capacity of individuals to sustain themselves and their families; continuous welfare actually creates persons who cannot live without it. The more we spend, the more such individuals we create. We create multi-generations of individuals whose capacity for self-support has eroded and disappeared. \n \n How is it that welfare has this sort of insidious effect? It's very simple. If you go to the core of the welfare system in the United States, we basically offer a young, unmarried woman with two children whom she has had out of wedlock a combined welfare benefits package of about $14,000 to $15,000 per year. We could call this her welfare paycheck. But there are two conditions that you, the taxpayer, insist on in order for her to be eligible to receive this $14,000- to $15,000-a-year welfare paycheck. \n \n Condition No. 1: She cannot work. \n Condition No. 2: She cannot marry an employed male. \n If she does either of those things, her welfare benefits will be sharply cut or eliminated entirely. I call this the Incentive System from Hell. If you were to deliberately design a system that in the long term would have the maximum harmful impact on low-income Americans, this is the system you would devise. I often say to Black audiences that if David Duke wanted to think up a system to destroy Black communities in the United States, this is it. It's a system that explicitly penalizes work and explicitly penalizes marriage. But the problem from David Duke's perspective is that it's not just Black families that have been destroyed, it's been white families, as well.\n \n The negative effects of welfare have been confirmed over and over again in scientific experiments. Few people know that in the late 1970's, Daniel Patrick Moynihan put together a massive national experiment called the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. We spent many millions of dollars on a controlled experiment to evaluate the effects of welfare policy on human behavior.\n \n As far as I know, it was the largest controlled behavioral experiment in human history. In this experiment, we tested the effects of welfare scientifically, just as you would test the effects of a new drug. We took a population of potential welfare recipients and randomly divided them into a number of different groups. One group, called the control group, did not get any changes in welfare benefits. The other groups received different welfare packages with different benefit rates, phase-down rates and the like. There were many different types of packages, and we were able to evaluate their effects on human behavior by comparing the group that received these new benefits with the control group that was held at the status quo. \n You have not heard of the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment because the results were politically incorrect. This experiment showed, without any doubt, that the more money you give to a family on welfare, the less that family works and the more dependent they become on the system. The Seattle-Denver study showed, astonishingly, that for every additional $100 given to families in terms of increased monthly welfare benefits, those families on average over the course of the year reduced their labor force participation and earnings by $80. So for every one dollar you gave them, you had an 80-cent reduction in their own capacity, their own earnings, their own ability for self-support. That goes a long way in explaining how you can spend and spend and spend under this system and nothing seems to improve. The government cannot spend its way out of poverty, because all it ends up doing is replacing self-sufficiency with dependency.\n \n The experiment also showed that welfare has a profound tendency to splinter families -- to pull the husband out of the family, to make him irrelevant, and to increase the number of single-parent households. Similar studies that have been done -- not on a controlled experimental basis, but by comparing the effects of welfare among different states -- show that the intensiveness and the generosity of the welfare system has a dramatic effect on increasing the number of out-of-wedlock births, particularly among teenagers. Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of Baruch College, in New York, has shown that if you increase the monthly welfare benefit package in the state by 50 percent, you will achieve a 40 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births in the state. Again, that is one of the underlying factors in our problem of consistent poverty.\n Reforming Welfare\n \n\n \n So, you see, Jo, making false statements that the \"Welfare Queen is a myth\" without one iota of substantiating proof just makes you look like a fool. I back my statements with fact; you should try it sometime. emoticon_rolleyes",

If you double every citizens wages this very second then you'd see every price increase two fold. If you increase the lowest people then the people that are above that get mad because the low people doing less skilled work make the same and they either demand more or trend towards the easier job. You basically end up promoting laziness. Furthermore, a minimum wage may create a baseline price. Surely you've heard of Henry Ford in the minimum wage. These things just have a way of working themselves out over time. It seems the problem people have is the \"over time\" part.\n \n Here is one study I found on the subject: http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=38",

   "That hasn't been the experience in the UK, where the minimum wage has increased markedly since its introduction, with no obvious implications for inflation. The inflationary arguments are spurious, and are trotted out by employers organisations every time anyone discusses low pay. The fact is that employers of low paid workers exploit the lack of mobility and job insecurity of their employees to pay them less than they are worth. If these employees were earning more than the work they were doing justified then the companies wouldn't be turning a profit. The solution is to pay the highest earners less and the lowest earners more. It works in Scandinavia, there is no reason why it can't work elsewhere.

You pay the top less, less people will want to do it. \n \n I don't see how my study is contradicted by any of this?\n \n In the US roughly half the people making minimum wage are those under 25. In other words these are the people asking \"do you want fries with that?\"\n You can get all the stats on this actually...not many people make the minimum wage.\n \n Now, I'm not stupid enough to think that raising minimum wage will always result in decreased employment. It really depends on what the salary spread is. In a simple example suppose 1 person makes $5 a hour doing low end task and another does a more skilled job at $15 an hour. Raising the 1 person from $5 to $7 probably wouldn't hurt much because of the rather large variance between the two. However if it was $5 vs $8 and you moved one to $7 then there is incentive to move to the lower skilled job thus making the lower skilled worker unemployed.\n \n I think the latest minimum raise hike was probably justified and should act more like the UK where you follow the trend of average salary.",

It was 1994. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but I believe that was 16 years ago. While I don't recall if $14k was the common amount received by Welfare Queens in the late 70's, I do know that they received a mixture of free housing, cash, food stamps and medical care for their kids, as well as a host of other freebies such as free school lunches, etc. \n The insidious part was that they were being rewarded for having more illegitimate kids and in many neighborhood (neighborhoods that you would never visit, but I had to because my high school was located there) the single moms loaned kids to their neighbors when the case worker showed up. (By law, they could not make \"surprise visits\"). So, what you had were the same kids being counted several times in order to boost the Welfare Queen's AFDC payments. \n Not ever having set foot in US ghettos, I'm sure none of this has a ring of familiarity to you, but it was part of everyday life in my world.

That was one of the reasons that I ALWAYS carried a knife sewn into a sheath in my right boot. \n I passed drunks sitting on their dilapidated stoops next to their new Cadillacs, because, as the saying goes \"You can live in a car, but you can't drive a shack.' emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Next time, argue about something that you have, at least, a modicum of knowledge about. :xbanghead",
