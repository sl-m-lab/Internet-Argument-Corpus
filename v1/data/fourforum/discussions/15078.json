   "Cuba, a country with a population of ~12 million, has decided to sack about 500,000 public employees. This would equate to government layoffs of 12.5 million in a country like the US, with a population of 300 million.\n \n Cuba with unions support announces elimination of 500.000 jobs to boost economy &mdash; MercoPress\n \n \"Our state budget cannot continue maintaining business and services with inflated payrolls, with losses that weigh down the economy, or those that are counterproductive, generate bad habits and distort worker conduct\"\n \n Who would have thought that a bloated federal government would distort and ruin the economy and result in unsustainable deficits? Glad they finally figured it out over there.\n \n I'm looking forward firstly, to the day when Cuba can take its world leading role as an exporter of sugar, rum and cigars, and secondly to the date when the USA is a more socialist country than Castro's people's republic.",
