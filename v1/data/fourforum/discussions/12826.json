   "They are not sure if this fuel belongs to the plane or not. There is so much rubbish and debris floating on the sea that the Brazilians admit that nothing is conclusive.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"Ice damage to speed sensors made by Thales SA may have prompted incorrect readings on the Air France plane that crashed on June 1, contributing to the Airbus A330&#8217;s plunge into the Atlantic Ocean, which killed 228 people. \n \n Investigators will ask Thales to supply information because damage to the three external sensors is a possible cause of &#8220;incoherent&#8221; speed data transmitted by the airliner, said a person familiar with the investigation who asked not to be named because the proceedings are confidential. \n \n Honeywell International Inc., whose components aboard the crashed plane included processors that interpret the data and feed it to the main flight computer, said it has been asked to help with the probe. Thales, based in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, said it will assist if called upon. \n \n Brazilian and French search teams haven&#8217;t recovered any confirmed debris from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in an area without radar coverage en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 216 passengers and 12 crew. \n \n In the plane&#8217;s last minutes, automated radio transmissions logged a catalogue of system failures, beginning with the disengagement of the autopilot and ending with a drastic drop in the difference between air pressure inside and outside the cabin -- which can result from a plane&#8217;s disintegration or from a rapid plunge in altitude. \n \n The inquiry, led by France&#8217;s BEA air-accident investigation bureau, is examining whether discrepancies among the sensor readings could have caused the autopilot to shut down, according to the person with knowledge of the probe. Alternatively, the pilots may have taken manual control when they became concerned about the speed data or another problem. \n \n Too Early \n \n The sensor-damage hypothesis is &#8220;far too advanced for this stage of the investigation,&#8221; BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono said in a telephone interview, declining to comment further. \n \n The Thales speed sensor on the A330 is a Pitot probe that consists of an open-ended tube that measures pressure to determine the velocity of passing air. An electrical heating system is incorporated in the unit to &#8220;limit the risk of icing,&#8221; according to Thales documentation. \n \n The plane probably encountered &#8220;explosive thunderstorms&#8221; with updrafts reaching 100 mph, State College, Pennsylvania- based AccuWeather.com said earlier this week. \"\n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Andrea Rothman in Toulouse, France at aerothman@bloomberg.net; \n \n Last Updated: June 5, 2009 10:47 EDT \n \n Air France Crash Inquiry Will Consider Ice Damage to Sensors - Bloomberg.com",
