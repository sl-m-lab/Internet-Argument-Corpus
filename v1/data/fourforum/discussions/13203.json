   "Gun law sparks debate on safety\n Secured firearms allowed in vehicles on campuses\n By Liz Segrist \n The Post and Courier\n Friday, June 5, 2009\n \n \n A third-year sociology and psychology student at the College of Charleston said hearing that it's now legal for firearms to be in enclosed compartments in vehicles on her campus makes her feel anything but safe. \n \n But that's exactly what soon could be the case since South Carolina's concealed weapon permit (CWP) holders now can legally have firearms in closed compartments of their car while on school property, furthering the reach of the pro-gun-rights activists and angering the anti-gun-rights movement. \n \n \"I think they should not be anywhere near a school or near any sort of students in our teenage years,\" Christeen Faucette, 20, said. \"If people know there could be guns in a car next to them, it could definitely affect the college campuses and schools with crime.\"\n \n The state has long allowed any legal gun owner to keep a firearm locked in their vehicle, in a glove compartment, closed console, closed trunk or secured container in the vehicle. Just not on school grounds. \n \n But after Gov. Mark Sanford signed a bill into law this week, CWP \n \n holders are now allowed to take guns onto school property. However, guns must remain secured and in the vehicle. And non-CWP holders still are banned from taking firearms onto school property. \n \n Sen. Jake Knotts, R-West Columbia, worked on the committee that considered the bill. He said it will not have any effect on gun violence on campuses. \n \n \"It's not in any way going to increase any type of shootings on campuses,\" Knotts said. \"The people who do the shootings on campus are not law-abiding citizens.\"\n \n South Carolina GrassRoots GunRights Executive Officer Bill Rentiers said he supports the law because \"it corrects an inefficiency or a wrong within the law.\" For instance, if a parent with a CWP has to pick up their child from school, they no longer have to go home to remove the firearm before picking up the child. \n \n However, some anti-gun groups disagree with the efficiency reasoning. \n \n \"I think the more places that guns are allowed, the more chance there is of more injury and gun violence,\" said Evelyn Dolven, the South Carolina Million Mom March chapter spokeswoman. \n \n Dolven, a 70-year-old retired public school teacher, said she doesn't think having guns on campus would increase safety, even in the event of a shooting. \n \n \"It's best to leave protection to the people who are trained to protect, such as the campus police and the campus security people,\" Dolven said. \"Untrained people often cause more problems than they think they would, resulting in more injury.\"\n \n Rep. Joe Daning, R-Goose Creek, said that although he is a Second Amendment supporter, his work within higher education led him to vote against the bill. \n \n \"I just don't like the idea of having guns on campus, any campus,\" Daning said. \"And I understand the reason why they did it. I understand what's behind it. It just concerns me.\"\n \n Rentiers said he believes this law will increase safety because CWP holders are trustworthy people who have been through training and background checks. Therefore, they could provide protection. \n \n \"Any area or zone that is a gun-free zone, with no exceptions, has no protection,\" Rentiers said. \"Crazed killers or criminals don't obey the laws. The law-abiding citizens, like concealed weapons permit holders, do obey the laws.\"\n \n Sen. Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said before this law, law-abiding citizens were prevented from protecting themselves. \n \n But Faucette maintains that she does not advocate guns for any reason, especially on her campus.\"It could definitely increase the possibility of school shootings too,\" Faucette said. \n \n Gun law sparks debate on safety The Post and Courier - Charleston SC newspaper",
