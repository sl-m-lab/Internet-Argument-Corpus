POLLICK, BDS, MPH\n ........\n \n Although 25% of the utilities reported using NaF, this corresponds to only 9.2% of the U.S. population drinking fluoride-supplemented tap water. The ease in handling NaF rather than fluorosilicates accounts for the disproportionate use of NaF by utilities serving smaller populations. On the other hand, the cost savings in using fluorosilicates result in large systems using those additives instead. The reduced cost of large volume offsets the costs associated with handling concentrated stocks of the fluorosilicates, which require accommodations similar to hydrochloric acid, which is sometimes used to adjust pH. In acidic solution, the dissociation and hydrolysis of fluorosilicic acid, which occurs upon dilution, is given by eq 1. In drinking water, pH is adjusted with the addition of base (e.g., NaOH, NaHCO3). H2SiF6(aq) + 4H2O(l) = 6HF(aq) + Si(OH)4(aq) (eq1).34\n While there may be evidence of toxicity of these substances when workers involved in their production are not protected, there is no credible evidence of toxicity when they are diluted for use in fluoridated water. Fluorosilicic acid is diluted with water from an initial aqueous concentration of about 23-24% by about 1:250,000-1:300,000 when used for fluoridating\n water.36 This produces the final concentration of between 0.7-1.2 mg/L, the specific level set according to CDC guidelines.37\n Concerns have been raised about arsenic and lead in fluorosilicic-acid-treated water.38,39 However, there is no credible evidence that this is of concern.40 Urbansky and Schock add:\n The vast preponderance of the lead(II) in nearly all tap waters originates from the plumbing materials located between the water distribution mains and the end of the faucet used by the consumer.\n Arsenic and lead may be present at minute undetectable concentrations, well below all current (50 ppb) and proposed (10 ppb) EPA standards. Following dilution with water, the calculated range of arsenic concentrations in the finished water contributed by fluorosilicic acid feed is 0.10 to 0.24 &#956;g/L (parts per billion, ppb).36 The analytic detection limit for arsenic is 2 &#956;g/L, so the amount added by the fluorosilicic acid would not be detected.36 In Fort Collins, the concentration of lead in the source waters was below the detection limit for lead in the department's laboratory of 1.0 &#956;g/liter (ppb). Because lead levels are below the detection limits both before and after the addition of fluorosilicic acid, the actual changes in lead concentrations were not measurable.36\n ....\n CONCLUSION\n Scientific evidence supports the fluoridation of public water supplies as safe for the environment and beneficial to people. Reports at the local, national, and international levels have continued to support this most important public health measure. There appears to be no concern about the environmental aspects of water fluoridation among those experts who have investigated the matter. Furthermore, since the chemicals used for water fluoridation are co-products of the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers, and the raw material used is a natural resource (rocks excavated for their mineral content), water fluoridation could accurately be described as environmentally friendly, as it maximizes the use made of these natural resources, and reduces waste.\n http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/pdf/pollick.pdf \n",

While Chemistry majors are taking several semesters each of Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry; ChE's take lots of Calculus, material science, fluid dynamics, Process design, process control and lots of physics.

   "As a professional Chemist, I'm always leary of Chemical Engineers that claim to be experts in chemistry. The fact is, they aren't. They're experts in thermodynamics, mass transport, etc., but they lack the fundamental chemistry background of a chemist. Don't believe it, just look at the curricula differences. While Chemistry majors are taking several semesters each of Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry; ChE's take lots of Calculus, material science, fluid dynamics, Process design, process control and lots of physics.

You want potassium, chew a potassium chloride pill, INORGANIC form. You want calcium, chew. a Tum, INORGANIC form. I suggest that you stop reading advertising propaganda and get the facts. It'll save you money on food supplements, too. ;)\n \n\n Source????\n Fluoride does more than accumulate in the bones (and NO it doesn't make them harder - read 'Fluorine...' HK Roholm, Smith, Connett, Yiamouyiannis , etc...). It also reacts at a cellular level affecting even DNA.\n \n\n \n\n Intake of Fluoride\n Cerklewski (1997) reviewed scientific literature addressing fluoride bioavailability. Although fluoride is not actively transported into animal cells, it is second only to iron in concentration in the human body, and thus should not be classified as a micro-trace element for humans. \n Indeed, fluoride has been considered as meeting many of the criteria for a recommended daily allowance (RDA) substance. The total fluoride found in a typical adult human body is approximately 2.6 g, which puts it above the concentration range for micro-trace elements. Unlike a dietary non-essential trace element like lead, high fluoride intake does not result in accumulation in the soft tissues where its toxicity becomes manifest. Normal fluoride soft-tissue levels are in the micromolar range (1.0 &#61549; M = 19 parts per billion), whereas enzyme inhibition typically requires millimolar concentrations (1.0 mM = 19 parts per million). The combined effects of skeletal uptake and urinary excretion maintain a loose homeostatic balance of the ion in selected tissues, a behavior that would be expected of a nutritionally required ion rather than that of a toxic element such as lead. Although fluoride does not bioaccumulate in tissues other than those of bones and teeth, its internal concentration is only crudely regulated by the balance between intake and urinary excretion requiring a continual intake of the substance. However, in cases of high exposure levels or with renal deficiencies (Public Health Service, 1991) fluoride will increase in soft tissues somewhat in proportion to intake. \n ......\n Fluoride and Osteoporosis\n In clinical trials, high doses of sodium fluoride such as 75 mg/day produced bone that was less mechanically strong than regular bone, but a lower dose (25 mg/twice daily with a slow release of F) produced fewer new vertebrate fractures and higher bone mass with minimal effects (Cerklewski, 1997). Fluoride's role in bone development is well documented (Cerklewski, 1997), and a report that a lifetime of fluoride exposure was associated with increased hip fractures has not been supported by others. \n TITLE: ECUA FLUORIDE REPORT \n\n \n \n\n 'Dr. Wolfgang Klein and co-workers at the Seibersdorf Research Center in Austria reported that 1 part per million fluoride inhibits DNA repair enzyme activity by 50%. Since fluoride inhibits DNA repair enzyme activity, fluoride should also be expected to lead to an increase in genetic or chromosome damage.\n \n This has indeed been found to occur in numerous studies showing that fluoride in water, even at the concentration of 1 part per million, can cause chromosome damage.'\n \n Fluoride: The Aging Factor\n \n\n \n Here's a refutation of that claim.\n \n\n Many other studies typically employ in vitro tissue culture into which fluoride is introduced in the culture medium. For instance, a series of studies by Tsutsui and coworkers (1984a; 1984b; 1984c) found evidence for DNA damage in cultured human or Syrian hamster cells including both chromosome aberrations and unscheduled DNA synthesis. Tsutsui et al. (1984c) point out that genotoxicity has been demonstrated in many in vitro studies but in few in vivo studies, and that concentrations employed in such studies are often as high as 10,000 times that of typical environmental exposure. Fluoride ion at these levels inhibits many enzymes, and in such in vitro studies it may interfere with enzymes involved in DNA repair or replication rather than by direct interaction with the DNA itself. \n TITLE: ECUA FLUORIDE REPORT \n\n \n \n\n Never said that.\n \n\n You did justify the addition of chlorine to drinking water didn't you? And we know that chlorine is also toxic to humans, right?\n \n\n Yes, that would be a smart move but, dumping it into the water supply isn't one of them.\n \n\n That's YOUR opinion, an opinion not shared by the majority of water suppliers in the US. Converting their effluent into a pure H2SiF6 stream that meets FDA requirements is a win-win scenario, IMO.\n \n\n Like what?

Chicken $hit is composed of high levels of nitrates and phosphates that aren't filterable.\n Tyson Foods, Cargill on Trial for Polluting Illinois Watershed Environmental Leader Green Business, Sustainable Business, and Green Strategy News for Corporate Sustainability Executives\n \n \n\n Of more concern than odor is the threat to water quality by run-off from chicken farming. Some chicken manure is used as fertilizer for crops, and when it rains, excessive nitrogen and phosphorus are washed into nearby bodies of water. Outbreaks of a harmful bacteria in the Chesapeake Bay area in 1997 were blamed on water conditions caused by run-off from chicken farms.\n chicken: Definition from Answers.com \n\n \n So, you see.

Besides, my daughter has an older cat with the same problem and a year after I told her about Pookie Pie she finally decided to try it with her cat - same results. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nWe don't have fluoride in our drinking water. My kids have, for the most part, grown up without it. I was concerned for dental reasons. I come from the generation where fluoride in drinking water, immunizations, penicillin are part of what separates America from the third world, are incredible advances in medicine that have made life so much better for everyone. \n Same generation here. In fact, I was born and grew up less than 20 miles from the town in NY where they did the first human experiment with fluoridated water (I was born about 10 years after the experiment started). I remember many walks to the dentist office and every molar in my mouth was filled with mercury fillings before I was 12. I attribute that to hitting the candy store on my way home from school every day and poor brushing habits. Fluoridated water didn't prevent cavities for me.\n \n \nAs a result, though, there's no fluoride in the water (it does taste much better), they have been slathered repeatedly at dentists. \n Fluoride is (supposedly) tasteless. What is the source of your water: surface or aquifer?\n \n \nWe haven't really had problems with decay, but I can't say what's attributable or not. We don't drink soda or eat junk food, there's some good heredity, and then, the regular slathering. (and of course good home care practice, usually, and regular cleanings) \n Diet and good dental hygiene is what prevents cavities. I don't really have a problem with fluoride applications in a dentists office - although the jury is still out on whether or not it helps or causes harm to the tooth. The dental grade fluoride they use is sodium fluoride, a pharmaceutical-grade and most importantly it is for topical application ONLY and is NOT to be swallowed. Read any toothpaste label.\n The XXXX they put in the water supply comes directly from the phosphate fertilizer plants and is classified by the EPA as a hazardous toxic waste.\n \n \nAnyway, it's not an issue I've read up on a lot, just took things in the course of life. It has come up in our community, and many intelligent people whose opinions I respect were opposed to adding fluoride. Ultimately, on the fence, I asked my dentist where he stood.

Well, he supports fluoridation. So I went that way, though not having enough background myself, to take either side.\n\n Sounds like you have a good dentist...but, remember, he is bound by the ADA oath as a member to not go against anything they publicly promote - such as fluoride...or mercury 'amalgam' fillings.\n \n \nOne community that has opposed fluoridation for years now is Ithaca, New York where Cornell University is. They have a lot of science people in that town. You won't get the community to support it. \n\n Yeah. Unfortunately, the Federal government is in the habit of over-ruling what local communities or States decide. It has happened in Hawaii and California and many more places. The trouble is the ADA has a legal force that does nothing but fluoride cases. When small communities or individual citizens try to go up against them, they always lose because the ADA has virtually unlimited funds and resources. (Google 'Peter M Sfikas')emoticon_xkill\n \n \nSo I realize this is not the stuff of debate that I'm giving you. There are just so many issues one can research and be involved in.\n \n Just my take from a more personal perspective. Agnostic, I guess.\n\n \n At least you are open-minded about it, have done your homework. emoticon_xgood\n \n The main problems with water fluoridation for tooth caries prevention are:\n \n Topical application of pharmaceutical-grade fluoride may work. Some tests show it actually weakens the tooth. They are absolutely NOT to be swallowed.\n \n The list of consumer products containing fluoride is staggering. The source of fluoride consumption is not just in tap water but in every product that uses tap water for processing (or irrigation). \n The amount of fluoride actually consumed by an individual cannot be accurately measured or controlled.\n Since water fluoridation is dosing the public with a dangerous chemical, and since some are allergic or, have serious health issues and are to avoid it altogether (like kidney patients and infants), the government is actually causing harm to the public rather than helping.",

   "Yeah, the Florida with some of the largest bass in the country. Funny, too, since bass don't like polluted water....\n \n \n\n \n Found something you might be interested in reading:\n New Report Links Toxic Pollution with Health Hazards as EPA Acts to Restrict Pollution Data - Florida PIRG\n \n New Report Links Toxic Pollution with Health Hazards as EPA Acts to Restrict Pollution Data\n \n \n \n TALLAHASSEE - Exposure to dangerous toxic pollution from industrial facilities threatens communities all across Florida, according to a new report.\n \n The report, Toxic Pollution and Health, uses information from the federal Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) to analyze toxic pollution linked to serious health problems such as cancer, birth defects or neurological damage. Due to a recent EPA action restricting the public's right to know, today's report may provide one of the last complete pictures of toxic pollution in Florida.\n \n Facilities in Florida released to the air and water more than 2,700,000 pounds of toxic chemicals known to cause cancer, making Florida the 5th highest state in terms of carcinogen emissions in 2004.\n \n \"This report confirms that communities in Florida are routinely put at risk by toxic pollution linked to serious health impacts,\" said Florida PIRG advocate Brad Ashwell. \"These toxic pollutants are the worst of the worst and pose tangible threats to public health that must be addressed.\"\n \n \"To address the potential health threats from toxic pollution, the public needs full information about what toxics are being released, where, and in what amounts,\" said Lois Gibbs, Executive Director of the Center for Health and Environmental Justice. \"Unfortunately, EPA's attack on the public's right to know means that communities across Florida will be left in the dark about toxic pollution.\"\n \n Florida also ranked 7th nationally in terms of states with the highest emissions of suspected neurotoxins and dioxins, dangerous and persistent chemicals that increase the likelihood of cancer and other debilitating effects. Florida also ranked 12th for states with the highest releases of suspected reproductive toxicants, as well as 21st for states with the highest releases of suspected developmental toxicants, which affect young children.\n \n Florida exemplifies the report's finding that a relatively small number of communities often experience the bulk of these toxicant emissions. Seven Florida zip codes account for nearly 2,000,000 pounds-about a 75% share-of cancer causing chemicals released in the state. All seven zip codes rank in the top 100 zip codes nationwide for cancer causing chemicals, with Bryant ranking 4th; Clewiston, 35th; Perry, 45th; Orlando, 51st; Fernandina Beach, 59th; Panama City, 76th; and Cantonment, 88th.\n \n In 2004, Palm Beach County ranked 8th nationally for total air and water releases of toxic pollution known to cause cancer, 15th nationally for reproductive toxicants and 55th for developmental toxicants. The largest source of this pollution came from the United States Sugar Corporation facility in Bryant, Florida which released more than 700,000 pounds of carcinogens into the air and water. The US Sugar facility ranked third highest in the nation for highest emissions of carcinogens into the air and water.\n \n Florida contributes seven counties to the national top 100 list in this category: Palm Beach, 8th; Nassau County, 46th; Hendry County, 48th; Taylor County, 57th; Bay County, 60th; Orange County, 64th; and Escambia County, 88th.",

   "Thanks from me and Pookie Pie. emoticon_love \n\n \n Pookie Pie is so sweet looking!\n \n [quote\\] Fluoride is (supposedly) tasteless. What is the source of your water: surface or aquifer?[/quote]\n \n Maybe it's something else then. Surface. Other disputes around that, though, because people boat and swim, wildlife and human children defecate (e coli one year), etc. One would never know from the taste! Another place I lived, nothing and no one went into the reservoir. They arrested people if they even swam in it. The police patrolled. Beautiful, but forbidden except for drinking.\n \n \n Diet and good dental hygiene is what prevents cavities. I don't really have a problem with fluoride applications in a dentists office - although the jury is still out on whether or not it helps or causes harm to the tooth. The dental grade fluoride they use is sodium fluoride, a pharmaceutical-grade and most importantly it is for topical application ONLY and is NOT to be swallowed. Read any toothpaste label.\n The XXXX they put in the water supply comes directly from the phosphate fertilizer plants and is classified by the EPA as a hazardous toxic waste.\n \n \n Sounds like you have a good dentist...but, remember, he is bound by the ADA oath as a member to not go against anything they publicly promote - such as fluoride...or mercury 'amalgam' fillings.\n \n \n Yeah. Unfortunately, the Federal government is in the habit of over-ruling what local communities or States decide. It has happened in Hawaii and California and many more places. The trouble is the ADA has a legal force that does nothing but fluoride cases. When small communities or individual citizens try to go up against them, they always lose because the ADA has virtually unlimited funds and resources. (Google 'Peter M Sfikas')emoticon_xkill\n \n \n \n At least you are open-minded about it, have done your homework. emoticon_xgood\n \n The main problems with water fluoridation for tooth caries prevention are:\n \n Topical application of pharmaceutical-grade fluoride may work. Some tests show it actually weakens the tooth. They are absolutely NOT to be swallowed.\n \n The list of consumer products containing fluoride is staggering. The source of fluoride consumption is not just in tap water but in every product that uses tap water for processing (or irrigation). \n The amount of fluoride actually consumed by an individual cannot be accurately measured or controlled.\n Since water fluoridation is dosing the public with a dangerous chemical, and since some are allergic or, have serious health issues and are to avoid it altogether (like kidney patients and infants), the government is actually causing harm to the public rather than helping.\n\n \n Even though I went with the fluoridation, after reading your posts, I'm glad the anti-fluoridation side won. My dentist is so sweet and gentlemanly and smart. They just don't make dentists like that anymore. I don't know if dentists take a hypocratic oath, but I think that's where he comes from. He will not recommend something or participate in something if he feels it causes harm, or would violate his principles as a medical practitioner. So I respect his opinion very much. I don't think I've done so much homework on this issue, as just gone with whoever seemed to know what they were doing the most, at that time. Such is the insanity of resolving local issues.",

   "The trouble with the ADA is, among other things, is that if a dentist publicly opposes anything the ADA supports, the member is brought before a board of peers and can be dis-membered.emoticon_rolleyes ...and who would go to a dentist who is not a member in good standing with the ADA? (I would if he were against fluoridation emoticon_xhoho ) \n Along with that, the ADA offers huge perks for it's members.\n \n I'm glad my posts have made you reconsider water fluoridation! That's why I put it 'out there'. \n \n There is soooo much info, research results and opinion on water fluoridation that it is overwhelming to read it all- let alone piece it together and come to an informed conclusion. \n The main thing to consider is that what they are putting in the water is a TOXIC waste by-product of the fertilizer industry and it most definitely is NOT safe for human (or other) consumption. emoticon_xkill\n \n Considering many people are allergic to it or because of their age or health condition should not consume it, it should not be automatically dumped in municipal water supplies. If there are those who want it, let them put it in their own water...because once it's in, you can't take it out.\n \n As for the 'underprivileged', it would be more beneficial for their dental and general health to provide them with toothbrushes, toothpaste and regular visits to the dentist.\n \n But, the best prevention for dental caries is proper diet and good dental hygiene - which each individual is responsible for themselves.\n \n How many times I've seen little kids (and adults) sucking on sodas and I've wanted to slap them out of their mouths! :xbanghead",

The exact mechanism of such actions is obscure. The sources of fluorine intoxication are drinking water containing 1 part per million or more of fluorine, fluorine compounds used as insecticidal sprays for fruits and vegetables (cryolite and barium fluosilicate) and the mining and conversion of phosphate rock to superphosphate, which is used as fertilizer. The fluorine content of phosphate rock is about 4 per cent. During conversion to superphosphate, about 25 per cent of the fluorine present is volatilized and represents a pouring into the atmosphere of approximately 25,000 tons of pure fluorine annually.

   "Sheesh, finally!\n I've been trying to download this from Scribd most of the day - I don't know what the problem is with that web site! emoticon_frazzled\n \n Anyway, here is the rest of the 1943 JAMA article I posted earlier.\n It is a bit two-faced in that they say 1ppm helps fight dental caries yet, it is also highly toxic.\n The point is NOW (2010) that we are consuming much more than just the 1ppm in our drinking water - it is also in just about everything else we consume, and it accumulates over time.\n \n CHRONIC FLUORINE INTOXICATION\n JAMA\n September 18, 1943\n \n Distribution of the element fluorine is so widespread\n throughout nature that a small intake of the element is\n practically unavoidable. Fluorides are general protoplasmic\n poisons, probably because of their capacity to\n modify the metabolism of cells by changing the permeability\n of the cell membrane and by inhibiting certain\n enzyme systems. The exact mechanism of such actions\n is obscure. The sources of fluorine intoxication are\n drinking water containing 1 part per million or more\n of fluorine, fluorine compounds used as insecticidal\n sprays for fruits and vegetables (cryolite and barium\n fluosilicate) and the mining and conversion of phosphate\n rock to superphosphate, which is used as fertilizer.\n The fluorine content of phosphate rock is about 4 per\n cent. During conversion to superphosphate, about 25\n per cent of the fluorine present is volatilized and represents\n a pouring into the atmosphere of approximately\n 25,000 tons of pure fluorine annually. Another source\n of fluorine intoxication is from the fluorides used in the\n smelting of many metals, such as steel and aluminum,\n and in the production of glass, enamel and brick.\n The known effects of chronic fluorine intoxication are\n those of hypoplasia of the teeth, which has been called\n mottled enamel, and of bone sclerosis. The classic\n epidemiologic studies of McKay 1 clearly demonstrated\n the relationship of the fluorine content of the domestic\n water supply to the anomaly of mottled enamel of the\n teeth. The condition is now known to be endemic in\n isolated communities on every continent. In the United\n States there are about four hundred known endemic\n areas distributed among twenty-eight states. Dean\n and McKay2 succeeded in the unique epidemiologic\n experiment of arresting the production of the endemic\n mottled enamel at Oakley, Ida., Bauxite, Ark., and\n Andover, S. D., by changing the common water supply\n from one containing amounts of fluorides toxic to cal\u00ac\n cifying dental enamel to one the fluoride content of\n which does not exceed the permissible maximum, i. e.\n 1 part per million. Children using domestic waters con\u00ac\n taining as little as 1 part per million of fluorine experi\u00ac\n ence only a half to a third as much dental decay as\n comparable groups using fluoride-free water, such as the\n Lake Michigan or the Mississippi River waters. The\n same inverse relationship has been observed in England,\n South India and North Africa. Apparently teeth require\n traces of fluorine for optimum dental health, although\n excessive amounts may result in the disfiguring condi\u00ac\n tion known as mottled enamel.\n Moiler and Gudjonsson 3 described in 1932 a peculiar\n form of bone sclerosis in workers exposed to cryolite\n dust for a number of years. An exhaustive study of\n the various aspects of fluorine intoxication was made\n by Roholm.4 Loss of weight, impairment of growth\n in young persons, loss of appetite, anemia and cachexia\n are mentioned among the general symptoms of chronic\n intoxication. Cases of fluorine osteosclerosis were\n reported by Wilkie,5 Bishop,6 Shortt,7 Pandit and his\n associates 8 and Linsman and McMurray.9 The bone\n changes are those of thickening of the bone lamina and\n an increase in the whiteness of the bone shadows on the\n roentgenogram to an actual opacity of the bones and\n calcification of the ligamentous attachments. Anemia\n was present in some of the cases and was probably due\n to the displacement of the bone marrow by thickened\n trabeculae. In Pandit's experience, continued residence\n over fifteen years in the endemic area was necessary\n in the case of adults to bring about symptoms of chronic\n intoxication. The incidence and severity of the disease\n had a definite relationship to the economic and nutri\u00ac\n tional status of the community. A pronounced defi\u00ac\n ciency of the vitamin C factor in the diet was espe\u00ac\n cially associated with a severe incidence of the disease.\n Factors other than the amount of fluorine in the water\n supply may assume a contributory role in the develop\u00ac\n ment of chronic fluorine intoxication.\n \n 2.
