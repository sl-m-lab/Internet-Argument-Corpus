   "Faith ultimately has a component that is quite intangible- fundementally you have to believe it and accept that the object of your faith exists, but you will never have clear evidence that that object exists. The observer accepts its existence without the need for any evidence as such.\n \n Confidence- in the context of my comment I mean they know the tools/techniques work- they have been designed to a purpose, tested, redesigned if necessary and the tested again. There is no ambiguity here- there are limitations such as instrument error and constraints on how you apply/use the techniques/tools, but if you operate within those you know you are getting an actual measurement/value of the object in question.\n\n I guess the point im trieing to make is that there is an element of faith involved.\n So there would be an element of faith to be able to say you have the right interpretation on the evidence. However is it true that the interpretations of the evidence seems to change in time, and if it is true, then what sort of faith is needed to say the current translations are the rite translations.",

   "I guess the point im trieing to make is that there is an element of faith involved.\n\n Not really. Not in the sense that you mean it.\n \nSo there would be an element of faith to be able to say you have the right interpretation on the evidence.\n\n No. No faith at all. Science isn't a matter of just interpretation of the evidence. That is only the beginning. A scientist looks at the evidence, formulates an hypothesis, makes a prediction, and then tests the prediction. There actually isn't any claim that the theories are \"right,\" only that they are the best explanations we can devise for the observed data. There is always the possibility that additional data will not agree, and it will have to be explained in the context of the prevailing theory, or the theory will have to be changed or junked.\n \nHowever is it true that the interpretations of the evidence seems to change in time, and if it is true, then what sort of faith is needed to say the current translations are the rite [sic] translations.\n\n What are you talking about? What is being translated? Are you talking about the Bible and the changing meanings that have been attributed to that? Of course, it is typical of religions to claim absolute and unchanging right. Science doesn't. Some major theories have been so well tested that it is highly unlikely that new data will change them - plate tectonics (the movement of the plates has been measured but the reasons why they move aren't clearly understood), heliocentrism (pretty secure even though we haven't know about Pluto long enough to have seen it actually complete an orbit), special relativity (it has been tested by comparing two identical atomic clocks, one moved at high speed while the other was stationary). There are lots of scientific theories about our world. And none of them is claimed to be \"right\" beyond any possibility of contradiction. We're still learning and scientific theories are always regarded as tentative. But many of the major theories have been so well tested that it would be ridiculous to question them at every turn. First, present some heretofore unknown piece of evidence that casts doubt on the theory.\n \n Do you doubt that nuclear theory is correct? Unless you have some evidence that has been tested then there won't be many nuclear power plants shutting down because you don't have faith in them.\n \n Really, claiming that science is faith is just an effort to bring science down to the level of religion, i.e., believing without evidence.",

If the answers are convincing and appear to reflect reality accurately, then it is ASSUMED that the methods are good.\n \n All this could be totally misleading and a good scientists realizes this.\n \n It has nothing to do with faith, but everything to do with assumptions based on prior knowledge.",
