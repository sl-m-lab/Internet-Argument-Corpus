Everyone except Kerry and his campaign have refused to acknowledge defeat, although that is reasonable to do at this point in time. But if Kerry demands recounts or sends 1000s of lawyers to Ohio, I will lose any respect I ever had for the man.",

I think the election last night shows the overwhelming American transition towards conservatism. You most look beyond the presidential election in order to see it. The Democrats have ruled the government for the last 50 years. Last night American sent the message that we no longer want a democrat House Senate or Whit House. We want a more conservative government. \n \n So, yes the presidential race was close, but the dems lost a good shot at winning the house and the senate. We widened the gap and have made it even harder for them to take it next time around.

Very little sits still.\n \n And just because something changes or is different now doesn't mean it was right or wrong before. It's way more complicated than that. It might just be different. Or the times call for different things. For example - the citizens desperately needed A LOT of assistance from the government during the depression - everyone was starving. Things are different now, not so dire. That doesn't mean that what FDR did was bad, it just that the same stuff is not needed - or perceived to be needed. \n \n And I think it is issue driven. More people held in priority and agreed with Bush's stance on some things than Kerry's.\n \n I am not sure if I am wording that well.\n \n Examples: \n \n Take me, my dad my friend. I am Christian. I am liberal. I voted Kerry. He is conservative. He is an atheist. He voted Bush. He disagrees with the president's \"religious\" agenda - but agrees with his economic one and that mattered more to him.\n \n My priorities are different. Civil liberties are usually my top issue, I disagree with the president on his stance there, regardless of how may or may not feel about his stance on other issues. Even if I agreed with him on Iraq and the economy he would have been trumped by Kerry because I disagree with him on the Patriot Act and gay marriage and reproductive rights and those issues are more important to me.\n \n My friend agrees with me on social issues and the Patriot Act but voted for Bush because Iraq was a bigger issue for her and she agrees with the president there.\n \n There is no way we are heading to political homogony.

   "Are you people all on crack? \n \n First of all, I hate Bush and Kerry equally. I really had no preference whatsoever in this election. Both of those guys represent the reason that our bill of rights contains the 2nd ammendment (because they are both the kind of folks who should probably be dragged up against the wall and shot). I have no biase as far as the election goes. I voted libertarian, and I generally dislike liberals. That said......\n \n We had 2 liberals to choose from in this election, how could you possibly say that the country is moving towards conservatism when the guy who just got re-elected pushed through a trillion dollar plus social program (the largest wholly federally funded social program EVER passed) in his last term? How can you possibly see him as anything but a liberal when he increased the size of government more than any president in the last 50 years? TED KENNEDY has made meritorious arguments regarding Bushs fiscal responsibility. When TED KENNEDY (the tax and spend liberal poster child) correctly points out fiscal irresponisibilty in somebody, that person has some MAJOR problems. This is the guy who left $77 TRILLION in unfunded federal obligations, and a vote for him is a vote for conservatism? This is the guy who tried to convince us that holding people in prison indefinatly, and without trial, was a GOOD thing (including American citizens ON AMERICAN SOIL).\n \n Lets say for a second that you actually believe his latest excuse for the debacle in irq, liberating the Iraqi people. Guess what, guys, conservative presidents do NOT send our military all over the planet \"liberating\" people on the taxpayers dollar with no return in the forseeable future. \n \n I can't help but laugh (sometimes uncontrollably, verging on hysterically) when I think about what a bunch of XXXXXX some of you people are. There were NO REAL DIFFERENCES between the platform of GW and Kerry. They both had the same sorry, poorly defined plan in Iraq. They both have similar plans for the economy, they both have similar views on gay marriage, etc.... YET, there are those who truly believe that handing over the country to one or the other would lead inevitably to our downfall. \n \n To anybody who wished for a conservative president, I hate to be the one to clue you in. YOU HAD NO DOG IN THIS HUNT\n \n You want conservative? Michael Badnarik was the only conservative in this election. Pat Buchanan was the only conservative in the last election. Neither one of these guys really had a snowballs chance in hell, because there are not enough true conservatives left in this country to get either elected, so the republicans knew that they had to find a canidate who could appeal to the liberal leaning swing voters.\n \n I sincerely hope that GW renegs on every one of his campaign promises, because we simply cannot afford the $3 trillion price tag that comes with his proposed programs (social programs...again, not real conservative).\n \n Anyway, try not to break your arm patting yourself on the back over your accomplishment at getting a \"conservative\" into the white house. Please, though, try to avoid somehow attaching the constituion to Bush, after all, he is the guy who tried to scrap the bill of rights (didn't you read the patriot act????). \n \n I do think that both parties did an excellent job of getting people to the polls, and an even better job of convincing the American public that there was actually a major difference between the two platforms. They may have done too good a job at this, as pointed out this morening by Chris Mathews. He said \"It will be difficult for the country to reconcile itself following the election. The two sides absolutly hate each other\". \n \n Leave it to the American Sheeple to look at two platforms, which on many points are the same word for word, and still believe that there is some difference serious enough to hate your fellow American over. \n \n For all you Kerry followers out there who are having trouble dealing with the loss, I have a simple solution. When Bush is on TV, just pretend it is kerry. With the exception of their health care plans (kerrys wouldn't have passed a republican congress anyway) they had either identical or similar views on every issue out there. No need to be depressed, you can just live in a constant state of denial for the next 4 years, much as the conservatives will have to in order to pretend that GW is a conservative.",

Do we really have to blow half our budget on it, though? \n \n \nWe just get our boys in office and you guys want to pull your support. We need to press them now more than ever\n\n \n You are incapable of \"pressing\" them because all they care about is special interests and getting re-elected, and you have made it clear here that when election time comes around, you will go into the little both and push the republican button like some kind of unthinking monkey. Push the button, get your banana. \n \n \nYou forgot about Michael Peroutka! hehe. well he wasn't on a lot of the ballots.\n\n \n This is true, he is a conservative. If you can't get on the ballot in every state, are you actually running??",

   "Wrong again Dono. You have once again failed to read or failed to comprehend my post. Allow me to walk you thru my point in this thread also. I said the country is moving overwhelmingly to the conservative side. You and Waxy both have failed to address the whole picture. \n \n Again, yes the presidential race was close. Not an overwhelming win. However the country has elected more and more conservatives to the Senate and the House since the mid 1990's. Now the conservatives hold all three branches of government, the House, the Senate, and the White House.\n \n That is what I called Overwhelming. Holding your hand thru these debates is getting old. Let's refresh.\n \n 1st- read and understand\n 2nd- refute the actual statement (instead of the statement you concieved and assigned to me.)\n\n \n I admit without reservation that I sometimes have a problem comprehending your ramblings, a problem I'm sure is shared by others on the forum. Perhaps I misused the word \"underwhelming\" in relation to your post because that seems to come to mind when I read many of your statements .... it is one of the kinder words. I will accept your apology for your spelling if you will promise not to hold my hand .... not a pretty picture in my mind's eye.\n Dono",
