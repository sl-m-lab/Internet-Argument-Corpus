   "CITIZENS UNITED, Appellant v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\n \n http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/scotus-fec-argument20090909.pdf\n \n \nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over whether government limits on corporate and union political spending violate free-speech rights, in a case that could prove pivotal in a longstanding constitutional debate.\n \n The court gave no explanation for scheduling the unusual summer argument a month before the customary start of its term. It was seen as a signal that the conservative majority could be ready to strike down key aspects of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law and supporting precedents that are the foundations for current restrictions on corporate and union election spending. (See a transcript of Wednesday's argument.)\n\n From the Wall Street Journal.\n \n The newest justice, Sonia Sotomayor, has raised the issue of the origins of the legal concept of \"corporate personhood.\"",
