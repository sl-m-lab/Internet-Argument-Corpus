Your ignorant opinions about abortion do not impress me, nor do they affect the lives of the poor women who are put in the terrible position in which abortion becomes an option. The one thing I might agree with you upon is that it is a terrible thing, life should be treasured. But not a one of you \"pro-lifers\" has ever given consideration to a single moment past the time of the abortion. Have you ever considered what kind of a life a child would expect to have without the love of their parents? Another thing you might consider in your time off from misinterpreting the words of the bible is the term overpopulation. In China, they have such a problem, not only do you have to be given the nod from the government to have a child, if you do so without their consent, you are required to abort! Pretty picture, huh?

To be exact, the type of abortion in which a child's limbs are \"ripped off\" for years has only been permitted in dire medical need, but because of people like you, this has recently been outlawed , meaning you take more consideration for the life of the unborn than that of the mother. Shameful. You also calim that an abortion causes trauma to your life- do you mean emotional trauma?

   "Post Abortive Stress Syndrome (PASS) (http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html)\n \n \"Standard PTSD is a psychological dysfunction that often comes from threats or experiences of physical injury, sexual violation, and the witnessing of or participating in a violent death. It's the same as the \"shell-shock\" that veterans go through. The trauma makes the victim's defense mechanisms soar out of control. They take on a life of their own and cause alterations in personality and behavior. In technical terms, the results are hyper-arousal (extreme sensitivity, nervous agitation, sleeplessness, constant alert to danger); intrusion (the bad experience breaks into ordinary life, often in the form of nightmares) and constriction (inability to reach out to others and express emotions). The trauma in PASS comes from the pressure to abort from boyfriends or family, the anxiety over choosing the abortion, the physical pain of the procedure (despite anesthesia!) and, most obviously, guilt once the abortion has been performed. Some women have even said that an abortion feels like rape - a sexual violation performed by a complete stranger causing extraordinary pain. PASS is particularly virulent in women who have had chemical abortions, because these abortions produce a complete, perfect and dead child. \n \n One study found that at least 19 percent of women who have had abortions suffer from some form of PASS. In all likelihood, the rate is actually higher, because these studies have high drop-out rates - and generally from the women who suffer the most intensely. Dr. Wanda Franz, testifying before a congressional hearing on the impact of abortion in March of 1989, summarized the syndrome by saying that women \"report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts and of blood ... they re-experienced it [the abortion] with terrible psychological pain ... they feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities - the role of being a mother.\" \n \n It doesn't stop there. There are reports of sexual dysfunction, both of extreme revulsion to sex and extreme promiscuity. Many women contemplate suicide and a fair number of those attempt it; studies in England and Finland identify a definite link between abortion and suicide. Smoking, drinking and drug use all increase after abortions, as do eating disorders. Post-abortive women are more prone to divorce and chronic relationship problems; they find it difficult to bond with their children born after the abortion and many simply continue the pattern - by now, 45 percent of all abortions are repeat abortions. All these expressions of PASS can show up from minutes after the abortion to decades later. Often it takes five to ten years of denial before the memories and emotions begin to surface uncontrollably. \n \n The turmoil of PASS is probably best seen in the dreams of those suffering from it. The site afterabortion.org catalogs a number of these dreams. Here's a fairly representative one: \n \n My dream has been repeated so many times over the years ... I can wake myself up now. The dream starts in an old three-story house. Sometimes I'm in the back of the house, sometimes I'm just driving up, sometimes I am already in the house. Big, white, clean, hardwood floors, beautifully decorated. I always think that it is a good dream. Then I start up the beautiful winding stairs. I am apprehensive but I still go up the stairs. I finally make it to the room on the third floor. The room is completely empty. There is only a white box under the window across the room. I walk into the room. I am never alone, someone is always with me. That part is ironic considering the complete feelings of isolation I have had all these years. Anyway, I walk to the box. Sometimes I hear a baby crying and I quickly open the box only to find it empty. Other times I have opened the box to find baby clothes. Other times I have found a dead baby. Other times I have found my old bloody clothes. I stand over the box crying and the intensity wakes me up.\"\n \n Yup, us Pro-Lifers definately don't care about the woman. We are Patriarchial Men who are plotting ways to keep them upstart women under our thumb. We want to ruin women's lives. Our lives are driven by a compulsion to control. We don't really care that the unborn, which we believe to be human, is being murdered. No, that's just a front so's we can use compassionate people to unwittingly help us fulfill our neurotic need for power.",

You can't have an abortion without the fetus being a certain size. However, abortions are still done quite often at later stages.

How ridiculous! It's called Surgical Abortion and no it hasn't been outlawed. If you go to a Planned Parenthood office they offer it.

If it were her body the fetus would need to have the same DNA, same blood type, same everything. But it doesn't. The fetus has a different DNA. The fetus has a different blood type. Also, if the fetus was part of the mother, then that would mean the mother has two vaginas, or a penis and vagina, or four arms, four legs, two different brains, four eyes, four legs, two hearts, et cetera. I don't think there is such thing as one human being with all that. B) The child does feel pain. The nervous system comes at around six weeks, and sympathetic nerves come at 8 weeks. 78% of abortions are done during or AFTER the 6th week, and 60% of abortions are done during or after the 8th week. Obviously, most abortions do cause the pain of the fetus. But does it matter whether it feels pain or not? If I go unconscious, most likely I don't feel pain. Does that mean anyone has the right to kill me? Of course not. C) Why does the woman have a right to control anything growing in her body? That doesn't necessarily matter. If I were to shrink and be placed in a tiny ship to go into the mother's body to fix her heart, does she have the right to kill me? No. The fetus is a living, human being, who has every right in the world.",

(PS its CELINE- as in the greek moon goddess, not SALINE- as in a water/salt solution.)\n\n \n 1) Would you put an infant \"out of it's misery\"? Obviously, horses and humans are two different things. Humans have laws; animals have instinct. Every human is going to eventually die. Just because the fetus would die at the age of three doesn't mean it doesn't have a right to live. This is why the overwhelming population of handicapped people are pro-life- if you're not conceived perfectly with no problems, you're killed. Handicapped people aren't perfectly created, so they know they will be next. \n \n 2) Why does that matter? Have you not seen the movie \"Gattaca\"? The main character in the movie, Vincent (later \"Jerome\"), wasn't born perfectly in his futuristic world, where humans were created genetically perfect. He had a 99% chance of dying at the age of 30 from heart failure. His whole life people thought of him as chronically ill. So much so, there was a new lower-class of people who weren't genetically perfect. In the work force, the only good-paying prestigious jobs were only open to people created perfectly. He fought the system and eventually got the most prestigious job there, and he didn't die at the age of 30. Nothing happened. I've been to ICUs. I think it's great that mothers are trying to save their children. But do you think parents should make the decision to kill their newborn infant, or should they do their best to let it live? \n \n \n Except in the case of late term abortion, the fetus is removed intact. (This is to pervent a little thing called toxic shock syndrome) And also I might point out, again, that in most cases, the abortion is performed before the end of the first trimester. \n\n \n LOL! Here is an image drawn by Nucleus Medical Art that shows the abortion procedure on a 9-week-old fetus. I could show you the 23-week old one too if you'd like. Secondly, according to the CDC, 60% of abortions are done during or after the 8th week, when the fetus can feel pain. This is before the first trimester, but the first trimester goes all the way to 12 weeks. \n \n \n Simple anatomy here: pain is the brain's response to electrical stimuli, without a fully developed nervous system, including complete neural networks, this \"feeling\" does not exist.\n\n \n That doesn't matter. The  fetus still feels pain, and this is from a very liberal site \n \n  This signal is sent via nerve pathways to the spinal column, then to the thalamus - an egg-shaped structure within the brain. Finally the signal is transferred to the cerebral cortex where it is sensed as pain. In a fetus, the pain receptors develop around 7 weeks after conception; the spino-thalamic system at about 13 weeks. Here\n \n  He estimated the age at which a preborn child feels pain: \"As early as eight to 10 weeks' gestation, and definitely by thirteen and a half weeks, the human fetus experiences organic pain.\" Here\n \n The fetus feels the full pain at 20 weeks, that is pain like we feel, but there is still pain to the fetus with the new pain receptors. \n \n \n What gives you more right than she to make these decisions?\n answer carefully.\n\n \n What makes the government the right for me not to kill you? Why should I listen to the Pope? Your parent says it's wrong for me to kill you, but what gives them to make my decision? It's MY choice, is it not?",

How it must have felt to have her skin, inch by inch, burned to a crisp. took a while too, I'm sure. Hours. compared to the ten minute (at a stretch) abortion procedure.\n\n \n So we should've killed Joan of Arc when she was a fetus, right? What about when she was newly born? What if she was paralyzed? What if she was unconscious? Just because you either don't or feel little pain doesn't mean that somebody has the right to inflict it on you, because in their opinion you should be dead. I'm sure Joan of Arc was happy she lived. I'm happy I lived. If I died savagely, I'm not going to ask God to make it so I never existed; I'm happy that I at least had a little bit of life. \n \n \n \nYou talk about the pain of an incomplete, partially formed embryo, one that has not the nervous system to support the feeling of pain, and in the same post you then point out how great Jean d'Arc's life was? How much worse off she would have been if she had not lived? I'm sure she felt that way as she was imprisoned, tortured, and finally executed by the devoutly religious. \n She was killed at the hands of the Catholics, remember? The same people who are supposed to believe in \"Thou shalt not kill\"\n And remember, it took the church 500 years to decide, well, maybe we shouldn't a done that.\n\n \n She was Catholic, and in fact a Catholic saint, and before that she was a venerable, and blessed (only a few decades after her death). Sure, it took the church 500 years to decide if she was a saint or not- but it takes a while. We weren't sure if her miracles were true; we weren't sure if she was holy. The church doesn't just say \"Ah she was good, she must be a saint!\". It takes YEARS for one to be a saint. It took Kateri Tekawitha 150 years. Joan of Arc's time is relatively short compared to others.",

   "I don't doubt that Abortion has been around for a long time. But I'm positive murder has been around longer, which was the debate me and Charchuk were having.\n\n \n Murder has only been around since there was the concept of law to define it.\n \n \n1) Would you put an infant \"out of it's misery\"? Obviously, horses and humans are two different things. Humans have laws; animals have instinct. Every human is going to eventually die. Just because the fetus would die at the age of three doesn't mean it doesn't have a right to live.\n\n \n Apples and oranges.\n \n \nThis is why the overwhelming population of handicapped people are pro-life- if you're not conceived perfectly with no problems, you're killed. Handicapped people aren't perfectly created, so they know they will be next.\n\n \n Guess what, I'm handicapped. I'm a victim of Thalidomide. Walk in my shoes for a while and you'll change your mind in a hurry. I'm also slowly going blind, I'm a type II diabetic, and every joint in my body is doubled (loose). I have to walk with a cane and take pain medication. You remind me of the old saying, \"I cried because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet.\" I have no feet (Well not literally, but you get the point.) I can speak for the handicapped. Shut up, you don't know what you're talking about.\n \n \nLOL! Here is an image drawn by Nucleus Medical Art that shows the abortion procedure on a 9-week-old fetus. I could show you the 23-week old one too if you'd like. Secondly, according to the http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5109a1.htm ]CDC[/url], 60% of abortions are done during or after the 8th week, when the fetus can feel pain. This is before the first trimester, but the first trimester goes all the way to 12 weeks.\n\n \n It is a drawing, not a photo.\n \n \nThat doesn't matter. The  fetus still feels pain, and this is from a very liberal site \n \n  This signal is sent via nerve pathways to the spinal column, then to the thalamus - an egg-shaped structure within the brain. Finally the signal is transferred to the cerebral cortex where it is sensed as pain. In a fetus, the pain receptors develop around 7 weeks after conception; the spino-thalamic system at about 13 weeks. Here\n \n  He estimated the age at which a preborn child feels pain: \"As early as eight to 10 weeks' gestation, and definitely by thirteen and a half weeks, the human fetus experiences organic pain.\" Here\n \n The fetus feels the full pain at 20 weeks, that is pain like we feel, but there is still pain to the fetus with the new pain receptors. \n\n \n Having pain and knowing pain are two different things.\n \n \nWhat makes the government the right for me not to kill you?\n\n \n Their ability to punish you.\n \n \nWhy should I listen to the Pope? Your parent says it's wrong for me to kill you, but what gives them to make my decision? It's MY choice, is it not?\n\n \n If you're not of legal age they are responsible for your actions.",

I don't think anyone has ever accused it of being canine, bovine, etc.\n \n You say it has it's own future, but unfortunately, you fail to realize that every child's future is determined by it's parents. At least the technical parts of it's future, like survival. (I'm not going to get into whether it will be a doctor, lawyer or indian chief with you)\n Maybe she'll decide not to have an abortion, but then decide not to use a car seat... a much more dangerous and tragic proposition.\n \n Perhaps that child's future is destined never to be realized, or better put, perhaps its destiny is to be aborted. The idea that it has its own future apart from what the mother decides is strictly a matter of opinion.\n \n My opinion is that nothing is pre-ordained, there is no such thing as destiny, fate, etc. The choices we each personally make determine our future, what else? God? the very concept of god is a matter of opinion, not fact.\n \n You also say that it has a genetic blueprint- which is true. but every component of that blueprint is genetically handed down by either the mother or the father\n \n NOT YOU\n \n So why should you, or anyone else, but the mother or father have any say in the future of that molecular structure?",

   " The mind is always active, even when it is not connected to the waking part of it. Just take brainscans of any coma patient. The waves maybe different, but they are still there.\n\n \n The dictionary, as you pointed out, is not necessarily the best place to define scientific terms in the medical field, which is why my definition came from a medical dictionary. If we look at a regular dictionary, it says \"Consciousness\" is the \"mind\". \n \n  Main Entry: con\u0095scious\u0095ness \n Pronunciation: -n&s\n Function: noun\n Date: 1632\n 1 a : the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself b : the state or fact of being conscious of an external object, state, or fact c : AWARENESS; especially : concern for some social or political cause\n 2 : the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought : MIND\n 3 : the totality of conscious states of an individual\n 4 : the normal state of conscious life <regained consciousness<\n 5 : the upper level of mental life of which the person is aware as contrasted with unconscious processes\n \n  Main Entry: 1un\u0095con\u0095scious \n Pronunciation: \"&n-'k\u00e4n(t)-sh&s\n Function: adjective\n Date: 1712\n 1 a : not knowing or perceiving : not aware b : free from self-awareness\n 2 a : not possessing mind or consciousness <unconscious matter< b (1) : not marked by conscious thought, sensation, or feeling <unconscious motivation< (2) : of or relating to the unconscious c : having lost consciousness <was unconscious for three days<\n 3 : not consciously held or deliberately planned or carried out <unconscious bias<\n - un\u0095con\u0095scious\u0095ly adverb\n - un\u0095con\u0095scious\u0095ness noun \n \n Further, brain waves aren't part of the mind. As I've shower from the medical dictionary, one must be able to \"think, reason, perceive, will, and feel\". Brain waves don't involve any of these things. \n \n \n It is not a human being, a person. having human DNA doesn't make one a person.\n\n \n The mind isn't the only source of personhood. The fetus has its OWN DNA. Sure, if a fetus has a twin or is closed it doesn't have its own DNA, but it still has, at least something of its own. Also, there really isn't such thing as a \"non-person, living, human\". Such humans don't exist! Throughout history, blacks, women, people of different religions, et cetera, were considered human non-persons. But the truth of the matter is such humans don't exist. \n \n \n It maybe alive, but it doesn't have a life.\n\n \n How? Debating involves having a counter argument, not just making a counter statement. If you say that your car is green, I can easily say \"no it's not\" or \"it's blue\", but I need an argument with evidence to back it up. I'm assuming you're saying that because the zygote doesn't have a brain means it's not a life. Jellyfish don't have brains, but they have lives, don't they? If a jellyfish killed another jellyfish would that jellyfish be committing murder, or no? \n \n \n Please, you're the one who is incoherent. You don't even know the different being human and being a human being, a person. Or even the correct definition of conscious and unconscious. And of course you don't know what you're talking about in the least when ot comes to the two states.\n\n \n Show me an example of a human non-person that has a life. \n \n Boopee20, \n \n \n I start to think that I am horrible for believing that women have rights\n\n \n It's not horrible to believe women have rights. That's not a bad thing. There is even a very large organization called Feminists for Life. The thing is just because women have rights doesn't mean they can decide whether their children should live or die. \n \n \n Anyway, no one is saying that a zygote or an embryo is a \"nonentity\". But until it can live independently of the mother's body, it is a part of her body. I've yet to meet a person who has had an abortion who did not find the experience traumatic and had to grieve the loss. It is a terrible thing. Attacking people who go through that tragedy is cruel and misplaced.\n\n \n In the 1950's the earliest point of viability for the fetus was 8 months. By 1970 it was 7 months. Today, we can do it at 5 months. Does this mean that the 7-month-old fetus in 1950 wasn't human, but now is? Does that make any sense?\n \n \n \n So where do you draw the line, oh person-who-feels-they-can-define-what-no-one-else-can? Is sperm a person? Is an ovum? Every 28 days I get rid of a potential child, am I a murderer for that? Should I please god and get pregnant very time I ovulate? Should I then have started at eleven years old?\n \n \n But the Sperm and Egg are part of another being's body. They aren't their own beings. The DNA of the sperm is half the DNA of the father, and the DNA of the egg is half the DNA of the mother. The fetus, however, has it's OWN DNA. If the fetus is part of the mother, would that mean the mother has two blood types? Two brains? If the fetus is a boy, a penis? Of course not, that's ridiculous!",

A parasite cannot live independently. \n Parasitic diseases include infections by protozoa, helminths, and arthropods: \n \u0095 Protozoa -- Malaria is caused by plasmodium, a protozoa, a single-cell organism that can only divide within its host organism. \n \u0095 Helminths -- Schistosomiasis, another set of very important parasitic diseases, is caused by a helminth (a worm). \n \u0095 Arthropods -- The arthropods include insects and arachnids (spiders, etc.), a number of which can act as vectors (carriers) of parasitic diseases. \n The term \"parasite\" came from the Greek \"parasitos\" (para-, along side of + sitos, food) meaning \"eating at the side of, as at the same table.\" The sense of the term later changed to that of a poor friend or relative who lived at the expense of another. Not until the 18th century did \"parasite\" come into English as a biologic term. \n The study of parasites is parasitology. \n \n Yes, a fetus is a parasite, for at least the first 5 months of the pregnancy (this will change in time). Either way, the fetus is still a human being. It is NOT part of the mother! \n \n \n OK, genius, name me a single parasite that lives off a host of the same species ( besides your flawed thinking on pregnancy)\n While it has it's own DNA, each and every element of that genetic identification can be directly traced to it's parents.

'Terminate' is used more for non-living beings, when the fetus is a living being. You're not only terminating the pregnancy, you're killing the fetus. \n \n What, in your opinion, is the fetus?

(My rapist infected me with a STD, which resulted in my being unable to ever conceive a child.) The very idea of having no choice as whether I had to maintain a pregnancy that resulted from that attack would be both physically and emotionally devistating. The very idea that a child who has never had to endure the pain and humiliation of being assulted in this way would strive to dictate how someone would be legally allowed to recover from a rape is outrageous.

I could just as easily say \"I am a woman and was raped\" as well.\n\n \n You're the one who likes to use emotional blackmail.\n \n \nI don't really believe you (too many liars on this debate forum), but let's pretend like you were really raped.\n\n \n It is more likely there is too much truth on the forum for you to handle.\n \n \nSo what? Does that mean only YOU understand this and only YOU can decide to kill your child? You're punishing the child for a crime it's father committed!\n\n \n Only the person involved can understand. It is not up to you. \n \n \nInteresting statistics, but you don't have to tell me how bad rape is. I already know. It does not, however, excuse the woman from killing her child.\n\n \n A fetus is not a child, no more than you or I are children. (Though, I wonder about you.)\n \n \nIf I was raped that doesn't mean I can do whatever I want, especially when somebody's life is in risk.\n\n \n No one else's life is at risk. \n \n \nShe isn't being forced, it's the only option. If the mother gave birth to this child, and she couldn't give it up for adoption, should she kill it, because she'd have to endure the pain of caring for a child in her already traumatized state? No! \n\n \n If apples were oranges would pears be bananas?\n \n \nThe rights of a child and fetus are equal- both are human beings. As long as both of them are human beings, they have equal rights.\n\n \n Wrong, under the law they are not equal since a fetus is not a human being, a person. A child is.\n \n \nWhat gives the woman the right to kill her child? Tell me.\n\n \n Nothing. But a fetus is not a child. It is an early stage of developement.\n \n \nOkay, so then, you understand the fetus is biologically independent, is a human being, feels pain from 12 weeks on (actually, 7, but we wont go there), and can think sometime later in pregnancy (second and third trimesters).\n\n \n Wrong on two accounts. It is neither a human being, nor does it experience pain. Experience and feel and two difference things.\n \n \nWhat gives you the right to kill it? If it is human, it's ALWAYS wrong to kill it. If it is not human, it's never wrong to kill it. Make your pick.\n\n \n You are still having trouble with the concept between the difference of being human and being a human being. From what I've seen here that is willful ignorance.\n \n \nOF course. But that still doesn't mean Incest is ALWAYS rape!\n\n \n But it is always a crime.",

Not everyone in the world has a Biblical view of morality, you know. A woman who was impregnated when raped aborts the fetus because that is what is best for all concerned. She knows that she will not be able to care for and love the child, so she prevents it from becoming one. As you have never been pregnant, I doubt you could possibly understand. I realize this does not prevent you from feeling that you can judge others, however.\n \n \nIt does not, however, excuse the woman from killing her child. \n\n \n She doesn't have a child yet. She is pregnant, and will have a child when it is born.\n \n \nThat's just like you and a soda straw...all you gotta do is open your mouth, and voila! To detach a child from it's mother's placenta....it takes a knife! And then stiches. Can you guess why this might be? Hint- it's that shared wall idea.\n\n \n \nWhat gives the woman the right to kill her child? Tell me. \n\n \n Oh, I see. You try to avoid admitting that you were proven wrong by clumsily changing the subject. Besides, as I said, a fetus is not a child yet. \n \n \nA fetus is not a child,\n\n \n An easy distinction Parcum has trouble with.\n \n \nI assert that ANY TIME an adult has sexual contact with a child, it is rape. Relatives included. Intercourse is not a requirement, only forced sexual contact. Because of the reasons you listed, I am sure you can see that other types of sexual activity are just as harmful.\n\n \n Oh, I don't know. Some people say that sexual assault is one thing, rape another. Keep in mind that the term rape was invented for a different purpose than it is now used, which is why penetration was a necessary component. I tend to use the term \"sexual assault\" as the umbrella term, whereas \"rape\" is maybe more specific. Then again, if someone is having trouble feeling for themselves, a term like \"rape\" is useful, because it evokes such an emotional response. I also know that it is true that penetration is not a necessary factor in the level of trauma experienced through sexual assault, so I guess it's a matter of context and opinion.\n \n \nBut the reason I don't want to kill him is not some moral ideal,\n\n \n Very right, superbuddhaman. I think the only reason it would be a bad idea to kill a rapist is that you might end up getting caught and going to jail. \n \n I'd also like to say that as a fellow survivor I really appreciated your post, and I hope you will completely ignore Parcum's immature and ignorant response. :)",

A woman has the right to choose who she has sexual intercourse with, and when. She also has the right to decide who she wants to father her children. It obviously is of no consequence to you what the woman's mental capability might be in dealing with a pregnancy, or the raising of a child.

Apparently you have no concern for the woman's well being at all. Over and over you have voiced the typical opinion of an 18th century bourgois man. Pick up your dictionary and look up the word progress.\n \n \n\n These statistics come from  the liberal Alan Guttmacher Institute. \n \n\n Oh, right, the institute you dismissed because it's area of research is women's reproductive health, including the research of abortion.

I cannot commit incest. I cannot steal. If I say women aren't allowed to steal, am I trying to take away women's rights? No. I'm trying to prevent them from doing wrong. Mothers often get sick when caring for their children- should we allow mothers to defend themselves by killing their children? \n \n \n this coming from an unbiased person such as yourself.\n\n \n Very good.\n \n \n That's exactly waht you are doing when you deny a woman the right to a late term abortion! deciding one person's value outweighs the other.\n\n \n Both equally have rights to life. It's not denying life- it's defending another's life. Again, everyone has rights, but that doesn't mean you should kill another life. AS for late term abortions, which I am assuming you're talking about when the mother's life is threatened (late term abortions are also allowed when the mother's life is NOT threatened), the goal isn't to kill one, the goal is to save both. Medical doctors CAN save both today. But in this case abortion should be allowed- but indirect abortion, meaning, the doctor killed the fetus in order to save the mother's life, not to simply kill the fetus. \n \n \n I am leaning towards the opinion you misinterpreted (intentionally) their arguments. From what I have read, they definitely have a better grasp of biology than you do.\n\n \n In what way? Please tell me. The fetus is a human being. Fact. The fetus has it's own circulatory system, it's own blood type, it's own GNA, it's own organs, et cetera. The fetus is a being. The fetus can only be a human being because of biogenesis. What more is there to be explained? That statement was merely an insult- please, if you're going to insult me, tell me why!\n \n \n Again, you are using very bad comparisons. Or are you actually implying that when a woman has an abortion, she is trying to kill all children, and thus, all humanity?\n\n \n Of course not. But if the government says it's OK to kill Jews, and I asked a Jew into my home to fix my stereo, do I have a right to kill the Jew because he's in my home? It's my home, I can do whatever I want. Right?",

   "It's very different with the internet. In the internet world, you can lie all you want- nobody's going to find out if you're lying or not.\n\n It is true that the internet makes it easier to lie, but I think that's a gross exagerration. Either way, this does not mean that you are temporarily excused from having to treat others with basic human kindness.\n \n \nYour idea is misinformed. \n\n Why, were you lying?\n \n \nEmotion shouldn't get into debates because it attempts to justify something that is unjustifiable. \n\n An absurd statement if I ever heard one. You cannot divorce yourself from your emotions, even if it were a good idea. Which it wouldn't be.\n \n \nI'm going to commit homicide and you can't stop me\n\n I don't see it that way. Neither does the law, so using words like \"homicide\" is misleading. I'm not pregnant right now, so it doesn't matter either way. However, if I did at some point decide to have an abortion, I wouldn't give your opinion a millisecond's thought. I would probably immediately start with herbal emmenagogues and abortifacients, such as wild carrot seed (Queen Anne's Lace), and high doses of vitamin c and parsley.\n \n \nMild Emmenagogues: \n These include Parsley, Ginger, Yarrow, Feverfew, Rosemary and Sage. For more information on these herbs \n \n Medium Strength Emmenagogues: \n Parsley , Queen Anne's Lace Seeds , Black Cohosh , Mugwort, Juniper. \n \n Strong Emmenagogues Include: Several of these herbs are also listed as abortifacients , which I have given a page of its own. You can find more information about these herbs there. \n Pennyroyal, Angelica, Savin, Rue, Tansy, Asafetida, Blue Cohosh , and Vitamin C , celery seed, birthwort. \n \n Uterine Contracting Herbs Include: \n Herbs with Oxytocic properties - these herbs induce uterine contractions by stimulating oxytocin. \n Blue Cohosh, Cotton Seed/Root, Angelica and Marijuana \n Herbs containing Thujone Thujone is a volatile oil found in several plants known to be a uterine stimulant. Anyone with a tendency toward epileptic seizures should not use herbs containing thujone. \n Tansy, Mugwort, Juniper berries, Chamomile. \n Misc Uterine Contracting Herbs These herbs have unique properties which cause uterine contractions: \n Angelica Root, Blue Cohosh, Ginger, Parsley, Pennyroyal, and Rosemary \n \n Herbs which Stimulate the Uterus This is desirable to aid in dislodging the fertilized egg. \n Angelica, Black Cohosh, Ginger, Horseradish, Queen Anne's Lace Seeds/Root \n \n Herbs which contain Estrogenic Properties These herbs can cause estrogen-like side effects including abnormal blood clotting, liver problems and aggravate estrogen-dependent tumors \n Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, QAL, Pomegranate seeds  \n \n Antispasmodic Herbs The abortive properties are believed to possibly result from the relaxant action on the uterus, causing inhibition of movement to such an extent that an abortion occurs. \n Black Cohosh \n \n Implantation Inhibiting Herbs These herb interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg, they are generally used after fertilizing intercourse until menstruation is due. For more information Herbal Contraceptives & Implantation Inhibitors \n Cotton Root, Juniper Root, Queen Anne's Lace Seeds, Vitamin C, Rue/Rutin. \n\n \n I would highly recommend to any woman certain she is terminating her pregnancy to start taking herbs right away. Of course one should always use appropriate caution, as these herbs (especially the stronger abortifacients) are powerful and thus must be used with caution. That said, using herbs early on can terminate the pregnancy before you even get an abortion consult, which is definitely IMO worth the trouble.",

   "The thing is, your mind is blocked now. You don't understand both sides, you only understand one, and that is that you were completely taken advantage of and raped, and feel horrible. Hence, your only concept is that the only solution to your problem is abortion. You can't remember before, about what happened before you were raped, what you would think of abortion. This knowledge is nessecary. Sure, I don't fully understand what goes on with rape victims, but if my dad was an alcoholic, and I say that because only I understand that he was an alcoholic I can kill him, does that give me the right to kill him? \n\n Thankyou once again for your misguided presumption. I do understand both sides of the argument, and I do understand why you might take the side you have. \n I do not feel horrible about what happened to me. Actually I feel very good about the way I went about my recovery, and feel that it is complete. The physical pain lasted much longer than the emotional in my case, for the simple fact that I was not to blame for his actions. I have a very good understanding of the motivations of a rapist, it is to have power over another, to harm their psyche by means of harming their body. And I assure you I can remember before, and my pro-choice opinion was very well founded long before that unfortunate event. In fact, if I had become pregnant at that point, I doubt I would have chosen abortion.\n Your example of an alcoholic father is, like most examples you use, irrelevant and confusing. If you were to kill him, it would be for the jury to decide your guilt, not me. Just like with abortion, there would obviously be aggregates of the situation that I was not privy to, and so I would be wrong to pass judgement.\n \n \n\n Yes. She must. Once again, the woman must suffer so that another may live. Having an abortion isn't going to erase the fact that you were pregnant- waiting a few months and delivering the baby won't either. It's not the baby's fault. Again, if you gave birth to that child, would you have the right to kill it?\n \n\n Why should the woman suffer? When a woman chooses to get pregnant, it is very unlikely to carry with it the physical repercussions of rape. You obviously have no concern for who this woman might be or her own personal medical history. Your only concern is your own moral view, that is wrong.\n \n \n\n The holocaust also killed homosexuals, and handicapped people- persons who weren't born perfect. Remember Margaret Sanger? Remember her famous \"Negro Project\" plan? At any rate, women can have rights. Everyone can have rights. But some rights are limited. I cannot kill you. I cannot rape you. I cannot commit incest. I cannot steal. If I say women aren't allowed to steal, am I trying to take away women's rights? No. I'm trying to prevent them from doing wrong. Mothers often get sick when caring for their children- should we allow mothers to defend themselves by killing their children? \n \n\n You cannot do any of those things to me because the law has said you can't. Actually, you can, but then I have the legal recourse. As when you say a woman is not allowed to steal, you are again dismissing the specific circumstances of each case. What if she was stealing food to feed the child it was so important to you she have? Remember 'Les Miserables'? The lead character was imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread. Pretty harsh sentence, but I must assume you would agree with the villains in that plot.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Both equally have rights to life. It's not denying life- it's defending another's life. Again, everyone has rights, but that doesn't mean you should kill another life. AS for late term abortions, which I am assuming you're talking about when the mother's life is threatened (late term abortions are also allowed when the mother's life is NOT threatened), the goal isn't to kill one, the goal is to save both. Medical doctors CAN save both today. But in this case abortion should be allowed- but indirect abortion, meaning, the doctor killed the fetus in order to save the mother's life, not to simply kill the fetus. \n \n\n Once again you are very confusing, but I will try again to decode your meaning. If the doctor can save both, without risking serious damage to either, he will. For years now it has been illegal for a woman to volunteer for such a procedure without medical reason. SO once again you gallantly flaunt your ignorance.\n \n \n\n In what way? Please tell me. The fetus is a human being. Fact. The fetus has it's own circulatory system, it's own blood type, it's own GNA, it's own organs, et cetera. The fetus is a being. The fetus can only be a human being because of biogenesis. What more is there to be explained? That statement was merely an insult- please, if you're going to insult me, tell me why!\n \n\n Criminy!!!! yes, the fetus is a human being, yes it has is own DNA (unless you actually meant GNA whatever that might be) It has it's won blood type, etc. But once again you fail to realize that every single aggregate to that being was passed down genetically from either the father or the mother.\n Why do I insult you? LOL\n You insult my intelligence every time you touch your keyboard.\n \n \n\n Of course not. But if the government says it's OK to kill Jews, and I asked a Jew into my home to fix my stereo, do I have a right to kill the Jew because he's in my home? It's my home, I can do whatever I want. Right?\n\n \n No, you can't do whatever you want because it's in your home. There are numerous laws limiting what exactly you can do in your home. \n This is obviously a metaphor for my body, right? Well, there are laws limiting what I can do with it too. Instead of listing numerous hypothetical situations like you would do, I will merely let you know that the most important law is that I can have an abortion, as long as I meet certain criteria.\n One disturbing law is that a woman cannot voluntarily have herself sterilized (in my state) until the age of 30. But is she is raped and happens to get pregnant, then if you had your way, she would have to carry the child. You dismiss whatever reasons she might have for not wanting to be a mother, such as the possibility that she has some genetic default that almost guarantees her child will be born retarded. A child such as this is very unlikely to ever be adopted, so unless she wants it to live as a ward of the state, she must raise it. That is a lifetime sentence for no crime. This child is sentenced by you as well, as your opinion that a life of pain and suffering is better than none at all. I will point out that yu have never existed in such a condition, so you would not know.",

Does that make it OK to give slaves a choice between cutting of their toe and penis (from the movie, Roots)? Slavery was one of the most embarrassing things in American History, and yet you're saying because the government said it was OK, it always was OK. The woman 90% of the time would not be raising the child, and 99% of the time would not have to. We have 3 million couples waiting to adopt infants every year. In fact, there is such a great number of couples willing to adopt that people are put on waiting lists, such as several people I know.

SO once again you gallantly flaunt your ignorance.\n\n \n Firstly, the thing about abortions is that they are expensive, and so the doctor (and abortionist) makes a lot of money by giving an abortion. Do you think an abortionist would deliver an infant? Of course not- he makes better money killing it before it's born. With the medical technology that we have today, it is extremely rare for a woman to die from having an infant, and even more rare for a woman to not know about it early on. Allow me to elaborate in what I think about when the mother's life is threatened- ectopic pregnancies. In this case, the fetus gets stuck in a tube and grows there, and if it stays there too long will explode, and both mother and fetus would die. In this case, you're killing the fetus unintentionally, but it's necessary to save the mother. \n \n \n For years now it has been illegal for a woman to volunteer for such a procedure without medical reason.\n\n \n Please elaborate. I have no idea what you're talking about. What procedure? Abortion? \n \n \n Criminy!!!! yes, the fetus is a human being, yes it has is own DNA (unless you actually meant GNA whatever that might be) It has it's won blood type, etc. But once again you fail to realize that every single aggregate to that being was passed down genetically from either the father or the mother.\n Why do I insult you?

You just said that they have a better grasp of biology than I do... and yet you agree with me, and I won the argument against them. WTF? What the hell are you talking about?\n \n \n1) No, you can't do whatever you want because it's in your home. There are numerous laws limiting what exactly you can do in your home. \n \n 2) This is obviously a metaphor for my body, right? Well, there are laws limiting what I can do with it too.

I will point out that yu have never existed in such a condition, so you would not know.\n\n \n 1) But it's legal to kill Jews, so I can kill one if it enters my house. Further, I can go into Jewish neighborhoods, kill their families, and take their money. I can do a lot of things with Jews! Interestingly enough, these sort of things happened in the past. Does that make them right? In Nazi Germany it was legal to exterminate 6 million Jews and 11 million Slavs... does that make it right? No!\n \n 2) No, it's not a metaphor for our bodies. The Jew goes onto my property, it's legal to kill Jews, therefore I can kill the Jew. It's very, very simple. And it's not hypothetical either- much of this kind of stuff has and is happening throughout this world. In Assyria, which is in Northern Iraq, the Kurds were allowed to savagely murder Assyrians by the old Iraqi government. Why? Because the Assyrians were a minority and Muslims disagreed with them. Therefore, it is legal to kill them. What???\n \n 3) Ah, but it's legal, so it must be for the better. Right? Is the woman \"forced\" to give birth? Unfortunately, no. She's allowed to kill her daughter or son. I dismiss all points; because if that child was born, would you kill it? Just because the infant isn't perfect doesn't mean you can kill it. Once again, in Nazi Germany, they sterilized woman and killed imperfect human beings- born and unborn. Does that make it right? No.",

Why don't you just be honest and say what you think- you think women who have abortions are sluts who should have to suffer for their sins.\n\n \n Listen, I am never going to call women sluts for having abortions. I know too many people who have had abortions and have regretted it, and in doing so brought me to the pro-life movement. I know how society works in convincing women that they can kill their children- how? They don't call it a child. They make it so it's not your child, but a blob of tissue. The fact is it's not just a blob of tissue, it's growing up, it's a human being.

   "The difficulty responding to your posts is not the complexity or argumentation, but merely making sense of what you're saying. \n\n your problem might lie in your ability to make sense out of anything\n \n \n \n\n Once again, what about slavery? Because slavery was legal, did that make it OK to whip slaves? Does that make it OK to give slaves a choice between cutting of their toe and penis (from the movie, Roots)? Slavery was one of the most embarrassing things in American History, and yet you're saying because the government said it was OK, it always was OK. The woman 90% of the time would not be raising the child, and 99% of the time would not have to. We have 3 million couples waiting to adopt infants every year. In fact, there is such a great number of couples willing to adopt that people are put on waiting lists, such as several people I know. It took one family I know seven months to find an infant, and an additional 4 months for it to be born. \n \n\n I never said that slavery was right, or that those who abused their slaves were in the right, please stop implying that I have. I have used the fact that abortion is legal only to prove that as of right now, a woman has the right to this procedure. As for proving moral correctness, I have never even tried, as morality is always open to debate, is often based on religious beliefs, and I know that our versions of morality are very different.\n \n \n\n Firstly, the thing about abortions is that they are expensive, and so the doctor (and abortionist) makes a lot of money by giving an abortion. Do you think an abortionist would deliver an infant? Of course not- he makes better money killing it before it's born. With the medical technology that we have today, it is extremely rare for a woman to die from having an infant, and even more rare for a woman to not know about it early on. Allow me to elaborate in what I think about when the mother's life is threatened- ectopic pregnancies. In this case, the fetus gets stuck in a tube and grows there, and if it stays there too long will explode, and both mother and fetus would die. In this case, you're killing the fetus unintentionally, but it's necessary to save the mother. \n \n\n first of all, an abortion costs, on average, about $500 dollars, do you mean to imply that this would somehow be cheaper than the cost involved in carrying a child to term, and then raising it? LOL\n Next, as i have previously pointed out, abortion is not a specialty, it is just another duty assigned to an ob/gyn, and I hope I don't have to point out that these doctors do deliver babies. (and they make a lot more money from that, I assure you)\n And, as I have previously posted, the number of women who die in childbirth grossly outweighs the number who die during abortion. The last time more women died from abortion than childbirth was 1970, before Roe V Wade. You have deinied the source, but I am willing to provide similar stats from other sources if neccessary, and they too, will prove you wrong.\n And, in the case of ectopic pregnancies- I assure you that the doctor knows very well that he is killing the fetus, and so- it is intentional, though no less neccessary to save the mother.\n \n \n\n Please elaborate. I have no idea what you're talking about. What procedure? Abortion? \n \n I was referring to late-term or 3rd trimester abortion. It has been years since a woman could have this done electively.\n \n \n\n What intelligence?! It takes me forever to respond to YOUR posts because it takes me forever to make sense out of them! You just said that they have a better grasp of biology than I do... and yet you agree with me, and I won the argument against them. WTF? What the hell are you talking about?\n \n\n I never said you won anything. A third grader has a better grasp of biology, of grammar, of vocabulary, and indeed compassion than you.\n \n \n I am going to dismiss your entire killing jews argument because it is irrelevant and totally perplexing.",

Further, early on (before implantation) the fetus isn't relying on the mother at all. Is it then not okay to kill it? \n \n \n It is both a blob of tissue and a human being.

The issue is whether it should be their choice, not how they come to make the choice.\n\n \n It's impossible to find statistics for this, because most women can't answer the question. Even so, a study done by Eliott Institute said the of women reporting problems after an abortion, 39% said that they felt pressured by friends and family to have the abortion, and 54% said they felt forced. In my experience, when doing sidewalk counseling towards women, trying to stop them from having an abortion, the woman is always interested, and doesn't want to do it, but the boyfriend (or in my case, the father) yells at me and tells the daughter not to listen to me.

Your logic is extremely corrupt. You're saying because death is everywhere, we can kill the fetus. Does that mean I can kill you too? Obviously not. I do care deeply for people who are dying on this earth, but it's quite different; they aren't dying from myths given by the organizations that they aren't human, they are dying from corrupt governments.

In hospitals, the doctor always gets paid the same.

In 1972, the year before Roe V. Wade, only 65 women died in one year, and 24 of the abortions were legal. Further, in 1975 only seven women died from illegal abortions, and 26 from legal abortions, all according to Induced Abortion: A World View  done by The Population Council in New York. 450 women die annually from childbirth in the US today, and about 40 die from legal abortions. But abortion is a much simpler procedure, and is done by much less of the population. \n \n \n I was referring to late-term or 3rd trimester abortion. It has been years since a woman could have this done electively.\n\n \n You think that those kinds of abortions are OK? That's even more disgusting! You understand that this is what you're killing, correct? You also understand this fetus fully feels everything and is aware of everything going on. It's just as bad as killing an infant- except that you don't have a good enough reason to kill the infant too. Why not just kill infants now? I don't want it!

Flat lines still happen- whether they are natural or not are not an issue. Does that mean a person on a flat line is really not a human? I don't see how you explaining this medical procedure is refuting my argument at all- you're only helping it. And yes, there have been cases where the doctor needs to do surgery on the brain, he puts a flat line. The infant at this point is on life support while the doctor performs surgery on the infant's brain. If the infant was born naturally with a flat line, it would be brain dead. However, this flat-line is put purposely on the fetus, as you've said, it isn't a natural procedure. \n \n \n rrrright. darn women! attaching those unneccessary cords for their own whims.\n\n \n You were the one who had sex! If you were raped, honestly, that's really sad, but that still doesn't justify the killing of your child.\n \n \n again flaunting your ignorance. Any neural activity results in brainwaves. Even those considered \"brain dead\" have brain waves, just not the right kind, or rather, not the right levels of them.\n\n \n Depends on the state.

But it's irrelevant, the brain waves that are used in people who are unconscious and the early fetus are not controlled by the mind (conscious is a synonym for mind).

   "excuse me for my ignorance, but i thought since you know so much about this issue, id ask you a few questions that im unsure about. doesn't everybody have a right to go out and speak their beliefs? i mean since the \"Real\" counselors basically just tell the woman who are pregnant their (the counselors) beliefs, which is that the thing that is growing in their body should be gotten rid of. and couldn't you also say that the abortion counselors are also taking advantage of women who are under a lot of stress and pressure and everything?\n\n \n \n No, a 'real' counselor (by this you mean the ones who are employed by such places as clinics, planned parenthood, ) would never do such a thing as you suggest. there is not a single counselor I have ever met who thinks of abortion as anything but an unfortunate and tragic event. When a woman goes into a clinic (or doctor's office) and finds that she is pregnant, the doctor or counselor merely lays all of her options on the table. It is always her choice- they never try to sway her in any direction, knowing how extrmely personal this decision may be.\n Where are you getting this stuff? Are you just making assumptions based on your personal convictions, or have you actually been a pregnant woman in this predicament? I'm leaning toward the former.\n You should realize that if a woman felt she was pressured into having an abortion by an employee of the clinic, she would have legal recourse. I don't think one of these clinics would want to set themselves up for a lawsuit.\n as for having a right to speak your beliefs... this is true, but as you should know, the government has limited where and when you might be able to do that. For example, you are not allowed to advertise on any issue at a polling place during elections because you might influence the voters. Also, you are not allowed to go into a church and start screaming out that the worshipers are wrong, you can't walk into any establishment with a \"no solicitation\" sign posted and start telling people that they need to buy a kirby vacuum.\n And you can't come within 50 feet of any abortion clinic as a protestor. In fact, in many cases, unless you have an appointment, you can't enter the building at all for the exact same reason. I don't think that i have to point out that everyone has a right to safety, and to do what they want within the law. I also don't think I should have to point out examples of violence done to these women and the staff of the clinic. We need to try to prevent such violence in the future.\n \n Your rights to free speech are not intended to do harm to another person. There are laws protecting me from your speech and vice versa.",

   "Again, if society legalized the killing of Jews, would that mean it's okay?\n no, it would mean it was legal, and therefore I would have to protest in a lawful manner.\n \n \n \n\n No, I'm not. I'm saying that Doctors make a ton of money giving abortions. They don't make a lot of money delivering babies. \n \n\n No, I don't think they do make a lot money doing abortions. If the procedure costs $500, I doubt that does much more than pay for the materials. Shoot, when I went in to get a throat culture and flu shot, it cost me nearly that much! Do you think those doctors are \"making a ton of money\"?\n \n \n\n Abortion isn't a specialty because it's usually very easy, but most doctors own clinics where they do abortions, and thus make a lot more money that from hospitals, because they get paid by the abortion. In hospitals, the doctor always gets paid the same. Since almost all delivery rooms are in hospitals (I believe it's the law), doctors in hospitals really don't make as much money, depending on the amounts of profits. Doctors usually have a fixed payment, while abortionists don't.\n \n\n It is not the law that all delivery rooms be in hospitals. Have you never heard of midwifery? And for the record, abortionists do have a fixed payment, and it is very low. It's not like one day the procedure is $500 and the next it will be $2,000! But you don't know anything about any of this, do you? Do you want me to find statistics on that too, or will you just refute them when I do?\n \n \n\n Before 1970, there were about 200-250 women who died annually from abortions. In 1972, the year before Roe V. Wade, only 65 women died in one year, and 24 of the abortions were legal. Further, in 1975 only seven women died from illegal abortions, and 26 from legal abortions, all according to Induced Abortion: A World View  done by The Population Council in New York. 450 women die annually from childbirth in the US today, and about 40 die from legal abortions. But abortion is a much simpler procedure, and is done by much less of the population. \n \n\n \n Lookie^^^^ you just contradicted yourself. Don't you remember telling me how much more dangerous abortion is than chilbirth? Or do you just contradict everything, and expect people to have the same memory flaws as you? BTW, these numbers are much larger than any I have seen anywhere, but ok. I'm still right.\n \n \n\n You think that those kinds of abortions are OK? That's even more disgusting! You understand that this is what you're killing, correct? You also understand this fetus fully feels everything and is aware of everything going on. It's just as bad as killing an infant- except that you don't have a good enough reason to kill the infant too. Why not just kill infants now? I don't want it! It's better if it just dies then.\n\n \n no, i refuse to follow your link, even the address shows it is obviously biased and propagnadizing. I'll look to a medical reference book for my information, not \"priests for life\"\n And i do beleive that if the woman's life is in danger, she has every right to choose abortion. I'm not saying she should, I'm just saying she has a right to the option.\n I'm disgusting? coming from you that is a compliment\n thank you\n \n [quote]\n Hello? XXXXX? Am I speaking to a four-year old? You're still not making any sense! Flat lines still happen- whether they are natural or not are not an issue. Does that mean a person on a flat line is really not a human? I don't see how you explaining this medical procedure is refuting my argument at all- you're only helping it. And yes, there have been cases where the doctor needs to do surgery on the brain, he puts a flat line. The infant at this point is on life support while the doctor performs surgery on the infant's brain. If the infant was born naturally with a flat line, it would be brain dead. However, this flat-line is put purposely on the fetus, as you've said, it isn't a natural procedure. \n [quote]\n You call me a XXXXX.... you don't even know what a flat line refers to. It refers to the line seen on a heart monitor. When it is flat, the patient is in cardiac arrest. As far as I know, this is never neccessary for neuro surgery. If the child was born naturally with a flat line, they would try CPR. you have to be in cardiac arrest for a certain period of time (i think its 30 minutes or so) before you are considered brain dead. I said that nature does not provide a flat line, again that's cardiac arrest- in order to perform surgery as you implied. again you are intentionally misunderstanding me.\n \n \n\n You were the one who had sex! If you were raped, honestly, that's really sad, but that still doesn't justify the killing of your child.\n \n\n I'm not going to dignify your chauvenism and ignorance with an answer.\n \n \n\n Depends on the state. Californian law says that when the brain waves stop, that's when death is. But it's irrelevant, the brain waves that are used in people who are unconscious and the early fetus are not controlled by the mind (conscious is a synonym for mind). Should we, then, be able to kill them? \n \n\n \n the brain waves are not controlled by the mind? What are they controlled by then? LOL\n \n \n\n Not unless I'm forcing her to speak to me, as in making physical contact, and if I'm on Planned Parenthood's property. Actually we almost always have a security guard with us at all times. You're telling me I'm taking advantage of vulnerable women? Her boyfriend is! Planned Parenthood is! The confident women don't ignore me; the closed minded ones do.\n \n\n You should never be on planned parenthood's property- you are not a patient. You are in violation of the law, and you are not \"counseling\" anyone.",

Your argument has no grounds. \n \n \n No, I don't think they do make a lot money doing abortions. If the procedure costs $500, I doubt that does much more than pay for the materials. Shoot, when I went in to get a throat culture and flu shot, it cost me nearly that much! Do you think those doctors are \"making a ton of money\"?\n\n \n It is a lot of money. In fact, according to a retired abortionist, who used to hire new doctors from medical schools to do abortions, said that they would come once a week and would get paid $75,000- that's a part time job, once a week. According to the interview:\n \n  Brad: When you were involved in this industry, what was your annual income? \n Eric: When I walked away from the clinics, I walked away from everything. I left my ownership and my money there. I wanted nothing else to do with it. The average doctor who does abortions one day a week at a clinic averages 25-40 abortions. He will walk away in his pocket with an average of $l00,000-$125,000 a year. An average clinic that performs roughly around 8,000 abortions will gross approximately $1 million a year.\n \n \n Lookie^^^^ you just contradicted yourself.

BTW, these numbers are much larger than any I have seen anywhere, but ok. I'm still right.\n\n \n I never said it was more dangerous than childbirth. You're arguing against something never said.

It's a picture of a six-month-old fetus- not an article. The picture can be found anywhere, that's just the site I knew it was at. If her life is threatened, the point shouldn't be to kill one, but to save both, as I've said several times. It should be INDIRECT abortion. If a mother and daughter were about to fall off a cliff, and one had to fall off first for the other to survive, what would your solution be? A) put a pillow at the bottom of the cliff, B) kill one? \n \n \n I'm not going to dignify your chauvenism and ignorance with an answer.\n\n \n I only called you a XXXXX because you called me an imbecile. \n \n \n the brain waves are not controlled by the mind? What are they controlled by then? LOL\n\n \n Allow me to rephrase- I said it incorrectly. The mind is separate from brainwaves. Brainwaves aren't part of the mind- but simply activity within the brain. An 8-week-old fetus has brain waves- does that mean it has a mind? No. It's not aware; it doesn't think; it's not conscious. \n \n \n You should never be on planned parenthood's property- you are not a patient. You are in violation of the law, and you are not \"counseling\" anyone.\n\n \n We DIDN'T go on Planned Parents property, as I've already made quite clear. \n \n \n When will you people learn?

The same arguments surface over and over and over and over... Stop bitching about it and shut up.\n\n \n I never base my arguments on religion unless I'm debating religion. I debate abortion fully based on our medical and scientific knowledge, and logic. Sure, there's some morality involved, and that morality is that it's wrong to kill another innocent human being. \n \n \n Should we treat a toddler like an adult because that is what they are going to be? No, what matters is what they are now. During an early herbal abortion you're talking about a blastocyst. That's what it is. Later it is a fetus. Not a born infant. They are different in many ways.\n\n \n No, you don't treat a toddler like an adult- but what do you treat it as? You treat the child well. You protect it. Your natural obligation is to take care of the child- you don't see animals having abortions- they care for their children. \n \n \n Infants. Not blastocysts or fetuses.\n\n \n So? What makes them different? The infant doesn't look like you and me- adult humans. It looks very different. In the same way, the fetus doesn't look like how we perceive humans to look like. \n \n \n At 9 months, yes. Which is not when elective abortions are given.\n\n \n Not anymore, it used to be that way about three months ago.\n \n \n Hold the phone. You actually go up to women entering clinics and harrass them? And you call me disgusting...\n\n \n No, we don't harass them; we beg them to reconsider.

But unless you're offering to painlessly transplant the fetus onto your uterus, you aren't offering these women any more choices than they already had when they made their decision. Leave them the hell alone.\n\n \n Enough of your insults; they're very offensive. This is a mature debate, we're not hating eachother. I'm trying to act as mature as I can but you continue to debate like a 14-year-old boy during puberty. Moving along, most women don't realize they're killing anything- they don't think about it because nobody gives them a chance to. I'm sure you don't tell women who are considering abortions that the fetus is a human being. Why? Because women will refuse to have abortions if they knew that! \n \n \n I'm saying that on the scale of world tragedies, abortion of blastocysts/fetuses just seems like an absurd thing to focus on. What about the millions of starving, and/or infured, and/or orphaned Iraqi children that result from the US's foreign policies? What about the Zapatistas getting massacred in Chiapas?

LOL. You're funny.\n \n \n Actually, doctors often encourage people to have caesarians, because they get more money from that than delivery, which isn't a surgery and takes much longer. So don't worry about them, they do well anyway. What this has to do with abortion I don't know.\n\n That's one example of why less abortions happen in hospitals- they usually happen in abortion clinics.",

   "ALL doesn't state that breast cancer is caused by abortion, they say it can be caused by abortion, which may be true. \n\n \n First of all, breast cancer has no one cause, so obviously abortion can't cause all breast cancer. About a billion things have been suspected as causes for cancer, there is no evidence that abortion is a factor in cancer prevalence any more than broccoli or tennis shoes.\n \n Second, \n \noverwhelming evidence (shows) that induced abortion does not place women at greater risk of breast cancer. Neither the National Cancer Institute nor the American Cancer Society recognizes the reliability of such an association (ACS, 1999; NCI, 2002).\n\n \nWhile researchers do not know what causes breast cancer, reproductive factors have been associated with risk for the disease since the 17th century, when breast cancer was noted to be more prevalent among nuns. It is known that having a full-term pregnancy early in a woman's childbearing years is protective against breast cancer, and some studies have also indicated that breastfeeding, especially in women who are young when they give birth, may reduce a woman's risk of developing the disease. A woman's age at menarche and menopause also influence her risk for breast cancer, with earlier onset of regular menstrual cycles and later age at menopause associated with higher risk (Kelsey & Gammon, 1991). However, the best available evidence - from large population-based cohort studies - shows no net effect that induced abortion places women at increased risk for developing breast cancer (Bartholomew & Grimes, 1998). \n\n \n \nAdherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues (Brumsted & Riddick, 1990; Westhoff, 1997). Attempts to prove this theory, however, have failed. (...)\n At least 80 research studies worldwide have collected data about breast cancer and reproductive factors such as childbirth, menstrual cycles, birth control pills, and abortion. Approximately 30 studies have examined the risk of developing breast cancer for women who have had abortions. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the World Health Organization, and major universities say that the most reliable studies show no increased risk, and they consider the entire body of research inconclusive (ACS, 1999; NCI, 2002; Rosenfield, 1994?; RCOG, 2001; WHO, 2000). \n\n more info from PP's website here \n \n All deliberately misinforms people, spreading fear in order to get people to comply with their political agenda. That is by definition terrorism.\n \n \nNow Planned Parenthood spreads lies that the fetus isnt' a human being, will never feel it, and tell women that it's not religiously a sin to have an abortion.\n\n \n I haven't seen them say the fetus isn't human, neither have I seen them say anything about whether abortion is \"religiously a sin\" (sic). I already posted why the fetus won't feel it, the medical evidence is as conclusive as can be without getting sworn affadivits from fetuses. Do you even know anything about PP firsthand, or have you gotten all your info filtered through ALL? \n \n \nObviously, Margaret Sanger was a racist.\n\n \n The picture you paint of Sanger is deliberately misleading- some of the quotes aren't even from her. Planned Parenthood's website is open about some questionable beliefs she had, and they also do not share these beliefs or policies which promote them.\n \n \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America finds these views objectionable and outmoded. Nevertheless, anti-family planning activists continue to attack Sanger, who has been dead for over 30 years, because she is an easier target than the unassailable reputation of PPFA and the contemporary family planning movement.\n\n \n Unlike the Catholic Church, which is also racist, and has not changed in their racist beliefs and practices.\n \n As for your quotes and such-\n \nSanger and Eugenics\n Eugenics is the science of improving hereditary qualities by socially controlling human reproduction. Unable to foment popular opposition to Margaret Sanger's accomplishments and the organization she founded, Sanger's critics attempt to discredit them by intentionally confusing her views on \"fitness\" with eugenics, racism, and anti-Semitism. Margaret Sanger was not a racist, an anti-Semite, or a eugenicist. Eugenicists, like the Nazis, were opposed to the use of abortion and contraception by healthy and \"fit\" women (Grossmann, 1995). In fact, Sanger's books were among the very first burned by the Nazis in their campaign against family planning (\"Sanger on Exhibit,\" 1999/2000). Sanger actually helped several Jewish women and men and others escape the Nazi regime in Germany  (\"Margaret Sanger and the 'Refugee Department',\" 1993). Sanger's disagreement with the eugenicists of her day is clear from her remarks in The Birth Control Review of February 1919:\n \n Eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her first duty to the state. We maintain that a woman possessing an adequate knowledge of her reproductive functions is the best judge of the time and conditions under which her child should be brought into the world. We further maintain that it is her right, regardless of all other considerations, to determine whether she shall bear children or not, and how many children she shall bear if she chooses to become a mother  (1919a).\n\n \n This is obviously, if you are paying attention, a quote from the same article you pulled a quote from, where she compares the movement for birth control to eugenicists. It is obvious if you read more that she disagreed with eugenicists. The fact that she helped Jewish people escape Hitler while the US gov't was turning them back by the thousands also adds to the case that she isn't as racist as anti-abortionists claim. \n \n \n\"More children from the fit, less from the unfit - that is the chief issue in birth control.\"\n A quotation falsely attributed  to Margaret Sanger, this statement was made by the editors of American Medicine in a review of an article by Sanger. The editorial from which this appeared, as well as Sanger's article, \"Why Not Birth Control Clinics in America?\" (1919b), were reprinted side-by-side in the May 1919 Birth Control Review.\n\n \n \n\"The mass of ignorant Negroes still breed carelessly and disastrously, so that the increase among Negroes, even more than the increase among whites, is from that portion of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear their children properly.\"\n Another quotation falsely attributed  to Margaret Sanger, this was actually written for the June 1932 issue of The Birth Control Review by W.E.B. DuBois, founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Taken out of the context of his discussion about the effects of birth control on the balance between quality-of-life considerations and race-survival issues for African-Americans, Dubois' language seems insensitive by today's standards.\n\n \n \n\"Blacks, soldiers, and Jews are a menace to the race.\"\n This fabricated quotation, falsely attributed  to Sanger, was concocted in the late 1980s. The alleged source is the April 1933 Birth Control Review (Sanger ceased editing the Review in 1929). That issue contains no article or letter by Sanger.\n\n \n \n\"We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.\"\n Sanger was aware of African-American concerns, passionately argued by Marcus Garvey in the 1920s, that birth control was a threat to the survival of the black race. This statement, which acknowledges those fears, is taken from a letter to Clarence J. Gamble, M.D., a champion of the birth control movement. In that letter, Sanger describes her strategy to allay such apprehensions. A larger portion of the letter makes Sanger's meaning clear:\n \n It seems to me from my experience . . . in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, that while the colored Negroes have great respect for white doctors, they can get closer to their own members and more or less lay their cards on the table. . . . They do not do this with the white people, and if we can train the Negro doctor at the clinic, he can go among them with enthusiasm and with knowledge, which, I believe, will have far-reaching results. . . . His work, in my opinion, should be entirely with the Negro profession and the nurses, hospital, social workers, as well as the County's white doctors. His success will depend upon his personality and his training by us. The minister's work is also important, and also he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation, as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs (1939).\n\n \n \npublished a book called \"The Negro Project\", which was basically a racist book about why the African race should die. \n\n I haven't heard of this book, but she was involved in the \"Negro Project\"-\n \nBeginning in 1939, (W.E.B.) DuBois also served on the advisory council for Sanger's \"Negro Project,\" which was a \"unique experiment in race-building and humanitarian service to a race subjected to discrimination, hardship, and segregation\" (Chesler, 1992). The Negro Project served African-Americans in the rural South. Other leaders of the African-American community who were involved in the project included Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. The Negro Project was also endorsed by prominent white Americans who were involved in social justice efforts at this time, including Eleanor Roosevelt, the most visible and compassionate supporter of racial equality in her era; and the medical philanthropists, Albert and Mary Lasker, whose financial support made the project possible\n \n A passionate opponent of racism, Sanger predicted in 1942 that the \"Negro question\" would be foremost on the country's domestic agenda after World War II. Her accomplishments on behalf of the African-American community were unchallengeable during her lifetime and remain so today. In 1966, the year Sanger died, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said:\n \n There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. . . . Our sure beginning in the struggle for equality by nonviolent direct action may not have been so resolute without the tradition established by Margaret Sanger and people like her.\n\n \n \n\"To create a race of thoroughbreds. . .\"\n This remark, again attributed originally to Sanger, was made by Dr. Edward A. Kempf and has been cited out of context and with distorted meaning. Dr. Kempf, a progressive physician, was actually arguing for state endowment of maternal and infant care clinics. In her book The Pivot of Civilization, Sanger quoted Dr. Kempf's argument about how environment may improve human excellence:\n \n Society must make life worth the living and the refining for the individual by conditioning him to love and to seek the love-object in a manner that reflects a constructive effect upon his fellow-men and by giving him suitable opportunities. The virility of the automatic apparatus is destroyed by excessive gormandizing or hunger, by excessive wealth or poverty, by excessive work or idleness, by sexual abuse or intolerant prudishness. The noblest and most difficult art of all is the raising of human thoroughbreds (1969).\n \n It was in this spirit that Sanger used the phrase, \"Birth Control: To Create a Race of Thoroughbreds,\" as a banner on the November 1921 issue of the Birth Control Review. (Differing slogans on the theme of voluntary family planning sometimes appeared under the title of The Review, e.g., \"Dedicated to the Cause of Voluntary Motherhood,\" January 1928.)\n\n \n By the way, Sanger never said that anyone should have abortions. She only spoke of contraceptives.",

However, I think if you're going to critique someone's philosophy you should use quotes by them, not by other people. Read her writings yourself, and find me a place where she says that she wanted Black people's extermination. Also, you would have to explain why W.E.B. DuBois and Martin Luther King were friends with her, if she really believed in the extermination of Black people.\n Try starting with things she actually wrote or said herself- like browsing her writings here, here here and here \n \n Then there are your allegations that she was anti-semitic-\n \nSanger was horrified by the news from Europe. In 1933, she wrote to Edith How-Martyn, \"All the news from Germany is sad & horrible & to be more dangerous than any other war going on anywhere because it has so many good people who applaud its atrocities & claim it's right. The sudden antagonism in Germany against the Jews & the vitriolic hatred of them is spreading underground here & is far more dangerous than the aggressive policy of the Japanese in Manchuria.\" (May 21, 1933, Palmer Collection, MSPP)\n\n \n For someone whom you claim advocated the extermination of all Jewish people, this is an odd sentiment. Even stranger is the fact that she embarked on a campaign to allow entry of Jewish refugees, despite the US gov't unwillingness to increase the \"quota\" given the situation in Europe.\n \n \nDespite the delays, Sanger's record in bringing refugees to America was largely successful. From letters at the Sophia Smith Collection, we have identified at least twenty people for whom Sanger signed affidavits (or had friends and co-workers sign) and of those, only five (unfortunately including Dr. Rubinraut) appear not to have made it to America, and none -- despite their worst fears -- appear to have perished in the war. Most, though not all of the refugees were doctors, including Ludwig and F. Sidonie F\u00fcrst Chiavacci (Italy) who were able to continue practicing medicine in the U.S. after taking licensing exams; Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg, Norbert Neufeld, and Hertha and Walter Riese (Germany); and Tilde Winternitz (Czechoslovakia). Others were acquaintances of Sanger's associates, such as Anna Kreupl, a housekeeper who wanted to emigrate with her employer, actress Lilia Skala, and Ludmilla Protitch, who later worked as an interpreter in the U.S.\nmore info here \n \n So, either Sanger wasn't really an anti-semite (she was at least less anti-semitic than the US gov't at the time), or she enjoyed doing things which went against her own ideas. Then again, you have no evidence that anti-semitism was one of her ideas, so there you are.\n \n \nThe sources are all there and from her speeches- none are made up.\n\n \n Yes, they are. I gave you the sources. Unless you can come up with a statement where Sanger says she believes in the extermination of people of color, you are just running off at the mouth to say so.\n \n I already refuted all your \"quotes\" point by point. You have to learn to start actually reading people's replies, and trying to argue against them with sources or logic, not just half-baked opinions.\n \n \nShe was also involved with illegal abortions. Once again, please give me links. How am I supposed to accept the credibility of your quotes? \n\n \n How am I supposed to accept the credibility of your  quotes? You are the one that is arguing that Sanger wanted people of color's extermination. You show the evidence. \n \n However, you may find that difficult, because I doubt there is any. Sanger was allied with the liberal wing of the eugenics movement. So were many other prominent persons of the day (if they weren't allied with the fascist wing of the same movement). She was born into a poor family and believed that poverty could be overcome partly by access to birth control for the poor (as the rich had access already). She also believed that healthy people should procreate and others shouldn't. This is obviously a problematic and outdated opinion. Still, she disagreed with the separation of access to birth control (and in fact disagreed with the separation of eugenics) along racial lines. All of her writings show that although she advocated \"breeding for the fit\", she did not consider fitness to be race-based.\n \n Furthermore, the past history of an organization is only relevant if that organization refuses to acknowledge their disagreement with these past actions/philosophies, and/or continues to practice this behavior. You have not demonstrated any evidence that Planned Parenthood advocates eugenics. So your point is moot. \n \n I notice you have nothing more to say about the terrorist organization you work with. That's probably wise, but this Sanger thing is such a transparent red herring.\n \n \nPlease, without laughing, tell me that the Catholic Church is racist, and give me evidence. \n\n \n \nRACISM IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH \n Please excuse the blunt tone of this letter: prolonged inaction over exclusion can make one impatient & bitter.\n \n PART I: The Bishops: Expressions of concern but no action\n \n Charter 1990: This was a watershed in the relations between non-white lay Catholics and the white hierarchy of England & Wales. For too long the bishops have stayed aloof and inaccessible, dispensing pious platitudes. \n\n \n Edith Stein, the RCC, and the Nazis- \n \nSince prior to 1874-1876 births had been registered only by the churches, the latter were asked to help in determining who was or was not fully Aryan, for under Nazi law this depended on the racial (i.e., religious) status of the parents and grandparents. The Church co-operated as a matter of course, complaining only that priests already overburdened with work were not receiving compensation for this special service to the state. The very question of whether the Church should lend its help to the Nazi state in sorting out people of Jewish descent was never debated. ... And the co-operation of the Church in this matter continued right through the war years, when the price of being Jewish was no longer dismissal from a government job and loss of livelihood, but deportation and outright physical destruction. \n\n \n There are just too many examples to quote, so I'll stop here.\n \n Oh, wait- then there was that little thing where they committed genocide against the First Nations of the Americas....",

Now I'm attacking you for supporting an organization founded by racist. I already read the Negro project online and some other writings. \n \n \n For someone whom you claim advocated the extermination of all Jewish people, this is an odd sentiment. Even stranger is the fact that she embarked on a campaign to allow entry of Jewish refugees, despite the US gov't unwillingness to increase the \"quota\" given the situation in Europe.\n\n \n I never said she was. I said she was for the slaughter of blacks. Planned Parenthood is for the killing of Jews, along with everyone else....\n \n \n So, either Sanger wasn't really an anti-semite (she was at least less anti-semitic than the US gov't at the time), or she enjoyed doing things which went against her own ideas. Then again, you have no evidence that anti-semitism was one of her ideas, so there you are.\n\n \n My statement was never about Margaret Sanger being anti-Semitic, but Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood, however, is not specifically anti-Semitic, but entirely racist. \n \n \n \n Yes, they are. I gave you the sources. Unless you can come up with a statement where Sanger says she believes in the extermination of people of color, you are just running off at the mouth to say so.\n\n \n I already gave you the sources.

I gave you the sources. Unless you can come up with a statement where Sanger says she believes in the extermination of people of color, you are just running off at the mouth to say so.\n\n \n Most of your replies were not valid. You kept quoting other people like \"\"To create a race of thoroughbreds. . .\" This remark, again attributed originally to Sanger, was made by Dr. Edward A. Kempf and has been cited out of context and with distorted meaning. Dr. Kempf, a progressive physician, was actually arguing for state endowment of maternal and infant care clinics. In her book The Pivot of Civilization, Sanger quoted Dr. Kempf's argument about how environment may improve human excellence:\"... THAT'S what I want sources for, NOT the only ones. YOU get THOSE links. \n \n \n How am I supposed to accept the credibility of your quotes? You are the one that is arguing that Sanger wanted people of color's extermination. You show the evidence.\n\n \n Because I left the source! I told you where they came from. If you wanted to, you can open up the Birth Control periodicals from your local library and find all these statements. \n \n \n However, you may find that difficult, because I doubt there is any.

If not I could be accused to plagiarism, which is very much illegal. Are you saying that Hitler also had outdated opinions, so really he wasn't that bad of a guy? What about Mao and Pol Pot? I can say the same about dozens of people- all have done a little good. The problem is the bad they did was horrible. Notice in all the pictures done of Margaret Sanger, all the people surrounding her are white... hmmm...\n \n \n Furthermore, the past history of an organization is only relevant if that organization refuses to acknowledge their disagreement with these past actions/philosophies, and/or continues to practice this behavior. You have not demonstrated any evidence that Planned Parenthood advocates eugenics. So your point is moot.\n\n \n Once again, Read that article. It is written by blacks who are being killed off before their first breath by people like Planned Parenthood.\n \n \n I notice you have nothing more to say about the terrorist organization you work with. That's probably wise, but this Sanger thing is such a transparent red herring.\n\n \n We're a terrorist organization now? What bull XXXX are you making up now, little bird? I have tons to say about my organization that I proudly work for, but we havn't discussed it. Planned Parenthood is a racist organization. \n \n Moving onto how the Catholic Church is NOT racist, your source is so incredibly biased. Please, give me a REAL source, no BS sources. \n \n On April of 1935, Pope Pius XII said at a speech in front of 200 thousand people in Lourdes, France:\n \"\"are in reality only miserable plagiarists who dress up old errors with new tinsel. It does not make any difference whether they flock to the banners of social revolution, whether they are guided by a false concept of the world and of life, or whether they are possessed by the superstition of a race and blood cult.\"\n \n Further, if Pius was a racist, why did he invite thousands of Jews to spend the night IN the Vatican City when the Nazis planned a round-up of Jews? Why did Pius have all the convents keep Jews inside? \n \n Have you seen the movie The Scarlet and the Black, or at least heard of the story? Gregory Peck is in it. \n \n  \"The Pope sent out the order that religious buildings were to give refuge to Jews, even at the price of great personal sacrifice on the part of their occupants; he released monasteries and convents from the cloister rule forbidding entry into these religious houses to all but a few specified outsiders, so that they could be used as hiding places. Thousands of Jews-the figures run from 4,000 to 7,000-were hidden, fed, clothed, and bedded in the 180 known places of refuge in Vatican City, churches and basilicas, Church administrative buildings, and parish houses. Unknown numbers of Jews were sheltered in Castel Gandolfo, the site of the Pope's summer residence, private homes, hospitals, and nursing institutions; and the Pope took personal responsibility for the care of the children of Jews deported from Italy.\" A Question of Moral Judgement: Pius XII and the Jews,, Joseph Lichten\n \n  \"in Rome we saw a list of 155 convents and monasteries-Italian, French, Spanish, English, American, and also German-mostly extraterritorial property of the Vatican . . . which sheltered throughout the German occupation some 5,000 Jews in Rome. No less than 3,000 Jews found refuge at one time at the Pope's summer residence at Castel Gandolfo; sixty lived for nine months at the Jesuit Gregorian University, and half a dozen slept in the cellar of the Pontifical Bible Institute. pg. 118, Rabbi Pinchas E. Lapide,  Three Popes and the Jews (New York: Hawthorn, 1967)\n \n Obviously, the Catholic Church was not racist.",

Either way, as I said, Planned Parenthood neither advocates or practices her beliefs at this time, and in fact openly condemns them. Can you not find anything wrong with PP presently?\n \n \nPlanned Parenthood is for the killing of Jews, along with everyone else....\n\n \n There is no evidence to support that statement.\n \n \nOnce again, Read that article. It is written by blacks who are being killed off before their first breath by people like Planned Parenthood.\n\n \n The website you quote is not against Sanger's racism in particular, but what the organizers feel is the inherent racism of many state contraceptive/abortion programs. However, for starters, they are a religious anti-abortion organization, and second they don't actually quote Sanger saying or doing anything particularly racist, but instead quote right-wing eugenicists or speak of abortion providers in general.\n \n \n\"The issue is not 'color of skin' or 'dialect of tongue,'\" Grant writes, \"but 'quality of genes [emphasis added].'\" Therefore, \"as long as blacks, Jews and Hispanics demonstrate 'a good quality gene pool'-as long as they 'act white and think white'-then they are esteemed equally with Aryans. As long as they are, as Margaret Sanger said, 'the best of their race,' then they can be [counted] as valuable citizens [emphasis added].\" By the same token, \"individual whites\" who shoe \"dysgenic traits\" must also have their fertility \"curbed right along with the other 'inferiors and undesirables.'\"\n\n \n This is another quote from the same website which makes it clear that Sanger never advocated the extermination of any particular race, as her idea of genetic \"fitness\" was not divided by race.\n \n The only real contention they have with Sanger (or PP in particular) is the argument that she seemed to target people of color in particular for her clinics. It may be true that Sanger and even PP target poor neighborhoods (which will inevitably due to racism often be people of color's neighborhoods), this arguably due to the fact that abortion access for the wealthy (in majority white) has never been a problem. That was the case even when abortion was illegal, in fact was even more so when abortion was illegal as the very fact that it was illegal made it cost-prohibitive.\n \n \nI already gave you the sources.

If you can support this statement with anything PP say or do (besides offer abortions to all), then by all means, please do, because I am tired of trying to explain to you how debating is supposed to work.\n\n \n They call Margaret Sanger a \"hero\" even though she was extremely racist! \n \n  \"Margaret Sanger is responsible, more than anyone else, for keeping alive international racism.\"\n (Drogin, Elasah, Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society)\n Margaret Sanger, 1883-1966, the founder of Planned Parenthood of America and honorary president of International Planned Parenthood, edited the American Birth Control League's publication the Birth Control Review. (Drogin, Elasah. Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society. CUL Publications, New Hope KY, 1989. p. 11.)\n Sanger played the attractive hostess for racist thinkers all over the world. Organizing the First World Population Conference in Geneva in 1926, she invited Clarence C. Little, Edward A. East, Henry Pratt Fairchild, and Raymond Pearl -- all infamous racists. (Birth Control Review, November, 1926.)\n In 1931 Sanger founded the Population Association of America with Fairchild as its head. Fairchild, formerly the secretary-treasurer of the American Eugenics Society and the leading academic racist of the decade, wrote The Melting Pot Mistake which denigrated the Jews, referring to them as the inferior new immigrants who would threaten the native Nordic stock. (Allan Chase, The Legacy of Malthus, p. 656.) \n Edward A. East, a firm believer in Black inferiority, persuaded Mrs. Sanger to gather information about her clients at her Maternity Research Clinic that went beyond medical histories. She agreed to include information about the nationality, heredity, and religion of the patients and to make a \"judgement\" regarding the amount of racial intermixture of the patient, \"whether the person was more or less pure Black, mulatto, quadroon, etc.\" (Linda Gordon, Woman's Body, Woman's Right, p. 287.)\n Lothrop Stoddart was on Sanger's board of directors for years. As previously mentioned, he had a personal interview with Adolf Hitler and was very impressed. His book, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy, was written while he served on Sanger's board. Havelock Ellis, one of Sanger's extra-marital lovers, reviewed this abominable book favorably in The Birth Control Review. (Birth Control Review, October, 1920.\n In the 20s and 30s Sanger fearlessly carried on with these racists and many others, totally uninhibited. But when Adolf Hitler poisoned the air by politically carrying out her eugenics schemes, Mrs. Sanger and her crew made some changes. The term \"birth control\" had always been associated with eugenics, so the American Birth Control League changed its name to Planned Parenthood. The racist language changed with it. Such terms as \"good or bad breeding stock\" were changed to \"class\" or \"income level\". (Linda Gordon, Woman's Body, Woman's Rights, p. 347.)\n Eugenics is identical to racism because both believe that there are innately, irreversibly inferior groups of human beings. Eugenicist-racists believe in the inequality of the races and that by selective breeding the inferior race can be improved -- by \"selective breeding\" is meant that the inferior breeders of the population are somehow consistently eliminated.\n \n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n \n  PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n \n The classic comprehensive 1988 expos\u00e9 of Planned Parenthood, Grand Illusions, The Legacy of Planned Parenthood, by George Grant, still provides valuable insights into the nature of that organization. \n \n Some highlights are:\n \n Planned Parenthood is the world's oldest, largest, and best organized provider of abortion and birth control services. It now plays a strategic role in the health and social services community. It carries considerable political clout through lobbying, legislation, advocacy, campaigning, and litigation. It has brokered its abortion trade into a public image that is very nearly unassailable. It has a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails, down-to-earth, where-the-rubber-meets-the-road kind of reputation that has made it a glittering star in the grand constellation of the American social service field. \n \n All that glitters, however, is not gold:\n \n Planned Parenthood claims to advocate the freedom of women to choose if and when they will have children, without government interference. The truth is that from its very inception, Planned Parenthood has sought mandatory population control measures measures carefully designed to deny the freedom to choose. Over the years it has proposed that our government implement such things as 'compulsory abortion for out-of-wedlock pregnancies,' 'compulsory sterilization for those who already have two children,' and 'tax penalties' for existing large families. \n \n China has taken Planned Parenthood's suggestions to heart, launching a brutal, no-holds-barred, one-child-per-couple policy. Planned Parenthood continues to maintain that the communist government's genocidal approach to population control is a 'model of efficiency.' In a recent survey of women who had received abortions at Planned Parenthood, ninety-five percent of the women said that their Planned Parenthood counselors gave 'little or no information about the potential health risks which might follow the surgery.' And eighty-nine percent said that their counselor was 'strongly biased in favor of the abortion.' \n \n Planned Parenthood's pose as a champion of the underprivileged is a cruel hoax foisted on the uninformed and unsuspecting. The truth is, Planned Parenthood appears to want to eliminate the poor, not serve them. Animosity toward the weak and lowly has been its hallmark from its earliest days. In fact, its entire program of family limitation was designed to foster an elitist program against the under classes. In 1927, Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, argued that organized attempts to help the poor were the surest sign that our civilization has bred, is breeding, and is perpetuating constantly increasing numbers of defectives, delinquents, and dependents. Planned Parenthood has always targeted minorities, the unwanted, and the disadvantaged for family limitation, contraception, abortion, and sterilization. More children from the fit, less from the unfit, Sanger pined, that is the chief issue of birth control. To this day, the trust of Planned Parenthood's literature constantly devises new plans to penetrate Black, Hispanic, and ethnic communities with its crippling message of Eugenic racism. \n \n Planned Parenthood claims that it is in the forefront of the battle against sexually transmitted diseases. The truth is, Planned Parenthood's efforts have been tragically counterproductive. It has become a veritable Typhoid Mary, actually encouraging the spread of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis, granuloma, chancroid, and even AIDS at an alarming rate. Besides the fact that it constantly exhorts youngsters to flaunt a ribald and irresponsible promiscuity, it continually promotes an alarmingly 'unsafe' exercise of that promiscuity. \n \n Instead of affording its fornicating disciples with the slim security of barrier devices, it primarily peddles the entirely unguarded prescription birth control methods. Eighty percent of Planned Parenthood's clients receive non-barrier contraceptives, and eighty-eight percent of those who previously practiced 'safe sex' are dissuaded from continuing. \n \n Planned Parenthood claims that sex education is a necessary and effective means of preventing teen pregnancies. The truth is, Planned Parenthood's sex education programs have backfired, actually increasing teen pregnancies. The conclusion, one that Planned Parenthood researchers have been unable to escape, is that sex education courses only exacerbate the teen pregnancy problem. [pages 24-30, footnotes omitted.]\n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n  Sanger's assistants gave Braun more pro-birth control literature and a copy of her autobiography, which he gave to his wife to read. Sanger's message of preventing maternal and infant mortality stirred Braun's wife. Now convinced of this need, Braun permitted a group of women to use his chapel for a birth-control talk. \"[I was] moved by the number of prominent [black] Christians backing the proposition,\" Braun wrote in a letter to Sanger. \"At first glance I had a horrible shock to the proposition because it seemed to me to be allied to abortion, but after thought and prayer, I have concluded that especially among many women, it is necessary both to save the lives of mothers and children [emphasis added].\"\n By 1949, Sanger had hoodwinked black America's best and brightest into believing birth control's \"life-saving benefits.\" In a monumental feat, she bewitched virtually an entire network of black social, professional and academic organizations into endorsing Planned Parenthood's eugenic program.\n Sanger's successful duplicity does not in any way suggest blacks were gullible. They certainly wanted to decrease maternal and infant mortality and improve the community's overall health. They wholly accepted her message because it seemed to promise prosperity and social acceptance. Sanger used their vulnerabilities and their ignorance (of her deliberately hidden agenda) to her advantage. Aside from birth control, she offered no other medical or social solutions to their adversity. Surely, blacks would not have been such willing accomplices had they perceived her true intentions. Considering the role eugenics played in the early birth control movement-and Sanger's embracing of that ideology-the notion of birth control as seemingly the only solution to the problems that plagued blacks should have been much more closely scrutinized.\n \"Scientific Racism\"\n Planned Parenthood has gone to great lengths to repudiate the organization's eugenic origins. It adamantly denies Sanger was a eugenicist or racist, despite evidence to the contrary. Because Sanger stopped editing The Birth Control Review in 1929, the organization tries to disassociate her from the eugenic and racist-oriented articles published after that date. However, a summary of an address Sanger gave in 1932, which appeared in the Review that year, revealed her continuing bent toward eugenics.\n In \"A Plan for Peace,\" Sanger suggested Congress set up a special department to study population problems and appoint a \"Parliament of Population.\" One of the main objectives of the \"Population Congress\" would be \"to raise the level and increase the general intelligence of population.\" This would be accomplished by applying a \"stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation [ in addition to tightening immigration laws] to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.\"\n It's reasonable to conclude that as the leader of Planned Parenthood-even after 1929-Sanger would not allow publication of ideas she didn't support.\n Sanger's defenders argue she only wanted to educate blacks about birth control's \"health benefits.\" However, she counted the very people she wanted to \"educate\" among the \"unfit,\" whose numbers needed to be restricted.\n Grant presents other arguments Sanger's supporters use to refute her racist roots:\n \u0095 blacks, Jews, Hispanics and other minorities are well represented in the \n \u0095 the former, high-profile president of the organization, Faye Wattleton, is a black woman; \n \u0095 \"aggressive\" minority hiring practices have been standard procedure for more than two decades; \n \u0095 the \"vast majority of the nation's ethnic leadership solidly and actively supports the work\" of the organization. \n These justifications also fail because of what Grant calls \"scientific racism.\" This form of racism is based on genes, rather than skin color or language. \"The issue is not 'color of skin' or 'dialect of tongue,'\" Grant writes, \"but 'quality of genes [emphasis added].'\" Therefore, \"as long as blacks, Jews and Hispanics demonstrate 'a good quality gene pool'-as long as they 'act white and think white'-then they are esteemed equally with Aryans. As long as they are, as Margaret Sanger said, 'the best of their race,' then they can be [counted] as valuable citizens [emphasis added].\" By the same token, \"individual whites\" who shoe \"dysgenic traits\" must also have their fertility \"curbed right along with the other 'inferiors and undesirables.'\"\n In short, writes Grant, \"Scientific racism is an equal opportunity discriminator [emphasis added]. Anyone with a 'defective gene pool' is suspect. And anyone who shows promise may be admitted to the ranks of the elite.\"\n The eugenic undertone is hard to miss. As Grant rightly comments, \"The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood was self-consciously organized, in part, to promote and enforce White Supremacy. ... It has been from its inception implicitly and explicitly racist.\"\n \"There is no way to escape the implications,\" argues William L. Davis, a black financial analyst Grant quotes. \"When an organization has a history of racism, when its literature is openly racist, when it goals are self-consciously racial, and when its programs invariably revolve around race, it doesn't take an expert to realize that the organization is indeed racist.\"\n Sanger's Legacy \n Its is impossible to sever Planned Parenthood's past from its present. Its legacy of lies and propaganda continues to infiltrate the black community. This poison is even more venomous because, in addition to birth control, Planned Parenthood touts abortion as a solution to the economic and social problems that plague the community. In its wake is the loss of more than 12 million lives within the black community alone. Planned Parenthood's own record reflect this. For example, a 1992 report revealed that 23.2 percent of women who obtained abortions at its affiliates were black---although blacks represent no more than 13 percent of the total population. In 1996, Planned Parenthood's research arm reported: \"Blacks, who make up 14 percent of all childbearing women, have 31 percent of all abortions and whites, who account for 81 percent of women of childbearing age, have 61 percent.\"\n \"Abortion is the number-one killer of blacks in America,\" says Rev. Hunter of LEARN. \"We're losing our people at the rate of 1,452 a day. That's just pure genocide. There's no other word for it. [Sanger's] influence and the whole mindset that Planned Parenthood has brought into the black community ... say it's okay to destroy your people. We bought into the lie; we bought into the propaganda.\"\n Some blacks have even made abortion \"right\" synonymous with civil rights.\n \"We're destroying the destiny and purpose of others who should be here,\" Hunter laments. \"Who knows the musicians we've lost? Who knows the great leaders the black community has really lost? Who knows what great minds of economic power people have lost? What great teachers?\" He recites an old African proverb: \"No one knows whose womb holds the chief.\"\n Hunter has personally observed the vestiges of Planned Parenthood's eugenic past in the black community today. \"When I travel around the country...I can only think of one abortion clinic [I've seen] in a predominantly white neighborhood. The majority of clinics are in black neighborhoods.\"\n Hunter noted the controversy that occurred tow years ago in Louisiana involving school-based health clinics. The racist undertone could not have been more evident. In the Baton Rouge district, officials were debating placing clinics in the high schools. Black state representative Sharon Weston Broome initially supported the idea. She later expressed concern about clinics providing contraceptives and abortion counseling. \"Clinics should promote abstinence,\" she said. Upon learning officials wanted to put the clinics in black schools only, Hunter urged her to suggest they be placed in white schools as well. At Broome's suggestion, however, proposals for t he school clinics were \"dropped immediately,\" reported Hunter.\n \n \n Further, PP has never condemned the forced abortions going on in China. Planned Parenthood's racism has spread so greatly, that now almost 40% of abortions are done by blacks. \n \n \n Again, you offered no evidence to support this.\n\n \n Planned Parenthood spreads lies, as shown above. \n \n \n Perhaps, but certainly not by someone who advocated the extermination of any race. Either way, as I said, Planned Parenthood neither advocates or practices her beliefs at this time, and in fact openly condemns them. Can you not find anything wrong with PP presently?\n\n \n Show me ONE source where PP condemns Margaret Sanger's racism. Yes, there are a lot of problems with Planned Parenthood today. They recommended China to have abortions, and now forced abortions are being done on women, and PP hasn't said anything about it. They have not regretted their racism in the past. They give biased opinions to women about their \"options\". They brainwash teenage girls into having an abortion, and keep it secret from their parents. This is SICK.\n \n [quote] The website you quote is not against Sanger's racism in particular, but what the organizers feel is the inherent racism of many state contraceptive/abortion programs. However, for starters, they are a religious anti-abortion organization, and second they don't actually quote Sanger saying or doing anything particularly racist, but instead quote right-wing eugenicists or speak of abortion providers in general.[/quoet]\n \n Actually they quote Sanger a lot. Here, here, and I'm sure you can find other places. \n \n \n This is another quote from the same website which makes it clear that Sanger never advocated the extermination of any particular race, as her idea of genetic \"fitness\" was not divided by race.\n\n \n What?! Grant made it clear that Sanger was OK with non-whites who \"acted\" white. THAT IS STILL RACIST!\n \n \n a) the sources you gave me were from biased web-sites and organizations as well,\n \n b) upon investigation, every one of your quotes was either taken out of context, inconclusive (ie showed she was for eugenics but not for the extermination of anyone), or a patently false invention.\n\n \n My sources have sources in themselves- and if they don't, I give you sources. You just give me articles written by third-party political scientists who provide no valid quotes. \n \n \n None of your quotes from Margaret Sanger include her saying she believes in the extermination of any particular race.\n\n \n Only those who \"act\" like their race. If they act white, they're OK! So let's kill all Asians, Africans, and Hispanics, unless they act white, they've gotta go. \n \n \n As I said before;\"ALL deliberately misinforms people, spreading fear in order to get people to comply with their political agenda. That is by definition terrorism.\"\n\n \n Um, no it is not. Terrorism involves violence, pro-lifers (generally) do not use physical violence. There are some rare cases where people like the Army of God bomb abortion clinics, calling them \"radical clinic bombers\", and even Feminists For Life offered a reward for the capture of a clinic bomber.\n \n \n Which one? I provided two- one written by a Catholic and published by the Goan Overseas Digest (\"a digest of issues for Goan & Asian diaspora\"), one from an anti-racism site on a Jewish Christian webring.\n \n \n Once source was from this site. Yes, very credible. The other was written by some figure who was a secretary for Catholic bishop's conference, but we don't know anything about the guy. \n \n \n You still haven't addressed any of the issues I offered, citing instead information about other things that members of the Catholic Church may have done, as though this is conclusive evidence for your claim that \"the Catholic Church is NOT racist\". As though saying that enough times will make my points magically dissapear. Perhaps instead you should just click your heels three times saying \"there's no place like Church\". Then again, you could try actually debating.\n\n \n Those things that the Catholic Church did were BY the PAPAL authority. THAT IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. \n \n \n Why would the church make itself neutral in such atrocities? Why would any aid given to the afflicted be made secret? And please refrain from using the \"we\" word, you weren't born for several decades, and I'm sure have no involvement in papal dictates even now. It's not like I would claim to have involvement in official american policy during the war.\n\n \n For the same reason Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Ireland, and other nations went neutral; so they wouldn't be invaded. The Vatican was always supported by Italy, but when Italy went fascist, do you think that's a smart move to make to ally yourself to people thousands of miles away? No. If they allied with Germany, they could have gotten benefits. However, instead they went neutral.",

The sudden antagonism in Germany against the Jews & the vitriolic hatred of them is spreading underground here & is far more dangerous  than the aggressive policy of the Japanese in Manchuria.\" (MS to Edith How-Martyn, May 21, 1933 [MSM C2:536].) She joined the American Council Against Nazi Propaganda and \"gave money, my name and any influence I had with writers and others, to combat Hitler's rise to power in Germany.\" (\"World War II and World Peace,\" 1940? [MSM S72:269].) For Hitler the feeling was mutual; in 1933 the Nazis burned Sanger's books along with those of Ellis, Freud, German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, and others. (Ellis to MS, Sept. 3, 1933 [LCM 3:385].)\n\n \n \nPlanned Parenthood spreads lies, as shown above.\n\n \n Again, you quote pro-life people's opinions, none of whom are able to find any quotes of Sanger actually saying she believed in racial extermination. \n \n \nWhat?!

So far, your thesis has been based entirely on other person's opinions, personal attacks, insults, and ridiculousness. It extremely difficult to respond to your post because I try so hard to make everything very clear, but only on rare occasions do you understand. It's humorous that you post things that clearly are biased and expect me to accept them as fact. I continue to ask for sources, you give them to me. I ask for links, and with time you give them to me. I discover your quotes come from biased authors, and you attack me and defend the sources, such as \"Catholic Ministries\", which is an anti-Catholic organization dedicated to \"Saving\" Catholics, and \"Jewish Christians\", which is a Protestant-Jewish anti-Catholic website. You expect me to take these sources seriously? I hope you don't. Obviously, you've been having difficulty finding sources to support your theses. If I may, I recommend you discover your thesis, research on it, and find your own answers before beginning to debate it, let alone act on it and tell others it is the truth, when clearly it isn't.\n \n And thus I conclude this argument; Abortion is the killing (By definition) of an innocent (by definition), human being (by science), and therefore it is morally wrong to kill it. Abortion is homicide, murder, et cetera, infinitum, saecula, saeculorum. You can never tell somebody that their not a human because they don't seem like one. You can never trick a woman into murdering somebody. Abortion is not only a disgrace to America, but a disgrace to humanity.",

   " Actually, that's completely false. Another red herring.\n\n \n Okay, I admit that was incorrect, but that isn't a red herring... do you know what a red herring is?\n \n \n First, as I said, you merely quoted the author's opinion, making the quote completely useless as a support to any argument. Second, by \"unbiased\" I can only assume you mean \"Catholic anti-abortionist who agrees with me\", as these are the only sources you'll accept.\n\n \n No, I mean unbiased as in it supports YOUR belief. Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society? Without laughing, say that a pro-lifer and anti-Margaret Sanger person would write that as a title.\n \n \n You are not critiquing the organization on their politics, you are just fishing for something to discredit them with. If they completely put Sanger down and hated her, it would make no difference whatsoever to you, and your exploitation of this sensationalist caricature of her.\n\n \n Of course not. I hate Planned Parenthood because they kill 4000 innocent people in America every day, and only part of it is that they support a racist woman, except they deny she's racist!\n \n  Beginning in 1939, DuBois also served on the advisory council for Sanger's \"Negro Project,\" which was a \"unique experiment in race-building and humanitarian service to a race subjected to discrimination, hardship, and segregation\" (Chesler, 1992). The Negro Project served African-Americans in the rural South. Other leaders of the African-American community who were involved in the project included Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. The Negro Project was also endorsed by prominent white Americans who were involved in social justice efforts at this time, including Eleanor Roosevelt, the most visible and compassionate supporter of racial equality in her era; and the medical philanthropists, Albert and Mary Lasker, whose financial support made the project possible -\n Planned Parenthood\n \n \n (the insinuation in your opinion here being that Sanger was a racist eugenicist. You still haven't proven it.)\n\n \n Ummm... yes I did. I showed you quotes from the Birth Control Review, from the Negro Project, et cetera. Now you're switching sides, just a little while ago you said that Margaret Sanger was a racist, now you're saying she isn't. ??\n \n Margaret Sanger, who passionately believed in a woman's right to control her body, never \"promoted\" abortion because it was illegal and dangerous throughout her lifetime.\n \n Planned Parenthood claims that Margaret Sanger supported abortion, but didn't promote it because it was dangerous. Either way, my argument was correct; Margaret Sanger did support abortion.\n \n No, that was an incorrect statement of mine. Planned Parenthood does believe the fetus is human, but don't believe it's a person. That's false, as the fetus is a person from it's own growth. Personality doesn't involve thinking always. \n \n Planned Parenthood has priest make quotes about abortion not being a sin\n \n Read what I said about Margaret Sanger supporting Fairchild's book,  The Melting Pot Mistake, which said Jews were \"diluting\" the American population, and in his other book  Race and Nationality, he blamed the Jews for their own holocaust... hmm... nice person to ally with\n . \n And to stop confusion, the American Birth Control League was Planned Parenthood before World War II. The name was changed.\n \n \n You still haven't answered the question of why ALL would continue to spread this hypothesis that has been found without basis by leading Cancer organizations.\n\n \n ... because they're against abortion, perhaps?\n \n \n Breast cancer could be caused by crossing your eyes too much. That's not a lie either. However, it would be misleading, unethical and dangerous if someone went about presenting themselves as an authority saying \"crossing your eyes could cause breast cancer\".\n\n \n The scientific support that abortion is the cause of breast cancer is much greater than your theory of \"crossing your eyes\". \n \n \n Why would you support an organization which spreads information that they/you know is false?\n\n \n Well, it hasn't been proven false. Once it has been proven false, I doubt ALL will continue to use it. IF they do, I don't know where I'll stand.\n \n \n I see. Would you also \"assure me\" that everyone is out to get you?

You are completely misunderstanding source validity and bias.\n \n \nI'm assuming this is not linked to this debate and is simply a red herring.\n\n \n Well, so long as you're feeling better.

New Jersey was chosen because it has no parental-consent laws regarding abortions for minors. The girl's home state of Pennsylvania, however, requires the consent of at least one parent. \n \n Sarah's parents successfully sued the high school in a separate lawsuit for violating their 14th Amendment rights to raise their child without interference by the public school. \n \n While the New Jersey clinic and provider cannot be criminally prosecuted for violating Pennsylvania law, they can be taken to task in the civil arena. This lawsuit makes it possible for the abortion providers to be sued for battery. \n \n \"This case establishes abortion clinics can't escape civil penalties by aborting for kids from other states when they know the state where they come from has parental-consent statute,\" Sarah's attorney Joseph P. Stanton told WorldNetDaily. \n \n Abortion clinics in no-consent states like New Jersey and Illinois are known \"dumping grounds\" for abortions by out-of-state minors, say anti-abortion advocates. According to Stanton's statistics, an average of 43 women from Pennsylvania travel to New Jersey every month to have abortions. Ten of those are teens, some as young as 12. \n \n Stanton said one New Jersey clinic routinely promotes its \"no parental consent\" services in advertising to minors in Pennsylvania. \n \n Sarah is said to have suffered tremendously since having her abortion. Attorney Susan Marie Gertz, executive director of the Women's Injury Network, the national charity that covered Sarah's case expenses, reports she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome following the abortion. \n \n Gertz applauded the undisclosed settlement, which was based on Sarah's need for medical monitoring for early detection of breast cancer. Doctors estimated that cost to be $2,500 annually. The settlement also includes funding to cover future psychological counseling. \n \n \"Abortion malpractice lawsuits help expose the deceptive practices of the abortion industry and hold doctors legally and financially accountable to the women they've harmed,\" Gertz said in a statement. \n \n Opened in 1978, the Cherry Hill Women's Center bills itself as \"a safe place to make an important decision.\" According to its website, a specialized group of medical care providers help make the center \"one of New Jersey's leading ambulatory surgical centers for women's health.\" \n \n A call for comment from the center's administrator was not returned, and Benjamin was unavailable. \n \n Proponents of the abortion-breast cancer link, known as the ABC link, also cheered the settlement, the first associated with the ABC link recorded in the U.S. Two others have been reached in Australia. \n \n \"This settlement will teach the medical establishment that it can no longer profit by keeping women in the dark about the breast cancer risk,\" said Karen Malec, president of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer. \n \n Malec and others call the ABC link \"the elephant in medicine's parlor.\" While medical experts privately admit abortion is one cause of breast cancer, the volatility of the issue prevents them from publicly acknowledging it. \n \n 'ABC link' \n \n WorldNetDaily has reported breast cancer is linked to reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen. Although science has yet to define specifically what causes breast cancer, it is uncontested - even among abortion providers - that the sooner a woman has her first child, the lower her risk of developing breast cancer. This is called the \"protective\" effect. \n \n According to Dr. Joel Brind, president of the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute and a leading ABC-link researcher, a woman's estrogen level increases hundreds of times above normal upon conceiving - and one of the first physical changes to the pregnant woman's body occurs in the breasts. That hormone surge leads to the growth of \"undifferentiated\" cells in the breast as the body prepares to produce milk for the coming baby. Undifferentiated cells are vulnerable to the effects of carcinogens, which can give rise to cancerous tumors later in life. \n \n In the final weeks of a full-term pregnancy, those cells are \"terminally differentiated\" through a still largely unknown process and are ready to produce milk. Differentiated cells are not vulnerable to carcinogens. However, should a pregnancy be terminated prior to cell differentiation, the woman is left with abnormally high numbers of undifferentiated cells, therefore increasing her risk of developing breast cancer. \n \n Since 1957, 29 out of 39 published studies on the subject worldwide and 13 out of 16 studies in the United States show a positive association between induced abortion and breast cancer. Seventeen of the 29 are statistically significant, which means there's a 95 percent certainty that the association is not by chance. Seven of these 17 report more than a two-fold risk increase. \n \n Five medical organizations recognize a link between abortion and breast cancer. They include the National Physicians Center for Family Resources, the Catholic Medical Association, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute and The Polycarp Research Institute. \n \n Groups such as Planned Parenthood attack the validity of Brind's and other researchers' studies and refuse to inform prospective abortion recipients of the existence, dismissing even the statistically significant findings as \"misinformation\" being used \"as a weapon in the campaign against safe, legal abortion.\" \n \n \"Undaunted by the absence of compelling evidence associating induced abortion with a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, anti-choice extremists insist on making the connection anyway,\" says Planned Parenthood on its website. \n \n Informed consent \n \n To combat the denial and protect women, Minnesota and Texas state legislators passed informed-consent legislation earlier this year, which requires abortion providers to tell prospective patients about the risk. Massachusetts is considering similar legislation. \n \n Linda Rosenthal, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New York, petitioned to participate as a lawyer in Sarah's case on the side of Benjamin and the clinic. CRLP is a national public interest law firm devoted to protecting the \"constitutional rights\" of women seeking abortions. \n \n \"It's disturbing to have [Rosenthal] declaring women are not entitled to [risk] information. To me, being fully informed is a part of your reproductive rights,\" said Stanton. \"It's disappointing they're willing to sacrifice women's lives because they're beholden to the abortion industry.\" \n \n \"It's common sense,\" adds Malec. \"Doctors should be erring on the side of caution and should be telling patients 'Yes, there is research going back 46 years that supports an abortion-breast cancer link.' That's the minimum owed to women.\" \n \n Previous articles: \n \n Study: Tell women about abortion-breast cancer link \n \n Judge rules in favor of abortion clinic \n \n Abortion-cancer link goes on trial \n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Diana Lynne is a news editor for WorldNetDaily.com.",

All of their fact sheets are related to abortion, all their resources are about abortion, including booklets and brochures, videos, etc. Clearly this is an organization with a single agenda.\n \n Same for the \"Polycarp Institute\", whose only medical subjects covered were \"Breast Cancer & Abortion, Breast Cancer & Oral Contraceptives, \n Postfertilization Effect of Emergency Contraception, Postfertilization Effect of Oral Contraceptives\".\n \n National Physicians Center for Family Resources, the Catholic Medical Association, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are all right-wing, anti-abortion organizations.\n \n Also, the 'news source' for the article you posted, you should clarify, has a clear anti-abortion bias. WorldNetDaily.com a right-wing Christian news board, also offers such news items as \"SPECIAL OFFER: When will Jesus return? Plug into ultimate prophecy.\"\n \n About the content of the abortion-breast cancer link-\n \nDoes abortion increase breast cancer risk? The short answer is that there is no clear evidence one way or the other. There is a biologically plausible argument that breast cell differentiation during the latter half of pregnancy, which prepares the body for lactation, has lasting effects upon the cellular structure of the breast that is thought to reduce breast cancer risk. Mid-pregnancy interruption of the hormone surge that is the engine for this differentiation process has been hypothesized to increase the risk of breast cancer, because breast cancer originates in undifferentiated cells, but this theory has not been proven.\n \n Many studies have been done in an effort to determine whether there is an abortion-related risk for breast cancer and, if so, how large a risk. Most of the research employs a \"case-control\" design: researchers match women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer with women who have not (usually matched by general age), and then compare the proportion of each group who report having had an abortion.\n \n Case-control studies rely on participants to report on their abortion history, which is notoriously inaccurate. One study that appeared in the American Journal of Public Health last fall found significant underreporting (35 to 60 percent of actual abortions) in surveys.1 Underreporting is more extreme in areas where there is strong social stigma around abortion, such as conservative Catholic regions.2 Women with breast cancer are 50 percent more likely to report accurate abortion history,3 presumably because of their desire to understand potential origins of their disease. Because of this reporting bias, results are skewed in a way that makes it seem that women with breast cancer have a higher rate of abortion.\n \n One of the best case-control studies found a 50 percent increased risk of breast cancer in women under age 45 who'd had an abortion.4 Because of the likelihood of reporting bias, the researchers called for further studies, stating that their study's limitations \"argue against a firm conclusion at this time.\"\n \n \"Cohort\" studies compare women who have had abortions with those who have not, following them for long periods of time to determine which group has a higher rate of breast cancer diagnosis. Because these studies do not rely on self-reported history, they are considered more valid than case-control studies. However, they take much longer and are therefore very expensive. No cohort study has found a relationship between abortion and breast cancer.\n \n The most respected of the cohort studies on abortion and breast cancer risk is one done in Denmark, where the government keeps a health record for each citizen. Using data from national registries on abortion and on breast cancer for 1.5 million Danish women, researchers found no increased risk of breast cancer among those with a history of abortion.5\n \n Three meta-analyses, which examine the collected findings from a number of studies, have also reported contradictory results. The three were published within four months of each other, between September 1996 and January 1997. One reviewed 19 studies, another 32; both found the collective research inadequate to determine with confidence the relationship between abortion and breast cancer.6,7 If such a relationship exists, it is likely to be small.\n \n The third meta-analysis, one often cited by the right-to-life movement, was done by Joel Brind and colleagues. Brind is a professor of biology and endocrinology at Baruch College, at the City University of New York. He and three colleagues from the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine published a meta-analysis of 23 studies and concluded that abortion increases the risk of cancer by 30 percent.8 The researchers' analysis dismissed the validity of reporting bias, and their article has been strongly criticized because of assumptions made about a causal relationship between abortion and breast cancer. (A correlation between two events does not mean that one is responsible for causing the other.)\n \n Brind, an active spokesperson for the National Right to Life movement for the past decade, is a frequent columnist in the National Right to Life News and a contributor to the National Review, a conservative political periodical. Although he has not published epidemiological research of his own design on this topic, he has been active in promoting his perspective that abortion is a significant cause of breast cancer. He is also the president of the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, an organization that promotes this point of view.\nBreast Cancer Action, Newsletter #71-May/June 2002\n \n \n the American Cancer Society has this to say-\n \nInduced abortion: Several studies have provided very strong data that induced abortions have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. Also, there is no evidence of a direct relationship between breast cancer and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in most of the studies that have been published. Scientists invited to participate in a conference on abortion and breast cancer by the National Cancer Institute (February 2003) concluded that there was no relationship.\n\n \n The National Cancer Institute explains the results of this conference-\n \n \nOn March 3, 2003, the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Board of Scientific Advisors and Board of Scientific Counselors reviewed and unanimously accepted the findings of an \"Early Reproductive Events and Breast Cancer Workshop.\" The workshop, convened by NCI, brought together a cross-section of experts to discuss available scientific data on reproductive events in a woman's life that may impact her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. \n \n Some of the population-based findings in the report that were presented as supported by evidence that was well-established were:\n \n \n \n Early age at first full-term birth is related to lifetime decrease in breast cancer risk. \n Increasing parity (number of live births) is associated with a long-term risk reduction, even when controlling for age at first birth. \n The additional long-term protective effect of young age at subsequent term pregnancies is not as strong as for the first term pregnancy. \n A nulliparous woman (someone who has never given birth to a live infant) has approximately the same risk as a woman with a first term birth around age 30. \n Breast cancer risk is transiently increased after a term pregnancy.  \n Long duration of lactation provides a small additional reduction in breast cancer risk after consideration of age at and number of term pregnancies. \n Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.  \n Recognized spontaneous abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. \n\n \n Empirical scientific review of the data put forth by anti-abortion organizations finds it to be without merit. Continuing to misinform women in order to dissuade them from having abortions is, in the case of doctors, malpractice, and in the case of laypersons, highly immoral and borderline terrorist.",

As well, the bias can go both ways. However, I understand that you have also argued against the surveys themselves with the Breast Cancer Action, Newsletter #71-May/June 2002.\n \n There are three main arguments in that newsletter: First, that the case-control studies are affected by reporting bias, second - that the largest cohort study found no correlation, and third - the meta-analysis which found a correllation was done by a biased individual.\n \n The third argument is refuted by your own statements to Parcum: \"First, because no one has no bias. Second, ... you are saying that no matter how accurate a source may be, you will not accept it if the person quoting the source is, in your estimation, biased. This is of course an ad hominem logical fallacy. No matter how biased someone is, you have to contend with the source itself. \"\n \n I hold that Brind's analysis is not disproved because of his bias. However, it is also noted that he dismissed reporting bias in his study, also that the other two analyses did not find a corellation. This leads me to the first arguement - that reporting bias affects the outcome of case-control studies.\n \n \n\n WHAT IS RECALL BIAS?\n \n The first kind of bias is called recall bias or reporting bias. It pertains to the bias that a patient allegedly has when answering the following question, \"Did you ever have an induced abortion?\" Some scientists have theorized that breast cancer patients are more likely to honestly report any abortions that they might have had than healthy women are (i.e. a bias between breast cancer patients and healthy women). This theory has been offered as an explanation for the studies linking abortion with breast cancer. If this phenomenon exists, then the findings in those studies reporting an increased risk of breast cancer among women having an abortion history -- as opposed to a decreased risk among women without an abortion history -- would not be authentic. \n \n If this hypothesis is true, then any epidemiological study relying on retrospective data, as opposed to prospective data could be faulty. Retrospective data are obtained through interviews and/or questionnaires by looking back at women's reproductive history. On the other hand, prospective data are obtained through the use of medical records recorded when an abortion takes place. \n \n It has been argued that if there was such a phenomenon as recall bias, then many thousands of epidemiological studies examining the relationship between a disease and any controversial risk factor could be called into question. [1, p. 63] For example, studies examining any one of the following risk factors would be problematical: 1) the link between cervical cancer and the number of sexual partners a woman has had; 2) the link between liver cancer and alcoholism; and 3) the link between AIDS and the number of homosexual partners a man has had.\n \n \n RESEARCHERS FIND NO EVIDENCE OF RECALL BIAS\n \n Dr. Brind Claims Swedish Researchers Covered-Up ABC Link \n \n Recall bias, however, has not been shown to exist by any researchers in abortion-breast cancer research. In the only study claiming to find direct evidence of it, Dr. Olaf Meirik found himself in the preposterous position of having to explain why seven breast cancer patients reported they'd had abortions which the computer said they'd never had. In other words, 27% (7 out of 26) of the patients in this group (the group which said they had had any abortions) allegedly lied and overreported their abortion histories, an assertion which is difficult to believe. The study was funded by Family Health International. Its authors hypothesized that, \"...a woman who had recently been given a diagnosis of a malignant disease, contemplating causes of her illness, would remember and report an induced abortion more consistently than would a healthy control.\" [1, p. 1003] \n \n Dr. Chris Kahlenborn, who authored the book, Breast Cancer, Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill, criticized the Meirik hypothesis. He asked, \"Why was this the working hypothesis instead of its direct \n counterpart?\" He suggested a more appropriate hypothesis and argued, \"....why did these authors not originally hypothesize that a woman who has breast cancer might be less candid about her recall of abortion? After all, 'denial' is one of the first reactions that patients have. When a woman is told that she has breast cancer it is not uncommon to deny to herself that she really has it. It would seem just as logical to think that such women would be more likely to deny factors that may have contributed to the breast cancer such as abortion and/or early oral contraceptive use.\" [2, p. 62, emphasis original]\n \n Dr. Joel Brind's team was also highly critical of the Meirik group's \n claim of overreporting. In a letter published in 1998 in the Journal of \n Epidemiology and Community Health, Brind identified serious errors in \n Meirik's study, and proved that that group had covered-up an abortion-breast cancer link in Norwegian women. [3] To read Dr. Brind's commentary about the recall bias hypothesis, see his lecture on our \"ABC Link\" page.\n \n No Direct Evidence of Recall Bias Among Greek Women \n \n Others tested for reporting bias and found no direct evidence of it. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Lipworth's group addressed recall bias among Greek women by completing a literature review. They determined that even before legalization of abortion in Greece there was no social stigma against it, and it was practiced extensively. Lipworth's team theorized that a control group of healthy Greek women would be more likely to be honest about their reproductive histories. The team reported a 51% increased risk of breast cancer among Greek women. [4]\n \n Janet Daling's Studies Report Lack of Response Bias\n \n Janet Daling tested for recall bias in her 1994 study, the only published study specifically commissioned by the National Cancer Institute. She found an overall 50% increased breast cancer risk among women who reported having had an abortion. Daling completed a separate study to test for recall bias in the study population. She chose another disease which was known not to be linked to induced abortion -- cervical cancer. She hypothesized that, if recall bias existed, then patients with cervical cancer would be more likely to report having had an abortion than healthy controls; and an apparent elevation in risk would result. If, however, recall bias does not exist in the study population, then an elevation in risk would not appear.\n \n Using the methods that were employed in the breast cancer study to \n identify subjects in the same geographic area, Daling's results reported no elevation in risk of cervical cancer from induced abortion. Therefore, she concluded that her methods were not influenced by recall bias. [5]\n \n The Daling group conducted another test for response bias in a study \n reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2000. Researchers collected birth records in Washington. The records contained reproductive histories furnished by the mothers at the time of the most recent childbirth, and these were compared to the reproductive histories reported by the subjects during the study interview. \n \n Daling showed that both patients (cases) and healthy women (controls) were underreporting their histories of induced abortion at the birth of their last child. Slightly less than 60% of the subjects in both groups, who said at the time of their interviews that they'd had an abortion, had also reported the abortion at the birth of their last child. More importantly, Daling demonstrated that there was no difference in underreporting level between cases and controls at study interview. She reported that 14.0% of the cases and 14.9% of the controls said during their interviews that they had not had abortions, which they had reported at the birth of their children. No difference in the level of underreporting means that there was no response bias between breast cancer patients and controls. \n \n Daling said that her findings are compatible with the findings reported \n in two other studies examining reporting bias. [7,8]\n \n PROSPECTIVE STUDY REPORTS INCREASED RISK\n \n A prospective study (i.e. a study in which even the possibility of response bias is non-existent) completed by Howe in 1988 relying on fetal death certificates filed in New York State at the time of abortion reported a statistically significant increased risk of 90%.

Despite consistent research findings documenting that induced abortion is a risk factor for breast cancer, proponents of abortion continue to label studies investigating the ABC Link with terms such as inconclusive, not definitive, inconsistent, or unduly alarming. \n \n These apparent attempts to assure women and girls that induced abortion poses no real breast cancer risk are based largely on a 1997study completed in Denmark. The Danish Study included an impressively large population. However, serious methodological flaws make the study's conclusions questionable.[viii]\n \n The study claimed that elective abortion was legalized in Denmark in 1973-when in fact, it had been legalized in 1939. \n Consequently, 60,000 of the oldest post-abortive women in the study were misclassified as not having had an abortion. \n Although abortions in the Danish population were included only since 1973, breast cancer diagnoses recorded as far back as 1968 were included. This means the measurement of the outcome (breast cancer) preceded the measurement of the exposure (abortion) for many women in the study. This is a fundamental violation of proper scientific procedure (and guaranteed to lower the calculated relative risk). \n In addition, approximately one-fourth of the women in the study were under age 25 at the end of the study. These women-all born between 1968 and 1978-had some 40,000 abortions, but only accounted for 8 cases of breast cancer. They should not have been included in the study at all since breast cancer generally does not develop until later in life.\n Regardless of these facts, a New England Journal of Medicine editorial remarking on the Danish study concluded that, \"a woman need not worry about the risk of breast cancer when facing the difficult decision of whether to terminate a pregnancy.\"[ix]\n \n http://www.physicianscenter.org/positions_abortion.asp",

   "I understand that the biases of these organizations are important... but as you said to Parcum, that is no reason to discredit the breast cancer - abortion link.\n\n \n Come on. In this case, your argument was the reputation of these organizations. You were not quoting their statements, just their names, as argument, \"five medical organizations which recognize the link between abortion and breast cancer\". That makes the source the essence of your argument, and open to attack. Very different from attacking a source instead of an argument.\n \n \nNo matter how biased someone is, you have to contend with the source itself.\n\n \n Um, unless they themselves are doing the study. I don't think you understand ad hominem. Ad hominem is thus-\n \n a) Marge is having an affair. Bob says so.\n \n Well, maybe Bob is biased. Who knows, he hasn't offered proof, just opinion. The onus is on Bob to present the evidence, as Bob is making the allegation. To note that Bob is also Marge's ex-husband and involved in a bitter custody battle is not ad hominem in this case.\n \n b) Bob says that Marge is having an affair. He says he saw her getting into Herb's car and kissing him.\n \n So, here again, Bob is asking you to believe him. He isn't offering any evidence except his own expertise as a witness, so unless other witnesses are found, there is no sound evidence. Bringing up the fact that Bob has been treated for having hallucinations lately related to his estranged ex-wife is not ad hominem.\n \n -Bob says Marge is having an affair. He says he followed Herb's car Thursday night to the Motel 8, where they rented room 27, and ordered room service champagne and condoms.\n \n Well, now, in this case Marge has a problem. Bob is unquestionably a lunatic, but that doesn't matter. She has to explain where she was Thursday night, why the guy at the Motel 8 knows her as \"Mrs Herb Blatchett\", and why her credit card is billed that night for room service \"Champagne $40.77, Condoms $6.50\". Her saying \"look, Bob's a lunatic, he's on medication and he hates me\" are ad hominem at this point. Bob could have no grasp of reality whatsoever, but the evidence can be explored on it's own.\n \n Back to our discussion, your suggestion that the abortion-breast cancer connection was valid because of the \"five medical associations\" was like a). The Brind case is like b), and people also found his methodology problematic.\n \n \nThe largest and most valid study of the alleged link between breast cancer and induced abortion concluded that induced abortion has no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. The Melbye study, reported in 1997, is considered the most accurate and informative study to date because of its particularly sound methodology: it involved a very large study group and was free from reporting bias. The study relied on data about all women born in Denmark over several decades, which was collected from Denmark's National Registry of Induced Abortions and the Danish Cancer Registry. It found a relative risk of 1.0. 3\n \n Anti-choice proponents rely heavily on the 1994 report of a study by Daling and others, in which 845 Washington State women who were interviewed after being diagnosed with breast cancer were compared with 961 healthy women. This study found a relative risk of 1.5. 4 This study is less reliable than Melbye's because it depended upon self-reports from women who had already been diagnosed with cancer. Other studies suggest that women with breast cancer are more likely to report previous abortions than are healthy women, thus leading to a false association between induced abortion and breast cancer. 5\n\n works cited (color-coded emoticon_xgood ) - \n \n 3.

I'm Jewish, and Judaism tells us that a baby isn't really a baby until the second that it's born and is breathing. I'm told that Christianity believes that a child become a child as soon as conception occurs. \n \n The fact that you won't hear what other's have to say about abortion is scary. You're closing your mind and becoming ignorant. You might want to try opening up your mind a little before you decide. We're both fifteen and have awhile to decide what believe in. I think it's great that you're so passionate about what you believe in, but don't close your mind up so tight that you can't listen to what other's have to say.\n\n \n As a teacher, I am very encouraged to see 15 year olds interested in something more serious than the latest video game! I completely agree that an open mind is the wisest course to take in life. One should also be open minded with respect to one's religion as well, and I would think hard about the view that life begins right at conception, but I would think much, much harder about the view that a baby is not really a baby until it is born and breathing.

   "hey numbskull.\n\n \n Knock it off, we all make \"speling\" mistakes! emoticon_smile You are being arrogant here! You go around and accuse others of being arroagant and here you are! The others are just as entitled to their views as you are and hence, should not be called \"arrogant\" for illustrating them. You are the arrogant one here for not listening and hearing them out correctly.\n \n I personally believe that abortion is wrong. In my  opinion you are as good as a child killer. That may sound hard, but that is what I believe. You never know, one of those babies that was aborted may have been the person to kill cancer or to advance knowledge, etc. I guess my point is that you are ending a child's life, as soon as it is concieved, than it has the potential for life and will become a human. The best way to aviod abortions is to have no sex before marriage, but if you are a horny little bugger than make sure that the women is taking those pills. I hear that they are something like 99% effective, as opposed to the condom which is only something like 75% effective in stopping a sperm and the egg getting together. But no sex before marriage appears to be smarter. emoticon_xgood \n \n It appears to me that many of those who support abortion are those who are evolutionists or atheists and thus do not truely know \"morals and ethics\" so it would be very hard to change their views. As a Christian I believe that there is a standard of morality, and as such try to follow it as much as I can. But atheists do not believe (or have no real need to believe) that there is an absolute morality and that morality is relative, i.e. each person decides for themselves what they consider to be \"right\" and \"wrong\". Atheists also have no real basis for morals and ethics, and some have no real respect for life - it all stems from the view of our history, i.e. evolution.\n \n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87",

It seems that you are lumping a lot together for which it appears you may not have a solid foundation of understanding. The belief that an 'evolutionist' (who may also be Christian, BTW) or an atheist does not truly know \"morals and ethics\" has no basis in reality. Perhaps these individuals do not see things from the same perspective that you see them from, but that does not mean they cannot believe there is a standard for morality. Additionally, the statement that an atheist has no real respect for life also has no basis. I happen to know an atheist who has a much greater respect for life (in my opinion) than many Christians that I know.\n \n If you believe that evolution is the 'wrong' view of our history, then I encourage you to start a post in the 'Creation vs Evolution' forum that states the reasoning for this belief. If you have any evidence that supports the idea of a literal interpretation of Genesis, I encourage you to post it there.\n \n Consider the possibility that the view you hold of God is not the only possible view of God (assuming that an all-powerful God exists). It is entirely possible that your view of God is not even close to the way God is in reality. (Don't worry, God still loves us all anyway!)\n \n Anyway, for whatever it's worth... I encourage you to keep an open mind to hearing the Truth, rather than believing you already have the Truth all figured out.\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

People who do not believe in a god or your god can hold \"absolute\" moral standards. They just won't necessarily be the same as yours. For example, I have very set moral standards. I am very much in opposition to Christian morality, but my values are no less \"absolute\". I would say the main way my morality differs from a Christian morality, aside from our specific views which tend to be opposed, is that I believe that although certain actions in certain contexts are very clearly good or bad, I don't believe that an action itself outside any context is good or bad, neither do I believe that people themselves are good or bad. For example, if you were to ask me if I believed violence was wrong, I would say that it depends on the context. If you were to ask me if I felt Matthew Shepard's torture and murder was wrong, I would say \"yes\" absolutely.\n \n I think you are confusing the two; having unswerving, absolute moral values and having absolutist and reductivist moral values.",

At conception, it does have all the genetic materials needed, but it lacks development. At a few weeks it has a heart beat and brain wave, but it takes a while longer before the fetus looks just like a baby. There is continuous developement with no obvious points that say decisively, \"Now you are a human.\"\n \n But one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy.

   "This topic is one which seems to divide the majority of us into 2 very distinct camps. I'd have to say I fall in the middle though. \n \n Each case of an abortion should be individually asessed as to whether it is legal or not. I can accept an abortion being legal if a woman has been raped, sexually assaulted etc, where the conception of the fetus was not consentual. I couldn't possibly face a woman and tell her she must give birth to a baby whos father was the person that raped her. The emotional scarring of a crime such as rape can be extreme, but to force the woman to carry the fetus for 9 months and give birth? That, I belive, is impossible to ask. \n \n As for a woman who consents to, in most cases, unprotected sex, I don't believe an abortion should be legal. What ever happend to one taking responsibility for their own actions? In countries such as America and Australia, the father of a baby is forced to pay child support (Or so I've come to believe from watching Maury Povich and Jenny Jones), as well as other financial benefits being available. These factors, in my opinion, dispel the theory of not being able to \"afford\" a child. Abortion should not be used in cases where a woman enteres into consentual sex, and were either too lazy or didn't use their common sense to A) Use a contraceptive themselves or B) Not sleep with a man unless they use a condom.\n \n I have this belief this for the simple reason that abortion should only be used as a procedure to remove fetuses from rape victims. By only allowing an abortion for rape victims, the stigmatism associated with abortion could also disappear as people would immediately know and understand why an abortion is allowed to take place.\n \n Reading through many of the responses here, religion is noted throughout the debate. Personally, i think a law should not be passed because a particular religion says that it is wrong, for the simple fact that not everyone follows one religion. Laws should be passed on what is believed to be socially desirable at that point in time, not what a book written thousands of years ago says. To use the arguement of religion is pointless becasue the people you argue against do not belive in your God, let alone what that God has to say.\n \n *As a side note, do the anti-abortion writers on the forum also oppose contraception?

If the father is not working there is no income to be paid. Support amounts are frequently based on how much the father can pay, not how much is needed, leaving the mother to figure out how to get ends to meet. In many cases the father simply does not pay. My ex is suppose to give me 25% of his income, I have never seen one thin dime. And as he is \"who knows where\" there is nothing that the state I live in can do.\n \n And there is far more to parenting than money. A few hundred bucks a month is fine, but more precious is a positive male role model, a father who spends time - who also participates in doctors appointments, makes lunches, cares for the sniffles, attends recitals, kisses away tears, does fun things, helps with homework, disciplines. The work involved is immense. I know, I do it every day alone. And although I would never trade it for the world, and there is adoption as an option for someone unwilling to be a parent, your perception that a bit of cash will make bringing up a kid suddenly easy is extremely naive.\n \n Also - this is not a diss to all men.

   "In this case you would be right, the morals would be absolute for that certain group of people, but relative to eachother.\n\n Which, by the way, could be considered to fall under 'moral relativism' on a macro scale.\n \n \nBut if there is only one God, than there must only be one set of rules! I don't really want to take this to the extent of saying which God is the only true one, but I have my opinion as others have their own opinion. So to avoid any rather nasty replies we will say that this one true God is \"P\". Than that means that \"P\" has absolute authority and sets the absolutes. Even though X and Y don't believe in P they will be accountable to P when they die and will be judged according to P's absolutes and authority. No matter what others think, P will always have absolute authority and morality set in stone.\n\n This assumes that there IS a God. It also assumes that there is only ONE God. It also assumes that this one God is concerned with the dual concepts of right and wrong and sets these concepts in stone. If all of these assumptions are true, then your conclusion may be accurate. Operating under these assumptions, it's easy to conclude that there is a universal and absolute morality. However, you only BELIEVE that these assumptions are true... You may believe it with all your heart that they are true, but you cannot KNOW. That's the uniqueness of faith. It requires acceptance of something without any way of knowing for certain whether it's true.\n \n Not everyone makes these same assumptions. And consider that if any of your assumptions do not reflect reality, then there may not be any absolute standards of morality.\n \n \nCan you get what I'm talking about? \n\n Of course I get it! :p \n \n \nEven though people may believe in different God (s), if there is only one God (as indeed I'm convinced that there is) than there is only one set of absolute morals and rules that comes from that one true God and covers and applies to all humans, no matter what they believe - even though they may not acknowledge that. I didn't make that very clear in my original message. \n\n And even though you are convinced there is only one God with one set of absolute morals that applies to all humans, this may not reflect reality -- no matter what you believe and whether or not you acknowledge that.\n \n Do you yet see how there can be more than one perspective regarding the issue? Accepting that there are multiple perspectives acknowledges that IF there is an absolute 'right' and an absolute 'wrong,' then you may be absolutely wrong!",

   "In my opinion - abortion should continue for victims of rape, sexual abuse, disability risks (erm I mean brain damage anything that means that the child would not be able to think in any way) because in my opinion this could lead to abuse from 'able-minded' people. I agree that there has been lots of 'sex education' and most people should be aware that there are contraceptives out there and unwanted pregencies should not easily take place. AND if you do forget a condom then there is always the morning after pill. There are also people who want children but shouldn't be allowed them. Peadophiles etc. These children are sometimes then taken into care where they are subject to even more abuse. Some people choose to adopt for sick fantasies etc. If I was pregnant but I suffered depression or something that may affect the way I brought up the child and then the child may be taken from me then maybe abortion is a way of protection? I'm not sure having never been in the situation where I have had to consider abortion - maybe sometimes you have to be there to know what thoughts go through a persons head. There are also many people who wish to adopt but because 'the authorities' say they can't then another child goes without a stable family. Some families that are turned down for adoption are perfectly fit and would make fantastic parents - again I have not been in this situation either. Perhaps it would be worth watching a film called 'IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK' - there are actually two of these films - one is about abortion and the other is about gay issues. The gay issues one discusses IVF treatment because adoption is out of the question for lesbian couples who actually would make great parents. If anyone has watched these films you may be able to explain what I mean better than I can. It's a tough subject for those involved directly and also those around watching on - but who gives a total outsider the right to make a decision for the family actually involved. If I was pregnant and considered an abortion - what would give 'prolife' or anyone the right to say what is right for me? I thought that we could make decisions ourselves? If given the right information, the pro's and the con's then surely if we are prepared to listen and take both sides in we can form the right decision depending on situation?\n \n I hope that all makes sense - sorry if I have missed a point or interrupted a thread.",

   "Post Abortive Stress Syndrome (PASS) (http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html)\n \n \n\n \n A source from a bliblical college? are you KIDDING? One word: bias. say it with me - BIAS.\n \n PASS is not recognised by any independent psychological health committee. It's a propoganda lie.\n \n Why don't you see this:\n \n \"Low risk of psychological harm. Well-designed studies of psychological responses following abortion have consistently shown that risk of psychological harm is low. Some women experience psychological dysfunction following abortion, but post-abortion rates of distress and dysfunction are lower than pre-abortion rates. Moreover, the percentage of women who experience clinically relevant distress is small and appears to be no greater than in general samples of women of reproductive age. A recent study showed not only that rates of disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were not elevated in a large sample of 442 women followed for two years post-abortion, but also that the incidence of PTSD was actually lower in women post-abortion than the rate in the general population (Adler et al., 2002).\n \n \n Positive functioning and educational attainment two years later. A study of adolescent abortion followed 360 adolescents over two years after they had been interviewed when seeking a pregnancy test. Some had a negative pregnancy test, some were pregnant and carried to term, and some were pregnant and aborted their pregnancy. The adolescents who chose abortion showed significant drops in anxiety and significant increases in self esteem and internal control in the period immediately following the abortion to two years later. They appeared to be functioning as well as, or even better than, adolescents who had a negative pregnancy test or had carried to term. They were also most likely to have higher economic well-being; most likely to be in high school (and performing at grade level) or to have graduated; and less likely to have a subsequent pregnancy (Zabin, Hirsch, & Emerson, 1989).\n \n \n Psychological measures within normal range. Available data show that mean scores on psychological measures are well within normal bounds for minors as well as for adults who have undergone an abortion. The data do not suggest that legal minors are at heightened risk of serious adverse psychological responses compared with adults following an abortion or with peers who have not undergone an abortion (Zabin et al., 1989).\n \n \n Positive emotions more often experienced. Freely chosen legal abortion, particularly in the first trimester, has not been found to be associated with severe psychological trauma, despite the fact that it occurs in the stressful context of unwanted pregnancy. The time of greatest stress is before the abortion. A woman's emotional responses after experiencing an unwanted pregnancy terminated by abortion are complex and may involve a combination of positive and negative emotions. Positive emotions are more often experienced, and they are experienced more strongly than negative emotions, both immediately after the abortion and during the months following it (Russo & Zierk, 1992).\n \n \n Higher risk for psychopathology if pre-existing emotional problems. While there is little risk for severe post-abortion psychopathology for women in general, it is important to recognize that some women, particularly those with pre-existing emotional problems, are at higher risk for negative emotional responses after abortion due to their individual history than are other women (Russo & Zierk, 1992).\n \n \n Effects of stress are relative. Abortion may be a stressful experience, however, it may also reduce the stress resulting from an unwanted pregnancy and from the events that led to the pregnancy being unwanted. The effects of abortion cannot be separated from the effects of the experience of unwanted pregnancy and from the effects of the context in which the pregnancy occurred (Russo & Zierk, 1992). \n \n \n Circumstances must be taken into account. In studying responses to abortion, one needs to take into account the circumstances of the conception, as well as those following conception. If the conception is planned, the resulting pregnancy is likely to be wanted. However, changing circumstances (e.g., separation from one's partner or adverse results of genetic testing) may cause an initially planned, intended, and wanted conception to become an unwanted pregnancy. The circumstances leading to this change may themselves be sources of stress and distress, and should be taken into account in evaluating a woman's response following abortion. That is, in some cases, it is the unwanted pregnancy that is the source of stress, not necessarily the abortion (Adler, 1992).\n \n \n Poor social outcomes often arise for unwanted children, especially of teenage mothers. Unintended and unwanted childbearing has been linked with a variety of social problems, including divorce, poverty, child abuse, and juvenile delinquency. One study found that unwanted children were less likely to have a secure family life. As adults, they were more likely to engage in criminal behavior, be on welfare, and receive psychiatric services. Another study found that children who were unintended by their mothers had lower self esteem than their intended peers 23 years later. Research has shown that social and psychological problems persist, partially because the mothers are themselves from disadvantaged backgrounds with poor prospects for future education and employment. Children born to teenage mothers are more likely to have lower achievement scores, poorer school adjustment, and more problem behaviors than children born to older women (Russo & David, 2002).\n \n \n Negative outcomes persist in the best of circumstances. Longitudinal research has found that when abortion is denied, the resulting children are more likely to have a variety of social and psychological problems -- even when they are born to adult women who are healthy with intact marriages and adequate economic resources (Russo & David, 2002). \"\n \n From http://www.apa.org/ppo/issues/womenabortfacts.html an independent organisation.",

   "Yes they are usually done in the first few months, but at that point the fetus does have limbs. You can't have an abortion without the fetus being a certain size. However, abortions are still done quite often at later stages. Any kind of abortion is legal up to 9 months. \n\n \n Ha ha ha ha!! The anti abortion propoganda industry have really got to you haevn't they? Abortion is only legal past 24 weeks for health reasons. \n \n \nLOL! How ridiculous! It's called Surgical Abortion and no it hasn't been outlawed. If you go to a Planned Parenthood office they offer it. The Partial Birth Abortion is now illegal, but that's when they take the entire fetus out except for the head, and stab the back of the fetus' head. \n\n \n And what is the medical name for this procedure?

Grow up, for God's sake, and try and understand the world you live in, not judge it.\n\n \n My favorite part about this is that you say pro-lifers dont look beyond the abortion...I would respectfully disagree with this statement. Pro-life looks beyond the abortion in the sense that once the abortion is done what are the effects on the women. Many women have problems after abortion...mainly late term. Suicide rate is also much higher. You mention that the kid might not have loving parents if he/she was born but how do you know that? Maybe the kid would have grown up to cure cancer or maybe be president. The point is, no one is sure what the child would have done or been treated like. It would be impossible to determine which child would have a good life and which wouldnt. Not only that, you have to determine what a good life is. I hope this helps!\n \n Steve",

   "ugh, i didnt realize there are 23 pages of posts... I will address a few more things\n \n first off..liberal does not mean just \"big government more laws\" It means a person who favors an economic theory of laissez-faire and self-regulating markets and a person who favors a political philosophy of progress and reform and the protection of civil liberties. Liberal, however, is now used to mean \"democrat\"...a Democrat is really socially liberal and economically conservative....but who knows now :p \n \n Also, The \"pro-lifers\" here need to learn something if they wish to get their message across.

IX).\n \nshouldn't you play it on the safe side and assume that it is a person?\nNot at the expense of the woman's basic human right to control her own body.

   "As for Seen's statement\n \n Besides from Roe vs Wade not being law no where in their conclusions do they make a claim of when life begins (section IX simple says that the 14th amendment doesn't say what a person is). We must understand that courts do not make laws. We still dont know when life begins is kind of where we are. I will correct myself by saying that genetic science thinks life begins at conception.\n \n http://www.devbio.com/printer.php?ch=21&id=162\n \n So then one claims that if we dont know it is a human you should still protect the womens \"rights\". Well One thing this country is based on is equal rights for ALL. Keep that in mind. So we don't know when a person is. We have to know when a person begins so we are sure we are not killing others. If you don't know then I could say anyone is not a person based on say...their color of skin. Since we have to define personhoob it would be in the best interest to default it at the earliest safest time until we know otherwise. If not, then you have a chance that you are killing someone which goes against the very basis of this country (that all are created equal). Ok, so it is a person, I still think the mother should be able to do what she wants with her own property aka body. This statement is false if you go by all men are created equal. If the unborn is a person they have the exact same rights as anyone else. Being attached to someone else does not change this (such as conjoined twins). So she can do what she wants to her own body as long as it does not violate the other persons rights. I don't believe a mother has special rights just because she is pregnant.\n \n As for the donating blood thing. Our country is set up to prevent people from violating each others rights...No where does the government have a responsibility is force one to help someone else.",

That is a legal construct. \"DNA and what not\" does not help with this.\n \n \n\n Never the less, if you say at birth then that means eventhough they kid is 2 inches from being born it is not yet a person. This really makes no sense to me. I don't understand how one can say 2 inches determines a person or not.\n\n \n Honestly, you do not know the difference? Let me see if I can lay it out for you. On one side of the \"2 inches\" it is inside another creature (the woman for the slow among us). When it is inside the woman it is living off of her organs and life-processes. In essence, it does not have a functioning body because most of it's own organs do not function correctly (as it would after it is born) or at all.\n \n Once it is born, it is independent in terms of life-processes. It's bodily processes are no longer being completely and totally supported by the woman's body. They can be separated from each other with no ill effects (physically, at least). Until that happens, the woman has complete and total say in whether or not she will continue to participate in the life-support function she is involved in.\n \n \n\n If one says \"well THAT would be a person\" then we have a problem again of where to draw the line and thus the \"safe\" argument would come back.\n\n \n The line is drawn at birth.\n \n \n\n If you don't know if it is murder....play it safe so that way you know for sure you didn't murder.\n\n \n I know it isn't murder.\n \n \n\n One last thing...if birth is the logical sound easy way to say it is a kid why can't conception be?\n\n \n Because conception is generally never known, not even by the woman. If we apply the laws at that point, if we apply citizenship at that point (for if the laws protect it, it must be a citizen right?) how in the world would we enforce that? How will we investigate the deaths of all these little people? 1/3 of all pregnancies end in natural miscarriages, what do we do about them? They are protected under the law, should we not make sure that we do everything in our power to make sure they survive?\n \n What will we do with women who continue to do activities that they could do when not pregnant and risk losing their \"little citizens\" inside them? Jail them? Chain them up perhaps until they give birth? Make them into nice little baby-ovens, eh?\n \n Pfft.\n \n Arbitrary points just don't make sense. Why not one day earlier or later?

   "Or respond with something like....\n \n what is the law for personhood? There is none...so why do you claim it is at birth?\n\n \n Several decisions by the Supreme Court indicate that personhood does not apply to the \"unborn\".\n \n \n\n The umbilical cord is part of the baby and always was. A child 2 inches in the womb has all functions that he would outside the womb...0 difference and I would like to see some proof that says otherwise.\n\n \n There are many physiological changes that happen to the fetus the moment it exits the birth canal and takes it's first breath, and again when the umbilical cord is cut. I am not about to give you a lesson in natal care, or basic biology. A couple changes that are significant are that the lungs of a fetus are collapsed in the womb. They are basically a solid mass of tissue that have no function. All nutrients and oxygen is recieved by the mother through the cord, all waste is passed to the mother through the cord. When the baby is born and takes it's first breath, the lungs inflate for the first time. That is why that first breath is so crucial. \n \n Another related change is the heart. The fetal heart does not beat as yours and mine do. There is a special hole, a valve that allows the blood to pass directly through, bypassing the lungs (since the lungs are non-functioning in the womb). The blood is oxygenated directly from the mother. When the lungs inflate, the valve snaps shut in the heart, and blood begins to be directed towards the lungs. Also, the cutting of the cord is the signal for many functions in the babies body to begin.\n \n \n\n What if the baby came out all the way and then the doctor put it back in for a second, would it lose personhood which you defined as when the baby is born eventhough you said it should be done by the law?\n\n \n Um... ok?

The way the studies I mentioned tracked the difference in the number of abortions between it being illegal to it being legal was watching the birth rates. They remained virtually unchanged, indicating that there were no more women having abortions than before.\n \n \n\n READ THE ROE VS WADE CASE!!! Trimesters were created by judge Blackmun was the one that delivered the opinion of the Court in which he created the concept of trimesters.\n\n \n haha, trimesters existed before roe v wade.

Science is about the evidence, so I am sure that you can provide the scientific evidence that supports your absolutist claim? Or are you one of those who try to lend credence to a personal belief and subjective claim by calling it \"scientific\"? How does \"DNA and whatnot\" prove scientifically that personhood begins at birth? (And for that matter, please document that \"personhood\" is a scientific concept to begin with.\n \n \nNever the less, if you say at birth then that means eventhough they kid is 2 inches from being born it is not yet a person.\nThat is correct. The legal term \"Person\" specifically is defined to not include the unborn. \n \n \nThis really makes no sense to me. I don't understand how one can say 2 inches determines a person or not.\nThat is not our fault :) \n \n \nIf one says \"well THAT would be a person\" then we have a problem again of where to draw the line and thus the \"safe\" argument would come back.\nAh, but then nobody are saying that anyway, as the law is clear. Read Roe vs Wade, Sect.IX. It provides clear legal proof that the unborn is not a person (It states it just that way, BTW).\n \n \nIf you don't know if it is murder....play it safe so that way you know for sure you didn't murder.\nAh, but I AM sure it is not murder. And I don't believe that it is to \"play it safe\" to enslave women just because you can't be sure.\n \n \nOne last thing...if birth is the logical sound easy way to say it is a kid why can't conception be?\nor the formation of the gametes themselves for that matter, or even. Why should we deliberately pick a time that involves enslaving women? The only reason I can see it that this is actually a ploy by prolifers to oppress women in the best patriarchal, misogynistic style.",

   "DNA science says so....They believe the DNA is the basis of life. So when the egg and sperm meet the DNA is formed.....also I should say personhood is life to me...so human life and personhood are the same.\n \n Where is person defined in law by the way? Granted I am talking about US law.\n \n That is not our fault?????? Its over now....Slavery is legal, well, not our fault. They wasnt right back in 1850 was it?\n \n You then get into Roe vs Wade again..Which I will remind you is not law. Courts dont make laws. You are wrong in saying that is what it said.

You make it seem like they were forced to get pregnant. Her body \"makes\" babies!!!! You can't change that. If males had the womb same rules apply. When she had sex she did an act which creates babies. A life is made at that point and its life cannot be taken away even if the mother does not want it there.

   "As for Seen's statement\nWho?\n \nBesides from Roe vs Wade not being law..\nAh, but it is. You should have listened in civics. When the US Supreme Court makes a ruling, they provide current interpretation and application of the existing US Constitution (Which very much is law). As such, their ruling is merely a clarification for how the law applies to the specific case in question. What they rule **IS** the law. I am sorry that you weren't aware of this already. But I am glad that I could help you with this civics lesson, even though I am an immigrant.\n \n \nno where in their conclusions do they make a claim of when life begins (section IX simple says that the 14th amendment doesn't say what a person is).\nSigh, you can't even get THAT right. Sect 14 \"doesn't say what a person is,\" other than citing how \"person\" **IS** applied in the law. And then it notably (I guess you missed that part) points out that the unborn is NOT a person regardless. Either you need to read that stuff more closely, or you must stop your distortions of this, whichever is the case (I hope it is the first, as the second would imply outright dishonesty).\n \n \n We must understand that courts do not make laws.\nRather, they clarify what is already the law.\n \n \nWe still dont know when life begins is kind of where we are.\nSure we do. \"life\" itself began about 3.8 bill years ago. The cells that make up the individual body had its start with the gametes, of which the sperm typically came into existence somewhere around 14 days before conception and the egg was laid down when the woman was still a fetus herself.\n \n \nI will correct myself by saying that genetic science thinks life begins at conception.\n\"think\"? Are you sure? What makes you say that they don't believe that the sperm and egg are alive?\n \n http://www.devbio.com/printer.php?ch=21&id=162\n Interestingly enough, that sites states this:\n \"The \"answer\" is fluid, in that it has been changing throughout history, because any answer about when human life begins is deeply integrated with the beliefs, values and social constructs of the community or individual that drew the conclusion. Throughout history there have been several \"answers\" to the question of when human life begins, but the only consistency among the answers is that they are always changing as social contexts change, religious morals fluctuate, or new knowledge about the process of embryo development is obtained.\"\n \n So that doesn't exactly show that your claim is true, does it now. Perhaps you need a less absolutist claim here.\n \n \nSo then one claims that if we dont know it is a human you should still protect the womens \"rights\".\nHmm, I hope that the mixing of terminology was accidental and not a deliberate deception. Being \"human\" is a species designation. \"A human\" is the description of an individual. The embryo or fetus are not individuals, and as such that claim is false.\n \n \n Well One thing this country is based on is equal rights for ALL. Keep that in mind.\nExcept for the time when slaves, women or whoever didn't have such rights. Minor detail to you, but important to a lot of people.\n \n \nSo we don't know when a person is.\nThat claim is false. We know the \"when\" is at birth. Roe vs. Wade and some of the Amendments to the US Constitution shows this clearly, that persons are born and that the unborn are not persons. SO we **DO** know that the \"when\" of personhood is birth, your evasions none withstanding.\n \n \nWe have to know when a person begins so we are sure we are not killing others.\nAnd that's at birth, so there is no problem here and certainly no problem with abortions.\n \n \nIf you don't know then I could say anyone is not a person based on say...their color of skin. Since we have to define personhoob it would be in the best interest to default it at the earliest safest time until we know otherwise.\nIt already is defined. And if you want it as early as possible, then the sperm are persons and masturbation is murder. After all, what if you claim they are not, and you are wrong?\n \n See <snicker< how silly your argument gets?\n \n \nIf not, then you have a chance that you are killing someone which goes against the very basis of this country (that all are created equal). Ok, so it is a person,\nNo it isn't. Your postulation in the face of facts doesn't make you right.\n \n \n \nI still think the mother should be able to do what she wants with her own property aka body.\nWell, isn't that gracious of you, particularly given that you insist on that same right yourself. I am sure you refuse to have your bodily resources used against your will, even to sustain another person's life, right?\n \n Because otherwise, you agree to mandatory giving blood and to have your extra kidney surgically removed against your will and given to a person dying from kidney failure. Until you do so, you certainly don't have any right to say that the woman should give of HER body against her will (unless you want to come across as extremely hypocritical).\n \n \n This statement is false if you go by all men are created equal. If the unborn is a person\nBut they are not. Your speculation to this is directly disproved by facts in legal rulings and in the US Constitution. Yes, you can elaborate on your fantasy \"what-if,\" but that doesn't change reality, that your fantasy is not real.\n \n \nthey have the exact same rights as anyone else. Being attached to someone else does not change this (such as conjoined twins). So she can do what she wants to her own body as long as it does not violate the other persons rights. I don't believe a mother has special rights just because she is pregnant.\nSo you are saying that preservation of bodily resources are not allowed if they are needed to keep another person alive. Hmm, you just agreed to mandatory kidney extraction. Please present at your local hospital tomorrow morning to have your kidney removed, so a life can be saved.\n \n \nAs for the donating blood thing. Our country is set up to prevent people from violating each others rights...No where does the government have a responsibility is force one to help someone else.\nAH, but you just said that the woman can be forced to help the fetus. Were you lying? OR is this some hypocritical \"I want to force her, but I sure don't want to be subject to that myself\" kind of evasion? That last statement about what our country is set up for, that completely contradicts every argument you have made against abortion.",

   "Powers for the Supreme Court\n \n Section 1 - Judicial powers\n \n The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office\n\n \n Correct. Article III is the only place that it mentions the creation of the Supreme Court. It does not spell out it's powers or responsiblities, only that the entire judiciary shall be vested in that one Court.\n \n \n\n the scenario you gave is a little bit different...The concept of Judicial Review is what determines this....in your case....unreasonable search and seizure amendment clearly applies. This is a far cry from taking something in the constitution that is applied to say...slavery....and using it for something else. Big difference in acting on what something says and what you think something could mean.\n\n \n Isn't judiciary review what we're talking about? The concept of judges striking down laws that Congress makes. \n \n It is part of the larger picture. The judges look at the Constitution and decide how it applies to the case. They looked at the Constitution, as it is written, and decided what the intent was and applied it to abortion. The intent was about freedom.",

Are we desensitized to the killings in Iraq because of abortion? Are we desensitized to serial killers because of abortion? Such outrageous claims need to be backed up... where is your evidence?\n \n You cannot lay all of the world's evil at the doorstep of abortion. Unwanted pregnancies and abortions are a symptom of problems in society, not the cause.\n \n \n\n Abortion should not be a way of life, as it has become the sanctioned genocide of our own people.\n\n \n How is it a way of life? Again, you are using emotionally charged words with no basis. There is no genocide happening; we are far from being wiped out.\n \n \n\n Pro-choice advocates cite the right for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby. However, that choice ceased upon the union of the sperm and egg, a baby was formed, and that baby has the right to live.\n\n \n But it hasn't. Abortion is legal, so the choice remains. Even if abortion is illegal, many women would kill the fetus if their situations were bad enough. All you would prevent is the woman being under the care of a physician in a clinical, safe setting.\n \n \n\n There are many methods available to avoid pregnancy and abortion is not one of those methods, it does not fall under the category of contraceptives.\n\n \n Absolutely right. Abortion is not a contraceptive.\n \n \n\n The act of abortion is an act of violence committed on the most defenseless of our society.\n\n \n No, I'm sorry but a fetus has no place in society, and I cannot forsee how it possibly could be. Until it is separate from the mother, it has no place and should have no place.\n \n \n\n Polls conducted have found that the majority of women who had abortions feared that a child would interfere with responsibilities such as school, work or other responsibilities. Some said that they couldn't afford a child. This reveals that not only are abortions criminal but most of result because the mother is too selfish to promote the life she created.\n\n \n You have made a rather strange logical jump here. How in the world does that reveal that abortions are criminal? Being selfish is no crime. You are right that it is selfish to think of oneself first; in fact I believe that those are selfish reasons (generally anyway, however they can be selfless reasons such as the desire to care for existing children). However, a woman has a right to be selfish, to want to do things for herself. She can choose to be selfless, and the gov't should not have the power to force her to be selfless (for would forced selflessness really be selfless?).\n \n If you have nothing but emotionally charged words to make your argument, then you have no argument.",

You are also under the impression that a woman can put a fetus up for adoption and it will no longer be under her care. A born child won't necessarily be \"provided for one way or another\" but a born child certainly has the ability to be taken care of by others, while a fetus cannot.\n \n You are trying to compare very different situations, that of a born child and of a fetus.\n \n \n\n You blatantly ignored the fact that he was arguing from a particular angle of the issue rather than the issue as a whole.

This does not give her the justification to destroy the childs life. This is making the assumption that the child deserves to die because of the wrong actions that someone took.

If your parents had chosen to abort you, you would not be here to debate this issue. How then can you believe that it is right?\n\n \n I believe it is right to not force women to continue their pregnancies. If my mother had aborted me I would not be around to argue, this is true. However, I still would never want my mother to be forced to continue a pregnancy and bear a child against her will and without her consent.\n \n \n\n Two people make the decision to have a child. If one fails to take responsibility then the other must. They should have thought about that before deciding they were responsible enough to accept the consequences of any given situation that might occur from having sex protected or not.\n\n \n Perhaps they should have thought of the possible consequences. I do believe that is irresponsible to ignore possible consequences to your actions. However, pregnancy and motherhood should not be used as a punishment for irresponsible behavior. That is more immoral than any abortion.\n \n There is no law stating that one must accept any consequence of your action if you can change it. Lets take an analogy. You come home drunk, open the door and stumble upstairs into bed. However, you left your front door ajar; more, you left your keys in your door! A criminal wandering by sees this and just walks inside your house. Suddenly, in your drunken stupor you wake to the noise of him stealing your stuff and call the police, do the police on the other end say \"you were irresponsible for drinking and leaving your keys in your door. You must accept the consequences of your actions. We will not help\"?\n \n \n\n Again, there is always the option of adoption so abortion is completely uncalled for in every case. \n\n \n Adoption is a parenting choice, not a pregnancy choice. A fetus cannot be put up for adoption.\n \n \n\n I know you'll probably retaliate with something concerning third world countries which don't have welfare and such things. Well personally i believe that everyone has a purpose and if these children are getting slaughtered before their purposes are fulfilled how is development ever to take place in such countries.\n\n \n Perhaps their purpose is to be aborted. How are you to know, or to judge?\n \n \n\n We have such luxiouries in the West. We have enough to provide support for these children, and educate them so they can learn to support themselves. I think the problems in the world are stemming from our own selfishness.\n\n \n Perhaps, perhaps not. Tell me, is the gov't forcing selflessness really being selfless?\n \n \n\n Abortion is completely unnecessary, but the only way to open peoples eyes to that is to offer them support and other ways out of the situation they have got themselves in.

Until women get the support (financial and otherwise) they need, however, abortion should remain a choice. Once they get that support, I doubt abortion would be much of an issue.",

I am safe, and now have my tubes tied, but if I were ever to become pregnant by rape, or were facing a pregnancy that was a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it in a heartbeat. \n\n \n I've already said what I thought of abortions as a result of rape above. I think that in the cases where it might affect the mother's health that she often has to accept the consequences of her actions. She decided not to use protection, not the child. The question that always comes up is; 'Whose life is more important?' I think that it is for God to decide who lives and who dies and not people, and that the pregnancy should go on and not be aborted.\n \n \nWhy are you ambiguous in the first sentence.

Only men can walk away from a pregnancy. \n\n \n That's a pretty narrow minded view. What about the father's rights to let the child live? You seem to think you want equality, but in actual fact you're not taking into account that some men do want to live up to their responsibility. Women quite clearly walk away from pregnancy all the time by having abortions, which the father has no say in.\n \n \n \nIt's necesary.

Financially able?\n\n \n Spoken like a person who has no clue what a pregnancy entails.\n \n A TV - even the most expensive one will cost but a few hundred dollars.\n \n Medical care for a pregnancy costs thousands. Food, rent, clothes, utilities, etc. are on-going expenses that cost tens of thousands of dollars a year (meaning she needs a livlihood).\n \n Now that's just the pregnancy. You want a run down on the cost of kid - food, housing, medical care, day care, etc? I have owned several TVs in my life, and I am single mother. I know which costs more.\n \n \nYes. I don't think that the woman has the will to do whatever she wants with her life. I think she should be forced into doing some things against her will. Especially if her own selfish will to do something affects the will of another human.\n \n \n Thank you for stating plainly that lifers are all about controling women.\n \n And you might want to rephrase that first sentence - for this woman has the will to do what she wants in her life - and does.\n \n \nYes, she gets to destroy life because her own has been destroyed by someone else? That's a very immature and selfish view to take.\n\n \n Women are people. They have jobs, families, medical conditions, plans, dreams, things that have worked hard to acheive, children to support, all sorts of stuff going on. Their lives and bodies are not up for grabs just because they are biologically capable of getting pregnant. \n \n Pregnancies are hugely impactful. It's not like storing a bike in your garage for nine months. It changes your body and your physical and mental health. It costs MONEY. It demands changes to your lifestyle. When I was pregnant with my son, I had to stop working at five months. As the SOLE support for my son now, stopping work for half a year is absolutely out of the question, I would end the pregnancy before letting either he or I come to harm.\n \n There are children out there who need a kidney to live. I can't DEMAND you give them one against your will. Why should you be able to demand it of a pregnant woman - ESPECIALLY when she did not consent to the pregnancy?\n \n \nAnd I suppose you see it as right to do precisely that to an unborn child all because they can't defend themselves by speaking up as the woman can?\n\n \n Nope. I am pretty sure I explained quite clearly why I am pro-choice. If you aren't going to bother to read what I say, don't debate me.\n \n \nI have nothing against you making decisions about what to do with your own body, but I don't think anyone should stand by while you make a decision to end the life of an unborn child.\n\n \n No you don't - or you would understand that a rape victim has the right to retain her bodily autonomy.\n \n \nConcerning children conceived of rape, I think it's wrong for the mother to suddenly feel she has the right to kill the unborn child. Sure, she went through a tough experience but that doesn't give her the right to put the child through a worse experience.\n\n \n This is so insulting. Can you possibly hate women more? It's childish and selfish to not give up everything in her life for a year to a violent crime? You think women are all just sitting around being taken care of and waiting to be pregnant? No circumstance in their life is ever valid? Do you even know any women?\n \n \nI've already said what I thought of abortions as a result of rape above. I think that in the cases where it might affect the mother's health that she often has to accept the consequences of her actions. She decided not to use protection, not the child. The question that always comes up is; 'Whose life is more important?' I think that it is for God to decide who lives and who dies and not people, and that the pregnancy should go on and not be aborted.\n\n \n Well - when you say a life threatening pregnancy should go on regardless - YOU are playing God - with a total stranger's life.\n \n Your plan would leave my son an orphan (as well as the new baby should it survive).\n \n \nThat's a pretty narrow minded view. What about the father's rights to let the child live? You seem to think you want equality, but in actual fact you're not taking into account that some men do want to live up to their responsibility. Women quite clearly walk away from pregnancy all the time by having abortions, which the father has no say in.\n\n \n What are you blathering on about? This started with your responding to a comment I made about dead beat dads. I pointed out the number of them - to which you said that if one parent fails then the other must step up to the plate and I simply asked to speak a little more honestly and clearly. \"If Dad bails Mom must step up.\" Face it, you hold woman much mroe accountable to children than men.\n \n \nIt's unnecessary. 1. Not necessary: not essential, needed, or required .You've made quite a few statements there but not extended it by using points to back it up.\n\n \n Your as willing to dismiss the lives of women as you seem to think women who choose abortion are to dismiss the lives of the fetuses they abort. You are equally guilty - unless women's lives just aren't that important to you. Time to fess up - one way or another.",

   "jitobear...since you bring up the rape and other extreme cases, do you only support abortion in these few cases?\n\n \n That is what I would like to see it come to. But I will fight hard seeing that happen via the demonizing of women facing unplanned pregnancy and the complete disregard of their circumstances.\n \n We need to to find ways to address the things that lead to unwanted pregnancy. We need to help women find ways to deal with the circumstances they face once pregnant. \n \n We need to teach our girls that the world does not revolve around men. Girls are bred to make men their focus from day one. Now there is nothing wrong with having a good relationship or marriage with a man, but it needs to be balanced out with her own needs and desires. How many young women hear \"when are going to settle down\" rather than \"how is your career going\"? How often I have been labeled unsuccessful as a person simply because I am single. I tell people I am divorced and the automatic assumption is \"what did you do to make him leave?\" (I do love answering this tho - I threw his sorry XXX out and filed for divorce - HA!). Anyway - my point is, if we train women to make men their focus - it will lead to sex and all that goes with that.\n \n And we also need to make men more accountable. Child support barely touches it. So many don't pay. And when they do it's based on their income rather than the child's needs - leaving the custodial parent (usually mom) figuring out how to make ends meet. And can we teach them to value women more? We do not hold men's reputations as accountable to promiscuity as we do women's. Women are whores, men are studs.\n \n All these things and more play a part.\n \n And we will never, ever fix this and really reduce abortion, until lifers understand that woman can make choices for themselves. And that sometimes a pregnancy will need to end. If you can't get to the point where you understand that sometimes the woman does come first, women will never be able to be empowered to make the right choices.",

But otherwise, that is an irrelevant, as laws of the US certainly are not allowed to be made on the foundation of Biblical interpretation (Which you already know as you have read the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution).\n \n \nThat's a pretty narrow-minded view. What about the father's rights to let the child live?\nAgain, there is no child. That aside, unless you want to force him to control her body, enslaving her.

Yet this is exactly what you wish to legislate for women, that they must provide the life-support system for another.

   "There is no desire to execute anyone. The desire is to remove the fetus from the woman's care. You can indeed remove that infant from your care in a myriad of ways. You cannot compare the case of an infant and a fetus in this sense.\n\n My comparison was not between a fetus/infant, it was between a paralyzed infant/paralyzed adult. Jitobear said the government should not intervene in personal family affairs. But I disagree with the view that a parent/sibling/child can justafiably kill someone they deem an \"inconvience\" or undue \"burden\" on them.

This issue is not like social security where you could say \"You technically do not have any right to the money so the gov't can take it away\". You cannot say \"You technically have no right to your own body so the gov't can use it or have it used as it sees fit\" (well you can say it but it would show you to be fascist even more so than your pro-life philosophy currently does).\n\n Name calling is unbecoming of you...

You obviously can be forced to serve in the military via a draft (wait, only men can be forced to do this...seems a bit unfair don't you agree?).

If the fetus is considered a person, it has the constitutional right to life that must be protected. Justice Blackmun wrote, \"If [the] suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.\" The Supreme Court obviously believes that if the fetus is proved to be a person, it has a right to life guaranteed by the Constitution.

   "No, it is not. Reading it again still clearly shows you are attempting to draw a comparison between a born infant and a fetus. There is little reason to make the comparison with an infant in the way you suggest, especially in an abortion debate.\n\n No Sigma, I was not drawing a comparison between the infant and the fetus. I never said the word fetus or unborn or any other word that would apply to a fetus. But if you read it that way, I must not have been clear. So please allow me to clarify what I said.\n \n Jitobear was asked this question\n \nAnd how about this: If you were paralyzed and couldn't defend yourself in anyway, and were an inconvenience to your family, would you want them to kill you?\n \n She responded with\n \nPossibly. I sure as hell know I don't want any any fundies or half-wit politicians meddling with whatever my family deciedes (i.e., Terry Schiavo)\n\n I was trying to say that the government has full right to step in in the case of the defenseless paralyzed adult human person. Even if such a person was a tremendous burden on their family, drew tremendous resources and finances from them, they still cannot kill this person. Hence we have laws preventing them from doing so. Thus, what I was trying to say to Jitobear was that you cannot determine what quality of life a person must attain to in order to have its life protected (notice I did not make the claim that a fetus is a person, thus this claim did not apply to a fetus).\n \n Then I gave another example that I hoped would strengthen my point: the one day old infant who was born paralyzed. I said:\n \nSuppose an infant was born paralyzed from the first day it was born. This will obviously place a tremendous burden on its parents, but that fact alone does not give the parents, family, government, etc. the right to decide it should be executed. If undo burden on society was the standard, the social security debate would be solved immediately...we would simply get rid of it. Then, if the elderly are unable to sustain themselves, they would be executed because to keep them alive is to place an undo burden upon society. As soon as one starts determining the \"quality of life\" one person must attain to in order to be considered a person worthy of being protected, he/she has become a bigot.\n\n In essence I was simply making the claim that a paralyzed adult or infant has the same moral standing as you or I, and thus the government must protect its rights in the same manner it protects yours or mine, i.e., it must protect it from being killed. If the one's inherent worth is outweighed by a \"burden\" it places on someone, then it would be permissable for the social security problem to be solved in the way I described. I sure hope this clarifies what I was saying to Jitobear. If not, I'll give it another go.\n \n \nIt isn't \"the right to do whatever one wants with ones body\" it's the desire to not have others do things to your body. Even in the military, you would not be forced to donate your organs against your will and without your consent, nor would you be forced to attach yourself to any other to support their life (as far as I know).\n\n I will assume that pregnancy constitutes a forced donation of one's organs against their will and without their consent. The U.S. Military, however, regulates abortions on military bases in the following manner:\n \n(a) Restriction on Use of Funds.- Funds available to the Department of Defense may not be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\n (b) Restriction on Use of Facilities.- No medical treatment facility or other facility of the Department of Defense may be used to perform an abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. \n\n Suppose a military servicewoman desires to have an abortion, but the only medical facility in which she could obtain one was in a military hospital. But, barring the cases of mother endangerment, rape, or incest, she would not be able to get an abortion. Here we see a clear example that a woman would be forced by the military (via U.S. Federal Law) to do that which you say she cannot be forced to do: \"donate [her] organs against [her] will [seeing how she desires an abortion] and without her consent.\"\n \n \nI don't believe the 14th amendment can apply in that way. Since there is no \"right to abortion\", only a freedom from governmental intervention, this cannot revoke that right. The Federal Gov't cannot restrict it without a Constitutional amendment.\n\n I was speaking of a Constitutional Amendment as part of a \"due proces\" process. Thus, I think we agree on this.\n \n \nI disagree with them. If it were considered a 'person' it would muddy the legal waters, but I never would believe anyone should have the right to live attached to another against their will and without their consent.\n\n I know you disagree with them, but I was simply pointing out that the Supreme Court unanimously disagrees with your position here. I know you don't care, I just thought it would be a point of interest.\n \n \nIntellectually it's just a disagreement. In reality the pro-life philosophy would ruin real lives.\n\n I don't agree here either.\n \n \nWell, that's a relief. Now, if you would abandon this way of opressing women, we can actually work to making abortions rare.\n\n What do you mean by \"abandon this way of opressing women?\" I don't understand what you are trying to say.",
