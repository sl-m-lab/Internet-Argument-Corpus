   "A story yesterday caught my attention regarding abortions of convenience. In China, many expectant mothers have been aborting pregnancies if they learned they were to have a girl. They wanted boys because they were more likely to earn they own living or be able to help with the family farm.\n \n The Chinese government had previously encouraged this. Now they have too many boys and not enough girls. The government is now encouraging the rearing of girls and is waiving the cost of their education.\n \n My question is, why would anybody in their right mind want to mess with Mother Nature?\n \n IIRC, throughout history, there have been more boys than girls born in a lot of countries. This came about naturally, some say as Nature's way of replacing the warriors.",

   "This is a modern incarnation of an ancient bias. There are a plethora of examples from history of why and where sons have been favoured over daughters. Perhaps the difference here is a state that (until not too long ago) had a period where strict limits were enforced on the number of offspring a person was allowed to have, making it quite an issue if you had a child of the opposite gender to the favoured one.",

   "My question is, why would anybody in their right mind want to mess with Mother Nature?\n \n IIRC, throughout history, there have been more boys than girls born in a lot of countries. This came about naturally, some say as Nature's way of replacing the warriors.\n\n \n First of all (unfortunately) humanity is all about messing with 'mother nature'.\n \n We develop technology that saves lives of those with terrible genetic diseases but then we end up allowing them to survive long enough to pass on their genes. We try to solve this problem by proposed genetic engineering but again the technology will only end up biting us in the arse in the future when 'evil' people get their hands on it and abuse it.\n \n Anyway, going back to the topic I once read an article that implied that after major periods of hardship women are on average more likely to produce females than they are males (to increase numbers) but during periods of plenty more males are developed to generate more competition to install the genetic strength of the future generation.\n \n Similar gender miss-balance may soon to effect the west given say another 100 years IMO. This time however more females will be produced (and survive). The reason for this is that recent research has shown that chemicals in cosmetics and deodorants, and pesticides in our food cause damage to male infants in the womb causing them to suffer many serious genetic problems including under-developed testes and penises.\n \n The unnatural chemicals in our diet and environment are already responsible for lowering the sperm count in many men and hence making them infertile. I could go onto point out that the western world/culture is becoming more female centred (many more tertiary sector 'service' jobs) and even how things like teaching methods in schools are biased to how females learn at the expense of males (national UK statistics speak for themselves).\n \n Finally with the advent of financially independent single mothers, increasing access to child care, and genetic engineering giving access to 'designer babies' I'm sure sooner or later we'll be seeing a big increase in the female population.\n \n [This is all from my perspective as an individuals living in the UK and most of my points refer to the environment of the UK but I'm tempted to apply it to the rest of the western modern world.]",
