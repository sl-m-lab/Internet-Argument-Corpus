However, when asked about \"heathen\" peoples who had never heard of Jesus's teachings, he said that if they never got the chance to reject the teachings, they went to heaven. This, of course, means that by spreading the word, he could only have lowered the number of \"heathens\" who would go to heaven, even though he claimed his main goal was sending more people to heaven...\n Others insist that God's creation is so obvious that people should find their way to the correct religion, and those who don't pay the \"ultimate price.\"\n \n Another response to the original question of this thread would be to quote a radio show host; it may be from infidelguy, but I'm not sure: \"You know what the worst part about being an atheist is?

   "(From Jonathan Edward's famous sermon, \"Sinners in the hands of an angry God\"):\n \n 7. It is no security to wicked men for one moment, that there are no visible means of death at hand. It is no security to a natural man, that he is now in health, and that he does not see which way he should now immediately go out of the world by any accident, and that there is no visible danger in any respect in his circumstances. The manifold and continual experience of the world in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the sharpest sight cannot discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is nothing to make it appear that God had need to be at the expense of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence, to destroy any wicked man, at any moment. All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God's hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.\n \n 8. Natural men's prudence and care to preserve their own lives, or the care of others to preserve them, do not secure them a moment. To this, divine providence and universal experience do also bear testimony. There is this clear evidence that men's own wisdom is no security to them from death; that if it were otherwise we should see some difference between the wise and politic men of the world, and others, with regard to their liableness to early and unexpected death: but how is it in fact? Eccles. ii. 16. \"How dieth the wise man? even as the fool.\"\n \n 9. All wicked men's pains and contrivance which they use to escape hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked men, do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it; he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself, and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order matters so for himself as not to fail.\n \n But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of those who heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because they were not as wise as those who are now alive: it was not because they did not lay out matters as well for themselves to secure their own escape. If we could speak with them, and inquire of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when they used to hear about hell ever to be the subjects of that misery: we doubtless, should hear one and another reply, \"No, I never intended to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; I thought I should contrive well for myself: I thought my scheme good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came upon me unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that manner; it came as a thief: Death outwitted me: God's wrath was too quick for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness! I was flattering myself, and pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and when I was saying, Peace and safety, then suddenly destruction came upon me.",

Look at the whole picture. You are attempting to reduce Christianity (and perhaps theism in general) to fear alone. You do this with a few Bible verses and some uncanny psychic powers (perhaps I should call you Dionne). I, on the other hand acknowledge that fear is a part of belief, assert that it is a minor part for most, and propose that there are many other reasons/motivations/aspects of belief.

That has been the Catholic picture from the beginning. That's why Christianity cannot be narrowed to \"bible alone\" theology. Tradition and the Teaching Authority of the Church must be included. That's why the Church is too joyful to be Puritan and too holy to be hedonist. The church is both physical and spiritual. It is both human and divine. It understands the natural and the supernatural. It is patriarchal but has the utmost respect and protection for women. It defends those still in the womb and those comatose in their death bed. It denounces the extremes of capitalism and the extremes of socialism/communism, putting the family first. It embraces the virtue of poverty while accepting the gift of material blessing. It respects the past without being archaic. It embraces the present without being a fad, or fashion, or \"child of the age.\" It looks to the future with calm--not prophesying doomsday end times while teaching to prepare for the end. And I could go on and on with example after example.\n \n The problem with most heresies and erroneous teachings in religion are that they fixate on one solitary issue or theme. The Catholic Church, however, is balanced in all things as I wrote above. To quote saint Paul, it is \"all things to all men\" as was he. That's why the Church is not a local or national one, its a universal one. \n \n You have the same problem as a heretic. You are too narrow and limited in your thinking. You try to reduce religion as do heretics. You think you are free yet you are bound. You seek to be modern and enlightened by destroying the past. But you are too modern. And tomorrow your modernity will be different than today. \n \n If you wish to know about Christian fear then I will tell you what Christian fear is. It is a fear that prompted Father Max Kolbe to sacrifice his life in place of another in Auschwitz. It is a fear that allowed Saint Thomas More to defy a king and give him his head while saying, \"The King's good servant and God's first.\" It is a fear that moved St. Francis to give up all his material possessions and then dance with unbridled enthusiasm and joy. Again my examples of this saintly fear could go on and on. Men and women of poverty, chastity and obedience who are not in misery but overflowing with joy.\n \n What is this fear?",

   "billsco...i'm going to have to disagree with you in regards to the fear aspect of religion. Yes, the bible says fear many times, and this word is uttered from God himself, but fear as you interpret it is not the fear God is talking about. I don't how much you know about the bible but i'm going to bring up some examples where some people openly argued with God and were not punished for it. Moses showed no fear when he spoke with God, Elijah the same, Samuel as a boy betrayed no fear when God called him as a child, Abraham spoke to God constantly and there was no fear radiating from him, and there are more but I want to get to the main point. Even though these people showed no fear in the sense that they were afraid of God, God still blessed them and used them to further His will. If these men did not fear God and yet God still blessed them then it can be seen that christianity is not based on fear. But the fear that is talked about in the bible is a word that means respect and reverance. The Lord does not want us to worship him out of fear for our lives but out of love. when you resoect someone you have a tnedency to listen to what that person has to say. It is no different with God. By respecting Him we are inclined to listen to Him. Now the children of isreal had it pretty tough. They were God's chosen people so they had the early burden of being an example to the rest of the world. Other nations looked at them to see what made them so different then they, and any mess up on the Israelites side would cause other nathions to cease thinking that God was anything special and continue on their current lives that were dominated by corruption and sin. The Israelites had just come out of Egypt where the way of thinking was contrary to that of God, thus their beliefs and moral systems were not where i was supposed to be. Without rules and guidlines the Israelites would wander back to the Egyptian way of things and would set a bad example to the rest of the world. God also needed to enforce these rules so that the Israelites would know that God was serious. Unfortunately the israelites began to associate God with vengeance, and so they feared Him. They worshipped God because they wanted to stay alive. But in the midst of these perception there were people who understood the true nature of God and as a result they did not fear Him but they respected Him and loved Him.

But that's okay, we'll wade into it, dig our mining pan into the river bed, sluice and shake the extraneous silt and sand away to reveal any glimmering bits which we can examine and save. \n \n \n Is Christianity the religion of fear or do you label any theism with this trait? \n\n \n I would hope that in our attempt to focus on the big picture that my assertion of fear being a prime motivator would be understood to mean much more than the upstart religion of Christianity. It is merely the last in the line of a long train of religions which has successfully instilled fear in its adherents, for the purpose of controlling its subjects. (I know next to nothing about the Eastern mystical religions however, and what exactly they are angling at will happily remain a mystery to me.)\n \n We have both agreed that fear is present in people who are religious, with Christianity being no exception. We may differ on the percentage; I would say well over 95% of its practitioners, while you may suggest somewhat less. Nevertheless, we are in agreement, so this may be a good time to examine why fear is present in any quantity, focusing on Christianity.\n \n IMO, the muddled message of salvation has much to do with it. We can never be sure if what we do or what we think is what is required. Too many cooks have spoiled the soup. Add to it the eternal nature of the punishment if the correct requirements have not been met and some truly bizarre behavior will ensue. Sir Thomas More will offer his extended neck, while St Francis will give his home and his clothes away and dance the jig, obviously naked. These types of behaviors should not be admired nor emulated; they should be exposed for what they are: examples of abject fear. Both these men would require intervention with social services today.\n \n \n\n ...Christianity cannot be narrowed to \"bible alone\" theology. Tradition and the Teaching Authority of the Church must be included. \n\n \n What is this passion for the past, and the need to capitalize phrases that don't need capitalization? If one thing is clear it is how our knowledge of the natural world has increased, along with a concomitant understanding of how deluded our ancestors were. Yet you want to hitch your wagon to musty obsolescence, to assign some special wisdom to the ignorant people of the past, and cap it of with this statement:\n \n \n\n But you are too modern. And tomorrow your modernity will be different than today. \n\n \n It's called progress, and I would hope to be able to change with the times, to not become too irrelevant. The proper position to be looking is forward. I can only think of one reason why anyone would not embrace the future: fear.",

   "as i already mentioned the Isralites had it tough with the punishments and as a result they began to fear that God would kill them if they did not follow the rules. in a sense it was true that God would severely reprimand those who did not follow His laws and commandments, but it is funny that the smoting of God's people began after the Israelites left Egypt. God did not destroy His people before Egypt, and they were held to the same standard as the Israelites. now there is a reason that the message of \"fear\" was not given to other nations. those nations had already seperated themselves from God and had given themselves over to idolatry. they would not understand God and what He was all about. thus the Israelites had to take up the charge sounded by their fore fathers and make a stand for God. but the Israelites were at a disadvantage. they had experiened idol worship in Egypt where the human can invent an image and worship it. the children of Israel forgot what a real God was and when they found Him again they had to adjust from the mindset of the world. now why did many of the other nations fall? they had all heard of the power of the real God because of Egypt and yet they chose to follow in the ways of man. the conciously rejected God and allied themselves with Satan. that was their choice and they had no intentions of changing their minds.emoticon_xgood",

   "We now return you to our regularly scheduled program after this advertisement from the one true Church...\n \n Leave it to you maximus to attempt to turn any legitimate discussion into a sales pitch for your favorite brand of religion. But that's okay, we'll wade into it, dig our mining pan into the river bed, sluice and shake the extraneous silt and sand away to reveal any glimmering bits which we can examine and save. \n\n Billsco,\n I have no need to advertise. We have the best-selling book on the planet.\n \n \nI would hope that in our attempt to focus on the big picture that my assertion of fear being a prime motivator would be understood to mean much more than the upstart religion of Christianity. It is merely the last in the line of a long train of religions which has successfully instilled fear in its adherents, for the purpose of controlling its subjects. (I know next to nothing about the Eastern mystical religions however, and what exactly they are angling at will happily remain a mystery to me.)\n \n We have both agreed that fear is present in people who are religious, with Christianity being no exception. We may differ on the percentage; I would say well over 95% of its practitioners, while you may suggest somewhat less. Nevertheless, we are in agreement, so this may be a good time to examine why fear is present in any quantity, focusing on Christianity.\n \n IMO, the muddled message of salvation has much to do with it. We can never be sure if what we do or what we think is what is required. Too many cooks have spoiled the soup. Add to it the eternal nature of the punishment if the correct requirements have not been met and some truly bizarre behavior will ensue. \n\n Is this based on some type of sociological or anthropological evidence or mere conjecture and opinion? There is a common thread running through most men dating back through history, probably even to the \"caveman.\" It is a common thread of honoring the dead and acknowledging a creator. Perhaps this common thread is only just common sense. Common sense that even the caveman possessed. \n \n Fear can be paralyzing and fear can be useful. If fear is of the paralyzing sort it is bad--\"Do not fear, only believe.\" Mark 5:36 (some translations say \"Fear is useless, what is needed is trust.\") The Christian view of fear looks at it as both good and bad. Compare the fear of God in some sorts to that fear of poisonous snakes, fear of walking in front of a speeding car, etc. There is a legitimate fear we all have to preserve our own life. So too, with fear of God. It leads us to the good things and steers us away from the bad things. It, hopefully, leads us further down the Christian walk to a love and respect of God. Remember the example of parental fear and love again. \n \n \nSir Thomas More will offer his extended neck, while St Francis will give his home and his clothes away and dance the jig, obviously naked. These types of behaviors should not be admired nor emulated; they should be exposed for what they are: examples of abject fear. Both these men would require intervention with social services today.\n\n I seriously doubt that you believe either Sir Thomas More or St. Francis lacked courage. You just like to argue. Do you believe in standing up for your ideals?...what about to the point of death or to the point of relinquishing all material goods? Would you have the fortitude? I'm not sure if I would. \n \n Saint Thomas More was in his right mind when maintaining his faith in the face of death, and a great mind it was. Have you seen Thomas More's resume? Collaborator with and friend of Erasmus, Speaker of the House of Commons, high steward for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, writer, lawyer, Lord Chancellor of England--a position of power second only to the king...seems like his bizarre behavior might have shown up at some point in his life and stifled his achievements. Let us put your head under an axe and see what your definition of fear becomes then. \n \n As for St. Francis, I am not sure why the dancing of a naked jig would not be admired. I am furthermore absolutely certain that the dancing of a naked jig would be a joyful dance and not a fearful one. It would have something to do with that joy and peace I spoke of in some posts earlier. \n \n \nWhat is this passion for the past, and the need to capitalize phrases that don't need capitalization? If one thing is clear it is how our knowledge of the natural world has increased, along with a concomitant understanding of how deluded our ancestors were. Yet you want to hitch your wagon to musty obsolescence, to assign some special wisdom to the ignorant people of the past, and cap it of with this statement:\n\n \"Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around.\" - G.K. Chesterton in Orthodoxy, 1908\n \n \nIt's called progress, and I would hope to be able to change with the times, to not become too irrelevant. The proper position to be looking is forward. I can only think of one reason why anyone would not embrace the future: fear\n\n I said nothing of not embracing the future. I have no problem with that. Of course, to your disappointment the Catholic Church will be a part of the future. I do have a problem with nihilism and an outright hostility to the past and those who have gone before us. Come on, be open-minded.\n \n But what of progress? If you are constantly changing by what standard do you measure your progress? If you wish to destroy the past then what is your standard? How will you measure improvement if you have no standard or the standard itself constantly changes? For progress to mean something a standard is implied. This is what I meant when I wrote, \"But you are too modern. And tomorrow your modernity will be different than today.\"",
