The thing is, water always has impurities, and it is these impurities that can conduct electricity.",

Although water autodissociates to \n 10^-7 M H+ and 10^-7 M OH-, this is much too low an ionic concentration to produce significant conductivity. Tap water and swimming pool water of course contain plenty of dissolved ions, so they'll conduct electricity.",
