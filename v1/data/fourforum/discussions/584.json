   "Maybe a point to this is that heaven is impossible?\n (Ultimate happiness or satisfaction with ones wants)\n \n\n \n \n This might work better on the Philosophy forum, but here goes...\n \n It seems logically impossible for Heaven to exist as we know it, because supposedly by definition we achieve ultimate happiness for ourselves. So what if two people's happinesses conflict? Or what if our happiness conflicts with God? (For example, the only way Billy Bob will be happy at all is if he gets to inherit the throne of the kingdom of heaven. Or even better, the only way Billy Bob will be happy is if he gets to drink tea with Satan every Sunday afternoon.)\n \n So then there's the response: Well, once you get to heaven, what you want will automatically coincide with what God wants for you. But isn't this in violation of the gift of free will? What's the point if God will determine what we want anyway?\n \n The problem is that all of this is pure logic. And logic as we know it is a very earthly thing. God, on the other hand, is infinite in every aspect. Even if it's completely flawless, who's to say that once we get to Heaven, the logic we know of won't work anymore, and suddenly all these conflicts will be easily fixed in a way that seems so simple and obvious with God in Heaven, but that we could never imagine on Earth?\n \n Logic is finite, and therefore it can't hope to contain the infinite. So can we really ever prove anything about heaven or hell with our logic, assuming that on Earth we're only physically able to see the barest tip of a vast, incomprehensible cosmic iceberg?\n \n Wow, I love the phrase \"cosmic iceberg\".\n \n Anyway, I know that's a very convenient explanation, but it's really not supposed to be an explanation at all.

   "\n And that \"Logic is finite and God is flawless\" is utter XXXX. If something isn't logical, there isn't a bloody point to think about it.\n\n \n Easy there, Tex. I'm only bringing up another possibility that is consistent with the Judeo-Christian view of God.\n \n The idea is that you're never at full intellectual capacity. There are some concepts that you could explain in the clearest terms to a 10-year-old, and he just will not understand. Because he can't. You could prove it to him, but it won't make any difference because he won't understand the proof. Doesn't it make sense to suggest that, since humans are imperfect, there could be a completely rational explanation for any theological conflict that we as humans simply cannot understand?\n \n The question about conflicts in heaven is in the same ballpark as the \"Can God create a rock too heavy for him to lift?\" riddle. It seems to be jumping to conclusions to say that either question is proof that He doesn't exist. It's a conflict, but it's doubtful that humans have the ability to imagine the entire realm of logic that may be needed to solve that conflict.",

We see things on a time scale. Heaven has no time. There is no reletive happiness as has been the presupisition. We wil be happy because we are doing that which make us happy, worship. We will not have the undying question of, \"What shall I do today\", \"What will make me happy today\". This line of thought is extremly earthly. This idea is not that of Christ.
