Can the school tell you what you can or can't say on public school grounds?\n\n \n Well than phrase it that way. Don't ask if it's illegal to be rude.\n \n And the answer to your question is yes, of course. All of our rights have some restrictions. If a school needs to put a limit on hateful speech in order to have an environment condusive to learning, than that's what they have to do. Of course, they should allow as much freedom of speech as possible, since exposure to different ideas is crucial for learning. But if all someone is doing is being rude or hateful, particualarly if their behavior is interfering with someone's ability to get the education they paid for, than I don't see a problem with telling them to knock it off. Based on that one snippet that we've seen it sounds like the school probably made the right call.

   "1) The actions stated in the article HAVE NOTHING to do with \"being Christian\". Being Christian doesn't mean that you go around pointing fingers at sinners. (At least in looking at the actual bible, although some modern Christians are obviously in disagreement.)\n I'm curious if she sends similar letters to the science department regarding evolution, any divorced persons on campus, or local non-Christian religious organizations which would be violating the \"First commandment\"?\n Or is it just the gays she wants to pick on?\n \n 2) I think the \"free speech\" aspect needs to be balanced with the ACTUAL PURPOSE of the college in the first place. If the \"free speech\" is disrupting the learning environment of others, then she better prepare herself to be censored.\n \n 3) With that said, I think there is some \"middle ground\" which should be reachable here. She's made her comment to the \"gay\" club, as stupid and non-religious as it was. Anything further could be approaching or stepping into the ground of \"harassment\", but that would be for a judge to decide where those boundaries lie. \n I'm not up on \"harassment\" laws...\n \n Here's one definition of the term... If the state in question includes \"sexual orientation\" on certain lists, it would be an easier case to prove. Considering it's Georgia, I doubt it... But the University in question might have it on their appropriate lists...\n \n harassment:\n n. the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group, including threats and demands. The purposes may vary, including racial prejudice, personal malice, an attempt to force someone to quit a job or grant sexual favors, apply illegal pressure to collect a bill or merely gain sadistic pleasure from making someone anxious or fearful. Such activities may be the basis for a lawsuit if due to discrimination based on race or sex, a violation on the statutory limitations on collection agencies, involve revenge by an ex-spouse, or be shown to be a form of blackmail (\"I'll stop bothering you if you'll go to bed with me\"). The victim may file a petition for a \"stay away\" (restraining) order, intended to prevent contact by the offensive party. A systematic pattern of harassment by an employee against another worker may subject the employer to a lawsuit for failure to protect the worker.\n http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=853&bold=||||\n \n 3.5) Maybe each gay student she harasses should just get a restraining order against her...\n \n 4) I find some dark irony in this situation.\n On one hand, we have this Christian woman who can't stop being insulting to gays, so she's removed from campus.\n On the other hand, we have examples of gays who are harassed so much that they drop out of school.\n \n Anybody see a connection here? Possibly a reason to the madness?\n Or are some anti-gay people just too damn bigotted to have \"Christian love\" for anything but their own exaggerated sense of piety...\n \n Reminds me of a quote:\n Christians aren't perfect...\n They just demand that you be...",
