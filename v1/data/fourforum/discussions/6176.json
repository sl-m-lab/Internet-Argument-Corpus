   "I found this comentary some of you may find it interesting.\n \n http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid18752.asp\n \n \n \n Literal interpretation \n A quick study of the Bible reveals the hypocrisy of conservative Christians, who claim to follow the good book word for word \n \n By Charles Hammer\n \n An Advocate.com exclusive posted, July 12, 2005\n \n \n \n \n \n Reprinted from The Tulsa World, Sunday, April 10, 2005. \n \n Where do conservatives get the moral values that won George W. Bush his second term, except from the Holy Bible? \n \n Yet, strangely, in political argument they seldom name the good book as the fountainhead of their ethics. Nor do they quote Genesis in their struggle to introduce creationism to science classrooms of my home state, Kansas. They rarely cite scripture in their condemnation of homosexuals. And no wonder it&#8217;s hard for them, since obedience to Biblical commands would bring agonizing death&#8212;not just to homosexuals&#8212;but to a good 90% of the adult U.S. population. \n \n This derives from what conservative Christians call their &#8220;inerrant&#8221; Holy Bible, which they say they interpret literally. They offer the appealing certainties of a moral guide dictated word for word by God. This is the major attraction that wins new members and political power. By contrast, conservatives argue, Christian mainstream faiths pick and choose among scriptures and offer an interpreted Bible full of moral relativism. \n \n &#8220;That&#8217;s how conservatives won the battle,&#8221; explains David O. Moore, an ordained Southern Baptist minister in Liberty, Mo., who suffered during the 20-year siege that conservative Christians call the Battle of the Bible. &#8220;The average Joe working in the shop, the housewife washing the dishes, they have no formal training in the Bible. They believe the Bible, and so do I. But when a preacher mentions that there are errors&#8212;geographical, numerical&#8212;it really upsets the people in the pews. They want to trust the Bible.&#8221; \n \n This battle has imposed profound change at the ballot box, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Congress, and state legislatures and public schools. It fuels the president&#8217;s push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage and his opposition to fetal stem-cell research. The nation is fortunate that despite their political power, conservatives are&#8212;yes&#8212;too compassionate actually to obey their inerrant Bible. Hating the sin of homosexuality but loving the sinner, they ignore the action clause of Leviticus 20:13: &#8220;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&#8221; \n \n Concerning heterosexuals, conservatives read Mark 10:11, which states that &#8220;whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another commiteth adultery against her.&#8221; But they are too humane to obey Leviticus 20:10: &#8220;And the man that commiteth adultery with another man&#8217;s wife...the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.&#8221; If Christians obeyed, zealots would slaughter&#8212;based on this verse alone&#8212;half the adult U.S. population, all of the remarried and their spouses. \n \n Conservative Christians also struggle against God&#8217;s order, passed down through Moses in Leviticus 20:9, which reads: &#8220;For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: He has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.&#8221; These conservatives are too kind to kill such children, nor would they&#8212;unlike the witch-burners of Salem, Mass., in 1692, obey Leviticus 20:27: &#8220;A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones.&#8221; \n \n Conservatives ignore Deuteronomy 22:21, which dictates the fate of the bride whose parents cannot bring forth the cloth that would serve as a token of her virginity: &#8220;Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father&#8217;s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die...so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.&#8221; \n \n The Bible also condemns to death many different classes of sinners, including &#8220;he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord&#8221; (Leviticus 24: 10&#8211;16) and &#8220;whosoever doeth work&#8221; on the Sabbath (Exodus 35:2). \n \n Today&#8217;s conservatives disregard Leviticus 25, which commands that we buy bondmen and bondmaids of the heathen around us and of strangers that sojourn in our land. \n \n &#8220;And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen forever.&#8221; \n \n Moore, 84 and a retired professor of religion at William Jewell College in Liberty, nearly lost his job in 1979 because he would not argue for a personal devil. How does he deal with such harsh Biblical commands? \n \n &#8220;I say to you, I can&#8217;t be a worshipper of that God,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The Bible is a history of the unfolding understanding of the Jews in Israel. It&#8217;s a secular social history which displays their growing understanding of God&#8217;s will. They did those things and wrote those things as if God commanded them to do it. But the whole Bible is God&#8217;s revelation of Himself in Jesus Christ for the salvation of sinners.&#8221; \n \n This view of scripture is widespread among mainstream Christians. They focus more on Jesus&#8217; teaching: that the first and great commandment is to love God, and the second to love our neighbors. That only he who is without sin should cast the first stone. That God loves the poor, and it&#8217;s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. \n \n Mainstream Christians argue that the Genesis creation story is a metaphor expressing an ancient people&#8217;s best understanding of their world. Here there&#8217;s an odd convergence, because some conservatives also have decided the world&#8217;s creation in six days is hard to swallow. They abandon Genesis for a mere &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; theory, battling to get it taught as science in public schools. \n \n Conservatives do not explain why&#8212;defying Biblical commands&#8212;they refuse to stone wizards, homosexuals, and nonvirgin brides. Instead, they justify today&#8217;s more humane ethics by speaking of the &#8220;Old Covenant&#8221; and the &#8220;New Covenant,&#8221; the supposed harsh Biblical law before Jesus and the gentler era after. As if the enduring, eternal God had reinvented himself and his laws between the Old Testament and the New. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, however, the Bible contains no article specifying how it can be amended. With conservatives it also comes down to the same picking and choosing among scriptures, the same dreaded interpretation they decry in mainstream Christianity. They choose to absolve Sabbath-breakers, blasphemers, remarried &#8220;adulterers,&#8221; and nonvirgin brides&#8212;but not homosexuals, who are condemned if not to death at least to damnation. \n \n And even the New Covenant makes problems for conservatives. Nowadays they must deal gingerly with dictates of the New Testament&#8217;s First Timothy, in which the Apostle Paul says he will &#8220;suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.&#8221; That is because, Paul adds, &#8220;Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the transgression.&#8221; \n \n In his Epistle to the Ephesians, Paul advocates submission to slave masters. In his Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 1, he condemns many offenders, including homosexuals, &#8220;whisperers, back-biters, haters of good, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents...covenant-breakers.&#8221; Compassionate conservatives ignore verse 32, which speaks of &#8220;the judgement of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death.&#8221; \n \n This is the inerrant Bible from which conservatives pick and choose the moral values that won the 2004 election. Not that they tricked the electorate&#8212;most conservatives are sincere. They just instinctively sense how to win: Imply that your values come from the Bible, but don&#8217;t point readers in that direction. \n \n Because if voters actually studied the good book, they might discover their own quite different set of values. \n \n \n \n \n Charles Hammer was born and reared on Tulsa&#8217;s west side. He graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1956. He is a former reporter for The Kansas City Star and taught journalism for 20 years at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. His Southern Baptist upbringing and a lifelong love of the Bible impelled him to write this article.",

   "Educating Matthew and his screwball liberal friends\n \n Quote: Hating the sin of homosexuality but loving the sinner, they ignore the action clause of Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\"  \n \n Horse dung. You're confusing Testaments. In the New Testament, and apart from the state (Romans 13), God is the one who puts people to death (Acts 5:1-10, etc.). \n \n QUOTE: Concerning heterosexuals, conservatives read Mark 10:11, which states that \"whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another commiteth adultery against her.\" But they are too humane to obey Leviticus 20:10: \"And the man that commiteth adultery with another man's wife...the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\" If Christians obeyed, zealots would slaughter-based on this verse alone-half the adult U.S. population, all of the remarried and their spouses.  \n \n Again, you confuse Old Testament / New Testament.

In his Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 1, he condemns many offenders, including homosexuals, \"whisperers, back-biters, haters of good, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents...covenant-breakers.\" Compassionate conservatives ignore verse 32, which speaks of \"the judgement of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death.\"  \n \n I'm a conservative and I don't ignore Romans 1:32, and I don't know anyone who does, apart from the milk-toast crowd.\n \n QUOTE: Because if voters actually studied the good book, they might discover their own quite different set of values.  \n \n That whole introduction was just one abortion after another. You really need to study up on these issues more.\n \n And it's quite obvious you're still trying to justify the abomination of illicit, gay sex sin there, Matthew. You can try to spin all these issues your way, but God isn't mocked. Gay sex is STILL a sin (Lev. 18:22; 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, I Cor. 6:9-10, etc.).",

   "Wow, gay sex is STILL a sin - even all the way in Leviticus? Who's confusing the old testament and new?\n\n \n Not me. Need a New Testament Scripture against gay sex? Go read Romans 1:26-27.\n \n \nIf the old testament is no longer in force, why do you so often quote Leviticus? \n\n \n Now follow real close, preppy. Matthew quoted: \"Hating the sin of homosexuality but loving the sinner, they ignore the action clause  of Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\"\n \n So, it's not the sin that's in question / issue in Matthew's argument, it's the punishment for the sin. And nowhere in the New Testament, under the New Covenant, does God or man or Apostle instruct anyone to kill someone for their sins. Ok so far? \n \n Next, unlike Old Testament dietary and Levitical Priesthood laws, God's moral laws have never passed away. Is adultery a sin in the Old Testament / Leviticus? Yes. Is it a sin in the New Testament? Yes (I Cor. 6:9-10, etc.). So that's one. Gay sex is another sin in both Testaments (Lev. 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26-27; I Cor. 6:9-10). And so on and so forth. Are you starting to get the drift on God's MORAL LAWS?? \n \n \nHave you actually read the bible?\n\n \n Many times, sweetpea. I even received a formal education in Biblical Studies. And you? How many times have you read completely through the Bible and what level of formal education in Biblical Studies do you have?",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider\n but Christianity has no equal when it comes to the facts and divine truth\n\n \n I'm sorry but I just don't get this. \n \n How can the bible be the definitive, verbatim word of God? First up, the Old Testament, written between two and three thousand years ago. All documents of this age have changed countless times by a combination of two reasons: one, simply the amount of time they have been around, and two, the fact that the originals would have been handed to the next generation as part of an oral tradition, before it was written down. Combine an oral tradition with a long period of time, and you get many changes.\n Additionally, the old testament is essentially a history book, telling the story of the ancient peoples of Israel. These stories have undoubtedly been romanticised and elaborated no less than other ancient documents such as the Greek and Roman myths.\n Finally, mixed up in all this history are a catalogue of allegorical morality tales, which may or may not bear any resemblance to anything that actually took place.\n The New Testament is equally dubious. For example, what do the many gospels which did not make it into the modern bible (ie the Apocrypha) say? We do not know because they are holed up in the vatican. What was changed in the translations from Hebrew to Latin, Latin to English? We do not know. This goes for the OT as well.\n To address the quote directly, what makes you so sure that Christianity is so right and other religions are wrong? Is there no value to the Koran, the Hindu Vedas, Buddhist scripture and in fact any other writing of a similar age, which also are made up of metaphor-laden history and moral-defining allegories?\n Historical records (ones with a great many souces) also point to the fact that the bible is not special or particularly true (ie all-encompassing, above all other texts). \n The ancient Jews, I have recently learned, were polytheistic before about 600BC, and the OT is older than this. Also it is common knowledge among historians that the only reason Christianity is a world religion is because the Emperor Constantine in about 300AD decided he wanted to do away with Roman polytheism. His wife happened to have met some of the few cultists in Israel who still carried on preaching about Jesus after 300 years, and that was that. If his wife had met some other monotheistic cult, no one today would know the name of Jesus. There would still be a NT, just not exactly the one we have today.\n My point is that I cannot see the reason why anyone believes in any of these old books. Even if I believed in a higher power, I would not join any of the dominant religions because they are based on nothing but romanticised history and allegorical morality tales which have been changed a great deal over the course of time, and often for political reasons.\n How can you fly in the face of logic and take the bible literally, word for word? It does not make sense to adhere to a moral code which suited a past society several thousand years ago. That code (I obviously do not mean the major points, like murder and theft etc) has no relevance to us.\n While there is plenty of evidence for a lot of the historical events depicted in the various holy texts, there is never any evidence for the miraculous aspects and certainly no evidence for God. This is why I see them simply as old, often metaphorical, histories. The best example is the 10 plagues of Egypt, which can easily be attributed to one of the most violent volcanic eruptions of the last 10,000 years, at Thera in the mediterranean.\n [QUOTE]Originally Posted by EasyriderListen, just because you have an immoral, screwball moral outlook on life is no reason the rest of America has to suffer with it. Fact is you have no objective basis for your pagan beliefs, so they're worthless as far as I'm concerned.[QUOTE]\n Substitute the word 'pagan' for 'christian', or in fact just 'religious' and you have a statement which goes through my mind every day.",

All documents of this age have changed countless times by a combination of two reasons: one, simply the amount of time they have been around, and two, the fact that the originals would have been handed to the next generation as part of an oral tradition, before it was written down. Combine an oral tradition with a long period of time, and you get many changes.\n\n \n I think you greatly exaggerate all this. They found the Isaiah Scroll in the Dead Sea Scrolls and, except for some insignificant copyist errors or spelling errors that don't even significantly change 1 story or doctrine, it's essentially the same as what we read today. \n \n \nAdditionally, the old testament is essentially a history book, telling the story of the ancient peoples of Israel. These stories have undoubtedly been romanticised and elaborated no less than other ancient documents such as the Greek and Roman myths. Finally, mixed up in all this history are a catalogue of allegorical morality tales, which may or may not bear any resemblance to anything that actually took place.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nThe New Testament is equally dubious.....\n\n \n I don't think so. Please give me your best example (1 example only for now please) of where the New Testament is wrong? Please cite the pertinent scriptures and provide your evidence. \n \n \nThe ancient Jews, I have recently learned, were polytheistic before about 600BC, and the OT is older than this.\n \n \n Some Jews were and some weren't. There's nothing in the Bible that endorses polytheism. Other so-called \"gods\" are mentioned but the Scriptures are quite clear that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the only true God. \n \n \nAlso it is common knowledge among historians that the only reason Christianity is a world religion is because the Emperor Constantine in about 300AD decided he wanted to do away with Roman polytheism. His wife happened to have met some of the few cultists in Israel who still carried on preaching about Jesus after 300 years, and that was that. If his wife had met some other monotheistic cult, no one today would know the name of Jesus. There would still be a NT, just not exactly the one we have today.\n\n \n The Council of Nicea met to endorse ALREADY EXISTING CHRISTIAN TRUTHS and also met to denounce a number of scurrilous pagan doctrines that people had tried to mix in with Christianity. The point is that no new truths or doctrines were \"invented\" at the time of Constantine. They already existed.\n \n \nHow can you fly in the face of logic and take the bible literally, word for word? It does not make sense to adhere to a moral code which suited a past society several thousand years ago. That code (I obviously do not mean the major points, like murder and theft etc) has no relevance to us.\n\n \n God's moral laws have never changed. Adultery is still wrong, as are abortion (Psalm 139:13), bribery, continual drunkenness, etc., etc.\n \n \nWhile there is plenty of evidence for a lot of the historical events depicted in the various holy texts, there is never any evidence for the miraculous aspects and certainly no evidence for God.\n\n \n Wrong. I'll post you some evidence in my next post.",

   "THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n  \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n \n \n REFERENCE\n \n McDowell, Josh. Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Vol. 1). Thomas Nelson\n Publishers. Nashville. 1972.\n \n There's your miracle, Luminus. Foretold in advance, even, and verified by non-Biblical sources.

Save this sermon for those who thinks it does and please make an attempt to actually respond to what I post.\n \n \nNope, but you'll sure question other people's religious beliefs like you just did.\n \n \n I am not questioning your beliefs at all. I have no doubt in my mind that you think gays, me, and everyone with purple hair is going to hell. On top of that I think it is your perogative to believe that and preach about it in a loud voice on the roof of your house. I quite frankly have no beef with what you believe. You can believe your tennies are going to eat your toes. Not my problem\n \n My ONLY issue with you is your attempts to impose your faith on others. Really. That's it. Believe what you will. \n \n \nWussy. First defend your own and then you will have some credibility in questioning someone else's.\n\n \n When I question your beliefs, I will defend mine. I don't care what you believe. I am simply working to defend my and everyone's right in the USA to not have Christianity imposed upon them.\n \n \nWhen you decide to come out of the closet and tell us who your so-called \"god\" is and where it lives, etc., you will start to gain credibility around here for being knowledgeable and fair minded. It's not enough to constantly bark like a junkyard dog at other people's religions - if you want to run with the big dogs you have to be able to document your own beliefs.\n \n \n Honey - I don'e have to do anything except stay white and die and I don't care if you and your imaginary friends find me credible. However, you need to provide some credible evidence that you have the right to blow off the constitution and impose the rules of your faith on anyone else. It would also be nice if you could provide proof from within the context of your religion that your are supposed to do that. \n \n By the way, I am still waiting for you to tell me who \"we\", \"us\", and 'everyone\" are. Throwing words like that around is a HUGE assumption. Speak for yourself. Or can't you square it off with me without an imaginary army that you get to speak for? \n \n \nWhich you are unable to do.\n\n \n Unwilling.",
