No. Did he end the costly and ineffective drug prohibition? No. These three things could've extraordinarily improved the quality of life of people both here and abroad and helped balance our budget. They could've finally given back to the people some of the liberties they deserve. And yet Obama did none of the above during his time in office.",

The GOP claimed that the Bush Tax cuts and increased corporate Welfare would create and environment where JOBS would be created, It didn't work. Obama agreed to an extension of the BUSH tax cuts while the GOP/Teabag Association held virtual gun to his head.. The Tax cuts Created nothing but more wealth for the Corporate buddies of Politicians.. Bachman is a whacked out teabagger who has no clue , even worse than Sara Palin, which I didn't think Possible. So of course the Blacks and Hispanics will again vote for Obama, as will a large percentage of the White community.",

   "Originally Posted by Xcaliber View Post\n It is not the Governments Duty to Create Jobs.Quote:\n \n Well it's not. Like I said above the Government Creates an Environment for Businesses to Create Jobs. But actually creating Jobs is not the Governments responsibility. \n \n Originally Posted by Xcaliber 2 months ago View Post\n Invest in bringing America to current levels of technology while creating jobs\n Quote:\n \n By this I meant that by investing in New technology businesses would create new jobs to upgrade the existing technology. The Governments only role would be to invest to create a Job creating Environment.\n \n Originally Posted by Xcaliber 2 months ago View Post\n we need to SPEND more on infrastructure to get the Nation back to creating jobs.Quote:\n \n Same as above.. Again the Government is not ACTUALLY creating Jobs.\n \n Originally Posted by Xcaliber 4 months ago View Post\n The Targeted Cuts proposed by the GOP will... create more unemployment..\n \n Well this is true. The Government doesn't create jobs but by initiating bad economic policies they can cause businesses to lay off, go out of business, thus creating higher unemployment. \n \n \nThe only consistency I see in your worldview is that you tow whatever line minimises negative associated with the democrats and plays them up when it comes to republicans.\n\n \n Exactly how is anything you quoted above minimalistic concerning my association with the Democratic party. Every quote with the exception of the last one was about the Government creating a stable economic environment where Jobs will be created in the Private sector. \n \n \n\n When republicans propose spending cuts, you oppose them because they will cost jobs, and the government should be investing, to create jobs. When Obama fails to improve employment rates, that's ok, since the government shouldn't be trying to create jobs anyway..\n\n \n Again, you should really stop taking what I say and adding your own meaning to it. And I never said Obamas failure to create such an environment was ok,\n \n \n\n It wouldn't hurt to have an honest discussion instead of some partisan talking point and a rant about \"teabaggers\"\n\n \n No it wouldn't, but then again it's not so easy to have a \" honest\" discussion when politics are concerned.",

Creating jobs, and creating an environment where jobs will be created are two different things. \n The Government SHOULD BE investing, To create an environment so that Jobs can be created.
