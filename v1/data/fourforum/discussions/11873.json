   "Saakashvili scares western investors by his movements against South Ossetia and hostile rhetoric concerning Abkhazia!\n \n Georgia president Saakashvili can't refuse from his county militarization and draw his attention at economy. The unrestrained wish to restore Georgian territorial integrity forces Georgia nation to live on the threshold of poverty. All funds are spent for Georgian Army needs. And this can't add the assurance to investors that Georgian economy will be able to develop under present regime. Dictator Saakashvili is trying to prove to the world with all his might that he uses financial asserts to the purpose of Georgian economy recovering but his steps and populist announcements prove the opposite! As a result of it no one of western investors will never run risks to put up money to Georgia! Nothing will change for the better under Saakashvili!",
