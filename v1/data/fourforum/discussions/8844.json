   "Well I have a few questions about monkey evolution and the people who study it...I'm just a novice monkey-bone investigator, so I thought maybe somebody could help me out here. \n ---------------------------------------------\n \n My first question is this: Is it true, despite being portrayed as the high priests of society -- when compared to other scientists such as chemists or physicists -- that paleoanthropologists (monkey scientists) are secretly the laughing stock of the scientific community? \n \n This may seem like a strange question, but I have read that these chimp-lovin' scientists are actually quite the story-tellers -- and that they have to rely more on free-wheeling imagination than on real, hard evidence. And this is because they never get to see the evidence first-hand. Thus, they are not able to speak with true scientific authority. Is this correct? Do other scientists laugh at them or discount their testimonies as non-scientific fairytale? Are monkey scientists good guessers?\n \n And is it correct that the quality of the so-called \"evidence\" is so slim that these guys have to resort blindfolded predjudice and raw emotions when interpreting homind fossils? And is it true that monkey scientists hardly ever get to handle real evidence?...that you have to work with cheap, Walmart-quality casts that are better suited for 5 and 6 year olds playing in a sandbox? Is it true that when monkey extraordinaire, Niles Eldredge asked to view Homo Erectus fossils that he was even denied? If so, then why is it that the only people who get to view and/or comment on these new finds are the the monkey geniuses who found them? Why must Homo Erectus fossils be shrouded in mystery? Are these guys like dad-gum King Tut?\n \n \n And why is it that unknown monkey scientists are constantly looking for fame and fortune? Why do they make up stuff to get on CNN? Why do they announce sensational and overblown claims for questionable bone fragments or teeth? Are all monkey scientists looking for the cheap thrill of becoming an overnight success? - regardless if these fragments hold water?\n \n Next...\n \n Do you guys believe that humans were descended from African apes? If so, why do you think Jeffrey Schwartz, professor of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, claims instead that we are more closely related to the orangutan? He states that of the 26 unique traits that humans share with hominids, we share all 26 with the orangutan and only 9 with the chimp and gorilla. (ie..teeth, menstrual cycle etc). Schwarts insists that the data shows that humans are not descended from african apes at all.\n \n Also, would you guys tell me the story of the origins of the chimpanzee and the gorilla? Where or what are the transitional forms leading up to modern apes? (gorillas...chimps...orangutans). And also where are the transitional forms leading up to the australopithecines? Why would Lawrence Martin from Nature say this?:\n \n Modern apes, for instance, seem to have sprung out of nowhere. They have no yesterday, no fossil record. And the true origin of modern humans - of upright, naked, tool-making, big-brained beings - is, if we are to be honest with ourselves, an equally mysterious matter.\n \n So where exactly are all the fossils from hominids in Africa from 4 to 14 million years ago? Is it true that the bug-picking, kunckle-dragging African apes have no fossil record? Is it true that many ancient apes have no known living counterparts? And do guys you agree with this quote from Niles Eldredge from The Myths of Human Evolution?: \n \n The details of the earliest evolution of the human line are still very vague, and as we shall see later, the time at which the human line branced off from that leading to our closest relatives, the African apes, is still shrouded in obscurity.....But it is now well known that it happened 3 million to 4 million years ago....pg. 7 (Is this time line correct?) when is the correct story going to finally be told?\n \n And also...please tell me about the origins of New World Monkeys. Were they ever anything other than monkeys? Where are their ancestors? What did these creatures look like?\n \n And where are the fossils leading from posimians (the earliest primates) and their New World monkey ancestors?....or even to Old World monkey ancestors? Can you point me to these? What about the transitional from monkey-like creatures to ape-like creatures? Can you lead me to these transitions?\n \n A.S Romer in Vertebrate Paleontology\n \n Our knowledge of the fossil history of these higher apes and of presumed human ancestors on this level is tantalizingly poor. Some have imagined that the ancestors of the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan may be found among species of Dryopithecus, fossil apes found in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Just why this is so seems to be rather obscure, to say the least.\n \n So basically -- here's how I see it: First, you guys don't know where humans came from. You also don't know where chimps came from. You also don't know where gorillas came from. You also don't know where orangutans came from. There are also no links between. Finally, how do you know that apes didn't descend from humans? Has anyone ever thought of that? I mean if you can't find any ancestors, then who's to know?\n \n And just as a side note.......do you guys find it curious that whenever a Creationist like myself screams in disbelief that we were descended from a monkey, that you evolutionists quickly correct us and say that we evolved from a \"common ancestor\".....yet, logic tells us that this so-called \"common ancestor\" most certainly looked like a monkey? Why do you guys play this mind game?? Do you think you're kidding anyone? And also...where is this mysterious creature?\n __________________\n As a Darwinian, I wish to defend Goldschmidt's postulate that macroevolution is not simply microevolution extrapolated, and that major structural transitions can occur rapidly without a smooth series of intermediate stages. . .

   "It seems that you have been reduced to insult. It is no longer necessary to respond to your flatulence since you seem to realize how it smells. If you had anything worthy of consideration to say, then you would present it in a clear and concise manner, without the need for disparaging references.\n \n It also makes you look confused when you begin by insulting paleoanthropologists and then glide into insults of Niles Eldredge, who is not a paleoanthropologist. How do you expect to make a point when your presentation is so confused? Moreover, why do you think it is necessary to refer to one of your betters as a \"monkey?\" Did that make a point worthy of debate?\n \n Grow up!",
