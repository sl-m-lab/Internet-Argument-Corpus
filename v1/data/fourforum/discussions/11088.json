   "Long but worthwhile read by a Todd Spivak on Barack Obama's rise through Illinois politics. Puts his legislative accomplishments in perspective (a la Kingmaker Emil Jones), with an opening and concluding temper tantrum scene, now putting all three candidates on par there re entitlement issues. Is that still surprising for anyone re anyone aspiring to the American presidency? \n \n http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-02-28/news/barack-obama-screamed-at-me/full#comments\n \n I imagine the Obama campaign is in the process of discrediting this writer.",
