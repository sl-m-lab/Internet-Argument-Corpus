Any freethinking person, whether socialist or conservative, will come to the conclusion that the current system of megacorporations benefitting from government largesse is the worst we can have.\n \n I myself am a capitalist and a conservative, but when I look at the corporatism that's running rampant I just shudder. The system we have today has nothing to do with capitalism or free markets and it only serves the ultra wealthy who get special benefits from the government.\n Take for example the current subprime meltdown. So a lot of stupid rich people invested their money poorly and now the central banks (Fed, ECB etc.) have to bail them out? How stupid is that? If they invested in the wrong things they should lose their money, period. That's how capitalism works. No more billion dollar bailouts financed by the public, that has to stop.\n If you or I invested our money poorly we don't get our money back from the government, so why should they?\n \n It always makes me laugh when people talk about democracy and freedom of choice because frankly we don't have it.

Of course they no longer subsidize Canadian Lumber and we Americans pay much higher prices than we would if our Government had just protected that Industry from foriegn competition in the first place.\n \n It must also be noted that at the time that the Canadian Government was doing this market manipulation by artificially absorbing the extra cost Canadian Companies spent in order to compete with the more efficient American Companies, this whole subsidizing scheme was exposed by the American Manufacturers, fought in Courts and disallowed by our own Government which claimed it was just part of the free enterprise system game. This is just one example of how many foriegn Industries have been allowed to come into the US and steal jobs with the help of Government subsidies while our Government did nothing to protect the American worker or the American Industry itself.\n \n You would think that Anti-trust laws would protect us from these monetary foriegn invasions but this aspect of the internationalization of the lumber industry is a prime example of what has happened in most every, if not evey Major Industry on Earth today.",

Now we have neither a social contract nor state support nor powerful trade unions to protect working people.\n\n \n This is complete bunk, at least regarding Reagan. Under Reagans watch the American middle class leaped forward by huge strides economically as did the lower echelons of the wage earning public. Prior to him, the dems had such high taxes on the lower income Americans that the economy was sluggish and even stagnent. Reagan immediately dropped all income taxes on low income wage earners, lowered them on middle income wage earners and raised them to an accross the board 35% to the higher income wage earners over 100,000 dollars a year. He cancelled the luxury tac that the dems created that prevented the wealthy from buying luxury items like boats and second homes and got the economy moving again.That created job growth and economic growth as the trickle down economics meant the wealthy spent more money and the middle class prospered tremendously from this. Jobs were created and viola, the economy was booming once again.\n \n It was under Clinton that high paying jobs were lost to foriegn Countries and Americans had to replace their one good job with 3 lousy paying ones in order to survive. I'll never forget seeing a yuppie looking guy driving a new Jaguar around town with a Domino's Pizza sign on his roof delivering pizzas. I'll also never forget when Clinton came on TV towards the end of his second term when he was closing down 40 Military Bases around the Country. He had so little respect for the American peoples intelligence that in the same speech he had the nerve to say that he was closing these bases in order to save the Government 40 billion dollars a year in overhead costs to keep them running but sadly he had to announce a tax increase to cover the cost of closing the Bases.\n \n Now tell me folks, If closing the bases is going to save us 40 billion a year then why do we need a tax increase to cover the cost of the closings ? Does that make any more sense today than it made then ? I think not.",

   "This reminds me of one of my favorite movies, Network. If you have never seen it, it is an eerily prophetic satire of television. It was written in 1974-ish. Howard Beale, the news anchor protagonist went on the air to stop a deal between the owners of the tv network he works for and some Middle East oil conglomerate. The chairman of the board, played by Ned Beatty, gives this speech. I think he won an academy award for this single scene. The brilliant writing by Paddy Chayevsky in the movie is a series of soliloquies.\n \n \n\"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it, is that clear? You think you have merely stopped a business deal - that is not the case! The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back. It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity, it is ecological balance. You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations! There are no peoples! There are no Russians! There are no Arabs! There are no Third Worlds! There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-variate, multi-national dominion of dollars! Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels! It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic, and subatomic and galactic structure of things today. And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature, and you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little twenty-one inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT and T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon - those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state - Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories and mini-max solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable by-laws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime, and our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality. One vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock, all necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused.
