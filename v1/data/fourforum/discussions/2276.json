   "I've recently developed an intrest in meteoriods, except unfortunatly I don't know anything about them. I read somewhere that they may hold bacterial spores???? Also that they may have some precurser molecules for cell membrains???? \n \n I really want to know is: What happens to them once they *land* because there are all these craters on Mars but there are no signs of the meteoriods. I'm thinking since there is little or no erosion on Mars them the meteors ought to still be there in the craters where they landed.\n \n Does anyone have an intrest in this? Can you explain this to me?",

   "Hi Dumb_Marklar,\n \n I haven't heard about the bacterial spores or the cell membrane theory. Is it suggesting meteoroids may have contained the seeds for life? \n \n My knowledge is pretty limited too, but I share an interest like you. Some scientists believe meteors were the carriers of water that has blessed our planet. It would take a mind-boggling amount of meteors to fill the oceans and streams, wouldn't it? But the early solar system was quite different. Earth was obviously bombarded quite frequently. Since we have a living planet the scars heal over time, leaving us with important minerals which we find all kinds of good uses for. And I'm sure if we were able to excavate Mars, we would find similar elements the collisions produced. \n \n Some other scientists believe that Jupiter played a large roll in allowing life to take hold on Earth. They believe a huge planet like Jupiter has helped shield this planet from the many meteors still sailing through the solar system, allowing elemental life, then species like the dinosaurs to develop and flourish over long time spans, until possibly one lucky meteor got past our big brother, changing things forever. Planets as large as Jupiter cause their nearby suns to wobble in a tell-tale fashion which we can detect. In that way we can find distant solar systems that may be good candidates for having a hospitable planet that we can one day venture to.\n \n regards",

   "Meteoroids do not reach the planet. They are vaporized in the atmosphere.\n \n Meteorites reach the surface of the planet. In a resistive atmosphere, they probably get to such a high temperature that anything living is killed.\n \n In the case of the string of comets that recently hit Jupiter, I doubt it had any appreciable effect on Jupiter. Had it hit the earth, we'd probably all be dead.\n \n Evidence of meteorites on earth suggests that a huge one hit in what is now the Gulf of Mexico and may have led to the end of the dinosaurs.",

   "I need to correct myself. I believe it's comets, not meteors, that are considered the water bearers. Also, I'm unsure about the value of minerals deposited or formed where a meteor strikes. I was thinking the heat process that occurs near ground zero would forge some pretty exotic metals, but I think that happens more naturally. I would suggest you take that byte from your memory bank and erase it or at least question it.",

   "Hi Billsco,\n \n Yeah meteoriods, meteors, comets, and asteroids. I'm not sure what the difference is. They're all space rocks to me; but I guess they come from different places and/or have different sizes.\n \n You are not so far wrong about new metals. They just discovered something new in the moon rocks they brought back all those years ago. (I wish I could change the bits in my brain).\n \n Back when the earth was formed... a lot of these things crashed into the earth and added alot of water. And possibly brought in some type of life because now they're saying that life started earlier then they thought and *grew* faster than was previously though.\n \n We will find out more about these things soon. I think it was the Brit's or could have been NASA; they sent a probe, called NEAR I think, to bring back samples from a comet. It has already taken those samples and is on the way back to earth.\n \n I have references and links for all these, if you are interested, I'll track them down. Most are from NASA (nasa.gov) at different sites they use. \n \n \n I was looking at the Mars pics and was wondering what happened to the meteoroids and wanted to know why I did not see the meteoroid just sitting there. Ice does explain alot. But i was thinking that since Mars has less atmosphere and a lower gravity so the rock part could survive better over on Mars than it would here.",

These things travel at 13,000 kajillion MPH and plow violently deep into planets, much like a bullet into wood. Atmosphere and gravity would have minor influence on the final outcome, IMO. We observe the penetration hole and a shock ring, never the meteor, I think.\n \n Thanks for the link to nasa.gov. I'm always looking for good sites. Post some more you think are good.",
