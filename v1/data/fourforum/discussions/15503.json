If greed could cause bubbles, everything would be in a bubble, all the time. \n \n In fact bubbles occur when the government distorts the economy by pumping money into it, in a way completely unaligned with consumer demand. \n \n Ron Paul knows this, and warned against the creation of a housing bubble all the way back in 2002\n \n \nby transferring the risk of a widespread mortgage default, the government increases the likelihood of a painful crash in the housing market. This is because the special privileges of Fannie, Freddie, and HLBB have distorted the housing market by allowing them to attract capital they could not attract under pure market conditions. As a result, capital is diverted from its most productive use into housing.\n \n Like all artificially-created bubbles, the boom in housing prices cannot last forever. When housing prices fall, homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out. Furthermore, the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss. These losses will be greater than they would have otherwise been had government policy not actively encouraged over-investment in housing.\n \n Perhaps the Federal Reserve can stave off the day of reckoning by purchasing GSE debt and pumping liquidity into the housing market, but this cannot hold off the inevitable drop in the housing market forever. In fact, postponing the necessary but painful market corrections will only deepen the inevitable fall. The more people invested in the market, the greater the effects across the economy when the bubble bursts.\n \n Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to act to remove taxpayer support from the housing GSEs before the bubble bursts and taxpayers are once again forced to bail out investors misled by foolish government interference in the market. I therefore hope my colleagues will stand up for American taxpayers and investors by cosponsoring the Free Housing Market Enhancement Act\n \n\n \n You have to be a real dumbass to retrospectively pin the housing bubble on \"greed\" when Ron Paul told you exactly how it would occur and what the consequences would be 6 years in advance.\n \n Paul Krugman, darling economist of the far left knew where the housing bubble was coming from - straight from Uncle Sam and the good old Federal Reserve Bank.

And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble. \n\n \n \nbusiness investment is not going to be the driving force in this recovery. It has to come from things like housing\n\n \n \nLow interest rates, which promote spending on housing and other durable goods, are the main answer. \n\n \n \nWill the Fed cut interest rates enough? Will long-term rates fall enough to get the consumer, get the housing sector there in time? We don&#8217;t know\n\n \n Everyone knows how to make a housing bubble, until the bubble bursts.

Nobody outside that 5% could afford to buy anything with their pathetic wages and everybody had become a pretty poor credit risk because 65% of their wages were going to making installment payments on goods already produced. \n \n Coolidge was trying to counter this with his taxation policies. By 1927, only the richest 2% of americans were paying any federal income taxes. This would have actually been a good policy, except that by the time he cut government spending by 50%, that was not moving enough wealth to make a difference.",

More specific intervention explains why this bubble was largely about housing, and not Technology stocks or Tulips.\n\n \n Except that there is nothing at ALL to indicate that the \"intervention\" in this case led to a housing bubble. The exact OPPOSITE is true. The GSEs...where the intervention was occurring....have seen a FAR lower rate of default than private lenders have. A FAR lower rate (like 4.5% for freddie vs 68% for countrywide). And most of the private loans that have failed carried HIGHER interest rates than similar GSE loans made at the same time. One of the things that consumer protection groups went crazy about was mortgage brokers steering people toward more expensive private sector mortgages and away from cheap GSE mortgages.\n \n This was not the result of \"cheap money\". This was the result of \"easy financing\". The geniuses on wall street figured out how to make hundreds of billions of dollars extending, repackaging, and selling mortgages that they EXPECTED to default. Not only did they make money on the origination end, we now know that most of them were making bets against the CDO paper they were creating in the derivatives market while they were promoting it as investment grade securities to their customers. \n \n This is one place where placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of greedy bankers puts you spot on. They basically figured out how to make big money on junk loans, so they did it. They did not need cheap interest rates to pull this off. They just needed gullible investors, a federal reserve that would refuse to regulate their activities even when they knew full well that the results would be disastrous, and friends in the white house and congress who would make sure that the SEC would not stand in their way. They had all 3. \n \n I think people need to actually look at the purpose and structure of the GSEs. They were essentially created to provide RESPONSIBLE and REGULATED securitization of mortgages. They essentially acted as a middle man, putting willing investors and creditworthy borrowers together. They were conceived and created to be a national mortgage clearing house. There was no bank at the time that was big enough to fulfill this function. Since then we have seen the rise of the mega banks. The mega banks are frankly a fairly new phenomenon. It has only been within the last decade or so that they have grown big enough to serve as their own mortgage clearing houses. The problem is that while the GSEs are required to do it in a RESPONSIBLE and REGULATED manner, the mega bank are just required to do it in the most profitable manner. What turned out to be most profitable was to make as many junk loans as possible and then hand off the losses to anybody they could sucker into buying them.",

It is precisely LOW interest rates that generate bubbles, the fact GSE was making available below-market-rate loans pins it as a culprit for driving the housing market higher than it would otherwise have been. \n \n The very natural of a bubble is that a market has the appearance of endless prosperity and successive buy ins take place with less and less relevance to any real value. Increasing levels of risk-taking are inherent in bubble economics, they do not mitigate its causes. \n \n The reason there is a cluster of risk taking in the bubble is because there is a delusion of rising consumer demand, created generally by the Federal Reserve, but in this case also low-rate GSE loans and guarantees.\n \n I blame the fed more than the GSEs.

If there had been no GSEs or as you suggest, the fed had regulated loans, we would simply now be talking about a biotechnology crash or a bubble in some other form.\n\n \n The GSEs rates were primarily indexed to the Feds rates. The private market rated had no such requirement, which is why we saw ARMS with rates as low as 2%. \n \n The investment side of the housing bubble was absolutely fascinating. You literally had lenders bidding competitively against each other to make loans that they knew were going to default. At the same time you had big investors snapping up these loans once they were securitized because frankly they had pretty much run out of stuff to invest in that made any kind of decent return. \n \n That is why even when the fed crashed rates it did not actually lead to improvements in the credit markets. The fed had basically lost control. It was not until the fed actually started buying assets that markets started to thaw. \n \n You say that low interest rates were the reason the bubble was formed, and tie that to government intervention, but the fact is that it was the non government loans that caused the bubble and subsequent collapse....non government loans made at interest rates that were essentially unconnected to fed rates...they were market set rates. \n \n Your contention that if the fed or SEC had stepped in to stop the stupidity on wall street would have just resulted in a bubble somewhere else is probably not far off, but that is FAR less the result of interest rates and FAR more the result of the distribution of wealth we have in this country. The reality is that for all intents and purposes the wealthy are running out of places to invest their money. The derivatives market is essentially an invented place to put your money...essentially allowing more and more parties to bet on the same investment. \n \n This was essentially a replay of the great depression. Even after things crashed and things froze up and the fed dropped interest rates to nothing, nothing happened. Consumers are tapped out. There is pretty much zero demand for expansion capital because producers are not going to expand production when consumers dont have any money left to spend anyway. \n \n I would disagree that there this bubble could have appeared anywhere but the housing market. There was simply too much liquidity in the system. No matter what interest rates were, I would argue that a real estate bubble was inevitable simply because that is the only market we have that was big enough to soak up that much liquidity.

Then again Fannie and Freddie basically owned all the \"good\" assets. \n \n I partially blame Fannie and Freddie because they were holding the line, in a way. Prior to 2004 they basically had 0 Alt-A and other crappy mortgage securities. Fannie and Freddie were both getting destroyed by the competition who would give out loans to anyone that could form an ink spot on a piece of paper. The GSEs eventually caved and their holdings of XXXX shot up to like 20% (I don't have the exact figure). Fannie and Freddie are HUGE and considered to be backed by the government so when they did it that just meant it was certified good to go by the federal government. Not to mention it created more demand for these types of securities which just jacks up their \"worth\". \n \n Fannie and Freddie should have stuck to their guns which would have caused the crisis to be a softer blow. They would have ended up looking golden had they done this. \n \n So maybe they didn't create the monster but they seem to have been the last push to drive us off the cliff.\n\n \n I am following you here, it just seems that you have to assume that the people who were giving mortgages to anybody with a pulse would NOT have been willing to generate these lower risk mortgages if fannie and freddie were not there. \n \n I have been looking closely at government mortgage programs lately because currently over 90% of mortgages are being funded either directly or indirectly by the US government. What I have found was a little surprising to me. A lot of the programs that I have seen people lambasting as reckless are actually good programs that both make sense and have proven themselves with low default rates. \n \n The \"easiest\" program I could find was the USDA rural development program. 0$ down, 103.5% LTV, can finance closing costs into the mortgage, no reserve requirements, no restrictions on gifts or sellers concessions, minimum credit score of 580, but they will go lower with mitigating factors. \n \n At first glance at the program I was outraged because the above is pretty much how I would design a mortgage to fail. Then I downloaded the underwriting handbook, and my opinion changed. Their underwriting is based heavily on debt ratios, income stability, and extenuating circumstances for bad credit history. The USDA default rate for ZERO DOWN mortgages...mortgages that the home buyer has pretty much no skin in at all for the first 5 years, is 1.7%. Compare that to 3.2% for 10% down private lender mortgages (2009 numbers).\n \n As I look at FHA loans, the same seems to be true, though on a lesser scale.",

I'm bad with analogies but its like a bunch of weak guys pushing a car off a cliff...they'll get it done but when you get 2 strong guys (Fannie and Freddie) to come in and help out it goes over that much easier and faster. How much blame can you put on the people for just doing what everyone else is doing? I don't know but it has to be more than nothing. \n \n From a government spending standpoint, the GSE's getting involved caused really big losses just because of the way they structured their securities and how they are run in general.

Hindsight tells us they were set up for disaster but I don't know if you can pin the \"setup\" on Fannie and Freddie. \n\n \n I see what you are saying, and I will certainly concede that point.\n \n I think basically what it boils down to is that it was a terrible, terrible combination. \n \n \nHaving so few control so much seems to never work out.

It dont think it is working out now at all. While they certainly have a place, the government should not be backing 90% of mortgages made. This is especially true since they have been given a new mandate to \"support\" the housing market, which basically translates to \"keep housing prices high\".\n \n The GSEs were originally conceived as a clearinghouse for mortgages. There was also supposed to be included a part that provided \"last resort\" lending, or lending for people who could not get funded through private sector lenders. Those \"last resort\" loans were to be insured by the GSEs. \n \n By the time the folks in the financial sector got through with their lobbying efforts, though, ALL the mortgages that pass through the GSEs come out the other side insured. There is no \"last resort\", they use the same credit standard for everybody and insure all the mortgages. \n \n Only about 10-15% of the mortgages that the GSEs currently have out would have qualified as \"last resort\" and been insured. The rest should have simply passed into the clearinghouse, been packaged and sold. \n \n Wall street saw a chance to create a relatively high yielding investment class where the taxpayers held all the risk and they took it. \n \n \nAnd yet we didn't let these private lenders fail? Nothing better to show something not working than making people go bankrupt. \n \n\n \n You will have to ask the special interest whores in congress about that. I agree. We should have let them fail.
