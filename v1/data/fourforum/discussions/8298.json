   "Don't you think that Mikhael Saakashvili simply ignores human rights as such within borders of his country and all other democratic norms feeling latent backing of the US? I think there is no need to list all his trespasses as there's been quite a lot written on it on various human rights forums and websites - just type <Saakashvili human rights violations< in a search engine and here you are dozens of links.\n \n Surely, Saakashvili is pretty aware that Washington has certain interests connected with Georgia owing to the would-be operation in Iran and therefore closes eyes to Saakashvili's riotous behavior. Today Saakashvili also starts discrediting Europe as he agreed to let secret CIA prisons be built in Georgia. Diplomatic and trade relations between Europe and Georgia bound the first to deal with an authoritarian state and tolerate presence of its representatives in democratic European institutions. However, nothing can be done about this. I think that if leaders of European states held cheap of the US, Georgia would long have got isolated from the rest of Europe.",
