That actually seems to constitute a large fraction of people in the US who, at least to some degree, seem to both accept various aspects of science while holding on to some aspects of Christian belief.

If your definition of faith is the belief in something without, or contrary to, evidence, then I feel faith is a very bad thing indeed and should always be avoided. \n \n\n And I already addressed the issue of trust: \n \nThis has nothing to do with trusting before all the facts are in. You must go through life with incomplete evidence and you do your best. But you learn with time which beliefs were better that others. There is where maturity and wisdom come from. That has nothing to do with faith. That has to do with experiencing that consquences of those (perhaps unfounded) beliefs. If after a time, no evidence is forthcoming or there is ample evidence to the contrary, you drop that belief. \n \n\n \n Continuing to have faith after\n \n 1. No evidence will ever be forthcoming\n 2. The whole concept doesn't make sense anyway.\n 3. The only documentation are some ancient, primitive texts who cannot be said to have been written from an unbiased point of view.\n 4. There is much evidence that refutes the assertions of the religious faith\n \n is not a wise position to adopt.\n \n This does not mean I am proposing to avoid trusting for all time. \n \n I am amazed at your responses when you are strapped for answers. Jyoshu implies I am not capable of appreciating the mysterious and wondrous. You imply I am cold and untrusting. \n \n Please provide some evidence to support your belief instead of implying that those who might require even the most rudimentary basis for belief are not as noble or sensitive as you.",

There is much evidence that refutes the assertions of the religious faith\n \n \n I can trust and forgive and commit to people and stuff just fine. I still don't believe in the supernatural.\n\n \n It is precisely to the topic. How do you know that no evidence will be forthcoming. The only way to determine if something is trustworthy is to trust it FIRST and then observe. From what you say, you are unwilling to do this with the \"supernatural\". \n \n The whole concept certainly makes sense. In as much as the universe appearing out of nothing makes sense, the idea that there is a creator makes sense.\n \n 3)I think you would be hardpressed to show the bias of the authors. What purpose would it serve? They were all living during a period where those particular beliefs would have caused their horrendous death. How would they have WANTED to mislead people and then die KNOWING that they were doing so for a lie. They died by frying, crucifixion, drawing and quartering, boiling, sawing, beheading, stoning etc. Your idea of bias makes no sense.\n \n 4) There is also much evidence that supports the assertions of religious faith. While you can certainly argue that the evidence is wrong, does not support the claims, is biased, is inaccurate, the evidence exists. I could easily argue the same claims about your evidence. Hisorically speaking there is far more documentary support for the historicity of the New Testament than there is of any other historical event more than 1000 years ago. There is also archeological evidence in both directions.\n \n From your arguments it would seem like you simply do not WANT to believe these things. Fine and dandy, I am not so certain I want to either. However, I am not willling to deny the existence of evidence on both sides and some claims on BOTH sides that don't make sense. For you to take your position and claim that one side is \"worthy\" is a matter of opinion and one that is not well supported by the evidence any more than the other side. You have made a choice of \"faith\" regardless of whether or not you believe it.
