Kind of like this...\n \nAfter learning of this quote, I am staunchly against the quote system on this forum. a wonderful idea is both completly reliable and capable of being abused.\n\n \nThe quotes hard. You still back your quote up with the original post. Ready?\n\n How's that?\n\n Here's the game...\n I'm going to say something stupid, profound, or at least a little coherant. I want the next person to quote me but change something around in the wording. All you do is go to quote and it comes up. Then you switch around the wording of the quote. Then when you go down to say something, you say something stupid, profound, or at least a little coherant. Then the next person to post will quote that and change the words around. Just remember, this is in the fun debates and ment to be fun. I don't want this thread to be used to bruteily insult any one. After all, anything you type will be turned around. And depending on who does the next post, it may be put up weird. My quote above is to explain what is going on. Only stick to quotes from this thread beyond here. Anything goes as long as it stays fun and family friendly.\n So, are we ready? Then lets let the quoting begin!!!!! :p",

I do it if it explains the gist.\n Stop doing it!\n\n Well technically, Phunting, Admin does have the ability to change the future. It's the past that can't be changed. That is until someone invents a time machine and has the ability to travel back in time. But how you change the future is based upon how you live or what you do in the present. In other words, turning left as opposed to turning right at a stop light can change a lot of possibilities. You don't see those possibilities because that would require the ability to see things 4th dimensionally. Have you ever read books that were called \"Choose Your Own Adventure?\" The book doesn't read cover to cover. It reads \"If you went through the mysterious door on your left, turn to page 76. If you rent to the door on your right, turn to page 24.\"\n Actually, I just changed the future of how this get's quoted because I changed that sentence.\n No, I don't feel it much, I don't think.

They are now called Classic Rock but at the time they would have gone under Hair Metal simular to Poison and Gun's N' Roses. They had a love ballad called \"Is This Love.\" But they are more famous for \"Here I Go Again.\" The music video features the lead singer's now exwife (I believe) dancing scantaly dressed on the hood of his car. It's a really good song also. You should go check it out.\n As far as euphemisms go, that's usually a simple word to replace a curse word.

   "I had the worst fried balls of my life in my southern fool class at school.\n I have a drunk nutcracker. That's awkward. Do I take it to a party?\n I kicked a Karaoke machine into the nutcracker. That snooty fool!\n\n What on earth were you doing eating fried balls? Fried balls of what? Are you talking about rocky mountain oysters? I hope not. A friend of mine was just talking to me about them last night, strangely enough. She was saying how much her mom loved them. She was also plotting to feed them to me secretly and then tell me what they were afterwards. Evil woman!!\n \n How is it possible to get a wooden, inanimate object drunk? I think you might be the intoxicated one in this situation.\n Yeah, bright idea, start having hallucinations and bring your nutcracker to a party. Brilliant.\n And your violent on top of everything else! Knocking a big ole Karaoke machine into that poor little nutcracker. SICKO!",

   "Plotting to feed me to an evil violent woman? It is possible. Strangely enough, her mom loved your little wooden object.\n\n \n Master_Shake, I thought I knew ye.This post makes the most eloquent argument in favor of reading the first post before jumping right in. I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on at first, What with polar bears and gentlemen kicking inanimate marionettes into juke boxes and such. I honestly do not believe this is what Al Gore had in mind when he invented the internet. Perhaps this post will end the madness as I am sure that there is no way that my reasoned thoughtful post could be construed into anything hideous, immoral, or even atonal.\n \n PS: \"I kicked a karoke machine into a nutcracker\" is the funniest damn thing I think I have ever read.",

   "I couldn't figure out why the hell Master_Shake and the inanimate Al Gore were jumping on eloquent polar bears and kicking hideous gentlemen.\n \n WHAT ATONAL MADNESS!!!\n \n \n P.S. I invented immoral arguments...and reading.\n\n You saw that?! I sure hope no one got it on video. Don't tell anyone this, but that is part of our secret plan to fight the hoax that is global warming. Yes, yes, I know, you're thinking to yourself, \"But Al Gore is out there spreading the word on global climate change and trying to fight it.\" That's just a cover. We were teaching the polar bears a lesson for telling everyone that they're stupid ice is melting and they are drowning because they can't find ice to rest on. We can't have that information getting out there. People might actually start believing that global warming XXXX.\n \n As far as kicking hideous gentlemen is concerned, it is a proven fact that ugly men are very likely to believe in glabal warming. We couldn't just stand by and let them believe it could we?\n \n Of course it's atonal. You trying jumping on polar bears and kicking people and make it sound harmonious.\n \n You were quite spot on at the beginning of your post, but you went off the deep end at the end there, Mutz. You invented immoral arguments? Participate in them frequently, maybe, but invent them? I think not. And reading too? I hope you will be starting a regiment of antipsychotics soon. Can you read that?\n \n \n \nPS: \"I kicked a karoke machine into a nutcracker\" is the funniest damn thing I think I have ever read.\n\n lol. Glad to hear it. I hope I can end up topping it emoticon_xhoho",

   "Don't tell anyone this, but I sure hope Al Gore got that on video. emoticon_xhoho I saw the polar bear spot on ugly men. You saw XXXX warming and no one is out there spreading the word \"atonal.\" I will jump on people kicking polar bears. You invented Off The Deep End. You immoral global climate! I hope you can't find ice to rest on! You Mutz.\n\n \n Someone's getting angry. I don't think E Mutz was the one who invented Off The Deep End. I think it was a parody artist by the name \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. By the way, why do ugly men have Polar Bear spots? Is it what makes them ugly? I know why no one is spreading the word \"atonal\" because it's not a common enough word. I never even heard it before I read this. I wouldn't want to go spreading a word that was never heard by me before.\n That's right, show those Polar Bear kickers who's boss. Jump on them with extreme force and prejudice. I would, if they're going around kicking poor defenseless Polar Bears, I already prejudged them anyway. I don't care if bears are the number one threat to America. You can't touch my bears! emoticon_angry \n Where was I? I'm sorry, I get side tracked when I hear or read that people are kicking the wonderful miraculous creatures that are Polar Bears.",
