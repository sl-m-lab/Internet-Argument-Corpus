   "7 Reasons to Read the Glorious Qur&#8217;an\n \n 1. Inimitable\n \n It dares you to disprove it. How? It says that humans cannot write a book like this even if they pooled all their resources together and got help also from the spirits. The Qur&#8217;an said this fourteen hundred years ago and yet no one has been able to disprove it. Billions of books have been written-but not another one like the Qur&#8217;an.\n \n 2. Incorruptible\n \n It is the only religious sacred writing that has been in circulation for such a long time and yet remains as pure as it was in the beginning. The Qur&#8217;an was kept intact. Nothing was added to it; nothing was changed in it; and nothing was taken away from it ever since its revelation was completed 1400 years ago.\n \n 3. Unsurpassable\n \n The Qur&#8217;an is God&#8217;s final revelation to humankind. God revealed the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and finally the Qur&#8217;an to Muhammad. Peace be upon Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad. No other book will come from God to surpass His final revelation.\n \n \n \n 4. Indisputable\n \n The Qur&#8217;an withstands the test of time and scrutiny. No one can dispute the truth of this book. It speaks about past history and turns out right. It speaks about the future in prophecies and it turns out right. It mentions details of physical phenomena which were not known to people at the time; yet later scientific discoveries prove that the Qur&#8217;an was right all along. Every other book needs to be revised to accord with modern knowledge. The Qur&#8217;an alone is never contradicted by a newly discovered scientific fact.\n \n 5. Your Roadmap for Life and Afterlife\n \n The Qur&#8217;an is the best guidebook on how to structure your life. No other book presents such a comprehensive system involving all aspects of human life and endeavor. The Qur&#8217;an also points out the way to secure everlasting happiness in the afterlife. It is your roadmap showing how to get to Paradise.\n \n 6. God&#8217;s Gift of Guidance\n \n God has not left you alone. You were made for a reason. God tells you why he made you, what he demands from you and what he has in store for you. If you operate a machine contrary to it&#8217;s manufacturer&#8217;s specification you will ruin that machine. What about you? Do you have an owner&#8217;s manual for yourself? The Qur&#8217;an is from your Maker. It is a gift for you to make sure you function for success, lest you fail to function.\n \n It is a healing from God. It satisfies the soul, and cleans the heart. It removes doubts and brings peace.\n \n 7. Your Calling Card to Communicate with your Lord\n \n Humans are social creatures. We love to communicate with other intelligent life. The Qur&#8217;an tells us how to communicate with the source of all intelligence and the source of all life-the One God. The Qur&#8217;an tells us who God is, by what name we should address Him, and the way in which to communicate with Him.\n \n Are these not seven sufficient reasons for reading the Qur&#8217;an?\n \n http://www.islamhouse.com/en/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=23",

   "Let's look at the Koran, how men and women fare...\n For righteous men... virgins (houris) for your pleasure\n Surah Ad-Dukhan: 44:54 \n So (it will be), and We shall marry them to Houris (female fair ones) with wide, lovely eyes. \n \n Surah At-Tur: 52:20 \n They will recline (with ease) on thrones arranged in ranks. And We shall marry them to Houris (female, fair ones) with wide lovely eyes. \n \n Surah Ar-Rahman: 55:72 \n Houris (beautiful, fair females) restrained in pavilions; \n \n Surah Al-Waqi'ah: 56:22 \n And (there will be) Houris (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes (as wives for the pious),\n \n \n \n For righteous women .... you get to stay with your husband. Even in the after-life women are discriminated against!\n \n \n But let's not just read the Koran, let's look at the Haddiths. Take Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha'\n that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\n Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, from http://www.quraan.com\n \n Then we can see the true nature of 'the Prophet' for is not the Koran written for all time? It is not an argument to suggest that his behaviour then was normative (usual) for the times.\n \n Muhammedans maintain that 'the prophet' was the best example for moral behaviour...\n \"The Lord of the universe, The Most Merciful and Compassionate sent about 124,000 prophets and messengers to every nook and corner of this earth to guide humanity towards understanding the purpose of its creation and thereby surrender to His Divine Laws and achieve its final destiny of Eternal Peace in His Paradise. The last messenger of God who brought His last revelation the Holy Quraan to humanity is Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, born in Mekkah, approximately 550 years after Jesus, son of Mary, peace and blessings of God be on them both. This is the account of this last Messenger of God, the most remarkable man, that human history has known.\"\n http://www.daar-ul-ehsaan.org/truth/must.htm\n \n \"The Prophet accomplished all this through the strength of his character and personal example;\"\n http://www.missionislam.com/youth/muhammad.htm \n Mohammedans argue that even today, he is still a role-model! Even here I can use how Mohammedans view him; you would use supposition. They even give him a special blessing each time they mention him; unique to him!\n \n So remarkable a man was he, that not only did he sleep with an under-age girl, but he also rejoiced at the killing of prisoner-of-war...\n \"The members of the last surviving Jewish tribe in Medinah, Banu Qurayzah, were even less fortunate. Muhammad offered the men conversion to Islam as an alternative to death; upon their refusal, all 900 were decapitated in front of their enslaved women and children. The women were subsequently raped; Muhammad chose as his concubine one Raihana Bint Amr, whose father and husband were both slaughtered before her eyes only hours earlier.\"\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/C...99Trifkovic.htm\n This info is itself based on Muslim sources...\n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa', the tribe of 'Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina.\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362)\n \n \n Further Muhammedan evidence of his 'acts with a child' comes from:\n (Haddith) Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n \n \n \n and \n \n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \n \n \n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\"\n \n \n and\n Hadith Bukhari 5:58:235.\n \n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammed) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" Remember, that she was only a child. He is fantasising about a little girl.",

   "Thank you for your reply montalban, first to all i would like to say that there are alot of unreputable websites that talk about Islam in a wrond way. so please try to get information from reputable sites that say the real and truth. \n \n women in Islam\n \"\n &#8220;Lo! Men who surrender unto the Lord, and women who surrender, and men who believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard (their modesty), and men who remember the Lord much and women who remember&#8212;the Lord hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward.&#8221; (33:35)\n The Lord&#8217;s own words strike to the very heart of the issue of justice for men and women, equally. Who can deny the truth, that both are equally accountable to the Lord? There are those who decry religion because it supposedly subjugates woman and denies her rights. The truth is that the firm belief in the Lord and His Message uplifts woman and protects her rights. For belief in the Lord, and a desire to please Him, will ensure just treatment of all of humanity, as well as the other creatures of the earth and the planet itself. Only when one abandons right guidance is the status of women endangered.\n \n Throughout history, women have suffered under the heavy hand of patriarchal societies that barely recognized her as a human being. She was stripped of her God-given rights, the right to her person and property, and treated as so much chattel, less valuable in many instances than a man&#8217;s horse or cattle. Silenced and subdued, she dwelt in the background of life, unable to fulfill her full potential as a beloved creature of the Lord.\n \n The Lord rescued her from this precarious existence when he revealed His Words to mankind, correcting the injustice and clarifying her place in society:\n \n &#8220;O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward the Lord, before Who ye claim (your rights) of one another, and toward the wombs (that bore you). Lo! The Lord hath been a Watcher over you.&#8221; (4:1) \n \n Thus we see that man and woman are a part of one another, each an indispensable part of the Lord&#8217;s plan, and that each has rights and responsibilities in regard to the other.\n \n Stating that men and women are equal before the Lord does not imply that there are no differences between them, or that they share the same role as vice regents on the earth. The Lord wisely assigned complementary roles to men and women that are consonant with their natural tendencies. Thus, the man is required to provide support for the woman, as the Lord commands:\n \n &#8220;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because the Lord has given the one more (strength) than the other and because they support them from their means.&#8221; (4:34)\n \n This in no way implies that a woman is the property of the man, but rather it recognizes her softer nature and allows her to fulfill her role as mother and nurturer free from the necessity of providing for herself. Many other words have been revealed that codify her rights; the right to choose her spouse, the right to inherit from her relatives, the right to work and own goods and property and to dispose of them as she sees fit, the right to have children and to enjoy marital relations, the right to learn and teach and simply be, to be a whole person, an individual with her own relationship to the Lord. \"\n http://www.lordswords.com/articles/show_article.asp?id=7\n \n and to know more about the status of woman in Quran you can visit this website:\n http://jannah.org/sisters/\n http://sisters.islamway.com/",

I note you say nothing of 'the Prophet' sleeping with an under-age girl. But as you want to have quotes on women from Islamic sources then I suggest you read...\n \n Are women equal in Islam? \"Men have fear of your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From that soul He created its mate and through them He bestrewed the earth with countless men and women\" (Sura 4:1). This clearly suggests that men and women were created from the same substance. Muslims will point to this as 'proof' that men and women are considered equal in Islam. However, Sura 2:228 states \"Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above women.\" However this difference in status runs much deeper. In legal testimony, \"Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses\" (Sura 2:282), in other words a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's.\n \n Can Muslim women be beaten? \"Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them\" (Sura 4:34) (though some Islamic scholars claim that this is a symbolic 'beating' only where-by the husband just 'taps' his wife on the arm. Although the wording does not say it should be but a symbolic tap, it should be noted anyway that it still points to male domination over women. (and it is an interpretation that is in the minority)\n \n It is clear that Muhammed 'loved' women, he kept nine wives and numerous concubines. But is this love? What did he invoke his followers to do? \"Omar reported from the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) who said, 'No man shall be questioned for beating his wife.'\" (Al Hadis, Vol. 1, p. 215) \n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.' It was asked, 'Do they disbelieve in Allah?' (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:2:28) \n \n \"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammed was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammed responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammed answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n Okay, so these words of Islam were written years ago. What relevance do they have today? Can I remind you that the Koran is seen as the word of their god. To question it is to commit blasphemy. The Haddiths are the doings of Muhammed. Moslems believe that he was the most perfect of men, that his example should be followed. In Islam, women are clearly inferior to Men.\n The list goes on...\n \n \"Allah's Apostle once said to a group of women : 'I have not seen any one more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious, sensible man could be led astray by some of you.' The women asked: 'O Allah's Apostle, what is deficient in our intelligence and religion?' He said: 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency of your intelligence' ... 'Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?' The women replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency in your religion.'?Sahih Bukhari, Arabic-English translation, 1 Hadith No. 301. See also vol. 3, Hadith No. 826.\n \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\"\n Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61\n \n \n But, getting back to Aisha, how about<b></b>:\n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah?s Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine?. \n \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\"\n \n FROM THE HISTORY OF TABARI\n Tabari wrote the most authentic Islamic history. It covers 39 volumes. Tabari was one of the greatest Islamic scholars and the greatest Islamic Historian.\n From Tabari, volume 7, page7:\n \"....my marriage (to Muhammad) was consummated when I was nine.....\"\n \n From Tabari, volume 9, page 131\n \"Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me\"......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal. She was eighteen years old when he died.\n \n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammed) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:58:235). Remember, that she was only a child. He is fantasising about a little girl.\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed! Yes there are child-marriages going on in non-Muslim areas of the world, but please remember that in Islam it is actually supported by their leader. It is done BECAUSE of their religious beliefs. Muhammed is believed to have been the 'best man' ever who lived, and his teachings aren't relative to a particular time or social group BUT are for all people in all times.",

One could easily gather scriptures out of the Bible and out of context use them to accuse Christians of subjegating women as well.\n\n \n If you want Muslim context then you need to look at how they, in general live their life.\n \n The Haddiths are a commentary on the Koran, and the life of their prophet and are deemed second only to the Koran. \n \n They aren't just 'snippets' because when I show quotes from their holy books, we already know how they live. If you want to broaden this into a general critique of society in Muslim countries then perhaps we need a new thread.\n \n You can't get a feeling of the Koran just by reading the Koran anyway, because it's not set out like the Bible. It's not ordered in any chronological/sequential order. Simply put they have the biggest book first, then the next biggest etc to the last book, the shortest book. So just looking at the Koran you won't know what was said when.\n \n You also will need to know about verses that have been abrogated (replaced) by other verses. Some sayings of 'the Prophet' were later found to be in conflict with other sayings. When asked to sort this out, he suggested that his god had made 'better' sayings later on. So if there's a conflict you need to know which order they are written, plus whether most commentators recognise the later as abrogating the former. This is in fact a great bonus for Muhammedans when they present their religion to the west. A typical westerner will say \"I think the Koran teaches violence\"\n \"No\", a Muslim might say, \"Look at this verse\", and they'll point to one of the few verses such as \"There shall be no compulsion in religion\", and you think, we'll there it is, in black and white, you've had it all wrong about Islam. But what you don't know is that this particular verse has been abrogated by other verses which are more severe.\n \n So, like how you read the Bible, you can't just sit down and read it, you need to know context.",

   "Hey, where's Truthkeeper?\n \n \n7 Reasons to Read the Glorious Qur?an\n 1. Inimitable\n It dares you to disprove it. How? It says that humans cannot write a book like this even if they pooled all their resources together and got help also from the spirits. The Qur?an said this fourteen hundred years ago and yet no one has been able to disprove it. Billions of books have been written-but not another one like the Qur?an.\n\n \n It proves itself wrong.\n Internal Contradictions: \n \n And it just doesn't add up: Sura 4:11-12 and 4:176 state the Qur'anic inheritance law. When a man dies, and is leaving behind three daughters, his two parents and his wife, they will receive the respective shares of 2/3 for the 3 daughters together, 1/3 for the parents together [both according to verse 4:11] and 1/8 for the wife [4:12] which adds up to more than the available estate. A second example: A man leaves only his mother, his wife and two sisters, then they receive 1/3 [mother, 4:11], 1/4 [wife, 4:12] and 2/3 [the two sisters, 4:176], which again adds up to 15/12 of the available property. \n How many angels were talking to Mary? When the Qur'an speaks about the annunciation of the birth of Jesus to the virgin Mary, Sura 3:42,45 speaks about (several) angels while it is only one in Sura 19:17-21.\n Further numerical discrepancies Does Allah's day equal to 1,000 human years (Sura 22:47, 32:5) or 50,000 human years (Sura 70:4)? --- How many gardens are there in paradise? ONE [as stated in 39:73, 41:30, 57:21, 79:41] or MANY [18:31, 22:23, 35:33, 78:32]? --- According to Sura 56:7 there will be THREE distinct groups of people at the Last Judgement, but 90:18-19, 99:6-8, etc. mention only TWO groups. --- There are conflicting views on who takes the souls at death: THE Angel of Death [32:11], THE angels (plural) [47:27] but also \"It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death.\" [39:42] \n Angels have 2, 3, or 4 pairs of wings [35:1]. But Gabriel had 600 wings. [Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 455] \n How many days did Allah need to destroy the people of Aad? One day [54:19] or several days [41:16; 69:6,7] \n Six or eight days of creation? Sura 7:54, 10:3, 11:7, and 25:59 clearly state that God created \"the heavens and the earth\" in six days. But in 41:9-12 the detailed description of the creation procedure adds up to eight days.\n Quick or Slow Creation? Allah creates the heavens and the earth in six days [7:54] and many Muslims want to be modern and scientific, and make that six eons, but then again, He creates instantaneously [2:117], \"Be! And it is\".\n Heavens or Earth? Which was created first? First earth and then heaven [2:29], heaven and after that earth [79:27-30].\n Calling together or ripping apart? In the process of creation heaven and earth were first apart and are called to come together [41:11], while 21:30 states that they were originally one piece and then ripped apart.\n What was man created from? A blood clot [96:1-2], water [21:30, 24:45, 25:54], \"sounding\" (i.e. burned) clay [15:26], dust [3:59, 30:20, 35:11], nothing [19:67] and this is then denied in 52:35, earth [11:61], a drop of thickened fluid [16:4, 75:37]\n Fully Detailed Or Incomplete? The Qur'an claims for itself to be (fully) detailed, that nothing is left out of the book [6:38, 6:114, 12:111, 16:89 etc.]. However there are plenty of important issues which are left unclear in the Qur'an. This article discusses the confusion found in the quranic statements on wine.\n Worshiping the Same or a Different God? Muhammad is commanded to speak to the disbelievers: ... nor do you worship what I worship [109:3]. However, other verses in the Qur'an state clearly that those disbelieving his message are in fact worshiping the same God, Allah.\n To Intercede or Not To Intercede? - That is the Question! The Qur'an makes contradictory statements whether on the Day of Judgment intercession will be possible. No: [2:122-123, 254; 6:51; 82:18-19; etc.]. Yes: [20:109; 34:23; 43:86; 53:26; etc.]. Each position can be further supported by ahadith.\n Where is Allah and his throne? Allah is nearer than the jugular vein [50:16], but he is also on the throne [57:4] which is upon the water [11:7], and at the same time so far away, that it takes between 1,000 and 50,000 years to reach him [32:5, 70:4].\n The origin of calamity? Is the evil in our life from Satan [38:41], Ourselves [4:79], or Allah [4:78]?\n How merciful is Allah's mercy? He has prescribed mercy for himself [6:12], yet he does not guide some, even though he could [6:35, 14:4].\n Will there be inquiry in Paradise? \"neither will they question one another\" [23:101] but nevertheless they will be \"engaging in mutual inquiry\" [52:25], \"and they will ... question one another\" [37:27].\n Are angels protectors? \"NO protector besides Allah\" [2:107, 29:22]. But in Sura 41:31 the angels themselves say: \"We are your protectors in this life and the Hereafter.\" And also in other suras is their role described as guarding [13:11, 50:17-18] and protecting [82:10].\n Is everything devoutly obedient to Allah? That is the claim in 30:26, but dozens of verses speak of the proud disobedience of Satan [7:11, 15:28-31, 17:61, 20:116, 38:71-74, 18:50] as well of many different human beings who reject His commands and His revelations.\n Does Allah forgive shirk? Shirk is considered the worst of all sins, but the author of the Qur'an seems unable to decide if Allah will ever forgive it or not. No [4:48, 116], Yes [4:153, 25:68-71]. Abraham committed this sin of polytheism as he takes moon, sun, stars to be his Lord [6:76-78], yet Muslims believe that all prophets are without any sin.\n The event of worship of the golden calf: The Israelites repented about worshipping the golden calf BEFORE Moses returned from the mountain [7:149], yet they refused to repent but rather continued to worship the calf until Moses came back [20:91]. Does Aaron share in their guilt? No [20:85-90], yes [20:92, 7:151].\n Was Jonah cast on the desert shore or was he not? \"Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick\" [37:145] \"Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore while he was reprobate.\" [68:49]\n Moses and the Injil? Jesus is born more than 1,000 years after Moses, but in 7:157 Allah speaks to Moses about what is written in the Injil [the book given to Jesus].\n Can slander of chaste women be forgiven? Yes [24:5], No [24:23].\n How do we receive the record on Judgment Day? On Judgement day the lost people are given the Record (of their bad deeds): Behind their back [84:10], or in their left hand [69:25]. \n Can angels disobey? No angel is arrogant, they all obey Allah [16:49-50], but: \"And behold, we said to the ANGELS: 'Bow down to Adam'. And THEY bowed down, EXCEPT Iblis. He refused and was haughty.\" [2:34].\n Three contradictions in 2:97 and 16:101-103 Who brings the revelation from Allah to Muhammad? The ANGEL Gabriel [2:97], or the Holy Spirit [16:102]? The new revelation confirms the old [2:97] or substitutes it [16:101]? The Qur'an is PURE Arabic [16:103] but there are numerous foreign, non-Arabic words in it.\n The infinite loop problem Sura 26:192,195,196: \"It (the Qur'an) is indeed a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds, ... in clear Arabic speech and indeed IT (the Qur'an) is in the writings of the earlier (prophets).\" Now, the 'earlier writings' are the Torah and the Injil for example, written in Hebrew and Greek. HOW can an ARABIC Qur'an be contained in books of other languages? Furthermore, it would have to contain this very passage of the Qur'an since the Qur'an is properly contained in them. Hence these earlier writings have to be contained in yet other earlier writings and we are in an infinite loop, which is absurd.\n Is the Torah like the Qur'an, or is it not? The Muslim claim of the corruption of the Bible leads to a contradiction between S. 2:24 and 17:88 on the one hand, and 28:49 and 46:10 on the other.\n \"An old woman\" and God's character About the story of Lot: \"So we delivered him and his family, - all exept an old woman who lingered behind.\" [Sura 26:170-171] And again: \"But we saved him and his family, exept his wife: she was of those who lagged behind. [Sura 7:83]. Either this is a contradiction or if indeed Lot's wife is derogatorily called \"an old woman\" then this does not show much respect for her as a wife of a prophet.\n More problems with the story of Lot \"And his people gave NO answer but this: They said, \"Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!\" [Sura 7:82 & 27:56]. Yet: \"But his people gave NO answer but this: They said: \"Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth.\" [Sura 29:29]. Obviously these answers are different.\n The \"pleasure\" of Allah? Is God's action of punishment or mercy and guidance or misguidance arbitrary? \n Did Abraham smash the idols? The accounts of Abraham, Suras 19:41-49, 6:74-83 differ quite a bit from Sura 21:51-59. While in Sura 21 Abraham confronts his people strongly, and even destroys the idols, in Sura 19 Abraham shuts up after his father threatens him to stone him for speaking out against the idols. And he seems not only to become silent, but even to leave the area (\"turning away from them all\").\n What about Noah's son? According to Sura 21:76, Noah and his family is saved from the flood, and Sura 37:77 confirms that his seed survived. But Sura 11:42-43 reports that Noah's son drowns.\n Was Noah driven out? \"Before them *the people of Noah* rejected (their messenger): They rejected Our servant and said, 'Here is One possessed!' And he was driven out.\" [Sura 54:9] Now, if he is driven out [expelled from their country] how come they can scoff at him while he is building the ark since we read \"Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the Chiefs of *his people* passed by him, they threw ridicule on him.\" [Sura 11:38] He cannot be both: Driven out and near enough that they can regularly pass by. \n Pharaoh's Magicians: Muslims or Rejectors of Faith? Did the Magicians of Pharaoh, Egyptians, become believers in the God of Moses [7:103-126; 20:56-73; S. 26:29-51] or did only Israelites believe in Moses [10:83]? \n Pharaoh's repentance in the face of death? According to Sura 10:90-92, Pharaoh repented \"in the sight of death\" and was saved. But Sura 4:18 says that such a thing can't happen.\n Abrogation? \"The words of the Lord are perfect in truth and justice; there is NONE who can change His words.\" [Sura 6:115] Also see 6:34 and 10:64. But then Allah (Muhammad?) sees the need to exchange some of them for \"better ones\" [Sura 2:106, 16:101]. And it is not for ignorant people to question Allah because of such practices!\n Guiding to truth? \"Say: 'God - He guides to the truth; and which is worthier to be followed ...?\" [Sura 10:35] But how much is left over of this worthiness when we also read: \"Allah leads astray whom he pleases, and he guides whom He pleases, ...\" [Sura 14:4]. And how do we know in which of Allah's categories of pleasure we fall? How sure can a Muslim be that he is one of those guided right and not one of those led astray?\n What is the punishment for adultery? Flogging with a 100 stripes (men and women) [24:2], \"confine them to houses until death do claim them (lifelong house arrest - for the women) [4:15]. For men: \"If they repent and amend, leave them alone\" [4:16]. 24:2 contradicts both the procedure for women and men in Sura 4. And why is the punishment for women and men equal in Sura 24 but different in Sura 4?\n Who suffers the consequence of sins? The Qur'an declares that everyone will be held responsible only for his own sins [S. 17:13-15, 53:38-42]. Yet, the Qur'an accuses the Jews of Muhammad's day for the sins committed some 2000 years earlier by other Jews, e.g. worshipping the Golden Calf idol.\n Will Christians enter Paradise or go to Hell? Sura 2:62 and 5:69 say \"Yes\", Sura 5:72 (just 3 verses later) and 3:85 say \"No\".\n God alone or also men? Clear or incomprehensible? The Qur'an is \"clear Arabic speech.\" [16:103] Yet \"NONE knows its interpretation, save only Allah.\" [3:7]. Actually, \"men of understanding do grasp it.\" [3:7]\n Was Pharaoh Drowned or Saved when chasing Moses and the Israelites? Saved [10:92], drowned [28:40, 17:103, 43:55].\n When Commanded Pharaoh the Killing of the Sons? When Moses was a Prophet and spoke God's truth to Pharaoh [40:23-25] or when he was still an infant [20:38-39]?\n When/how are the fates determined? \"The night of power is better than a thousand months. The angels and spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord, with all decrees.\" [97:3,4] \"Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night.\" [44:3] To Muslims, the \"Night of Power\" is a blessed night on which fates are settled and on which everything relating to life, death, etc., which occurs throughout the year is decreed. It is said to be the night on which Allah's decrees for the year are brought down to the earthly plane. In other words, matters of creation are decreed a year at a time. Contradicting this, Sura 57:22 says, \"No affliction befalls in the earth or in your selves, but it is in a Book before we create it.\" This means it is written in the Preserved Tablet, being totally fixed in Allah's knowledge before anyone was created. All of the above is contradicted by \"And every man's fate We have fastened to his own neck.\" This says that man alone is responsible for what he does and what happens to him. [17:13]\n Wine: Good or bad? Strong drink and ... are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. [5:90, also 2:219]. Yet on the other hand in Paradise are rivers of wine [47:15, also 83:22,25]. How does Satan's handiwork get into Paradise?\n Good News of Painful Torture? Obviously, announcing torment and suffering to anyone is bad news, not good news. However, the Qur'an announces the good news of painful torment [3:21, 4:138, 9:3, 9:34, 31:7, 45:8, and 84:24].\n Will all Muslims go to Hell? According to Sura 19:71 every Muslim will go to Hell (for at least some time), while another passage states that those who die in Jihad will go to Paradise immediately.\n Will Jesus burn in Hell? Jesus is raised to Allah, [Sura 4:158], near stationed with him [Sura 3:45], worshiped by millions of Christians, yet Sura 21:98 says, that all that are worshiped by men besides Allah will burn in Hell together with those who worship them. \n Jinns and men created for worship or for Hell? Created only to serve God [Sura 51:56], many of them made for Hell [Sura 7:179].\n Who is the father of Jesus? A more involved argument that is difficult to summarize in one sentence.\n Begetting and Self-sufficiency A self-contradiction on account of confused terminology.\n Could Allah have a son? Sura 39:4 affirms and Sura 6:101 denies this possibility.\n Did Jesus Die already? Sura 3:144 states that all messengers died before Muhammad. But 4:158 claims that Jesus was raised to God (alive?). \n One Creator or many? The Qur'an uses twice the phrase that Allah is \"the best of creators\" [23:14, 37:125]. What other creators are in mind? On the other hand, many verses make clear that Allah alone is \"the creator of all things\" [e.g. 39:62]. There is nothing left for others to be a creator of.\n From among all nations or from Abraham's seed? Sura 29:27 states that all prophets came Abraham's seed. But 16:36 claims that Allah raised messengers from among every people.\n Marrying the wives of adopted sons? It is important that Muslims can marry the divorced wives of adopted sons [Sura 33:37], yet it is forbidden to adopt sons [Sura 33:4-5].\n Messengers were never sent to other than their own people? So it is claimed in Sura 14:4 and 30:47. However, the Bible and the Qur'an, and the Muslim traditions confirm that Jonah was sent to a different nation.\n Messengers Amongst the Jinns and Angels? Allah sent only men as messengers [Suras 12:109, 21:7-8, 25:20-21] but there seemingly are messengers from Jinns and Angels [6:130; 11:69,77; 22:75; etc., see article for details].\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#internal\n \n Solomon listening to ants? In Sura 27:18-19 Solomon overhears a \"conversation of ants\". Is this possible based on our knowledge about the mode and complexity of ant communication?\n The stars and the moon The Qur'an teaches that there are seven heavens one above the other [67:3, 71:15], and that the stars are in the lower heaven [67:5, 37:6, 41:12], but the moon is depicted as being in/inside the seven heavens [71:16], even though in reality the stars are much further away from the earth than the moon.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#external\n \n Glory to (Allah) \n Who did take His Servant for a journey by night, \n From the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque. \n -- Sura 17:1 \n Problem: The Farthest Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a) was built many years after the death of Muhammad. It is utterly impossible that Muhammad visited it on his Night Journey.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/h003.html\n \n2. Incorruptible\n It is the only religious sacred writing that has been in circulation for such a long time and yet remains as pure as it was in the beginning. The Qur?an was kept intact. Nothing was added to it; nothing was changed in it; and nothing was taken away from it ever since its revelation was completed 1400 years ago.\n\n \n Muhammad, during the course of his prophethood, made many 'revelations'.\n There is a study on the formation of the Koran See: THE INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE QUR'AN TEXT at http://www.answering-islam.org/Gilchrist/Jam/chap1.html)\n \n These revelations were collected together in what would ultimately be the Koran. However, luckily for Mohammedans, an editing process was able to capture some of the data before it made its way in... most notably \"The Satanic Verses\"...\n \n \"Translated from Arabic, the satanic verses are \"these are exalted females whose intercession is to be desired\" in the 53rd sura of the Koran, Surat-An-Najm (\"The Star\"). Said to have been between verses 19-20, the females referred to were the goddesses al-Lat, Manah, and Uzza, who were three deities in pre-Islamic Arabia.\n \n According to customary explanation, Muhammad originally accepted these verses as part of the Koran. While the angel Jabril customarily told Muhammad to recite the sura revealed to him, Jabril then told him that the verses were actually a deception planted in his head from Satan, and they were therefore not the authentic word of Allah. The verses were later withdrawn and denounced as \"satanic.\"\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses\n \n What is genuine?\n \"But confronted with the enormous body of hadiths, which had been scattered in various forms and narrations throughout the length and breadth of the Islamic world following the migrations of the Companions and Followers, the Sunnah sometimes proved difficult to interpret. Even when the sound hadiths had been sifted out from this great body of material, which totalled several hundred thousand hadith reports, there were some hadiths which \"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/PQ/ch19-index.htm#ch19\n \n The Koran makes mistakes about Christianity...\n Then God will say: ?Jesus, son of Mary, did you ever say to mankind: \"Worship me and my mother as gods besides God?\"? \n ?Qur'an 5:116\n This is part of a mistake of Muslims who believe that the Trinity isn't Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, BUT Father, Son, and Mother (Mary)!\n \n Further to that the Koran states:\n Sura 6:115\n The words of thy Lord are perfect in truth and in justice; NONE can change His words: For He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.\n \n Sura 6:34\n There is none that can alter the words of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.\n \n Sura 10:65\n There is no changing the words of God; that is the supreme triumph.\n \n If these were so, then the Bible is the unchanged word of God! Muslims are saying that God's words can't be changed, yet they argue that the Bible is the word of God, but that it has been corrupted by man, hence the reason for Muhammad! Also, the fact that the Koran itself has gone through many edits suggests this too is wrong.\n \n \n3. Unsurpassable\n The Qur?an is God?s final revelation to humankind. God revealed the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and finally the Qur?an to Muhammad. Peace be upon Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad. No other book will come from God to surpass His final revelation.\n\n \n This is based on circular reasoning only, that the Muslims believe it to be the final revelation therefore it is unsurpassable. If this were so, then why are there abrogated Suras? Even within the Koran, some Suras replace other Suras. Further to that, no Muslim relies wholly on the Koran, but instead use the Koran in conjunction with the Haddiths, and other commentary. Thus the Koran, by itself, can not stand.\n \n \"The Qor'an contains sentences which are incomplete and not fully intelligible without the aid of commentaries; foreign words, unfamiliar Arabic words, and words used with other than the normal meaning; adjectives and verbs inflected without observance of the concords of gender and number; illogically and ungrammatically applied pronouns which sometimes have no referent; and predicates which in rhymed passages are often remote from the subjects. These and other such aberrations in the language have given scope to critics who deny the Qor'an?s eloquence. The problem also occupied the minds of devout Moslems. It forced the commentators to search for explanations and was probably one of the causes of disagreement over readings.\" (Dashti, Twenty-Three Years: A study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad, Allen and Unwin, London, 1985, pp. 48-49;)\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/incomplete.html\n \n \"To sum up, more than one hundred Qor?anic aberrations from the normal rules and structure of Arabic have been noted. Needless to say, the commentators strove to find explanations and justifications of these irregularities. Among them was the great commentator and philologist Mahmud oz-Zamakhshari (467/1075-538/1144), of whom a Moorish author wrote: ?This grammar-obsessed pedant has committed a shocking error. Our task is not to make the readings conform to Arabic grammar, but to take the whole of the Qor?an as it is and make Arabic grammar conform to the Qor?an.?\" (Ibid., p. 50;)\n Ibid\n \n \n4. Indisputable\n The Qur?an withstands the test of time and scrutiny. No one can dispute the truth of this book. It speaks about past history and turns out right. It speaks about the future in prophecies and it turns out right. It mentions details of physical phenomena which were not known to people at the time; yet later scientific discoveries prove that the Qur?an was right all along. Every other book needs to be revised to accord with modern knowledge. The Qur?an alone is never contradicted by a newly discovered scientific fact.\n\n \n As for claims against science...\n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, 'If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice, because Satan has stayed in the upper part of his nose all the night.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:516) \n \n \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, 'Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:509)\n \n \n \n Technically, these aren't from the Koran, but they are still from the most respected Haddith, and science can't actually test to see if Satan is in fact up your nose, or that he causes yawning.\n \n \n \n Thus, one Muslim web-site will calmly states:\n \"With fiber optic wire technowlogy (sic) we can now film the stages of a baby's growth whithin the womb however the muslim Holy book the Quran stated all of these stages in an amazing detail.\n In the name of God most gracious most merciful\n O mankind! If ye are in doubt concerning the resurection, the (sic) lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a bite of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We make it clear for you.\n REFERENCE: (Chapter 22) part of verse\"5\"\n Clot in the Arabic language can mean the name given to leaches which the baby resembles its looks during the very early stages of its development then this subsequently developes to a shape simmilar to abite made impression when the spine of the little baby starts to form.\n (all spelling mistakes are as written at http://members.tripod.com/~bensG/islam3.htm).

This is based on the concept of Tawhid, Unicity of God, which is the most fundamental principle of Islamic epistemology. \"\n \n http://www.cis-ca.org/\n \n \n \n \n \n5. Your Roadmap for Life and Afterlife\n \n The Qur?an is the best guidebook on how to structure your life. No other book presents such a comprehensive system involving all aspects of human life and endeavour. The Qur?an also points out the way to secure everlasting happiness in the afterlife. It is your roadmap showing how to get to Paradise.\n\n \n In Islam, no one knows for sure that you're going to get to heaven (unless you die as a warrior). IF you die as a warrior you get seventy plus virgins. If you're a woman, you get to be with your husband!\n \n \n6. God?s Gift of Guidance\n God has not left you alone. You were made for a reason. God tells you why he made you, what he demands from you and what he has in store for you. If you operate a machine contrary to it?s manufacturer?s specification you will ruin that machine. What about you? Do you have an owner?s manual for yourself? The Qur?an is from your Maker. It is a gift for you to make sure you function for success, lest you fail to function.\n It is a healing from God. It satisfies the soul, and cleans the heart. It removes doubts and brings peace.\n\n \n Islam urges you to make peace only with your Islamic brothers. In Muhammed's day, a man could indulge in a 'temporary marriage'. Instead of a prostitute, you'd marry the woman for the night, then divorce her in the morning - payment would be exchanged. Does this suggest a very moral outlook? Note too, it only benefits the man.\n What does it say of tolerance?\n See: \"Tolerance and the Qur?an\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Themes/tolerance.html\n What about love?\n See: \"A study of the word \"love\" in the Qur'an\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Themes/love.htm\n \n \"The permission to beat a woman in the case of rebelliousness is based on the Qur'an and the Hadith. \"Admonish those women whose rebelliousness you fear, and leave them alone in their beds, and [even] beat them [if necessary]. If they obey you, do not seek any way [to proceed] against them\" (Sura al-Nisa' 4:32)\"\n http://www.light-of-life.com/eng/reveal/\n \n7. Your Calling Card to Communicate with your Lord\n Humans are social creatures. We love to communicate with other intelligent life. The Qur?an tells us how to communicate with the source of all intelligence and the source of all life-the One God. The Qur?an tells us who God is, by what name we should address Him, and the way in which to communicate with Him.\n \n Are these not seven sufficient reasons for reading the Qur?an?\n http://www.islamhouse.com/en/module...=article&sid=23\n \n\n \n If they were true reasons, yes.",

   "Hey, where's Truthkeeper?\n \n \n \n It proves itself wrong.\n Internal Contradictions: \n \n And it just doesn't add up: Sura 4:11-12 and 4:176 state the Qur'anic inheritance law. When a man dies, and is leaving behind three daughters, his two parents and his wife, they will receive the respective shares of 2/3 for the 3 daughters together, 1/3 for the parents together [both according to verse 4:11] and 1/8 for the wife [4:12] which adds up to more than the available estate. A second example: A man leaves only his mother, his wife and two sisters, then they receive 1/3 [mother, 4:11], 1/4 [wife, 4:12] and 2/3 [the two sisters, 4:176], which again adds up to 15/12 of the available property. \n How many angels were talking to Mary? When the Qur'an speaks about the annunciation of the birth of Jesus to the virgin Mary, Sura 3:42,45 speaks about (several) angels while it is only one in Sura 19:17-21.\n Further numerical discrepancies Does Allah's day equal to 1,000 human years (Sura 22:47, 32:5) or 50,000 human years (Sura 70:4)? --- How many gardens are there in paradise? ONE [as stated in 39:73, 41:30, 57:21, 79:41] or MANY [18:31, 22:23, 35:33, 78:32]? --- According to Sura 56:7 there will be THREE distinct groups of people at the Last Judgement, but 90:18-19, 99:6-8, etc. mention only TWO groups. --- There are conflicting views on who takes the souls at death: THE Angel of Death [32:11], THE angels (plural) [47:27] but also \"It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death.\" [39:42] \n Angels have 2, 3, or 4 pairs of wings [35:1]. But Gabriel had 600 wings. [Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 455] \n How many days did Allah need to destroy the people of Aad? One day [54:19] or several days [41:16; 69:6,7] \n Six or eight days of creation? Sura 7:54, 10:3, 11:7, and 25:59 clearly state that God created \"the heavens and the earth\" in six days. But in 41:9-12 the detailed description of the creation procedure adds up to eight days.\n Quick or Slow Creation? Allah creates the heavens and the earth in six days [7:54] and many Muslims want to be modern and scientific, and make that six eons, but then again, He creates instantaneously [2:117], \"Be! And it is\".\n Heavens or Earth? Which was created first? First earth and then heaven [2:29], heaven and after that earth [79:27-30].\n Calling together or ripping apart? In the process of creation heaven and earth were first apart and are called to come together [41:11], while 21:30 states that they were originally one piece and then ripped apart.\n What was man created from? A blood clot [96:1-2], water [21:30, 24:45, 25:54], \"sounding\" (i.e. burned) clay [15:26], dust [3:59, 30:20, 35:11], nothing [19:67] and this is then denied in 52:35, earth [11:61], a drop of thickened fluid [16:4, 75:37]\n Fully Detailed Or Incomplete? The Qur'an claims for itself to be (fully) detailed, that nothing is left out of the book [6:38, 6:114, 12:111, 16:89 etc.]. However there are plenty of important issues which are left unclear in the Qur'an. This article discusses the confusion found in the quranic statements on wine.\n Worshiping the Same or a Different God? Muhammad is commanded to speak to the disbelievers: ... nor do you worship what I worship [109:3]. However, other verses in the Qur'an state clearly that those disbelieving his message are in fact worshiping the same God, Allah.\n To Intercede or Not To Intercede? - That is the Question! The Qur'an makes contradictory statements whether on the Day of Judgment intercession will be possible. No: [2:122-123, 254; 6:51; 82:18-19; etc.]. Yes: [20:109; 34:23; 43:86; 53:26; etc.]. Each position can be further supported by ahadith.\n Where is Allah and his throne? Allah is nearer than the jugular vein [50:16], but he is also on the throne [57:4] which is upon the water [11:7], and at the same time so far away, that it takes between 1,000 and 50,000 years to reach him [32:5, 70:4].\n The origin of calamity? Is the evil in our life from Satan [38:41], Ourselves [4:79], or Allah [4:78]?\n How merciful is Allah's mercy? He has prescribed mercy for himself [6:12], yet he does not guide some, even though he could [6:35, 14:4].\n Will there be inquiry in Paradise? \"neither will they question one another\" [23:101] but nevertheless they will be \"engaging in mutual inquiry\" [52:25], \"and they will ... question one another\" [37:27].\n Are angels protectors? \"NO protector besides Allah\" [2:107, 29:22]. But in Sura 41:31 the angels themselves say: \"We are your protectors in this life and the Hereafter.\" And also in other suras is their role described as guarding [13:11, 50:17-18] and protecting [82:10].\n Is everything devoutly obedient to Allah? That is the claim in 30:26, but dozens of verses speak of the proud disobedience of Satan [7:11, 15:28-31, 17:61, 20:116, 38:71-74, 18:50] as well of many different human beings who reject His commands and His revelations.\n Does Allah forgive shirk? Shirk is considered the worst of all sins, but the author of the Qur'an seems unable to decide if Allah will ever forgive it or not. No [4:48, 116], Yes [4:153, 25:68-71]. Abraham committed this sin of polytheism as he takes moon, sun, stars to be his Lord [6:76-78], yet Muslims believe that all prophets are without any sin.\n The event of worship of the golden calf: The Israelites repented about worshipping the golden calf BEFORE Moses returned from the mountain [7:149], yet they refused to repent but rather continued to worship the calf until Moses came back [20:91]. Does Aaron share in their guilt? No [20:85-90], yes [20:92, 7:151].\n Was Jonah cast on the desert shore or was he not? \"Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick\" [37:145] \"Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore while he was reprobate.\" [68:49]\n Moses and the Injil? Jesus is born more than 1,000 years after Moses, but in 7:157 Allah speaks to Moses about what is written in the Injil [the book given to Jesus].\n Can slander of chaste women be forgiven? Yes [24:5], No [24:23].\n How do we receive the record on Judgment Day? On Judgement day the lost people are given the Record (of their bad deeds): Behind their back [84:10], or in their left hand [69:25]. \n Can angels disobey? No angel is arrogant, they all obey Allah [16:49-50], but: \"And behold, we said to the ANGELS: 'Bow down to Adam'. And THEY bowed down, EXCEPT Iblis. He refused and was haughty.\" [2:34].\n Three contradictions in 2:97 and 16:101-103 Who brings the revelation from Allah to Muhammad? The ANGEL Gabriel [2:97], or the Holy Spirit [16:102]? The new revelation confirms the old [2:97] or substitutes it [16:101]? The Qur'an is PURE Arabic [16:103] but there are numerous foreign, non-Arabic words in it.\n The infinite loop problem Sura 26:192,195,196: \"It (the Qur'an) is indeed a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds, ... in clear Arabic speech and indeed IT (the Qur'an) is in the writings of the earlier (prophets).\" Now, the 'earlier writings' are the Torah and the Injil for example, written in Hebrew and Greek. HOW can an ARABIC Qur'an be contained in books of other languages? Furthermore, it would have to contain this very passage of the Qur'an since the Qur'an is properly contained in them. Hence these earlier writings have to be contained in yet other earlier writings and we are in an infinite loop, which is absurd.\n Is the Torah like the Qur'an, or is it not? The Muslim claim of the corruption of the Bible leads to a contradiction between S. 2:24 and 17:88 on the one hand, and 28:49 and 46:10 on the other.\n \"An old woman\" and God's character About the story of Lot: \"So we delivered him and his family, - all exept an old woman who lingered behind.\" [Sura 26:170-171] And again: \"But we saved him and his family, exept his wife: she was of those who lagged behind. [Sura 7:83]. Either this is a contradiction or if indeed Lot's wife is derogatorily called \"an old woman\" then this does not show much respect for her as a wife of a prophet.\n More problems with the story of Lot \"And his people gave NO answer but this: They said, \"Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!\" [Sura 7:82 & 27:56]. Yet: \"But his people gave NO answer but this: They said: \"Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth.\" [Sura 29:29]. Obviously these answers are different.\n The \"pleasure\" of Allah? Is God's action of punishment or mercy and guidance or misguidance arbitrary? \n Did Abraham smash the idols? The accounts of Abraham, Suras 19:41-49, 6:74-83 differ quite a bit from Sura 21:51-59. While in Sura 21 Abraham confronts his people strongly, and even destroys the idols, in Sura 19 Abraham shuts up after his father threatens him to stone him for speaking out against the idols. And he seems not only to become silent, but even to leave the area (\"turning away from them all\").\n What about Noah's son? According to Sura 21:76, Noah and his family is saved from the flood, and Sura 37:77 confirms that his seed survived. But Sura 11:42-43 reports that Noah's son drowns.\n Was Noah driven out? \"Before them *the people of Noah* rejected (their messenger): They rejected Our servant and said, 'Here is One possessed!' And he was driven out.\" [Sura 54:9] Now, if he is driven out [expelled from their country] how come they can scoff at him while he is building the ark since we read \"Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the Chiefs of *his people* passed by him, they threw ridicule on him.\" [Sura 11:38] He cannot be both: Driven out and near enough that they can regularly pass by. \n Pharaoh's Magicians: Muslims or Rejectors of Faith? Did the Magicians of Pharaoh, Egyptians, become believers in the God of Moses [7:103-126; 20:56-73; S. 26:29-51] or did only Israelites believe in Moses [10:83]? \n Pharaoh's repentance in the face of death? According to Sura 10:90-92, Pharaoh repented \"in the sight of death\" and was saved. But Sura 4:18 says that such a thing can't happen.\n Abrogation? \"The words of the Lord are perfect in truth and justice; there is NONE who can change His words.\" [Sura 6:115] Also see 6:34 and 10:64. But then Allah (Muhammad?) sees the need to exchange some of them for \"better ones\" [Sura 2:106, 16:101]. And it is not for ignorant people to question Allah because of such practices!\n Guiding to truth? \"Say: 'God - He guides to the truth; and which is worthier to be followed ...?\" [Sura 10:35] But how much is left over of this worthiness when we also read: \"Allah leads astray whom he pleases, and he guides whom He pleases, ...\" [Sura 14:4]. And how do we know in which of Allah's categories of pleasure we fall? How sure can a Muslim be that he is one of those guided right and not one of those led astray?\n What is the punishment for adultery? Flogging with a 100 stripes (men and women) [24:2], \"confine them to houses until death do claim them (lifelong house arrest - for the women) [4:15]. For men: \"If they repent and amend, leave them alone\" [4:16]. 24:2 contradicts both the procedure for women and men in Sura 4. And why is the punishment for women and men equal in Sura 24 but different in Sura 4?\n Who suffers the consequence of sins? The Qur'an declares that everyone will be held responsible only for his own sins [S. 17:13-15, 53:38-42]. Yet, the Qur'an accuses the Jews of Muhammad's day for the sins committed some 2000 years earlier by other Jews, e.g. worshipping the Golden Calf idol.\n Will Christians enter Paradise or go to Hell? Sura 2:62 and 5:69 say \"Yes\", Sura 5:72 (just 3 verses later) and 3:85 say \"No\".\n God alone or also men? Clear or incomprehensible? The Qur'an is \"clear Arabic speech.\" [16:103] Yet \"NONE knows its interpretation, save only Allah.\" [3:7]. Actually, \"men of understanding do grasp it.\" [3:7]\n Was Pharaoh Drowned or Saved when chasing Moses and the Israelites? Saved [10:92], drowned [28:40, 17:103, 43:55].\n When Commanded Pharaoh the Killing of the Sons? When Moses was a Prophet and spoke God's truth to Pharaoh [40:23-25] or when he was still an infant [20:38-39]?\n When/how are the fates determined? \"The night of power is better than a thousand months. The angels and spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord, with all decrees.\" [97:3,4] \"Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night.\" [44:3] To Muslims, the \"Night of Power\" is a blessed night on which fates are settled and on which everything relating to life, death, etc., which occurs throughout the year is decreed. It is said to be the night on which Allah's decrees for the year are brought down to the earthly plane. In other words, matters of creation are decreed a year at a time. Contradicting this, Sura 57:22 says, \"No affliction befalls in the earth or in your selves, but it is in a Book before we create it.\" This means it is written in the Preserved Tablet, being totally fixed in Allah's knowledge before anyone was created. All of the above is contradicted by \"And every man's fate We have fastened to his own neck.\" This says that man alone is responsible for what he does and what happens to him. [17:13]\n Wine: Good or bad? Strong drink and ... are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. [5:90, also 2:219]. Yet on the other hand in Paradise are rivers of wine [47:15, also 83:22,25]. How does Satan's handiwork get into Paradise?\n Good News of Painful Torture? Obviously, announcing torment and suffering to anyone is bad news, not good news. However, the Qur'an announces the good news of painful torment [3:21, 4:138, 9:3, 9:34, 31:7, 45:8, and 84:24].\n Will all Muslims go to Hell? According to Sura 19:71 every Muslim will go to Hell (for at least some time), while another passage states that those who die in Jihad will go to Paradise immediately.\n Will Jesus burn in Hell? Jesus is raised to Allah, [Sura 4:158], near stationed with him [Sura 3:45], worshiped by millions of Christians, yet Sura 21:98 says, that all that are worshiped by men besides Allah will burn in Hell together with those who worship them. \n Jinns and men created for worship or for Hell? Created only to serve God [Sura 51:56], many of them made for Hell [Sura 7:179].\n Who is the father of Jesus? A more involved argument that is difficult to summarize in one sentence.\n Begetting and Self-sufficiency A self-contradiction on account of confused terminology.\n Could Allah have a son? Sura 39:4 affirms and Sura 6:101 denies this possibility.\n Did Jesus Die already? Sura 3:144 states that all messengers died before Muhammad. But 4:158 claims that Jesus was raised to God (alive?). \n One Creator or many? The Qur'an uses twice the phrase that Allah is \"the best of creators\" [23:14, 37:125]. What other creators are in mind? On the other hand, many verses make clear that Allah alone is \"the creator of all things\" [e.g. 39:62]. There is nothing left for others to be a creator of.\n From among all nations or from Abraham's seed? Sura 29:27 states that all prophets came Abraham's seed. But 16:36 claims that Allah raised messengers from among every people.\n Marrying the wives of adopted sons? It is important that Muslims can marry the divorced wives of adopted sons [Sura 33:37], yet it is forbidden to adopt sons [Sura 33:4-5].\n Messengers were never sent to other than their own people? So it is claimed in Sura 14:4 and 30:47. However, the Bible and the Qur'an, and the Muslim traditions confirm that Jonah was sent to a different nation.\n Messengers Amongst the Jinns and Angels? Allah sent only men as messengers [Suras 12:109, 21:7-8, 25:20-21] but there seemingly are messengers from Jinns and Angels [6:130; 11:69,77; 22:75; etc., see article for details].\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#internal\n \n Solomon listening to ants? In Sura 27:18-19 Solomon overhears a \"conversation of ants\". Is this possible based on our knowledge about the mode and complexity of ant communication?\n The stars and the moon The Qur'an teaches that there are seven heavens one above the other [67:3, 71:15], and that the stars are in the lower heaven [67:5, 37:6, 41:12], but the moon is depicted as being in/inside the seven heavens [71:16], even though in reality the stars are much further away from the earth than the moon.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#external\n \n Glory to (Allah) \n Who did take His Servant for a journey by night, \n From the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque. \n -- Sura 17:1 \n Problem: The Farthest Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a) was built many years after the death of Muhammad. It is utterly impossible that Muhammad visited it on his Night Journey.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/h003.html\n \n \n Muhammad, during the course of his prophethood, made many 'revelations'.\n There is a study on the formation of the Koran See: THE INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE QUR'AN TEXT at http://www.answering-islam.org/Gilchrist/Jam/chap1.html)\n \n These revelations were collected together in what would ultimately be the Koran. However, luckily for Mohammedans, an editing process was able to capture some of the data before it made its way in... most notably \"The Satanic Verses\"...\n \n \"Translated from Arabic, the satanic verses are \"these are exalted females whose intercession is to be desired\" in the 53rd sura of the Koran, Surat-An-Najm (\"The Star\"). Said to have been between verses 19-20, the females referred to were the goddesses al-Lat, Manah, and Uzza, who were three deities in pre-Islamic Arabia.\n \n According to customary explanation, Muhammad originally accepted these verses as part of the Koran. While the angel Jabril customarily told Muhammad to recite the sura revealed to him, Jabril then told him that the verses were actually a deception planted in his head from Satan, and they were therefore not the authentic word of Allah. The verses were later withdrawn and denounced as \"satanic.\"\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses\n \n What is genuine?\n \"But confronted with the enormous body of hadiths, which had been scattered in various forms and narrations throughout the length and breadth of the Islamic world following the migrations of the Companions and Followers, the Sunnah sometimes proved difficult to interpret. Even when the sound hadiths had been sifted out from this great body of material, which totalled several hundred thousand hadith reports, there were some hadiths which \"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/PQ/ch19-index.htm#ch19\n \n The Koran makes mistakes about Christianity...\n Then God will say: ?Jesus, son of Mary, did you ever say to mankind: \"Worship me and my mother as gods besides God?\"? \n ?Qur'an 5:116\n This is part of a mistake of Muslims who believe that the Trinity isn't Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, BUT Father, Son, and Mother (Mary)!\n \n Further to that the Koran states:\n Sura 6:115\n The words of thy Lord are perfect in truth and in justice; NONE can change His words: For He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.\n \n Sura 6:34\n There is none that can alter the words of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.\n \n Sura 10:65\n There is no changing the words of God; that is the supreme triumph.\n \n If these were so, then the Bible is the unchanged word of God! Muslims are saying that God's words can't be changed, yet they argue that the Bible is the word of God, but that it has been corrupted by man, hence the reason for Muhammad! Also, the fact that the Koran itself has gone through many edits suggests this too is wrong.\n \n \n \n This is based on circular reasoning only, that the Muslims believe it to be the final revelation therefore it is unsurpassable. If this were so, then why are there abrogated Suras? Even within the Koran, some Suras replace other Suras. Further to that, no Muslim relies wholly on the Koran, but instead use the Koran in conjunction with the Haddiths, and other commentary. Thus the Koran, by itself, can not stand.\n \n \"The Qor'an contains sentences which are incomplete and not fully intelligible without the aid of commentaries; foreign words, unfamiliar Arabic words, and words used with other than the normal meaning; adjectives and verbs inflected without observance of the concords of gender and number; illogically and ungrammatically applied pronouns which sometimes have no referent; and predicates which in rhymed passages are often remote from the subjects. These and other such aberrations in the language have given scope to critics who deny the Qor'an?s eloquence. The problem also occupied the minds of devout Moslems.

Needless to say, the commentators strove to find explanations and justifications of these irregularities. Among them was the great commentator and philologist Mahmud oz-Zamakhshari (467/1075-538/1144), of whom a Moorish author wrote: ?This grammar-obsessed pedant has committed a shocking error. Our task is not to make the readings conform to Arabic grammar, but to take the whole of the Qor?an as it is and make Arabic grammar conform to the Qor?an.?\" (Ibid., p. 50;)\n Ibid\n \n \n \n As for claims against science...\n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, 'If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice, because Satan has stayed in the upper part of his nose all the night.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:516) \n \n \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, 'Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:509)\n \n \n \n Technically, these aren't from the Koran, but they are still from the most respected Haddith, and science can't actually test to see if Satan is in fact up your nose, or that he causes yawning.\n \n \n \n Thus, one Muslim web-site will calmly states:\n \"With fiber optic wire technowlogy (sic) we can now film the stages of a baby's growth whithin the womb however the muslim Holy book the Quran stated all of these stages in an amazing detail.\n In the name of God most gracious most merciful\n O mankind!

IF you die as a warrior you get seventy plus virgins. If you're a woman, you get to be with your husband!\n \n \n \n Islam urges you to make peace only with your Islamic brothers. In Muhammed's day, a man could indulge in a 'temporary marriage'. Instead of a prostitute, you'd marry the woman for the night, then divorce her in the morning - payment would be exchanged.

   "\"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammad was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammad responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammad answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n It would be good of Mizmaxx to find similar tracts in the Bible. But no, just a generalised criticism of the Bible is all her argument requires - opinion appealing to preconceived bias.\n \n \"The Christian Church is female! This is going to come to a shock to most non-Christians (and maybe even some Christians), but God's people are referred to as female, not male. In the Old Testament, God's people are the \"daughters of Zion.\"32 The Church or body of Christ (including us men) is referred to as the \"bride\" of Christ 33 and God is said to be our \"husband.\"34 Whenever referred to by sex, the Church is described as \"she\" or \"her.\"\n http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/sexism.html\n (footnotes are at the bottom of this post)\n \n \nIf it is possible for gender equity to exist in Jewish and Christian cultures, then it is possible for it to exist in Muslim cultures. Such cultures all have histories of extreme sexism and oppression of women, and their holy books are each full of examples of the same.\n\n \n Ah the anti-Christian enters the debate... with an attempt at a relativist argument. Rather then debate specifics about Islam, let's ignore these by suggesting that all cultures have been evil towards women. How can we critique Islam - when everyone's religion (except her own) is evil. Embedded in her tract is that she believes Christianity to be essentially anti-women.\n \n And it misses the most important point... Islam's anti-female tenets are for all time! Muhammad who slept with a nine-year old is painted as the ideal man. Mizmaxx shamefully doesn't address this. She only speaks out when a Christian speaks up!\n \n The most revered (wholly) human being in the Orthodox Christian church is a woman; the Theotokos (known to you as the Virgin Mary). In the Christian church men and women are together; in a Mosque women are hidden behind a curtain. Christianity says that the rewards in heaven are equal for both sexes. Islam does not.\n \n Christianity is a pro-monogamous religion. Islam is not... and this polygamy is only in favour of men.\n \n Islam allows instant divorces for men.\n \n What did Muhammad say to a group of women? \"Allah's Apostle once said to a group of women : 'I have not seen any one more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious, sensible man could be led astray by some of you.' The women asked: 'O Allah's Apostle, what is deficient in our intelligence and religion?' He said: 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency of your intelligence' ... 'Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?' The women replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency in your religion.'(Sahih Bukhari, Arabic-English translation, 1 Hadith No. 301. See also vol. 3, Hadith No. 826.)\n \n Further, a woman is created for man's pleasure... \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\" (Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61)\n \n Christianity is in a lose-lose situation by Mizmaxx's standards. She can criticise Christianity by its own merits, and if we investigate another belief system, such as Islam, well, we've got to drag Christianity into it too! In the end, Mizmaxx is just plain old anti-Christian. In fact, we can't even criticise her own beliefs because apart from describing herself as ex-Catholic and 'Wiccan' no one knows what she believes... but hey, it's only so she can attack Christianity at every instance.\n \n \nNonetheless, women in each of these cultures have found ways of fighting sexism in their own cultures and living in relative equality. The more religious-totalitarian the state/country is that they live in, the more extreme and violent it's sexism, and the more difficult it is to fight it from within. For example- medieval Europe, ancient Judea, the Third Reich, etc.\n\n \n Is she you mixing up culture and religion? I think she is. Is she also now saying that if a state adopted her wiccan theology it too would be anti-women? It makes me laugh that Mizmaxx introduces such nonsense as debate. The great bonus for Mizmaxx in this is no one knows exactly what she believes so one can't actually challenge her on anything.\n \n She ignores a number of prominent women in the bible; heroines. Esther, and Ruth for example. \"Other strong women of the Bible included Sarah, the wife of Abraham, who was preserved by the Lord despite the cowardly actions of Abraham in saying that she was his sister\"\n http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/sexism.html\n \n \"(Pamela) Eisenbaum (a Jewish feminist) then explores the reasons from Paul's ambiguity on the subject of both Jews and women, and she concludes by proposing the Paul saw in marriage a metaphor that defines the optimal relationship between persons of different faiths, genders, or social standing. Beyond his own ambiguity, Eisenbaum suggests that Paul actually felt that the proper relationship between Jews and Christians, as between women and men, was that of the marriage partnership: two people with real differences joined together in a loving relationship such that differences are not obliterated but are seen as complimentary within the new family that marriage creates.\"\n http://christianity.about.com/library/weekly/aa022601.htm\n \n \n Footnotes for the text at top of post\n 32 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, \"Lo, your salvation comes; Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.\" (Isaiah 62:11)\n \"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\" declares the LORD. (Zechariah 2:10)\n Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. (Zechariah 9:9)\n 33 Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready. (Revelation 19:7)\n And he said to me, \"Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'\" And he said to me, \"These are true words of God.\" (Revelation 19:9)\n The Spirit and the bride say, \"Come!\" And let him who hears say, \"Come!\" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. (Revelation 22:17)\n \n 34 For your Maker is your husband-- the LORD Almighty is His name-- the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth. (Isaiah 54:5)",

It is not meant to be a personal attack on you, though it may seem that way as religion and person are intertwined, in some people (including myself).\n \nI just wonder montalban why do you spend all this time to prove that Islam is wrong? \n\n Because it is. Any religion that claims the best example as a man who murdered prisoners-of-war, and who slept with a child, and who encouraged political assinations can't be good. And ye shall know the tree by the fruit it bears.\n \nWhat is your religion? Christian?\n\n I am an Orthodox Christian - probably the worst example of one, but one never-the-less. I am, specifically Antiochian Christian. My church's base is in Syria, and thus we are well aware of the fruits of living under Islamic law. (although I am a convert, and my background is different - being a Celt; my church has a continual link with Syria, the Lebanon, Jordan etc) Our priest is just out from Syria. (this actually doesn't always help, as he breaks into Arabic during Divine Liturgy - and I don't speak Arabic - so I lose my place).\n \nThen why don't you try to prove have good is the Christianity rather than trying to show how bad is the other religion is?\n\n I do state positive statements on other threads. On the evolutionary threads I made bold statements about the truthfulness of the Orthodox Church, in generalist terms, and specifically to its teachings on the creation. However, you post here on a debate forum propaganda for your religion, and it requires a reasoned response. However, this is not a thread \"The Truths of Orthodoxy\"\n Personally, I once considered becoming Muslim, I was a member of a university Muslim student's association and studied stuff about it at university,* in private, and even got myself a Koran - mind you it was a Penguin Classics edition of one. However, looking a little deeper, past the staged rhetoric offered me, I was appalled at the actual practices and teachings of Islam with regard to women and children. \n \nI would like to say one thing, that Islam doesn't need my prove to show that it is right,\n\n Then one wonders what you are doing here proclaiming the virtues of Islam. It seems it is your self-appointed job to present a positive face, and I don't blame you. It is my self-appointed job to show what you have in the 'fine-print'. I expect you will continue to present abrogated verses and pretend that they have not been superseded.\n [QUOTE=TruthKeeper]so if I will not be here to reply for you posts montalban that doesn't mean that Islam is wrong!!\n This is true. Your lack of response does not infer anything other than you haven't responded. Likewise, it doesn't make you right.\n \n There are alot of Muslims that are not practising Islam as it should be, there are alot of Muslims that show a wrong face of Islam, and that happen also in other religions.\n\n The wrong face of Islam is the one that is presented. A typical trick goes like this...\n Un-committed Person: I heard Islam teaches violence\n Moslem: No, look, here is the Koran see \"There's no compulsion in religion\"\n Un-committed Person: Oh, I've been misinformed\n Moslem: Yes, many people have a bias against us\n Un-committed Person: Tell me more\n \n And what hasn't been said is that such a Sura has been abrogated. Sure, it's still there, as are dietary laws in the Bible.\n \nBut do you know what is the difference? The difference is that still the Islam is the The Fastest Growing Religion in the World !\n\n I believe that Mormonism comes close to making this claim. But it is totally superfluous that Islam is the fastest growing. Has it always been? If it wasn't then was it false when it was less popular?\n You are saying that there are some bad Muslims, I understand this, there are, in the words of the philosopher (wink!) Paul McCartney \"Good and bad, in everyone\" (\"Ebony & Ivory,\" 1983)\n \n Here are stories of people converted to Islam: \n\n Many have embraced Islam for the wrong reasons. People such as yourself, put forward a positive spin on your religion, and don't respond to any criticism, whilst ironically stating that you welcome it. The you are helped by people like Mizmaxx who continually attack Christianity. Even in this nation you tried to use the courts to silence opposition.\n http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=\\\\\\\\ForeignBureaus\\\\\\\\archive\\\\\\\\200208\\\\\\\\FOR20020814c.html\n Fortunately this back-fired as all the allegations made against Islam, were, like mine (see below) from Islamic sources. However the general public is irreligious or anti-religious. I know several people who aren't interested in the lies of Islam, because they believe that this is just Christian lies - they won't even look at your sources - so you've got the deck stacked in your favour - at the moment.\n \n Do you have any response to Muhammad sleeping with an under-age girl (albeit someone he married)? I have read many attempts to explain this away to a western-educated audience and would very much like to see what approach you would take.\n Haddith (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha')\n that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\n \n I have seen several\n - that she was not 'literally' nine\n - that the custom is relative to the times\n - that he didn't actually sleep with her - the marriage was symbolic - to cement an alliance between two houses.",

   "There were, in the time of Muhammad, Arab tribes that were Christian. Some were pagan, and some were Jewish. One such Jewish tribe, the Banu Quarayza helped Muhammad in battle. However, \"their loyalty was questioned and inevitably, after the siege, Muhammad moved against them. Realizing that they had no chance of surviving, the Banu Quarayza agreed to surrender on condition that they quit Medina empty-handed. Muhammad refused and wanted nothing less than unconditional surrender. The Jews then appealed to their ancient friendship with the Banu Aws and asked that Abuy Lubaba, an ally belonging to that tribe, be allowed to visit them. He was asked what Muhammad's intentions were; by way of reply Abu Lubaba drew his hand across his throat, indicating that they must fight to the end, as death was all that they could hope for. At last, after several weeks, the Jews surrendered on condition that their fate should be decided by their allies, the Banu Aws. The latter were inclined to show mercy but Muhammad decided that the fate of the Jews was to be decided by on of the Banu Aws. Muhammad nominated Sa'd ibn Muadh to be the judge...He pronounced, \"My judgement is that the men shall be put to death, the women and children sold into slavery, and the spoil divided among the army.\" Muhammad adopted the verdict as his own: \"Truly the judgment of Sad is the judgment of God pronounced on high from beyond the seventh heaven.\"\n During the night trenches sufficient to contain the dead bodies of the men were dug across the market place...In the morning, (Muhammad), himself a spectator of the tragedy, commanded the male captives to be brought forth in companies of five or six at a time. Each company as it came up was made to sit down in a row on the brink of the trench... The butchery began in the morning, and lasted all day...(Muhammad) returned from this horrid spectacle to solace himself with the charms of Rihana, who's husband and all of her make relatives had just perished in the massacre\"*\n \"And yes, a revelation came down from heaven justifying the stern punishment meted out to the Jews: sura 32.25 - \"And He has caused to descend from their strongholds the Jews that assisted them. And he struck terror into their hearts. Some you slaughtered and some you took prisoner\"\n Ibn Warraq (1995) \"Why I am Not a Muslim\", pp95-96.\n \n All the males of the tribe were asked to show their pubic region. Those who had not developed pubic hair were considered children and were not killed. All in all - at a most conservative figure - some 900 prisoners-of-war were put to death at that instance.\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/C...99Trifkovic.htm\n The incident is actually contained in Muslim sources - they are proud of Muhammed's cunning in gaining advantage of an alliance with this Jewish tribe - using them, then when they weren't needed - disposing of them.\n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina.

(This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime but if married persons commit it, the punishment is to stone them to death, according to Allah's Law).\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=27&bid=24\n \n Immured* wives\n Surah An-Nisa\n 4.15\n And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or Allah ordains for them some (other) way.\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=27&bid=4\n \n Stoning\n This is perhaps the more interesting of the punishments here, because it also proves that the Koran is not 'perfect'... because the Surah (verse) is missing from the Koran - but we know of it from Aisha - the prophet's wife.\n The Haddith Sahih Muslim\n Book 17, Number 4194:\n 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Verily Allah sent Muhammad (may peace be upon him) with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession.\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=9&tabid=24&bid=1&cid=18\n \n Thus this begs the question ? where did the verse go; that came down from heaven? It is clear this person recognizes that it is not contained in the Koran, but recalls it clearly, and just in case people think it was never mentioned, he reminds the reader here.\n \n \n Book 17, Number 4209:\n Abu Huraira and Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani reported that one of the desert tribes came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I beg of you in the name of Allah that you pronounce judgment about me according to the Book of Allah. The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.\n (Ibid)\n \n \n And just in case someone says \"Oh, yes, but they don't do that now...\"**\n \n \"On November 20th (2003) enraged Nigerians took to the streets, allegedly protesting the planned Miss World contest to be held in the capital, Abuja, and comments in a newspaper that Mohammed would have approved and probably desired to marry one of the contestants. The mobs burned Christian homes and churches. Some Christians fought back. The riots destroyed 22 churches and 8 mosques and left over 400 dead, 1,200 injured, and 12,000 homeless. \n \n Western media blurred distinctions between perpetrators and retaliators by calling it \"violence between Christians and Muslims.\" Fellow journalists blamed Nigerian columnist, Isioma Daniel, for her culturally insensitive insights.

   "Montalban, i have read your reply so deeply, you know alot about Islam, but still you would not like to belive in it. you keep on looking for the bad pictures you keep on misunderstanding everthing about Islam, i belive that you are not a person who are looking for a truth, because you know the truth. but you refuse to admit to the sound of truth. \n \n You are gathering in here all what you misunderstand about Islam, you think that what you are copying would stop an open mind people from seeking the truth. What Allah willes will happen.\n \"And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad SAW) then compel mankind, until they become believers. It is not for any person to believe, except by the Leave of All\u00e2h, and He will put the wrath on those who are heedless.\" (Yunus 10:99,10:100)\n \n \n I would really like you to read this article: \n \nDear Seeker of Truth,\n No one is compelled to accept the truth, but it is certainly a shame upon the human intellect when a man is not even interested in finding out what the truth is!\n \n Islam teaches that our Creator has given human beings the faculty of reason. Therefore, it is incumbent upon them to reason things out objectively and systematically for themselves to ponder, to question and to reflect.\n \n Nobody should press you to make a hasty decision to accept any of the teachings of Islam, for Islam teaches that human beings should be given the freedom to choose. Even when a person is faced with the truth, there is no compulsion upon him to embrace it.\n \n But before you begin to form an opinion about Islam, ask yourself whether your existing knowledge about it is thorough enough. Ask yourself whether that knowledge has been obtained through third party sources who themselves have probably been exposed to only random glimpses of Islamic writings and have yet to reason out on Islam objectively and systematically themselves.\n \n Is it fair enough that one should form an opinion about the taste of a particular dish just by a mere hearsay from others who may themselves have not necessarily tasted the dish yet?\n \n Similarly you should find out for yourself about Islam from reliable sources and not only taste it, but rather digest it very well before you form an opinion of it. That would be an intellectual approach to the truth.\n \n In making your next move to the truth, Islam continually reassures you that your rights to freedom of choice and freedom to use that God-given faculty of thought and reason will be respected, for everyone has that individual will. No one else can take away that will and force you to submit to the true way of your Creator, you have to find out and make that decision yourself!\n \n May your intellectual journey towards the truth be a pleasant and fruitful one... Amen\n \n \n",

   "Do you have any response to Muhammad sleeping with an under-age girl (albeit someone he married)? I have read many attempts to explain this away to a western-educated audience and would very much like to see what approach you would take.\n \n \n Then you are looking for my answer just to see what approach i would talk? \n I hope this is not the reason for your question. I hope that you asked the question beacase ( You think) that i Would put in the truth. \n \n before answering the question, you should know that there are alot of woman in the Arab world still tell 2 generation ago getting married at an age of 9 - 10 -11 - 12, and that seem so normal, for any couple to get married at an early age. it is something in our culture and the woman do not get forced for the marriage. According to Islamic Law, women cannot be forced to marry anyone without their consent. \n \n &#8220; Ibn Abbas reported that a girl came to the Messenger of God, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she reported that he father had forced her to marry without her consent. The Messenger of God gave her the choice&#8230; (between accepting the marriage or invalidating it)&#8221; (Ibn Hanbal No. 2469). In another version,&#8220; the girl said: Actually I accept this marriage but I wanted to let women know that parents have no right (to force a husband on them)&#8221; (Ibn Maja, No.1873).  \n http://www.islamland.org/books1/wamy/swoman/swoman_woman.htm#sub4\n \n The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah despite the age difference   \n \n \"\n Answer : \n \n Praise be to Allaah. \n \n The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam&#8217;ah (may Allaah be pleased with her). She &#8211; &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old. \n \n Among her virtues was the fact that the Revelation did not descend when he under one cover with any of his wives other than her. She was one of the dearest of all people to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and news of her innocence was revealed from above the seven heavens. She was one of the most knowledgeable of his wives, and one of the most knowledgeable women of the ummah as a whole. The senior companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to refer to her opinion and consult her. \n \n With regard to the story of her marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had grieved over the death of the Mother of the Believers Khadeejah, who had supported him and stood by his side, and he called the year in which she died The Year of Sorrow. Then he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Sawdah, who was an older woman and was not very beautiful; rather he married her to console her after her husband had died and she stayed among mushrik people. Four years later the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), and he was over fifty. Perhaps the reasons for the marriage were as follows: \n \n 1 &#8211; He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: &#8220;You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, &#8216;This is your wife.&#8217; I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, &#8216;If this is from Allaah then it will come to pass.&#8217;&#8221; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181. \n \n 2 &#8211; The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had noticed in &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings. \n \n 3 &#8211; The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets. \n \n It may be noted that among his wives were those who were young and old, the daughter of his sworn enemy, the daughter of his closest friend. One of them occupied herself with raising orphans, another distinguished herself from others by fasting and praying qiyaam a great deal&#8230; They represented all kinds of people, through whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was able to set out a way for the Muslims showing how to deal properly with all kinds of people. [See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah fi Daw&#8217; al-Masaadir al-Asliyyah, p. 711]. \n \n With regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage. \n \n If you think &#8211; may Allaah guide you &#8211; that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet&#8217;s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc. \n \n Such slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allaah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee&#8217;ah. \n \n And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=44990&dgn=4",

   "There were, in the time of Muhammad, Arab tribes that were Christian. Some were pagan, and some were Jewish. One such Jewish tribe, the Banu Quarayza helped Muhammad in battle. However, \"their loyalty was questioned and inevitably, after the siege, Muhammad moved against them. Realizing that they had no chance of surviving, the Banu Quarayza agreed to surrender on condition that they quit Medina empty-handed. Muhammad refused and wanted nothing less than unconditional surrender. The Jews then appealed to their ancient friendship with the Banu Aws and asked that Abuy Lubaba, an ally belonging to that tribe, be allowed to visit them. He was asked what Muhammad's intentions were; by way of reply Abu Lubaba drew his hand across his throat, indicating that they must fight to the end, as death was all that they could hope for. At last, after several weeks, the Jews surrendered on condition that their fate should be decided by their allies, the Banu Aws. The latter were inclined to show mercy but Muhammad decided that the fate of the Jews was to be decided by on of the Banu Aws. Muhammad nominated Sa'd ibn Muadh to be the judge...He pronounced, \"My judgement is that the men shall be put to death, the women and children sold into slavery, and the spoil divided among the army.\" Muhammad adopted the verdict as his own: \"Truly the judgment of Sad is the judgment of God pronounced on high from beyond the seventh heaven.\"\n During the night trenches sufficient to contain the dead bodies of the men were dug across the market place...In the morning, (Muhammad), himself a spectator of the tragedy, commanded the male captives to be brought forth in companies of five or six at a time. Each company as it came up was made to sit down in a row on the brink of the trench... The butchery began in the morning, and lasted all day...(Muhammad) returned from this horrid spectacle to solace himself with the charms of Rihana, who's husband and all of her make relatives had just perished in the massacre\"*\n \"And yes, a revelation came down from heaven justifying the stern punishment meted out to the Jews: sura 32.25 - \"And He has caused to descend from their strongholds the Jews that assisted them. And he struck terror into their hearts. Some you slaughtered and some you took prisoner\"\n Ibn Warraq (1995) \"Why I am Not a Muslim\", pp95-96.\n \n All the males of the tribe were asked to show their pubic region. Those who had not developed pubic hair were considered children and were not killed. All in all - at a most conservative figure - some 900 prisoners-of-war were put to death at that instance.\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/C...99Trifkovic.htm\n The incident is actually contained in Muslim sources - they are proud of Muhammed's cunning in gaining advantage of an alliance with this Jewish tribe - using them, then when they weren't needed - disposing of them.\n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa', the tribe of 'Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina.\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362)\n \n \n *Muir, Sir W (1923) \"The Life of Muhammad\", p240\n \n \n Jesus said to forgive one's enemies.\n\n \n :) \n Your sources are so weird. I would really like to read this boos \" The life of Muhammad\" and see the sources used in the book.\n \n This is the the story of \"Banu Quraithah's\" \n \"\n Banu Quraithah's Breach of Trust\n \n Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) who had been sent to Banu Quraithah during the Battle of Trench to bring them back to their senses, was treated rudely by them. He was hurt by an arrow during the battle of Trench. Due to his wound he did not join the expedition to Banu Quraithah. \n \n The Prophet (SAWS) handed over the standard to Ali Ibn Abu Talib (RA) and sent him ahead as the advance guard. Hua'i Ibn Akhtab was present in the fort of Banu Quraithah and was engaged in rousing them against the Muslims. The Muslims besieged the fort of Banu Quraithah and the siege continued for 25 days.\n \n The chief of Banu Quraithah was Ka'b Ibn Asad. When he saw that his people were unequal to face the charge of the Muslim troops, he assembled them all at one place. He said, \"There can be no doubt about Muhammad being the Prophet of Allah, for our heavenly Book carries clear and unequivocal prophecies about him and whose advent we have been waiting for. It appears fitting that we believe in him and thus safeguard our lives and our property.\" But the Banu Quraithah opposed this proposal tooth and nail. \n \n Ka'b Ibn Asad put forward another suggestion then and said, \"Kill your women and children first and then go out of the fort and give a fierce battle. If victory is won, women and children can be had again, and if defeated and killed, it will be a death of honor.\" Banu Quraithah rejected this offer too. Ka'b Ibn Asad presented a third alternative and said, \"Snipe at the Muslims on the night of Sabbath when we are not permitted to launch any invasion or carry out killing activities, the Muslims will be careless on this night and thus incur heavy losses.\" But they refused to agree to this proposal also for they did not like to violate the sanctity of Sabbath.\n \n Meanwhile, three persons from Banu Quraithah named Tha'labah Ibn Saeed, Asad Ibn Ubaid and Usaid Ibn Saeed, confessed Islam. A man named Amr Ibn Sa'd said, \"I admit that my people have committed a breach of trust and I cannot become a party to it.\" Saying this he left the fort.\n \n At last one morning, they sent a message to the Prophet (SAWS) that they would like to surrender on condition that Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) was allowed to suggest the punishment for them. He (SAWS) accepted the proposal. After Banu Quraithah consigned themselves to the Muslims, the Muslim Ansar of Banu Aus called on the Prophet (SAWS) and submitted: \"On the eve of the battles between the Aus and the Khazraj, Banu Quraithah would side with the Aus. You have set Banu Qainuqa' free in accordance with the will of the Khazraj. It is our turn now, please appoint from us a judge to decide the fate of Banu Quraithah.\" The Prophet (SAWS) said, \"I have already appointed Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath, the chief of the Aus to deliver his judgment about Banu Quraithah, while Banu Quraithah has also suggested his name for the role.\" Hearing this the Aus expressed utmost joy.\n \n At the same moment they left for the Prophet's Mosque where Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) was undergoing treatment for his injuries. They brought him to the Muslim troops. On the way they kept pressing Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) to make concession for Banu Quraithah. \n \n However, he told one and all that he would do nothing but justice. When Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) approached, the Prophet (SAWS) asked the Ansar to get up and pay regards to their chief. When he was told that the Prophet (SAWS) had entrusted to him the matter of Banu Quraithah, his old allies, Sa'd (RA) turned to his people and said, \"Tell me by an oath to Allah that you will accept my judgment with pleasure and without any objection to it.\" All of them expressed their total agreement. Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) put the same question to the Prophet (SAWS) and the Muhajirin, and they all agreed to abide by his judgment. \n \n Now Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) delivered his judgment: \"I enjoin that all the men of Banu Quraithah be put to death and their wives and children be treated like prisoners of war while their wealth and properties be divided among the Muslims.\" Following this judgment Banu Quraithah were ordered to come out of the fort and they were all brought to Al-Madinah in custody. At last, following the judgment, their men were killed and their dwellings were given to the Muslims. \n \n From: The History of Islam, Vol.1\n \"\n http://www.islamweb.net/php/php_arabic/readArt.php?lang=E&id=37137",

   "\"what does Islam say about the treatment of POWs?\"   \n \n In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. \n \n All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.  \n \n \n As Islam stands against waging war, especially against the innocents, it never overlooks the possibility that mankind may resort to war against each other. That&#8217;s why it shows keenness on regulating warfare, between Muslims and non-Muslims; it enumerates those that should not be killed or even targeted during the battles. Not only that, but Islam also sets rules regarding those taken as prisoners of war; how they should be treated and dealt with. \n \n Islam does not allow any form of abuse whether it is physical or sexual against the POWs. On the contrary, the Islamic texts have preceded the Geneva Convention in demanding clemency with captives and stressing that prisoners of war must be dealt with in an extremely merciful and kind manner. \n \n This is what is clarified by the late Sheikh Muhammad Abu Zahrah, in his book Concept of War in Islam; it reads: \n \n \"Islam advocates clemency with captives. History has never known warriors so merciful to their captives as the early Muslims who followed the teachings of their religion. Numerous religious texts demand clemency with captives. \n \n Prisoners are usually taken when a battle is at its height and there is danger that rage may lead the victorious warriors to harm those who have been defeated in order to take revenge. The Prophet, however urged his followers to treat their captives with clemency. He said to them &#8220;You are recommended to treat your captives kindly.&#8221;  He also urged his Companions on the day of Badr to be kind to their captives. Accordingly the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, gave their captive preference over themselves in matters of food. This is the tolerance of Islam and its respect for human dignity. \n \n In this way Muslims learned two kinds of Jihad. The first is Jihad on the battlefield where people give themselves to the cause of Allah and the second one is Jihad against one&#8217;s desires that restrains man&#8217;s rage and allows him to fight his foes with clemency and not in the accordance with the laws of the jungle. \n \n What are the teachings of Islam as regard the prisoners of war? Does Islam grant them freedom, ransom or enslave them to the Muslims? Here, we should again refer to the religious texts and the example given by the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. The most direct of these texts is Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates.\"  (Muhammad: 4) \n \n The Qur&#8217;anic verse thus provides alternatives: either the Muslim commander should free those captives who can not offer ransom either in the form of money or an equivalent number of Muslim captives, or he should ransom his captives for money or for a similar number of Muslim captives. This is what is now known as an exchange of prisoners. That kind of ransoming should be adopted, as it leads to the release of two big groups of people &#8211; Muslims and non-Muslims. \n \n The religion of freedom, therefore, esteems the freedom of those who do not follow it as much as it does that regarding its followers, for if the advocate of freedom is himself free, he will not make any discrimination on regional, racial or religious grounds, because freedom is a natural right to every human being. \n \n The Qur&#8217;anic verse does not mention a third choice, namely the enslavement of captives; the Qur&#8217;anic text explicitly forbids it by limiting the choice to only two alternatives &#8211; free dismissal or ransoming &#8211; without referring to enslavement. Thus enslavement is not involved in the choice. \n \n Moving to the Prophetic Tradition, we shall again find that the Prophet never enslaved a free man throughout his reign. His Companions did take some captives among the spoils in the conquest of &#8220;Bani al-Mustaliq&#8221; and turned them into salves. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not explicitly prohibit them from doing that, but his own action (of setting free a prisoner) prompted them to release their captives. \n \n This implies prohibitions of enslavement although it is not explicit. The Prophet avoided the enslavement of any free man in his wars; his actions tended towards its denunciation. He urged the manumission of those who had been enslaved. The Qur&#8217;an refers to the permissibility of slavery only to urge the emancipation of the enslaved. \n \n The time of the Companions was characterized by the intensification of clashes between the Muslims and the Byzantines in the West and between the Muslims and Persians in the East. The enslaving of captive was practiced in the wars of these nations. When they captured Muslims, they sold them as salves. Those early Muslims made their dealing with their enemies on a reciprocal basis. They therefore retaliated by enslaving their enemies, as it was not fair that the Muslim captives should be kept as slaves while enemy captives should enjoy their freedom. \n \n The Arab commanders found neither Prophetic text nor Qur&#8217;anic verse prohibiting slavery explicitly. They only found that the law of dealing on a reciprocal basis necessitated retaliation. Thus if the enemy enslaved a free Muslim it was the duty of Muslims to enslave an enemy captive in compliance with the verse: &#8220;If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah: 194). The Muslims fighters had therefore to enslave their enemies just as the latter had enslaved them. The sin lies with him who initiates the bad policy. \n \n The Muslims dealt justly with their enemies in compliance with the injunctions of their religion. Having been forced to allow themselves to enslave their enemies they also tolerated the same thing from their enemies when they captured Muslims. \n \n We may compare this wise policy in the treatment of captives with the modern practice which though not allowing the actual buying and selling of captives (as the slave trade has been abolished) yet it allows worse treatment. Captives of the vanquished party may be retained by the victor to do really hard work, while captives of the victor are released immediately after the cessation of hostilities.&#8221; \n \n Moreover, Sheikh `Atiya Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, adds: \n \n \"The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, urged Muslims to show good treatment to war captives; he said to his Companions: &#8220;Treat the prisoners of war kindly.&#8221; Relating how the Companions complied strictly with this order given by the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, one of the prisoners of Badr, Huzayr ibn Humayr, states: &#8220;I was with one of Ansari families, after being taken as captive. \n \n Whenever they had lunch or dinner, they used to give me preference by providing me with bread while they&#8217;d eat only dates, in showing compliance with the Prophet&#8217;s order of treating prisoners well.\" \n \n In light of the above-mentioned facts, it is crystal clear that Islam requires that prisoners of war, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, should be accorded with good treatment. \n http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=55158",

   " \"what does Islam say about the treatment of POWs?\" \n In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. \n ...\n As Islam stands against waging war, especially against the innocents, it never overlooks the possibility that mankind may resort to war against each other. That?s why it shows keenness on regulating warfare, between Muslims and non-Muslims; it enumerates those that should not be killed or even targeted during the battles. Not only that, but Islam also sets rules regarding those taken as prisoners of war; how they should be treated and dealt with. \n\n \n Yes, that's very nice to say. BUT the facts remain, from Haddith sources we can see that Muhammed Himself (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362) ordered them to be killed and Sura 32.25 - \"And He has caused to descend from their strongholds the Jews that assisted them. And he struck terror into their hearts. Some you slaughtered and some you took prisoner\"\n \n This is not an exceptional circumstance for often Muhammed had one rule for his followers, whilst he obeyed another - notably the rule on the number of wives. He ordered Muslims to have 4, whilst he had 9. Although I just discovered he might have had 11 (http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=13344&dgn=4) and that's also along with his concubines.\n \n \nIslam does not allow any form of abuse whether it is physical or sexual against the POWs. On the contrary, the Islamic texts have preceded the Geneva Convention in demanding clemency with captives and stressing that prisoners of war must be dealt with in an extremely merciful and kind manner. \n\n \n This simply is not true. I have shown you the verses, from Haddith amd Sura. You simply ignore this. Now, as Mizmaxx would have argued - I have misinterpreted these verses - so I offer you the opportunity to give your interpretation of them... to show that I have got it wrong.\n \n I also gave you the same opportunity two days ago with regards Muhammed's under-age wife. And you don't debate me on this by stating how or where I have mis-read it, you simply ask me to turn off my mind, to submit to its truth as you have.\n \n \nThis is what is clarified by the late Sheikh Muhammad Abu Zahrah, in his book Concept of War in Islam; it reads: \n \"Islam advocates clemency with captives. History has never known warriors so merciful to their captives as the early Muslims who followed the teachings of their religion. Numerous religious texts demand clemency with captives.\n\n \n Yes, like you we often hear spokesmen for Islam saying how generally wonderful Islam is. However, as I said, I've shown you the verses, you've not even contested that Muhammed did something else. All you do is come up with a monologue - although here you introduce someone else's monologue. What this guy doesn't say is that Muslims will allow PoWs to convert. If they convert, generally everything's fine. \n \n Let's look at the Koran\n Surah Muhammad\n 47.4 So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus [you are ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out Jihad against the disbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire) or at least come under your protection], but if it had been Allah's Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost,\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=27&bid=47\n \n How is this interpreted?\n \"Question : How are prisoners of war treated in Islam? \n Answer : Praise be to Allaah. \n Islam is the religion of mercy and justice; it commands us to call others to the religion of Allaah in a kind and good manner, and to encourage people to enter this great religion. If some people persist in rejecting the religion of Allaah and stand in the way of ruling by that which Allaah has revealed on earth, or they fight against the call to Allaah, then we give them the choice of three things: \n Either they become Muslim; or if they refuse they pay the jizyah (whereby they pay a specified amount to the Muslims in return for being allowed to remain their land, and the Muslims undertake to protect them); or, if they refuse that, there is nothing left but the way which they themselves have chosen, which is fighting and dealing violently with those who have persecuted the Muslims and put obstacles in the path of the Islamic da?wah.\"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=13241&dgn=4\n \n That is, conversion, submission to a special class of person, or death. Three choices. If you choose option number 2, submission, you loose most of your freedoms even after the war is over. This is nothing like the Geneva Treaty. Submission, you become 'dhimmi' or 'protected' (another ironic name choice). Dhimmi whold have to pay a special tax the rest of their lives (unless they subsequently convert), and also wear special clothing to set them aside from the rest of the (Moslem) population. Their testimony in a court is worth less than that of a Muislim.\n \n In light of the above-mentioned facts, it is not so crystal clear that Islam requires that prisoners of war, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, should be accorded with good treatment.\n \n I note you simply ignore what Muhammed himself did to 900 men. He even slept with one of the widows. Can you even begin to imagine how she must have felt? She just watched this man order the deaths of every adult male in her tribe, and then she had to go to his bed and become his!\n \n If you want a general comparison between, say the UN declaration on Human Rights, and Islam, visit\n http://www.geocities.com/islampencereleri3/is_islam_compatible.htm\n \n Look at freedom of religion; even within a household...\n \"Question : I know that Allah (S) has permitted us to marry Christians and the Jews. Now, can she practice her religious rites in the same house and have pictures of the crucifiction of Jesus (A) and celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas and etc. Can her kids join her? If no, would not it hurt her feelings? Please, answer me on this issue.\n \n Answer : Praise be to Allaah.\n It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=3320&dgn=4\n \n \n I am at a slight disadvantage as I can't find my book on Dhimmitude by Bat Ye'or, but when I do, you shall hear from it too!",

   " Do you have any response to Muhammad sleeping with an under-age girl (albeit someone he married)? I have read many attempts to explain this away to a western-educated audience and would very much like to see what approach you would take. \n\n \nThen you are looking for my answer just to see what approach i would talk? \n I hope this is not the reason for your question. I hope that you asked the question because ( You think) that i Would put in the truth. \n before answering the question, you should know that there are a lot of woman in the Arab world still tell 2 generation ago getting married at an age of 9 - 10 -11 - 12, and that seem so normal, for any couple to get married at an early age. it is something in our culture and the woman do not get forced for the marriage. According to Islamic Law, women cannot be forced to marry anyone without their consent. \n ? Ibn Abbas reported that a girl came to the Messenger of God, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she reported that he father had forced her to marry without her consent. The Messenger of God gave her the choice? (between accepting the marriage or invalidating it)? (Ibn Hanbal No. 2469). In another version,? the girl said: Actually I accept this marriage but I wanted to let women know that parents have no right (to force a husband on them)? (Ibn Maja, No.1873). \n http://www.islamland.org/books1/wam..._woman.htm#sub4 \"\n\n \n And how does a child decide not to be married?\n Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children\n \"Child marriage robs a girl of her childhood-time necessary to develop physically, emotionally and psychologically. In fact, early marriage inflicts great emotional stress as the young woman is removed from her parents' home to that of her husband and in-laws. Her husband, who will invariably be many years her senior, will have little in common with a young teenager. It is with this strange man that she has to develop an intimate emotional and physical relationship. She is obliged to have intercourse, although physically she might not be fully developed.\"\n http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs23.htm\n Note this is looking at the effects on girls 11 years up - not even from 9 years, when Ai'sha was forced to be married.\n \n \nThe reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married ?Aa?ishah despite the age difference \n \"\n Answer : \n Praise be to Allaah. \n The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married ?Aa?ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam?ah (may Allaah be pleased with her). She ? ?Aa?ishah ? was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old. \n 1 ? He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of ?Aa?ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: ?You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, ?This is your wife.? I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, ?If this is from Allaah then it will come to pass.?? (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181. \n\n \n Yes, I already mentioned this, he was dreaming about her being naked, when she was 4 or 5. He was close to 50 at the time.\n \n2 ? The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had noticed in ?Aa?ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings. \n\n I know many smart children. I was even considered one myself. However, these are still children.\n \"Sexual contact between children and adults: A life course perspective.\"\n Browning, Christopher R; Laumann, Edward O \n Citation: American Sociological Review, v62n4, pp.540-560, Aug 1997 \n Number: 03374356 Features: Table; Illustration; References \n Copyright: American Sociological Association 1997 \n \"Research interest in the long-term effects of sexual contact between female children and adults has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Two sets of issues have driven this enhanced attention. The first concerns the nature and extent of the impact these experiences have on subsequent well-being in adulthood. Empirical research has offered evidence of the severe and wide ranging effects of adult-child sex by documenting its associations with a host of later \"symptoms,\" such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.\"\n quoted in http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n3 ? The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets. \n\n \"In the book \"One River\", by Wade Davis, page 228, (Simon & Schuster), Davis documents how when young girls are subjected to intercourse with an adult male, their hips get damaged, because their bones are not fully formed:\n \"These were Loayza's concubines, Indian children who grew into adolescence physically deformed, their hips weak and permanently dislocated from intercourse.\"\n I am not saying that Aisha had deformed hips, or that Muhammad brutalized her. I am saying that just because a girl has her 1st menstrual cycle doesn't mean she qualifies as an adult. There are other factors that need to be considered. Islam however, fails to consider these factors.\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n With regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage. \n If you think ? may Allaah guide you ? that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than ?Aa?ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet?s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc. \n\n How does a nine year old gain physical enjoyment from sex?\n Check out\n Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children\n Traditional cultural practices reflect values and beliefs held by members of a community for periods often spanning generations. Every social grouping in the world has specific traditional cultural practices and beliefs, some of which are beneficial to all members, while others are harmful to a specific group, such as women. These harmful traditional practices include female genital mutilation (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price. Despite their harmful nature and their violation of international human rights laws, such practices persist because they are not questioned and take on an aura of morality in the eyes of those practising them.\n http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs23.htm\n \nSuch slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allaah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee?ah. \n And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=e...&QR=44990&dgn=4 \n\n If Allah was true, then he would have seen the damage such practices would do to young girls every where. Instead, what fed this line of rulings was the sexual appetite of Muhammed who lusted after a girl since she was 5, and barely held himself back.\n And we have evidence of the negative affect on her...\n \"Another such study was done by Peter O. Ebigbo. In the German periodical for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychoanalysis his work was published. The abstract reads,\n Presents data on disturbed female clients whose marriages were arranged at age 9-13 years. When husbands had paid the dowry and fulfilled marriage customs, they were entitled to have sexual intercourse with their wives. Early sexual experience, mostly against the will of the underage girls, precipitated positive or negative reactions. In positive reaction cases, an imprinting fixation on the man took place. If the man died or rejected the young women, a disorientation took place, resulting mostly in an inability to have sexual relationships with other men. If the reaction was negative, the women did all she could to prevent sexual relationships with her husband through a variety of symptoms such as frequent pregnancies and secret love affairs.\"\n A quick review of Aisha's life, during and following Muhammad's death, shows that she exhibited some psychological problems:\n 1) She was extremely jealous of some of Muhammad's other wives.\n From Bukhari, 5.164:\n Narrated 'Aisha: \n I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija (although) she died before he married me, for I often heard him mentioning her, and Allah had told him to give her the good tidings that she would have a palace of Qasab (i.e. pipes of precious stones and pearls in Paradise), and whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would send her women-friends a good share of it.\n 2) She conspired with other wives and lied to and deceived Muhammad.\n From Bukhari 7.192:\n Narrated 'Ubaid bin 'Umar:\n I heard 'Aisha saying, \"The Prophet used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house. So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us, she should say him, \"I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' \" So the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet said, \"Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore.\" So there was revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you ... If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,' (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. 'When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.' (66.3) namely his saying: But I have taken some honey.\"\n 3) She was a ringleader in the first Muslim civil war... the first time Muslims took arms up against other Muslims. According to the Hadith, Muslims went to hell for fighting in support of her. In the \"Battle of the Camel\", thousands of Muslims were killed fighting against each other. Aisha's side lost, and she was basically put under house arrest by Ali.\n From Bukhari 9.204:\n Narrated Al-Hasan:\n (Al-Ahnaf said) I went out carrying my arms during the nights of the affliction (i.e. the war between 'Ali and 'Aisha) and Abu Bakra met me and asked, \"Where are you going?\" I replied, \"I intend to help the cousin of Allah's Apostle (i.e., 'Ali).\" Abu Bakra said, \"Allah's Apostle said, 'If two Muslims take out their swords to fight each other, then both of them will be from amongst the people of the Hell-Fire.' It was said to the Prophet, 'It is all right for the killer but what about the killed one?' He replied, 'The killed one had the intention to kill his opponent.'\"\n 5.116: \n Narrated Abu Wail:\n When 'Ali sent 'Ammar and Al-Hasan to (the people of) Kufa to urge them to fight, 'Ammar addressed them saying, \"I know that she (i.e. 'Aisha) is the wife of the Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter (world to come), but Allah has put you to test, whether you will follow Him (i.e. Allah) or her.\"\n So not only did Aisha help cause the death of thousands of Muslim men, she is pictured as acting against the very will of Allah.\n One can only feel sorry for Aisha. Robbed of her childhood, becoming a bride to a man who had a large sexual appetite for many women, Aisha felt she had to at times lie to and deceive Muhammad to keep his attention. She ends up after her marriage to him, left all alone, forbidden to re-marry. Later, she helps lead the first Muslim civil war, causing the death of thousands of Muslims, who according to Islam, would go to hell for fighting each other. Finally defeated, she is not executed but ordered to live the rest of her days, basically under house arrest, in Medina.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm",

   "Your sources are so weird. I would really like to read this boos (sic) \" The life of Muhammad\" and see the sources used in the book.\n\n I quote haddiths. The odd thing about you calling my sources odd, is that you are about to say what I said... the PoWs were all killed. Only, you take longer to say it :)\n \nThis is the the story of \"Banu Quraithah's\" \n \"\n Banu Quraithah's Breach of Trust\n Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) who had been sent to Banu Quraithah during the Battle of Trench to bring them back to their senses, was treated rudely by them. He was hurt by an arrow during the battle of Trench. Due to his wound he did not join the expedition to Banu Quraithah. \n The Prophet (SAWS) handed over the standard to Ali Ibn Abu Talib (RA) and sent him ahead as the advance guard. Hua'i Ibn Akhtab was present in the fort of Banu Quraithah and was engaged in rousing them against the Muslims. The Muslims besieged the fort of Banu Quraithah and the siege continued for 25 days.\n \n The chief of Banu Quraithah was Ka'b Ibn Asad. When he saw that his people were unequal to face the charge of the Muslim troops, he assembled them all at one place. He said, \"There can be no doubt about Muhammad being the Prophet of Allah, for our heavenly Book carries clear and unequivocal prophecies about him and whose advent we have been waiting for. It appears fitting that we believe in him and thus safeguard our lives and our property.\" But the Banu Quraithah opposed this proposal tooth and nail. \n \n Ka'b Ibn Asad put forward another suggestion then and said, \"Kill your women and children first and then go out of the fort and give a fierce battle. If victory is won, women and children can be had again, and if defeated and killed, it will be a death of honor.\" Banu Quraithah rejected this offer too. Ka'b Ibn Asad presented a third alternative and said, \"Snipe at the Muslims on the night of Sabbath when we are not permitted to launch any invasion or carry out killing activities, the Muslims will be careless on this night and thus incur heavy losses.\" But they refused to agree to this proposal also for they did not like to violate the sanctity of Sabbath.\n \n Meanwhile, three persons from Banu Quraithah named Tha'labah Ibn Saeed, Asad Ibn Ubaid and Usaid Ibn Saeed, confessed Islam. A man named Amr Ibn Sa'd said, \"I admit that my people have committed a breach of trust and I cannot become a party to it.\" Saying this he left the fort.\n \n At last one morning, they sent a message to the Prophet (SAWS) that they would like to surrender on condition that Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) was allowed to suggest the punishment for them. He (SAWS) accepted the proposal. After Banu Quraithah consigned themselves to the Muslims, the Muslim Ansar of Banu Aus called on the Prophet (SAWS) and submitted: \"On the eve of the battles between the Aus and the Khazraj, Banu Quraithah would side with the Aus. You have set Banu Qainuqa' free in accordance with the will of the Khazraj. It is our turn now, please appoint from us a judge to decide the fate of Banu Quraithah.\" The Prophet (SAWS) said, \"I have already appointed Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath, the chief of the Aus to deliver his judgment about Banu Quraithah, while Banu Quraithah has also suggested his name for the role.\" Hearing this the Aus expressed utmost joy.\n At the same moment they left for the Prophet's Mosque where Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) was undergoing treatment for his injuries. They brought him to the Muslim troops. On the way they kept pressing Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) to make concession for Banu Quraithah. \n However, he told one and all that he would do nothing but justice. When Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) approached, the Prophet (SAWS) asked the Ansar to get up and pay regards to their chief. When he was told that the Prophet (SAWS) had entrusted to him the matter of Banu Quraithah, his old allies, Sa'd (RA) turned to his people and said, \"Tell me by an oath to Allah that you will accept my judgment with pleasure and without any objection to it.\" All of them expressed their total agreement. Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) put the same question to the Prophet (SAWS) and the Muhajirin, and they all agreed to abide by his judgment. \n Now Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath (RA) delivered his judgment: \"I enjoin that all the men of Banu Quraithah be put to death and their wives and children be treated like prisoners of war while their wealth and properties be divided among the Muslims.\" Following this judgment Banu Quraithah were ordered to come out of the fort and they were all brought to Al-Madinah in custody. At last, following the judgment, their men were killed and their dwellings were given to the Muslims. \n \n From: The History of Islam, Vol.1\n \"\n http://www.islamweb.net/php/php_arabic/readArt.php?lang=E&id=37137\n (emphasis mine)\n \n Are you aware that the source you quote simply confirms what I said?

   "Here's a few articles from the Amnesty International web-site, and others about Muslims persecuting Christians\n \"URGENT ACTION \n Yemen: Torture/prisoner of conscience/death penalty: Mohamed Omar Haji\n PUBLIC AI Index: MDE 31/05/00\n UA 208/00 Torture/prisoner of conscience/death penalty 11 July 2000\n \n YEMEN Mohamed Omar Haji, Somali national, aged 27 Mohamed Omar Haji has been put on trial for converting to Christianity from Islam, which carries the death penalty. He has allegedly been tortured to force him to recant. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience.\n The Yemeni authorities may deport him to any country, where he could face human rights violations.\n \n Mohamed Omar Haji has been arrested several times since January 2000 for \n converting to Christianity. Police allegedly beat and threatened to kill him to \n force him to recant during interrogation at al-Tawahi police station in Aden.\n \n He has since been brought before a court in Aden at least twice, charged with apostasy (turning away from Islam), which is punishable by death unless the offender declares before the court that he has returned to Islam. The trial is continuing. If he is sentenced to death, under Yemeni law he will go through a lengthy appeal process and face a long time in prison.\n http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGMDE310052000\n \n BRUNEI DARUSSALAM\n Three prisoners of conscience were detained for nine months for alleged ''subversive'' activities related to their peaceful Christian beliefs. More than 20 others were reported to have been questioned, with some detained for over three weeks. Amendments to press laws introduced a series of restrictions to press freedoms. Death sentences continued to be passed and a number of people convicted of criminal offences were reportedly subjected to corporal punishment.\n Background\n The monarch, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, continued to exercise a wide range of executive powers, holding the offices of Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Finance Minister and head of the police. Under the 1962 state of emergency, constitutional provisions safeguarding fundamental liberties remained suspended. The sole remaining opposition party, reported to have less than 200 members, was largely inactive.\n Arrests under the Internal Security Act (ISA)\n The ISA allows the Minister of Home Affairs, on the orders of the Sultan, to detain any person deemed to be a threat to national security. The Minister is empowered to sign two-year detention orders, renewable indefinitely. ISA detainees are denied their rights to a trial, to legal counsel and to be presumed innocent. During prolonged interrogation, while held in isolation and denied access to lawyers, family members and independent medical attention, ISA detainees are at risk of ill-treatment or torture.\n Three men, Yunus Murang, Freddie Chong and Malai Taufick, were arrested under the ISA in December 2000 and held for nine months. The three prisoners of conscience, all reportedly Christians linked to the Borneo Evangelical Church Mission, were accused of '' activities which sought to convert ''by deception'' members of the country's majority Muslim community and so threatened inter-religious harmony. According to reports, the three detainees were subjected to intense psychological pressure, including threats of indefinite detention without trial, unless they confessed to ''subversive'' activities or cooperated in a process of Islamic re-education. At least one detainee was reported to be have been held for two months in a darkened cell. The three were released in October after signing a statement regretting their ''past involvement in subversive activities'', taking an oath of allegiance to the Sultan and pledging not to repeat their alleged wrongdoings.\n http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2002.nsf/bed8009ca83e16c780256a4f00344f2f/ff6228ce7fbdf8d780256bc0003b38bb?OpenDocument\n \n Eritrea: Prisoners of Conscience / Torture or ill-treatment\n PUBLIC AI Index: AFR 64/002/2004\n UA 101/04 Prisoners of Conscience / Torture or ill-treatment 09 March 2004\n ERITREA Pastor Mengist Tewelde-Medhin (m);and 55 members of the Hallelujah Pentecostal Christian church \n Police and security officers arrested Pastor Mengist Tewelde-Medhin, and 55 women, children and men from the Hallelujah Pentecostal Christian church in the capital Asmara on 12 February. They were arrested at a religious service in a private home and most are still being held incommunicado, without charge or trial, in police stations or army camps. They are allegedly being ill-treated or tortured in order to force them to abandon their faith.\n The head of church, Pastor Mengist Tewelde-Medhin, is reportedly being held at Adi Abeto military prison near Asmara, in harsh conditions. Like other members of the church, he is said to be under pressure to abandon his religion. Amnesty International considers all the detained members of the Hallelujah Pentecostal Christian church to be prisoners of conscience, who are being imprisoned for practicing their religion. There are also concerns for their safety as those held in military custody are at risk of torture, which often includes the \"helicopter\" method of being tied in a contorted position in the open air for a week or more, almost 24 hours a day. \n Following their arrest, about 18 church members were taken to Mai Serwa military prison and punished for evading national service, which is compulsory for all males and females aged over 18. They are reportedly locked up in metal shipping containers, where conditions are said to be suffocating and in which temperatures range from zero degrees at night to 28 degrees in the day. \n Amnesty International is also deeply concerned about the unlawful detention and ill-treatment of children in military or non-juvenile police custody, contrary to the international and regional child conventions to which Eritrea is a party? the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. \n Twenty-five girls and boys were arrested and taken to the main Sawa military training centre, where they were locked up in a shipping container and forced to do farm work. Younger children were arrested and held unlawfully in police custody for several days until their parents were finally allowed to take them home after being made to sign a statement declaring they would no longer practice their religion. Older men and women were detained in police stations without charge or trial and also coerced into abandoning their faith. Some were subsequently released when they signed a statement in which they promised not to worship again. \n BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n Persecution on the grounds of religion has intensified in Eritrea since the closure of \"minority\" Christian churches in May 2002. There have been arrests \n in the past year of hundreds of \"home worshippers\" or military conscripts found with bibles. No official explanation has been given for the crackdown on the \n minority churches, which has not affected the officially-recognized Orthodox, Catholic and Lutheran churches. The crackdown appears to be partly related to \n official action against young people trying to evade military service and against parents accused of assisting them to hide or flee the country. The \n dozen or more minority churches are not linked to the political dissidents in prison, and only the Jehovah?s Witnesses oppose military service as a matter of \n religious principle.\n http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAFR640022004\n \n In February 2002 a Muslim mob, including Palestinian Authority Special Forces, burned Christian businesses and attempted to destroy the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in Ramallah. The attack occurred after a Christian man killed a Muslim while being pursued by a Muslim gang because he refused to pay protection money for safe passage to his home.\"\n http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_current_christians.php\n \n See also\n THE BELEAGUERED CHRISTIANS OF THE PALESTINIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS\n http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=14002\n Arafat's Terrorism Threatens Christians and Christian Sites ...

   "Um, hello, TruthKeeper, these seven claims are basically the same as nearly every other single religious book around the world. You have not said what really makes it different from the other religious books.\n \n 1. Inimitable\n It dares you to disprove it. How? It says that humans cannot write a book like this even if they pooled all their resources together and got help also from the spirits. The Qur&#8217;an said this fourteen hundred years ago and yet no one has been able to disprove it. Billions of books have been written-but not another one like the Qur&#8217;an.\n \n Interestingly enough, the Bible people have made the same claim about the Bible: \"The Bible is not a book that man could write if he would, or would write if he could.\" The Bible does not honour man, but God. The people in teh Bible have feet of clay; they are shown \"warts and all\". Against the backdrop of their sinfulness and unfaithfulness, God's holiness and faithfulness shine through. Even the heories of the faith (Heb. 11) have their failures recorded, including Noah (Gen. 9:20-24), Moses (Num. 20:7-12), David (2 Sam. 11), Elijah (1 Kings 19), and Peter (Matt. 26:74). On the other hand, the enemies of God's people are often praised - for example, Artaxerxes - don't ask me how to pronouce that one - (Neh. 2), Darius the Mede (Dan. 6), and Julius (Acts 27:1-3). These are clear indications that the Bible was not written from a human persepective.\n \n Does the book make any predictions (or prophecies) about future events in the years since it was first put together and now that have been accurate? If so, could you please write them out?\n \n Does it make any scientific statements, such as the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7)? Once again, please list.\n \n Is it historically accurate? Has anyone stated that it is historically reliable. Who, and what was their comments?\n \n Does it have a life-transforming message? For example, can it change the lives of \"down-and-outers\" or women trapped in degraded lives, such as prostitution? \n \n Does it have a civilizing influence? For example, has it ever elevated blood-drinking \"barbarians\" to decency?\n \n I have outlined these questions in an easy to answer format. I ask these because the Bible answers all these with a yes. I very much doubt that you will find one line of accurate prophecy in the Qur&#8217;an. The Bible contains 61 documented prophecies regarding Jesus alone. Many of these, such as His place, time, and manner of birth, betrayal, manner of death, burial, etc., were beyond His control. An example is in Isaiah where it is written that \"He [the Messiah - Jesus] was wounded for our transgressions\"; this was nearly four hundred plus years before Jesus appeared on Earth. McDowell also throughouly documents 12 detailed, specific prophecies regarding Tyre, Sidon, Samaria, Gaza, Jerusalem, Palestine and others. [Can be found in McDowell, J., 1972. \"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\".] The Bible has elevated the blood-drinking \"barbarians\" of teh British Isles to decency. Unless it makes any predictions or comments on things that can be tested or observed today, it cannot be proved to be infallible, nor can it be disproved.\n \n 2. Incorruptible\n It is the only religious sacred writing that has been in circulation for such a long time and yet remains as pure as it was in the beginning.  \n \n And the Bible hasn't? Despite being penned by more than 40 authors from over 19 different walks of life over some 1,600 years, teh Bible is a consistent revelation from teh beginning to the end. Indeed, the first and last books of the Bible, Genesis and Revelation, dovetail so perfectly - telling of \"Paradise Lost\" and \"Paradise Regained\" respectively - that they speak powerfully of their divine authorship. The Bible has nearly been destroyed and wiped off the face of the Earth, by the Roman Emperor Diocletian firstly, but is today availble in far more languages than any other book.\n \n 3. Unsurpassable\n The Qur&#8217;an is God&#8217;s final revelation to humankind. God revealed the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and finally the Qur&#8217;an to Muhammad. Peace be upon Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad. No other book will come from God to surpass His final revelation.\n \n And you know this how? Have you read the other holy books (there are a lot of them around)? I think I can safely assume that you have not are just enspousing rhetoric that you have heard from fellow believers. By what definition and characteristics do you judge \"surpass His final revelation\" on? \n \n 4. Indisputable\n The Qur&#8217;an withstands the test of time and scrutiny. No one can dispute the truth of this book. It speaks about past history and turns out right. It speaks about the future in prophecies and it turns out right. It mentions details of physical phenomena which were not known to people at the time; yet later scientific discoveries prove that the Qur&#8217;an was right all along. Every other book needs to be revised to accord with modern knowledge. The Qur&#8217;an alone is never contradicted by a newly discovered scientific fact.\n \n Once again, unless it makes prophecies that can be observed or tested on (either today or a few thousand years ago) it can never be proved. I have made the next few paragraphs in the easy to answer form. \n \n Please list the accurate prophecies and historical validity.\n \n Please list these \"physical phenomena which were not known to people at the time\" and the \"scientific discoveries that proved the Qur'an was right all along\". \n \n You last statements are totally false. For one, the Bible does not have to be revised to accord with modern day scientific fact. The Bible states many scientificly accurate verses, such as the Earth is round; the stars are countless - people of old thought that the stars could be counted - there were about 1200 visible stars); the hydrologic cycle; sea currents; living things reproduce after their kind; many insights into health, hygiene; diet; physiology; the two most fundamental laws of physics, the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa. 51:6) and many other things [see Morris, H. M., 1984. \"The Biblical Basis of Modern Science\".] I'm not to informed of any scientific predictions of the Qur'an, so I will await for you to produce some examples to back up your statement.\n \n 5. Your Roadmap for Life and Afterlife\n The Qur&#8217;an is the best guidebook on how to structure your life. No other book presents such a comprehensive system involving all aspects of human life and endeavor. The Qur&#8217;an also points out the way to secure everlasting happiness in the afterlife. It is your roadmap showing how to get to Paradise.\n \n So does the Bible, the Hindu's holy book and nearly every other religious book in the world. Even the ancient Egyptians believed that they had a \"roadmap for the after-life\". We cannot test the after-life part, so we do not know whether or not it is true. It must be taken by blind faith if it is believed.\n \n 6. God&#8217;s Gift of Guidance\n God has not left you alone. You were made for a reason. God tells you why he made you, what he demands from you and what he has in store for you. If you operate a machine contrary to it&#8217;s manufacturer&#8217;s specification you will ruin that machine. What about you? Do you have an owner&#8217;s manual for yourself? The Qur&#8217;an is from your Maker. It is a gift for you to make sure you function for success, lest you fail to function.It is a healing from God. It satisfies the soul, and cleans the heart. It removes doubts and brings peace.\n \n Once again, so does most other holy books. Jeremiah 29:11 for instance says, \"For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" Every holy book states in one way or another what the Qur'an says.\n \n 7. Your Calling Card to Communicate with your Lord\n Humans are social creatures. We love to communicate with other intelligent life. The Qur&#8217;an tells us how to communicate with the source of all intelligence and the source of all life-the One God. The Qur&#8217;an tells us who God is, by what name we should address Him, and the way in which to communicate with Him.\n \n Once again, so do every other holy book. You have presented nothing special in the past three arguments.\n \n For one thing, Jesus Christ is a live Saviour&#8212;after having been raised from the dead, he appeared to over 500 eyewitnesses [1 Corinthians 15:6]&#8212;while the founders of other religions decayed in their tombs.\n \n The article Holy books? might help you see that the Bible is in fact the one which is different from the other holy books. The following is just a bit from that article:\n \n While we are here on earth, it&#8217;s hard for us to test what each &#8220;holy book&#8221; says about heavenly things. But where books make claims about earthly things2 &#8230; aha! Here&#8217;s something we can test. Which book best explains the earth&#8217;s geology: why we find mountainous layers upon layers of sediments that look like they were pushed up and folded while still wet, and with dead animals and plants buried in them, all over the world? The Bible! Which book best explains biology: why plants and animals reproduce &#8220;after their kind&#8221;, why we have male and female, why women have pain in childbearing, why we have an ever-increasing number of mutations and genetic disorders&#8212;as if the creation is in &#8220;bondage to decay&#8221; [Romans 8:20&#8211;22]? The Bible! \n \n &#8216;And what about the number and distribution of humans around the world&#8212;calculating backwards using standard population growth rates gives us a handful of ancestors around 4,500 years ago, somewhere in the Middle East&#8212;doesn&#8217;t that fit with what the Bible says?3 Doesn&#8217;t it explain why scientists now say &#8220;race&#8221; is biologically meaningless, as if we are of &#8220;one blood&#8221; [Acts 17:26]?\n \n &#8216;And agriculture: is it just coincidence that many of our crop plants have been traced back to the &#8220;Fertile Crescent&#8221; between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which just &#8220;happens&#8221; to be where the Bible says Babel was located? \n \n &#8216;But here&#8217;s the linchpin: no other &#8220;holy book&#8221; that I know of describes death as an &#8220;enemy&#8221; [1 Cor. 15:26], which is what it clearly is. Just watch mourners grieving over the death of a loved one; it&#8217;s obvious that something&#8217;s wrong, death is an intruder, just as the Bible describes. And the Bible not only accurately describes the problem, but also the only logical solution.4 So, if in things that we can test, the Bible wins hands down, which &#8220;holy book&#8221; are you going to trust?&#8217;",
