It's done nothing for Chrysler to be yoked to Daimler, has it?\n\n \n Chrysler is profitable on an operating basis and had 1st quarter sales increases, even with the largest inventory of unsold vehicles and highest incentives in the domestic industry.\n \n That says a lot for Daimler's management influence in a tough US market where domestics are bleeding red ink and dropping market share without pause. I'm not aware of how much of the old Chrysler lifer group is still with Daimler-Chrysler, but many of the top ones were eliminated in quick order after the merger. \n \n Daimler-Chrysler is now poised to, in their words, play the German card for Chrysler brands. Daimler-Chrysler's chairman will begin appearing in US TV ads in an attempt to identify Chrysler with quality German products to distance the company from Ford/GM poor reputations and problems with entrenched management. I'd think that had something to do with Carl Ikan's influence on the GM board in virtually ordering Wagoner to meet with Renault. Wagoner may have a big Motor City ego left over from the good old days, but Ikan cares only about results and money. As Wagoner should. \n \n The clean broom worked at Chrysler, as it has in most turnarounds where fresh management is capable of making the tough decisions and implementing effective policy. If its going to avoid BK, GM needs someone to shake it up and maybe that's Renault's Goshen and some of his policies, who certainly proved his worth at then failing Nissan.",

Additionally, their projections showed only a 8-10% decrease in demand at that price.\n \n I finally found some copies of these auto industry reports and they are all essentailly based on the prmise that the price of gas exists in a vacum...that is, the price of gas woudl not have any real effect on other energy prices or the price of living outside of transportation expenses. Their calcualtions are essentially based on gas being $4 per gallon, but no other prices increasing.\n \n All I can say is...WOW...what a bunch of XXXXXX. \n \n There is an old saying \"As goes GM goes America\". It seems that it still holds true. The problems with GM are essentially poor management, poor financial strategy, unproductive, overpaid workers, and a world view that is at best sickly optimistic and in reality closer to completely delusional.",
