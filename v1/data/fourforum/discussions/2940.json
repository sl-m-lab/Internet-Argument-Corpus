I get owned in that level can someone help me? :xbanghead\n\n That part almost made me smash my xbox into shreddy little pieces and throw it out the window. :xbanghead First kill off his minions. Then instead of you attacking it. Let it attack you! In one of his moves he will use all of his strenght into hitting you. Right before he hits do a backwards summersault and dodge his attack. Then quickly do the \"running up the person's body and while in the air slice him many a times\" move. Keep on doing this and in no time you'll suck up that monster into that little dagger of yours. (Dont worry that's probably the hardest boss in the whole game!)",
