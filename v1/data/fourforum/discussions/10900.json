   "Considering how \"inevitable\" Hillary's nomination was once viewed, I'm pleased with Obama's showing yesterday. Salon has him currently leading the delegate count. http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/05/election_results/ But all the votes aren't in and there are primaries to come. \n \n I'm getting concerned about my state of Michigan's delegates ultimately counting for Clinton, which seems patently unfair since she was the only one on the ballot. (Other than Kucinich who eventually tried to withdraw but couldn't by that time, and Dodd who had already dropped out.) Obama and Edwards had their names removed but she did not. Here's a good discussion of the issue. http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14366.html If she ultimately gets the nomination, I would like to be able to support her, but if she does so by this kind of underhanded maneuvering, it's going to be very difficult. \n \n It looks like McCain has the Republican nomination sewed up and I don't know what that might mean for the general election. Given the public's weariness of the Iraq war, and his enthusiasm to stay a \"hundred years\", I would think it's unelectable, but then again, GWBush was re-elected so I don't underestimate the Republicans. \n \n This is the most interesting election I can remember.\n \n What do you all think? Will Obama prevail over Clinton? Obama or Clinton versus McCain, who wins?",

   "Whichever one wins will make make McCain look like a crazy old man. In last several elections it has been the better looking more charismatic person that has won. \n \n Clinton vs Bush\n Clinton vs Dole\n Bush vs Gore\n Bush vs Kerry\n \n Now we come to either \n Obama vs McCain\n Or Obama vs Clinton\n \n Both Obama and Clinton are powerful charismatic speakers.\n \n I hope it is Obama and he is right he has the power to take the white house. Who do you think people are going to vote for, McCain, who wants to spend a 100 or even a 1000 years in Iraq or Obama or Clinton both of whom will end the war.",

Neither have said they will pull out, but somehow you have blended together stories from the media to imagine a \"truth\" you desire.\n\n \n What do you mean, \"neither have said they'd pull out\"? \n \n Introduces the Iraq Troop Reduction & Protection Act of 2007\n \n Washington, DC - Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton renewed her call on President Bush to reverse course and endorse the plan she outlined several weeks ago that would cap the level of U.S. troops in Iraq at the number prior to his escalation plan, and begin the long overdue phased redeployment of U.S. troops out of Iraq beginning in 90 days. Senator Clinton outlined her plan when she returned last month from her third trip to Iraq and is formally introduced the legislation yesterday. \n \n I have also called on the Administration to be clear that the United States will not seek and will not maintain permanent bases in Iraq. Attempts to establish such permanent bases would damage U.S. interests in Iraq and the broader region, and I will continue to strongly oppose such efforts. http://www.senate.gov/~clinton/news/statements/record.cfm?id=269481\n \n Bringing Our Troops Home\n Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al Qaeda attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al Qaeda. http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/\n \n If you want direct quotes from their speeches, you can do your own homework because they both have said it.",
