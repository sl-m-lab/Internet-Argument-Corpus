   "Since everyone on TV now agrees that the Swiftboat ads should be condemned for being nothing but a pack of lies, should John Kerry condemn the movie, Fahrenheit 9/11, since a lot of people are saying that it is a bunch of lies?\n \n What do you think?\n \n For the people that said they would never watch the movie, I have attached a copy of the transcript. Michael Moore won't make a penny from your reading it. Maybe some of you can point out the lies, and show why John Kerry should condemn it.",

Kerry says he'll debate Bush every week until the election. Man, that would be awesome. I think Kerry will tear Bush up in ANY debate. I really wish that Bush would agree to it. I know its a tactic to make Bush look chicken, but it would be sooooooo entertaining to see Bush squirm once a week until he loses.",
