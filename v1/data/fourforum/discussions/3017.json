These groups are dangerous Ladywolf, There is so much evidence to support that. Even the founders of \"Exodus\" left it saying they were doing more harm than good. The NASW, APA and other reputable organizations in behavioral health have all come out against groups like Narth and Exodus. There is an interesting and surprisingly unbaised website called Ex-gay watch. They seem to promote both sides of the story. You can google it and it should come up.",

That is your right to do so. But just because you don't like it doesn't change it or make it go away.\n The fact that you are completely unwilling to accept gays own experiences and are so willing to force feed your personal ideals on any individual suggests a tad bit of Meglomanicy. \n Honey, get some help. \n Anger management would be my suggestion.",

Exodus was started by a group of individuals who wanted to change their orientation because of what they were taught the bible said. Two of those individuals were Gary Cooper and Michael Bussee. After many years of trying and many a horror story later. Both left exodus and made it public that no one in the group had changed. Many attempted suicide, some just left the group, others mutilated themselves. They left the group because they believed it was doing more harm than good. They were destroying lives! \n \n When the founders of an organization leave the organziation and admit thet were wrong to start it! You have to question the people who still run it!",
