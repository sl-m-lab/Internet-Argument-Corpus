Try it again.\n \n \n...but one question comes to mind:\n Are the alternative sources not cost-effective today specifically because of King Oil's dominance? In other words, if we were to switch to hydrogen-based energy, wouldn't we begin to see a more reasonable EROEI? \n\n Hydrogen is not an energy source. It takes energy to be able to use hydrogen as a fuel. Based on what I've read, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that you will never get more energy out of hydrogen fuels than the energy that was used to produce those fuels. \n \n The other interesting question this brings up, though, is that even if we ARE able to find an alternative, renewable source of energy to replace oil... will we be able to implement it quickly enough to fulfill the ever-increasing demand? Based on what I've read, there isn't anything that's even close to ready to bridge the gap.\n \n Here's a particular site that discusses alternative energy sources:\n http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/052703_9_questions.html\n \n Here, Lee R. Raymond, Exxon Mobil CEO, states:\n http://www.energybulletin.net/newswire.php?id=624\n \"And what about hydrogen? \n \n Many have great hopes for hydrogen and it does have some considerable promise, but only some decades in the future. First, hydrogen is not an energy source. It does not exist freely in nature. Before it can be used as a fuel it must be separated from something else, such as petroleum or natural gas or water. Liberating hydrogen from oil and gas is well understood, but is expensive, and the process requires considerable energy. Liberating hydrogen from water is also understood, but even more expensive and energy consuming. \n \n And then there is the matter of infrastructure to efficiently get such a new fuel into the broad consumer marketplace. We do not yet have practical and economic ways to make hydrogen available for use as a fuel in cars, trucks and buses. It does not have the inherent energy contained in an equal volume of petroleum, it is not easily stored, and there is today no fuels infrastructure to generate, distribute and dispense it. \n \n Additionally, the potential risks associated with widespread use of hydrogen by the consuming public need to be highlighted, evaluated and dealt with to ensure safe use. The recent National Research Council report on the hydrogen economy reached similar conclusions, including the view that it will take decades to overcome these issues, if they can be overcome at all.\"",

If we could figure out a way of economically extracting even 1% of this amount it would make the supply issue much more rosy.\n \n In the long term we will new technologies to meet our energy demands, and those of the nations who are now becoming increasingly industrialised (like China and India at the moment).\n \n Then again, we have to find the steel first. China's current civil enginnering programme is eating up so much steel there is now a global shortage.

   "Well, this subject unnerved me and I'm not sure why. I certainly don't subscribe to apocalyptic scenarios, and it seems as though even if oil were to dry up, alternative sources can be developed. Yes?\n\n Regardless of the accuracy of some of the 'alarmist' websites and books that address the topic, the reality is that 'peak oil' will happen. It is inevitable assuming we continue to use non-renewable resources. (Which seems to be a pretty safe assumption for right now.) Even if we find a LOT more oil, coal, and natural gas, the extraction of these resources will peak at some point. We may be able to extend it a few years... perhaps even a few generations... but it will happen. Especially when you consider that the population continues to grow... and the growing population demands more resources.\n \n I think the key question is whether we, collectively as the human race, will be able to develop alternative sources that are as conducive to economic growth (read: inexpensive) as oil has been up to this point. If peak oil happens anytime in the next generation or two as most experts are predicting, it appears unlikely that we will have alternative energy sources as widely available and as inexpensive as oil is now -- particularly for transportation.\n \n But even if we do that... The fact remains that our current system of food production and economics is not sustainable. The amount of available food for any biological population dictates the extent to which that population may grow. That is a simple biological law to which humans are not immune. \n \n As we continue to increase food production, the world population continues to grow. As the population continues to grow, food production is increased in order to 'keep up.' It's a vicious cycle. Ending it would likely be considered 'cruel,' since it would necessarily mean that some humans already in existence would not get enough food intentionally. Not ending the cycle means that 200+ species per day* will continue to become extinct in the world ecological system. (*This is a figure that is often quoted by Daniel Quinn -- the individual who wrote Ishmael and several other books. I have not taken the time to independently verify his figures. See www.ishmael.org if you are not familiar with Quinn's work.) Converting the world's finite amount of biomass to human biomass is not 'healthy' for the world ecology, as it decreases diversity.\n \n \nYesterday, the first hydrogen refueling station opened. Why would we be even considering hydrogen if it had a negative EROEI? \n\n I'm not an expert on the topic so I can only guess... But I would guess that it has to do with 'green' politics. A hydrogen-run automobile does not emit harmful exhaust. What some people forget is that it takes fossil fuels to create the hydrogen fuels in the first place, so the negative effects are still there... just not as visible to the consumer.\n \n If we could figure out an efficient way of producing hydrogen fuel using solar or wind power, perhaps it would have a positive EROEI?\n \n ================================\n \n I think what can probably be considered unnerving about this topic is that it can cause one to question the very foundation upon which we have built our world culture... that is... that humans are the 'masters' of the earth. Manifest Destiny! That we were placed here to be caretakers of the earth. That we have the 'right' to decide what creatures can live and what creatures can die as our needs or our pleasure dictate. Some (many?) individuals believe that the 'world' was made specifically for us and that it will always be able to support us, regardless of our actions. Our ingenuity has always prevailed before, so it will continue to do so.\n \n Quinn presents an interesting analogy in some of his works that compares our global culture to the inventor of a 'flying machine' that throws a bunch of odds and ends together and drops his invention off of a very high cliff. Of course, while in the air, it appears that the flying machine is working, but an observer can see that it is inevitable that the flying machine will at some point crash into the ground. The only factor is how high the cliff was. Quinn suggests that our global culture has been in free-fall for quite some time, thinking everything is fine... but we continue to accelerate toward the ground and the inevitable crash.\n \n I'm not sure I'm tying together enough of the loose ends here... so I'll quit for now.\n \n BTW -- I'm excited, so I want to share: I just got married last weekend!!! Phenomenal experience! I likely won't be around these forums as much anymore, but we'll see...",

Much more efficient and practical than controlling pollution released directly from vehicles.\n \n One thing that has not come yet with regard to EROEI is fusion power. Surely this presents something akin to the holy grail of EROEI. The technology is not at a practical stage yet- it takes more energy to start the reaction than that which is released, but when a sustainable reaction is achieved the potential seems amazing. There is some radioactive waste to consider with this method (namely the reactor chambers) but it is less persistent than that produced by fission reactors (ie. a half life of tens of years as opposed to thousands).\n \n Currently JET (Joint European Torus) is at the cutting edge of fusion research, but is a way off from commercial application. The next step is the ITER which aims to produce a net gain in energy (by a factor of 10-20 times) and act as a platform from which commercial fusion power can be evolved.\n \n It might take 40 years before commerical fusion power is reality, but that reality would be a remarkable one indeed.",

   "http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/GA26Dj04.html\n \n \nBut with oil breaking the US$50-a-barrel barrier in October, and amid other concerns, the peak oil crowd is grabbing more attention. One of their most startling claims is the following: six barrels of oil are now used for every new barrel discovered. Major oil finds - that is, more than 500 million barrels - peaked in 1964. In 2000, there were 13 such discoveries; in 2001, six; in 2002, two; and in 2003, zero - the first time that had ever happened. \n \n The \"peak\" oil analysts also say oil-industry investment patterns seem to indicate that there isn't much oil left to discover\n\n \n The above gives a very strong indication that the World is basically living on past oil discoveries, even if we havent reached \"peak oil\" we are no longer finding the cheap oil that we did in the past. \n \n \nBut if discoveries are down and supplies dipping, demand is up. Driving it is population growth led by China, with 1.3 billion people. Buoyed by an economic boom, China has overtaken Japan as the world's second oil-consuming country after the United States. \n \n The US Department of Energy predicts that through 2020, energy consumption in China will rise about 4.3% a year, and by at least 3% in three other large developing countries: India, Brazil and Mexico. \n \n Aleklett and other peak oil analysts warn that meeting future demand without seriously drawing down reserves is impossible. Aleklett said China is aware that oil will be scarcer in the future and is scrambling to buy up or contract for as much oil as it can - even negotiating with Canada, America's top energy supplier.  \n Possible Sino-American jousting for Canadian oil could be just a glimpse of what will be a more fierce global competition for black gold. Michael T Klare, author of Resources Wars, noted that the biggest oil supplies are found in some of the most volatile regions: the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia. He said major world powers won't be drawn into direct conflict there but they won't sit on the sidelines, either. \n\n \n \n In regards to the bolded area, who would have ever thought that oil from North America would be exported to China?",
