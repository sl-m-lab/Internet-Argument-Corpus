   "Eight years of monstrous brainlessness and stupidity, disparaging of intelligence and scholarly pursuits....\n \n Will we now begin to value education and accomplishment instead of dispensing with merit and handing everything over to the Bush dynasty and their cronies?\n \nBarack Obama's election is a milestone in more than his pigmentation. The second most remarkable thing about his election is that American voters have just picked a president who is an open, out-of-the-closet, practicing intellectual.\n \n Maybe, just maybe, the result will be a step away from the anti-intellectualism that has long been a strain in American life. Smart and educated leadership is no panacea, but we've seen recently that the converse - a White House that scorns expertise and shrugs at nuance - doesn't get very far either.\n \n We can't solve our educational challenges when, according to polls, Americans are approximately as likely to believe in flying saucers as in evolution, and when one-fifth of Americans believe that the sun orbits the Earth.\n \n Almost half of young Americans said in a 2006 poll that it was not necessary to know the locations of countries where important news was made. That must be a relief to Sarah Palin, who, according to Fox News, didn't realize that Africa was a continent rather than a country.\n\n Nicholas Kristoff:\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/opinion/09kristof.html\n \n My goodness! Actually respecting intellectually accomplished people instead of spitting on them!",

   "I have been talking with a number of moderate Republicans who hope that the large Republican loss during this election will be able to convince the Religious Right (that form the majority of the party) to allow the party to swing toward a genuine moderate position. I fervently hope they are right - it would be nice to have a real choice for a change. If the Republicans move center and the Democrats make the mistake of turning very liberal (a path which they seem smart enough now not to follow), then they would have a good chance of recovering the White House in four years. I hear that the country is, on average, center right, so whichever party is closer to that view has a better chance of winning.\n \n Unfortunately for the Republicans and for the country, I suspect that the right wing will take the wrong message from these elections. Apparently, most of the Republicans who lost their seats in Congress were moderate Republicans, leaving a more conservative existing pool of Republicans in congress. This, along with their ideological point of view, could well keep the Republicans stuck to the increasingly outdated Right Wing anti-intellectual populist stance represented by Palin and her brand of politics. The only way that they would then be able to win in four years is to launch a successful massive smear campaign, or unless Obama messes up badly. The smear campaign was far less successful in this election but I fear that the main reason for that is that people paid more attention to the real issue of economics. If the economy improves by 2012, then I fear that the Red Herring issues of gay marriage, unsupported smear campaigns, ... might take center stage again. I hope that I am wrong...",
