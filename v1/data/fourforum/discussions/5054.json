   "AMAZING GRACE\n \n \n &#8220;I was blind but now I see!&#8221; John 9:25\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n John Newton (1725-1807) Words: John New*ton, Ol*ney Hymns (Lon*don: W. Ol*i*ver, 1779). Ex*cept*ion: the last stan*za is by an un*known au*thor; it ap*peared as ear*ly as 1829 in the Bap*tist Song*ster, by R. Win*chell (We*thers*field, Con*nec*ti*cut), as the last stan*za of the song &#8220;Je*ru*sa*lem My Hap*py Home.&#8221;\n \n Music: &#8220;New Bri*tain,&#8221; in Vir*gin*ia Har*mo*ny, by James P. Car*rell and Da*vid S. Clay*ton (Win*ches*ter, Vir*gin*ia: 1831) (MI*DI, score).\n \n This is prob*ab*ly the most pop*u*lar hymn in the Eng*lish lan*guage&#8212;a tel*e*vi*sion doc*u*ment*ary was ev*en made about it. Per*haps it is be*cause its words so well de*scribe the au*thor: John New*ton was a slave trad*er be*fore com*ing to Christ. It was sung at the funeral of American president Ronald Reagan.\n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Amazing grace! How sweet the sound\n That saved a wretch like me!\n I once was lost, but now am found;\n Was blind, but now I see.\n \n &#8217;Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n And grace my fears relieved;\n How precious did that grace appear\n The hour I first believed.\n \n Through many dangers, toils and snares,\n I have already come;\n &#8217;Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\n And grace will lead me home.\n \n The Lord has promised good to me,\n His Word my hope secures;\n He will my Shield and Portion be,\n As long as life endures.\n \n Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\n And mortal life shall cease,\n I shall possess, within the veil,\n A life of joy and peace.\n \n The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,\n The sun forbear to shine;\n But God, Who called me here below,\n Shall be forever mine.\n \n When we&#8217;ve been there ten thousand years,\n Bright shining as the sun,\n We&#8217;ve no less days to sing God&#8217;s praise\n Than when we&#8217;d first begun.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "Ah, that's a song I actually like! It seems to be very popular in England, or certainly people actually put effort into singing it. Some believe it should be the national anthem, it's certainly a better tune than \"God save the King/Queen\". However, I doubt the song is as popular in England as amazing grace is in America, what with England considerably less religious than America (generally).\n \n The \"satanic mills\", I believe, refers to the workhouses and factories of the time (I take it, it was written during or around the time of the industrial revolution?).\n \n Is there much else to 'understand' about it? That seems to be the only obscure lyric. I assume Jerusalem is simply a metaphor for something amounting to a utopia.\n \n -Wez",
