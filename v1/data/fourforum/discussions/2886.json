   "Please post here your opinion of the worst songs and bands ever and why if you please.\n \n \"God Bless the USA\" by Lee Greenwood- A one-hit wonder that never ceases to induce my gag reflex. This blindy patriotic, flag-waving tripe (no matter how falsely patriotic or just plain badly-written) has inspired more **** like it. (Like the song below).\n \n \"Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue\"- same reasons as above, except this one is also a war anthem which makes it that much worse.\n \n \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana- This band, with this song more than any other, inspired a generation of drug users to bang out power chords and yell.\n \n I'm sure I will add more, but it is bands/performers that come to mind more than songs when I think of bad music so here are some of them:\n Some of these aren't neccessarily bad (B) just overrated (O) which I will indicate.\n \n Nirvana (see above)- B\n Toby Kieth (see above)- B\n Kiss- O\n The Cure- B\n Black Flag- O\n The Vines- B\n Slayer- B\n All of the pop girls (Britney, Christina, etc.)\n Just about every rapper on pop radio right now (they are too numerous to list)",

It was going to be awesome. One of those huge band, small venue type things. After sitting through 2 poopy bands (El Diablo and Hatebreed) then waiting for another hour we were told there was some \"medical emergency\" and Slayer wasn't playing. I couldn't find out anything about it but needless to say we were totally PO'd. (this board is silly for the words it x's out) so anyway, i would still go see them in a heartbeat\n \n Worst music ever: all contemporary country (goes without saying)\n Worst song of recent memory: That freaking Outkast song, you know the one I'm talking about. Hated it the first and 1000th time I heard it.\n More sucky music: all whiny British and European pop (ie Coldplay)",

Current rockers could use to learn to lighten up a bit. There simply is no room in rock for the current brand of whining (Nickelpuke) that is dominating the airwaves. Musically Kiss are and were hot.

   "I have added Billy Idol to my top concerts.\n \n I went to the Vans Warped Tour yesterday. There were about eight stages, four little ones strewn about, two medium ones on the North and South end of the lot, and two big grand stand stages next to each other in the middle (one would have a band playing while they set up the other so there was no lapse between the acts).\n \n I mostly went to see the Offspring and to check out the Dropkick Murphy's (who I met). Both of those bands were good. I do love me the Offspring. I also encountered a few interesting bands that have zero fame (Jerra and Fred Savage and the Unbeatables). Two very sweet rappers did a private performance to get me to buy their album (which I did), and I found out about a company called s.h.e. (Sugar Hooker Entertainment) which is an all female run company and record label supporting female ROCKERS.\n \n It was an all ages show so there were half nekked teen-agers with smart mouths everyhwhere. They were all excited to see the headliners like \"My Chemical Romance\". Well - let me tell you all those Clear Channel approved bands just sucked! I could not tell one from the other - no originality. This is supposed to be a punk rock festival and I kept running into Brittney Spears and Avril Levigne wannabes. lame\n \n Well - right before the Offspring played Billy Idol was playing on a different stage. After how much some of my friends hyped up Billy - I just had to check the man out. After whatever Clear Channel band played before him left the stage it emptied out so I got right up front. Eventually teenagers meandered over to see \"old Billy Idol\". None of them are even old enough to remember when he was big - so he is just a funny oddity to them.\n \n Well if he did not completely blow their minds (and mine as well). His new tunes are hot, his band is right on - his guitar man a true 80s guitar gawd ! It may have been the first time those kids had ever heard a REAL guitar solo. Billy's energy is unbeatable -as are his vocals. In about five minutes he had the girls squealing and the boys body surfing. He also stripped from the waist up - and I think there should be a law against him wearing a shirt - ever. The man is still HOT - you could bounce a quarter off those abs!!! He played too long and I missed the first 10-15 minutes of the Offspring - the band I actually came to see, and did not care.\n \n I hope Billy comes back to Mpls soon - I am sold.",

Before even considering any of their music, that already puts them a few step ahead of everybody else, and their music ain't too bad either. Some of it actually sounds a little like real country, as oppose to most of the trash coming out of Nasville anymore.",

Gotta give credit where it is due.\n \n Rap makes my ears bleed.

   "As far as I'm concerned, the worse are any pop girls (eg. Britney Spears) or group of guys in their mid to upper 20's in what we call a \"boy-band\". I like to call them N*Stinck or the BackSeat Boys. :) \n In the world of Rock, the worse in my opinion is David Lee Roth post Van Halen. (Although I sometimes can't stand him with Van Halen.) The only songs he did that made it famous (somewhat thanks to the videos that are still shown on VH1 classic) \"I'm Just A Gigalo\" and a cover to the Beach Boys \"California Girls.\" Frankly, I don't know why so many people prefer him over Sammy Hagar anyway.
