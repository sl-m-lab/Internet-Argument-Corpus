Can u imagine these two people are the same man? Believe me, they are. Let me remind u, this is Mr. Zakaev bodily. The first shot was made quite recently in London. The second shot was made in Chechnya a couple of years ago. Well, if somebody told ya a man who has changed a camo and a vakhabit fillet for a severe suit and a tie has changed inwardly, he must have cheated u. Akhmad Zakaev used to be a terrorist and he is still one. What is more, he is still one of the leaders of the Chechen organized militant groups as he runs their activity both in Chechnya and West Europe right from his apartment in a most prosperous district of London which is Chelsey. Judging on classified data coming from a reliable source running his own investigation on Akhmad Zakaev's case, the renowned terrorist who had been inscribed into law by the Great Britain authorities holds a meeting once a week with a certain Chechen citizen who is a second-rate businessmen Maraev. This sona'bitch yo-yos to Chechnya and back to GB under the pretence of his business. Maraev was once noticed in the circle of Aslan Maskhadov. Out of this fact we can draw out a conclusion that Maraev is a connecting link between the secessionist leaders. Besides, I have a strong feeling Aslan Maskhadov is going to carry out a terrorist act in the London tube. He doesn't care the people of the country that saved his freedom or even life might suffer the loss of their own lives. I think our authorities were highly careless to grant political asylum to Zakaev. As it turns out, Zakaev constitutes a danger to the very GB and its citizens. I think the Government shouldn't waste time and must extradite Zakaev as soon as possible for not to suffer such disasters as it was in Moscow not so long ago.",
