   "http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/larryelder/2006/03/02/188299.html\n \n Bush lied, people died?\n Mar 2, 2006\n by Larry Elder \n \n I recently interviewed General Georges Sada, who served as the second-highest ranked general in the Iraqi Air Force. A two-star general, he wrote a recently published book called \"Saddam's Secrets: How an Iraqi General Defied and Survived Saddam Hussein.\" Here are some sound bites from that interview: \n \n Elder: General, as you know, the president has been accused of lying about the intelligence, fabricating it, cherry-picking it, that he wanted to go to war, he really didn't believe that Saddam had WMD. It was all a big smokescreen. When you hear people accuse the president of lying about WMD, of misleading the country and the world, your reaction, Gen. Georges Sada, is what? \n \n Sada: Let me tell you. I am really surprised how people are speaking like this and their soldiers are still in the battle. You see, a soldier when he is in battle, he wants to feel that all his nation are backing him and they are with him. And now I tell you I feel very sorry when I see some people in this country, their soldiers are in the battle, and they are discussing political things making that soldier to feel that he is there in the wrong place. That's one. Second, if there was something right had been done in this country, it was the best decision taken in the proper time, to go and liberate Iraq from an evil dictatorship who only God knows what he was going to do in the region, and maybe even to America, because that man was possessing the weapons of mass destruction and then he was with very evil intentions towards all the West, especially America. \n \n Elder: Fifteen months before we invaded Iraq, the president began talking about what our intentions would be if Saddam would not comply with the U.N. resolutions. During those 15 months . . . did Saddam have WMD, have stockpiles of WMD, and, if so, what type? \n \n \n Sada: Iraq possessed WMD and they were there, and they were chemical and biological, and nuclear weapons. He have also deals with China to make it in China this time, not in Iraq, because F-16s of Israelis have destroyed the Iraqi nuclear project, therefore, he designed a new system to have the atom bomb to be done in China, and he would only pay the money, and he did for $100 million, and $5 million were paid for down payment. I know the bank, I know the branch, and I know the accountant who did it. \n \n Elder: What happened to the chemical and biological weapons? \n \n Sada: The chemical and biological weapons were available in Iraq before liberating the country, but Saddam Hussein took the advantage of a natural disaster that happened in Syria when a dam was collapsed and many villages were flooded. So Saddam Hussein took that cover and declared to the world that he is going to use the civilian aircraft for an air bridge to help Syria with blankets, food and fuel oil, and other humanitarian things, but that was not true. The truth is he converted two regular passenger civilian aircraft, 747 Jumbo and 727 . . . all the weapons of mass destruction were put there by the special Republican Guards in a very secret way, and they were transported to Syria, to Damascus, by flying 56 flights to Damascus. . . . In addition . . . also a truck convoy on the ground to take whatever has to do with WMD to Syria. \n \n Elder: I've always thought it incredible, bizarre, unbelievable, that our intelligence could have been wrong, British intelligence could have been wrong, the French, the Germans, the Russians, the U.N., the Egyptians, the Jordanians, all of whom thought he had WMD. I never felt comfortable with the idea that everybody got it wrong. . . . \n \n Sada: Your intelligence said that Saddam Hussein had WMD. . . . I agree with them. They were there in Iraq. But they didn't find them after liberation of Iraq, because they were searching not in the right place. These things were transported by air and by ground. \n \n Elder: General, why would Saddam, knowing we were about ready to invade, transfer WMD out of the country instead of using it on American and coalition troops? \n \n Sada: Because he knew that the power of America to liberate the country is more than what he can do. And maybe not all WMD were ready to use then. And that's why he transported to Syria and he thought that he's going to maintain in the power as he was maintained in 1991 and then he was going to get it back again and then proceed to complete the whole project of WMD. \n \n \"Bush lied, people died\"? \n \n To be continued. \n \n Larry Elder is an accomplished attorney, radio personality, syndicated columnist, best-selling author and host of daytime television's The Larry Elder Show",

And now I tell you I feel very sorry when I see some people in this country, their soldiers are in the battle, and they are discussing political things making that soldier to feel that he is there in the wrong place.\n\n \n Tough. If people don't agree with the war because the grounds for it were dubious at best to begin with, have been changed several times and remain unsupported, it's called FREE SPEECH.\n \n \n That's one. Second, if there was something right had been done in this country, it was the best decision taken in the proper time, to go and liberate Iraq from an evil dictatorship who only God knows what he was going to do in the region, and maybe even to America, because that man was possessing the weapons of mass destruction and then he was with very evil intentions towards all the West, especially America.\n\n \n Saddam was clinging to power by manipulating the sanctions regime to keep his supporters happy and his cronies rich. His military capability was utterly destroyed during the war with Iran and the Gulf War. The only country Iraq borders that is not under the aegis of Western protection is Syria, which has no oil industry and hence is not worth invading. While Saddam probably was \"with very evil intentions towards all the West\" he had no way of getting revenge and would have known that any attempts at revenge/invasion would have led to his utter destruction.\n \n \nSada: Iraq possessed WMD and they were there, and they were chemical and biological, and nuclear weapons. He have also deals with China to make it in China this time, not in Iraq, because F-16s of Israelis have destroyed the Iraqi nuclear project, therefore, he designed a new system to have the atom bomb to be done in China, and he would only pay the money, and he did for $100 million, and $5 million were paid for down payment. I know the bank, I know the branch, and I know the accountant who did it. \n\n \n Really. Surely this accountant should have been the Bush administration's trump card in the run-up to the war? Has this China connection been mentioned by anyone except this one man? Anywhere? No. It would have been all over the news. \n \n \nSada: The chemical and biological weapons were available in Iraq before liberating the country, but Saddam Hussein took the advantage of a natural disaster that happened in Syria when a dam was collapsed and many villages were flooded. So Saddam Hussein took that cover and declared to the world that he is going to use the civilian aircraft for an air bridge to help Syria with blankets, food and fuel oil, and other humanitarian things, but that was not true.

In addition . . . also a truck convoy on the ground to take whatever has to do with WMD to Syria.\n\n \n So our intelligence agencies with their access to high resolution satellite imagery of Iraq, and our years of flying spyplanes and fighter planes over Iraq failed to record any of these weapons systems being built, failed to record any of the \"56\" flights and truck convoys to Syria? Give me a break. A child wouldn't believe it. And if Syria is hiding Saddam's WMDs, and the administration/Pentagon knows this, why don't we threaten Syria to give them up? Why wasn't this done at the time? Surely now Syria has all this military capability we should be worrying about them? They are next door to our Israeli buddies after all...\n \n \nSada: Because he knew that the power of America to liberate the country is more than what he can do.\n\n \n The General's own words totally undermine the premise that Iraq was a threat to anyone. \n \n There is absolutely nothing in this interview except propaganda spewed by exactly the sort of person you would expect to spew it.

   "First of all, Bush admitted that they didn't FIND any weapons. This is entirely different than saying that Saddam never had any weapons at all. Also, why is it so hard to believe that he was able to disassemble, disguise and transport weapons to Syria, regardless of satellite capabilities? As far as I know, we don't have satellites that can see through cargo planes or trucks. Am I the only one who remembers how UN weapons inspectors were delayed, detoured, and outright refused access to certain areas? I guess I am the only one who also remembers that Reagan SOLD weapons to Iraq. Strange. And where do you suppose Saddam Hussein got all that gas he killed the Kurds with? And what about the reports of yellow cake uranium that our soldiers found in Iraq? If all of these people believe that EVERY SINGLE ONE of those intelligence agencies was WRONG, why aren't they demanding investigations into the effectiveness of said agencies? \n \n But since we didn't find any WMDs, I guess they never existed, despite claims from several intelligence agencies.

And it doesn't change the fact that the weapons our governments told us were there, were not there.\n I imagine Clinton started telling the Pentagon what it wanted to hear on January 20th 1993. \n And yes I did miss that story, but interestingly that's related to one of the things that most convinced me that the WMD story was BS and our leaders knew it: If we thought he had thousands of litres of anthrax and all the rest of it, why did we go in with ground troops in 2003?\n\n \n Again not true. Russia in fact still claims that Iraq was after nuclear capabilities. They opposed the war, but they made the same claims about WMDs.\n And being obsolete does not mean that they cannot be used.\n Here is a link to the letter that was provided. \n http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/Iraq_WMD_Declassified.pdf",

   "New Intel Report Reignites Iraq Arms Fight\n By KATHERINE SHRADER, Associated Press Writer\n 3 hours ago\n \n WASHINGTON - Hundreds of chemical weapons found in Iraq were produced before the 1991 Gulf War and probably are so old they couldn't be used as designed, intelligence officials said Thursday.\n \n Two lawmakers _ Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and House Intelligence Chairman Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich. _ on Wednesday circulated a one-page summary of a military intelligence report that says coalition forces have recovered about 500 munitions with mustard or sarin agents, and more could be discovered around Iraq. \"We now have found stockpiles,\" Santorum asserted.\n \n But intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitive nature, said the weapons were produced before the 1991 Gulf War and there is no evidence to date of chemical munitions manufactured since then. They said an assessment of the weapons concluded they are so degraded that they couldn't now be used as designed.\n \n They probably would have been intended for chemical attacks during the Iran-Iraq War, said David Kay, who headed the U.S. weapons-hunting team in Iraq from 2003 until early 2004.\n \n He said experts on Iraq's chemical weapons are in \"almost 100 percent agreement\" that sarin nerve agent produced from the 1980s would no longer be dangerous.\n \n \"It is less toxic than most things that Americans have under their kitchen sink at this point,\" Kay said.\n \n And any of Iraq's 1980s-era mustard would produce burns, but it is unlikely to be lethal, Kay said.\n \n Asked about the potential danger to U.S. troops, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said: \"They are weapons of mass destruction. They are harmful to human beings. And they have been found.\"\n \n The newly declassified military intelligence report was released Wednesday by National Intelligence Director John Negroponte. Santorum and Hoekstra had urged him to release report this week during congressional debates on Iraq.\n \n The senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee questioned the timing of the report's release. \"What worries me is that the intelligence community _ Ambassador Negroponte in particular _ may be playing a partisan role in the 2006 election,\" California Rep. Jane Harman said.\n \n Hoekstra said the document is not a \"smoking gun.\" But he hinted that the chemical agents could be significant because they may have been added to the discovered artillery shells after the first Gulf War. He noted that one of the declassified findings says the munitions could be lethal.\n \n \"David Kay says anything produced prior to 1991 is not lethal anymore, so what is the discrepancy here?\" Hoekstra said. \"I am 100 percent sure if David Kay had the opportunity to look at the reports that describe these things, he would agree with the finding that ... these things are lethal and deadly,\" Hoekstra said.\n \n Intelligence officials said the munitions were found in ones, twos and maybe slightly larger collections over the past couple of years. One official conceded that these pre-Gulf War weapons did not pose a threat to the U.S. military before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. They were not maintained or part of any organized program run by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.\n \n There is no evidence that insurgents have found the chemical munitions. But one official said that insurgents have improvised conventional weapons, so they could apply similar creativity with the vintage weapons.\n \n Copyright 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\n TextText \n \n This whole thing is so amusing.\n \n 500 old shells are found from a war 15-20 years ago, and that's news?\n \n What happened to the \"immediate threat\" to the USA posed by the massive stockpile of WMDs that Saddam had at this disposal?\n \n It's absolutely pathetic that people continue to cling to this, even after the Bush administration itself, as well as the British and other intelligence agencies, have publicly and officially admitted the error and the \"stretching of the truth\". :xbanghead emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Waxy",

What little credibility Bush had left after the downing street memo was squashed by the hoards of intelligence analysts who showed up claiming that the Bush administration had pressured them to provide directed intel.\n\n \n As to the last paragraph, I will need to read some past posts. I have not done my research. Give me some time to get back to you on this one.\n \n As for the cyanide: Cyanide Salt is a simplistic representation of any compound that contains the CN- ion. This ion can be combined with any number of positive ions. The most common are in the Sodium family. Potassium is only slightly more poisonous as it is more easily gives up the ion in a chemical reaction.\n \n Indeed the chemical reaction occurs on contact with water (not acid) as you previously stated. The reaction will look something like:\n \n R-CN + H2O = R-OH + H-CN where R is any element needing a negative ion to complete its electron structure. Na is a common one that will produce sodium hydroxide + Hydrogen Cyanide. It takes only a very small amount of this material to be toxic. Weaponizing something that is reactive to water is extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemly easy.\n \n Wikipedia describes the toxicity as:\n \n \nToxicity\n \"Cyanide\" is a staple of crime fiction and publicly regarded as meaning deadly poison. Many cyanide-containing compounds are indeed highly toxic, but many are not. Prussian blue, nominally Fe7(CN)18, a common pigment, is administered orally to counteract the effects of poisoning by Thallium and 137Cs.\n \n The most dangerous cyanides are hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and salts derived from it, such as potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium cyanide (NaCN), but including others. Also some compounds readily release HCN or the cyanide ion, such as trimethylsilyl cyanide (CH3)3SiCN upon contact with water and cyanoacrylates upon pyrolysis. [citation needed]\n \n Many thousands of organic compounds contain the CN group. These compounds are called nitriles. Generally, nitriles do not display the toxicity of HCN, NaCN, and KCN. In fact, the nitrile functional group is an integral component of numerous pharmaceutical drugs including cimetidine (Tagamet), verapamil (Isoptin), and citalopram (celexa). The reason for their diminished toxicity is that nitriles do not release the CN&#8722; ion, which permanently binds to and inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, the specific basis of the lethality of cyanide (see below).\n \n \n\n \n Salt is a general chemical term that refers to one of the products of an acid base reaction. HCN (acid) + NaOH (base) = NaCN + H2O. Acid + Base = Salt + Water. This is true of all acid base reactions. Cyanide salt is simply saying that it is a compound formed in this manner.\n \n EF",

There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.\n\n \n \nThe Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force.\n\n \n Even if that is ALL we had, it would be enough to prove beyond any doubt that Bush lied to get us to war. He was running around behind the scenes fixing intel around his policy. \n \n From the Duelfer report:\n \n \nWhile a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991. There are no credible indications\n that Baghdad resumed production of chemical munitions thereafter, a policy ISG attributes to Baghdad's desire to see sanctions lifted, or rendered ineffectual, or its fear of force against it should WMD be discovered.\n\n \n \nISG did not discover chemical process or production units confi gured to produce key precursors or CW agents.\n\n \n \nA former nerve agent expert indicated that Iraq retained the capability to produce nerve agent in signifi cant quantities within two years, given the import of required phosphorous precursors. However, we have no credible indications that Iraq acquired or attempted to acquire large quantities of these chemicals through its existing procurement networks for sanctioned items.\n\n \n \nISG investigated a series of key pre-OIF indicators involving the possible movement and storage of chemical weapons, focusing on 11 major depots assessed to have possible links to CW. A review of documents, interviews, available reporting, and site exploitations revealed alternate, plausible explanations for activities noted prior to OIF which, at the time, were believed to be CW-related.\n \n \u0095 ISG investigated pre-OIF activities at Musayyib Ammunition Storage Depot-the storage site that was judged to have the strongest link to CW. An extensive investigation of the facility revealed that there was no CW activity, unlike previously assessed.\n\n \n \n The report is quite interesting, but far too long to post in its entirety. What it boils down to is that sadddam did not have WMDs. He had no way to make them, he hand no place to store them. They were not spirited away to syria before the invasion, they were not destroyed in the lead up to war. They simply DID NOT EXIST.",

Given what the Downing street memo actually says, I sometimes wonder if they have even really read it.\n \n Face it, people who dogmatically say Bush lied and the intelligence didn't fail do so because they've started with that assumption, not because they've drawn that assumption from the evidence. If they were looking at evidence and not just a way to damn Bush, they would really do their homework and see that it ultimately was a memo reflective of one man's opinion, Richard Dearlove, who made the controversial remarks that the intelligence was being fixed around the policy. (the memo was actually written by Matthew Rycroft.) It's also interesting that the memo is taken by it's supporters as gospel, as if it too could not have had political motives behind it. It's a classic case of people believing everything they read IF it's what they want it to say. No one has ever really concretely confirmed or denied the memo. Given the unlikely nature of the comments in the context of the supposed meeting and the rest of the memo, some have suspected it was faked.\n \n The truth is, we'll never know if Bush really lied about WMDs. The idea he lied would never have even come along except for anti-war political enemies of Bush who used the accusation as an anti-war political tool.

Else, how could you miss his references to Saddam's human rights abuses? Here's an excerpt from his speech that escaped your attention:\n \nfrom Blair's address to Members of Parliament:\n \n One further point. The purpose in our acting is disarmament. But the nature of Saddam's regime is relevant in two ways. First, WMD in the hands of a regime of this brutality is especially dangerous because Saddam has shown he will use them. Secondly, I know the innocent as well as the guilty die in a war. But do not let us forget the 4 million Iraqi exiles, the thousands of children who die needlessly every year due to Saddam's impoverishment of his country - a country which in 1978 was wealthier than Portugal or Malaysia but now is in ruins, 60 per cent of its people on food aid. Let us not forget the tens of thousands imprisoned, tortured or executed by his barbarity every year. The innocent die every day in Iraq victims of Saddam, and their plight too should be heard.\n\n \n Your initial assessment of Blair's statement seems accurate enough, that if Saddam would cooperate with UN inspections and give up his WMDs, then war in Iraq could be avoided. This speech, in my view, does imply that Blair did not support a British invasion of Iraq to effect regime change solely on the basis of Saddam's human rights abuses. The WMDs appeared to be his litmus test. But it's all a moot point, as Hans Blix was compelled to report in his final address to the Security Council that Saddam had failed to cooperate in substance, despite persistent efforts by UN inspectors.\n \n In any event, the opinion that WMDs were the only reason given to the Parliament is misleading.

Not only did Saddam have hundreds of tons of yellowcake from years before, Iraq has several uranium mines that they worked for several years, stockpiling the uranium, following the application of sanctions. \n \n I think that the uranium claims cost us a lot of international support. You would have to be an absolute, total, and complete XXXXX to have ever believed them, or to believe Bushs \"mushroom cloud\" BS.

The intelligence communities did not get it wrong.\n \n However, that is not what the Politicians wanted to hear. So we get the 'dodgy dossiers' and doctored intelligence for purely political purposes\nPeter, it's evident with respect to the various intelligence agencies that unanimous consensus was never achieved nor even expected. Still, I'm not clear on what basis you say that 'the intelligence communities did not get it wrong.'\n \n Wikipedia states that National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) express the coordinated judgments of the US Intelligence Community. Coordination of NIEs involves not only trying to resolve any interagency differences, but also assigning confidence levels to the key judgments and rigorously evaluating the sourcing for them.\n \n Consider the excerpt of Key Judgements from an Oct 2002 NIE on Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction. The estimate states with High Confidence:\n -Iraq is continuing, and in some areas expanding, its chemical, biological, nuclear and missile programs contrary to UN resolutions.\n -We are not detecting portions of these weapons programs.\n -Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons and missiles.\n -Iraq could make a nuclear weapon in months to a year once it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material.\n \n The alternative view from the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (INR) challenges only the confidence level of the nuclear weapons-related capability. In any event, these are estimates, not predictions or proofs. However, in view of the authoritative weight attributed to NIEs, it appears that the intelligence communities did get it wrong.\n \n With regard to your parting comment alleging 'doctored intelligence,' do you have specific examples to cite, or is it simply a suspicion you feel is warranted by the failure to uncover a smoking gun.",

   "Daewoo, I wasn't even addressing you, so why do you embarrass me with your cogent examination, dissecting every word of my scroll. You're so smart and well-informed, I can't fathom why you waste time on a 'XXXXX' like me. My head hangs in despair, my whipped mind impressed with your non-babble style of crisp, informative debate, and your courtesy for substantiating your brilliant analysis with credible, documented sources, even as you refrain from resort to childish, ad-hominem attack. Perhaps I too someday can have a puffed up brain like yours and impress people with little-known but remarkable assertions.\n \n How can thank you enough for such economic enlightenment as:\n The S&P measures different markets, focusing on small businesses (limited partnerships, sole propreitorships,\n ...while a poor little bonehead like me ignorantly thought the S&P 500 was a stock price index of the largest corporations in the leading industries in the U.S. economy. Thanks for showing me how silly I was not to recognize the S&P is all about partnerships and proprietorships that don\\'t even issue shares of stock.\n \n Kudos to you as well for uncovering the fact that, [URL=\"http://www.4forums.com/political/44061-post185.html\n \n You are indeed a veritable fountain of limitless experience and undiscovered knowledge. Why even the UN Charter becomes malleable in the elastic confines of your cerebral ether. When you state that the Charter says [URL=\"http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=42297&postcount=28\"]self-defense does not justify invading another country, no matter the circumstance[/URL], we can be sure that Article 51 of the Charter is a forged interpolation that doesn't really exist in the original document.\n \n Perhaps I can unscrew my twisted thinking if I simply imitate you and support the anti-american terrorists 110%. Yes, I know it's a long shot, but my fellow dunderheads and I need something to hang our hope on.",

   "Kudos to you as well for uncovering the fact that, \"Most of the middle east runs on nuclear power.\" I thought you were jesting at first, but then without any URLs or references you proved with your mere word alone that a number of Mideast countries do in fact run on nuclear power. Turkey, for example, purchased a reactor from a Canadian company in 1999,\"... apparently without either country even being aware of such purchase. And Egypt, too, runs on nuclear power because, after all, you saw it on Egyptian TV, and in view of your seven trips to Egypt no one should doubt your claim that since Egypt doesn't have power problems like the U.S., even a tiny 22 MW experimental reactor is sufficient to power several small towns and a fair-sized city.\n \n\n \n I still have this one bookmarked. Yep, my next post was:\n \n \nEgypts 2 reactors are the ET-RR1 which was acquired from the soviet union in 1961 IT was orignally a 2mw reactor, but was upgrded in 1991 with tec assistance form india. THE other reactor in egypt is th ET-RR2. IT is an open pool type reactor. COnstruction started in 1991 and it came online in 1998.\n\n \n Which is correct. You are welcome to check it if you would like. I can only imnagine that if it was incorrect, you would have called it before.\n \n The governemtns of Turkey and Canada don't know abotu the turkish reactor situation? \n \n http://www.cnp.ca/action-alert/alert-candu-turkey.html\n \n \nIn 1999, the Turkish Electricity Generation and Transmission Company (TEAS - - a state-owned utility) is expected to make a long-awaited announcement about the winner of a bidding process to build a nuclear power station at Akkuyu Bay on the Mediterranean. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) is bidding to sell two 700 MW CANDU reactors to Turkey at a cost of about $4 billion (CDN). It is bidding against a German/French consortium (Nuclear Power International - NPI - is a cooperative venture between Siemens/KWU and the French national nuclear company Framatome). The third consortium bidding is a partnership of Westinghouse and Mitsubishi.\n\n \n Google \"Turkey CANDU\". Have you been living in a cave for the last 20 years? That was one of the most hotly contested nuclear power issues of the 20th century. Environmental groups were up in arms because Turkey has several active fault lines. Security junkies were up in arms because nukes can be made from spent fuel from CANDU type reactors, The Canadian company was fighting on all fronts because the number of canadian reactors is dwindelig and they need to expand their revenue stream, and the Turks just didn't seem to have a nice word to say to anybody. \n \n Google it. There are thousands of pages. We know that the turkish government knew about it since TEAS was buying them, and they are a state run company. If the canadian governement somehow missed it, it would have been the biggest governemtn XXXX up in the history of canada...especially since the canadian government approved it.\n \n I realize that it is demoralizing to have your argument ripped to shreds as happened above. Get a grip, refine your argument, then come back and try it again. \n \n If it woudl help, we can swap sides here. I can argue your point and you can argue mine. Yours is certainly the more difficult point to argue, isnce it is unquestionably wrong, but there are still some approaches you could take if you wanted to try. For example, you have not used the \"There are secret forces within the CIA working to destroy the president\" argument. Try that one. It is VERY difficult, if not impossible, to prove since, like all good conspiracy theories, it is a self perpetuating delusion.",
