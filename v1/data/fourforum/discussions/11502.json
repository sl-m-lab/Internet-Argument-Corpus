It does\n not make sense, then, that the NSPOF\n estimate of the number of rapes in\n which a woman defended herself with\n a gun was more than the total number\n of rapes estimated from NCVS (exhibit\n 8). For other crimes listed in exhibit 8,\n the results are almost as absurd: the\n NSPOF estimate of DGU robberies is\n 36 percent of all NCVS-estimated robberies,\n while the NSPOF estimate of\n DGU assaults is 19 percent of all aggravated\n assaults.

   ":xbanghead\n \n I'm trying here, I really am. But your blind refusal to actually accept that you might possibly be wrong and actually see if this is the case or not is making things go veeeeery slowly.\n \n The 'national crime victimisation survey', is NOT crime based. If it were crime-based, then only people who had reported a crime commited would be questioned. Instead, it is a probability sample of the whole of the US that questions everyone. Amongst the first questions asked ascertain whether an individual has been victimised in the past, either actually or attempted. See the question paper, here. While the survey does indeed deal with 'victims' from this point (giving some credence to your argument), note that you can still be a victim of 'attempted crime' - which removes your entire argument that such a survey misses out individuals.

What give's any of you anti-gun folk's the right to try and impose your opinion's on the rest of us, by seeking to turn those opinions into law, on honest, hard working, law-biding gun owners. We are all entitled to our own opinion's about any given subject from guns to God, and there is nothing wrong with debating those opinions, but when you push for, and/or, support law's that only affect honest, hard working gun owner's, it's moraly wrong. How would you all feel if someone had the opinion that classic muscle car's, worth a lot of money, were bad for the air, and they wanted to take your prized 65 vette from you. This is actually going on right now by the way. This is how I feel as a gun owner, I do not break the law but yet, my property and rights are in danger because of someone else's opinion. People like Brady need to leave honest people who are'nt bothering anybody alone, and go after the criminal's who victimize honest people. You should all support Criminal Control and not gun control.\n\n And every incident where a gun is used to victimise someone is evidence that guns are used for bad.

Prohibition of an item reduces availability of an item, end of story. The consequences of reduced availability is another argument, but the initial reduction is always there.\n \n How about if you wanted to drive your 65 vette at 60 mph in a residential area?

   ":xbanghead\n \n I'm trying here, I really am. But your blind refusal to actually accept that you might possibly be wrong and actually see if this is the case or not is making things go veeeeery slowly.\n \n The 'national crime victimisation survey', is NOT crime based. If it were crime-based, then only people who had reported a crime commited would be questioned. Instead, it is a probability sample of the whole of the US that questions everyone. Amongst the first questions asked ascertain whether an individual has been victimised in the past, either actually or attempted.\n\n \n Despite everything I've presented to you, you still claim that your sources aren't crime based? You whine at me about ignoring your sources, but at least I don't ignore your posts; you do. If you are too blind and inattentive to read what I have written, then why the hell are you whining about my reading comprehension? I'll post this again. Pay attention this time.\n \n ...In the NSDS, for example, all respondents are asked the gun use questions. In contrast, the NCVS inquires only about use among persons who claim to be victims of rape, assault, burglary, personal and household larceny, and car theft. The NCVS excludes preemptive uses of firearms, uses that occur in crimes not screened for in the survey (e.g., commercial robbery, trespassing, and arson), and uses for crimes not revealed by respondents.1...\n \n This shows the great headache they bore.\n \n \n[See the question paper, here. While the survey does indeed deal with 'victims' from this point (giving some credence to your argument), note that you can still be a victim of 'attempted crime' - which removes your entire argument that such a survey misses out individuals. The only people missed out by this survey are those who have defended themselves against a crime without actually knowing that they were doing so - something which is highly minimal and cannot be measured by your survey either.\n\n \n Your error is where you assume that all victims of attempted crimes self-report; I would be surprised if half of them did. Also, as I pointed out, your source omits victims of crimes that aren't screened for on the survey. Is this example of bias, or a lack of effort? Or maybe bias-based laziness? Your continuing to use the same arguments no matter how many times I refute them is piling evidence of your lack of attentiveness.\n \n \nThe survey also covers gun defence by intimidation as well as actually causing harm. Hence the summary quote: We measured firearm protection as an attempted or completed crime in which the victim reported using a gun to attack or threaten an offender.\n\n \n Yes, but only if they were self-reported victims of particular crimes. I'm irritated that you continue to use this arguments even though I've refuted it many times now. The reason you whine about my reading comprehension is because of your own. You continually fail to understand the points that I present. Don't just see, watch. Don't just hear, listen. Further evidence of your belligerance is that I condemn your attention span while you condemn my reading skills. Which would you consider a greater insult? Maybe I should start sneering and jeering about your reading skills? Nah, not yet...\n \n \nSo... your claims that you have addressed this quote are entirely false, your claims that the survey ignores incidents where guns are used in a non-harmful way are entirely false, and your claims that 'victims only' misses out victims of attempted crime are entirely false.\n I think that those three make up your entire argument.\n\n \n How often will you continue to use this strawman? You are addressing three tertiary points; does my main point evade you? My main point is that your source only counts those victims who were self-reported, and it discards all who are not victims of attempted or commited crimes on their little \"hit-list\". If you don't understand that, then I will have justification to jeer about your reading comprehension. I can't be any clearer than that.\n \n \n \nAnd every incident where a gun is used to victimise someone is evidence that guns are used for bad. What this thread is about is which of the two outweighs the other.\n\n \n Despite the fact that your source discards those who never self-reported, and weren't victims of only particular crimes, your source is still more accurate? I'll give you another shot, and thoroughly explain my point (for the fifth time; I can't say I haven't given you every opportunity that I can).\n \n \nThe argument that gun control will only affect non-criminals if a fallacy, we've been over this several times. Prohibition of an item reduces availability of an item, end of story. The consequences of reduced availability is another argument, but the initial reduction is always there.\n\n \n Now you openly admit to only observing the tip of the iceberg. It would seem logical that someone would be more intimidated by a gun than by a defensless lady desperatly trying to dial 9-11; and the cops won't be there instantly either. That's the thing with the Brady Bunch, they can't see further than two steps ahead of them. We are a bit more farsighted. We know that a criminal will be more intimidated by a firearm than a burglar alarm; the cops could take an hour or more before the decide to show up, and this is plenty of time for an average burglar to take what he wants and leaves. The \"safe room\" is expensive, and it does nothing at all to stop a criminal. It's like a knight's armour; he'll use it to defend himself, but if he wants to fight, he'll need a sword. The gun, Ian, is our sword. You have nothing better to do than to flee from the house or hide in an expensive safe-room (that's money well wasted!) while you watch helplessly as the burglar takes what he wants. Will the burglar alarm save you or your items? Will the cops be there to protect you? No.\n \n \nHow about if you wanted to drive your 65 vette at 60 mph in a residential area? You could use exactly the same argument to argue for abolition of all speed limits, because 'you want to go faster than that' - regardless of the fact that removing such limits will endanger others.\n\n \n Strawman! You seem to be implying that the base of the pro-gun argument is \"we want to own guns\". You're not even looking at the tip of the iceberg; you're only looking at the very peak!\n \n I will now give (another) explanation of the point that I have brought up to you. This is the most generous chance I've ever given to any opponent; I suggest you read it this time.\n \n Your vaunted source only counts victims of particular crimes who were self-reported; in other words, it only counts victims under these conditions:\n 1. They reported themselves. A victim of a crime isn't garunteed to report himself, and a victim of an attempted crime is even less likely.\n 2. They were victims of a crime that was on their little \"hit-list\". If they were a victim of any other crime, they were discarded.\n \n I can't say I've ever been more generous in a debate.\n \n You're not refuting any points of the issues at hand; why are you giving medical care to try to revitalize corpses?",

Not included (as listed by you) are commercial robbery, arson and trespassing. \n Arson and trespassing are both immeasurable crimes for the context of the survey (with very few exceptions) - if someone has trespassed then they have already commited the crime: if they do not tresspass then there can be no evidence that this was because guns were present. The same goes for (attempted) arson - a single act takes place, and that's it. Commercial robbery is absolutely minimal at best - and I have far less issues about employees of firms likely to be robbed to carry guns.

   "I don't think that my survey does count 'every single defence incident'. In fact, I think I've pretty explicitly stated this already. However, I've also given my reasons why this is not relevant.\n \n This are not relevant because the figure of gun crime we are comparing our gun defence figure to also doesn't count 'every single illegal incident'. Instead, the figure is composed of all incidents within the spectrum of violent crime where a gun has been criminally used. This means that to get a fair comparison we are not looking for 'every single defence incident', but 'every single defence incident within the spectrum of violent crime'. And that one, I've shown to be the case.\n \n If you want to use all instances of gun defence - not just the ones included by my survey (which, to be fair, is still a pretty large range), you have to also include for the comparison all the extra crimes that were committed while the criminal was carrying. As we don't have those figures, these ones - and this survey - will have to do.\n \n Your pizza analogy is failing in two ways. Firstly, it ignores the fact that if the same set of questions are asked for fish instead of pizza and the figures compared, both types of question - include or discard - will give a valid comparison. Secondly, to compare it to guns the initial question should not simply be 'do you like pizza'? The question would be 'do you like: pepperoni pizza, margarita pizza, Hawaiian pizza, meat feast pizza, .......?' The fact that some people will only like pizza that haven't been included on the list is there, but most people have been accounted for - and in the case of our gun crime survey, the question 'have you been a victim of a crime or an attempted crime', while more all-encompassing, is not as specific. Remember that the NCVS was not carried out purely for this survey, but for many others also - they're not missing out a question because of laziness.\n \n EDIT: A rereading of your post gave me the half impression that you could have meant that you accept this, but don't believe that my survey counts all cases of gun defence within the spectrum of violent crime. The simple response to this is to look at my posts above - I've explained there that the only way for my survey to miss crimes within this spectrum is for people to deliberately lie about their experiences (the 'false negative'). While this may happen occasionally, it is far less likely than the false positives that your survey experiences, because your survey can have people lying and (more frequently) can have people who mistakenly believe that their gun prevented a crime that would not have happened anyway.",

   "Just because it supports you doesn't mean that it's automatically correct even though it's not even telling anything. \nI take it as correct, not because it agrees with me, but because it is from the original survey- which your source (from the OP) is based on. \n \n Essentially, what the survey has done is say 'X amount of Americans own guns [lots of detail], and an estimated Y amount claim to have used guns for self-defence. However, there are several problems with this estimated claim, so that data isn't very reliable\". Your source has read the first half of the survey and ignored the second bit.\n \n Have a more detailed list of problems:\n \n Only 2,568 people took part in you survey, which was conducted once. Compare this with the NCVS, which surveyed 59,000 housing units (made up of more than one person), surveyed once every 6 months - and the study used data collected over a period of 4 years. As far as sample size goes, you are outranked by far.\n \n Your survey rests on the positive answers of 19 people. If one person is mistaken in their claim, this represents 116 822 people in the calculated final estimate - and because far less people used guns than didn't, this is much more likely to inflate the figures. \n To go into more detail on this: say just 0.5% of all people are habitual liars, and you survey 1,000,000 of them. If you assume that 1% of people actually use guns for self defence (this is better than your survey: 19/2568 = ~0.7%, so I'm raising the figure), 0.5% of those 1% will lie about it and claim that they have never used a gun - so the surveyed figure will be too small by 50 (1,000,000*1%*0.5%=50). However, 0.5% of the non-gun-users will also lie, and say that they have used a gun. If you run the same calculation, this adds 1,000,000*99%*0.5%=4950 people to the surveyed figure. Including all liars, this inflates your surveyed figure from it's correct (hypothetical) value of 10,000 to a fake value of 14,900. If 1% of people are habitual liars, the figure inflates to 19,800 and if 5% of people lie the figure skyrockets to 59,000.\n \n There is also the issue of misleading questions. To quote from the analysis in my survey (bold added by me) - Unfortunately, Kleck's survey question did not confine self-defence to attempted victimizations. Merchants who arm themselves before making night bank deposits might view this as self-protection even if they have never encountered a robber. Motorists who carry guns in their cars might assert that they use the weapons for protection although they have never displayed them. Persons who have used firearms to settle arguments might believe that they have prevented assaults. In a survey of prison inmates, 63% of those who fired guns during crimes described their actions as self-defence.\n In short - not only will some people see a crime deterred where no crime was actually present in the first place, or give credit to their gun where no credit was due (these factors were reduced somewhat by later refinements to your survey, but were not completely eliminated, especially giving credit), but many uses of 'gun self-defence' may actually be overall harmful and criminal (with regards to the bold text).\n \n Finally, there is pure number comparison between surveys. To quote from your survey (bold added by me): For example, in only a small fraction of rape and robbery attempts do victims use guns in self-defense. It does not make sense, then, that the NSPOF estimate of the number of rapes in which a woman defended herself with a gun was more than the total number of rapes estimated from NCVS (exhibit 8). For other crimes listed in exhibit 8,the results are almost as absurd: the NSPOF estimate of DGU robberies is 36 percent of all NCVS-estimated robberies, while the NSPOF estimate of DGU assaults is 19 percent of all aggravated assaults. If those percentages were close to accurate, crime would be a risky business indeed! NSPOF estimates also suggest that 130,000 criminals are wounded or killed by civilian gun defenders. That number also appears completely out of line with other, more reliable statistics on the number of gunshot cases.14\n Pure and simple, your numbers don't make sense. Firstly when compared with the very reliable pure crime stats from NCVS (there is no reason why these numbers would be false - they are simply asking a question to be answered), and secondly when comparing them with other surveys on gun use.",

The NSPOF estimated 322 attempted rapes had been prevented by firearms. The NCVS estimated a total number of 316 rapes(attempted and actual). In short, NSPOF claims that 6 more rapes were stopped by firearms than the total number of rapes - attempted or sucessful (from NCVS).\n \n As for 'questionable survey methods'... the NCVS methods are far from questionable in asceertaining initial victimisation. The original question paper is here, if you want to see - the appropriate questions for rape are #41 and #43.\n \n Finally, I'd say the most reliable study is a government study with a large sample size. Unfortunately for you, the NCVS is a government study, and it has a far larger sample size than yours.\n \n \nCare to provide a few of the \"reliable\" sources? Care to define \"reliable\"?

Your survey, page 9, after the section you quoted comes a reference. If you follow the reference to the bottom of the page, you get the following: \n 14. In 1994 about 17,000 people were shot dead in criminal assaults and justifiable homicides. Given what we know about the case fatality rate, fewer than 100,000 nonfatal gunshot woundings were known to the police. (See Cook, P.J., \"The Case of the Missing Victims,\" Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 1985). Presumably, the true number of justifiable shootings was just a fraction of this total.\n \n Also, again with the random insults. I'll take that as a sign I'm showing you things you don't like.",

It's nice to see that my 'whining' about your lack of reading skills was actually justified.\n \n Secondly, yes. If you read your survey you will see that the questions asked were (quoted):\n \"Within the past 12 months, have you yourself used a gun, even if it was not fired, to protect yourself or someone else, or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere?\" Answers in the affirmative were followed with \"How many different times did you use a gun, even if it was not fired, to protect yourself or property in the past 12 months?\" Negative answers to the first DGU question were followed by \"Have you ever used a gun to defend yourself or someone else?\" (emphasis in original).\"\n ...\n \"Respondents were excluded on the basis of the most recent DGU description for any of the following reasons: the respondent did not see a perpetrator; the respondent could not state a specific crime that was involved in the incident; or the respondent did not actually display the gun or mention it to the perpetrator.\"\n \n Those questions screen neither cases where a 'self-defence' was used with criminal intent/outcome nor cases where a gun was not actually needed, due to no actual threat being present. Note also that the screening process only applies to the most recent DGU (defensive gun use) - those who claimed more than one incident were allowed multiple counts on the merit of the first incident, not on all of them. If only the first incident was used, the figure drops from an estimated 4.7 million to an estimated 1.5 million - still large, but the there are all of my other issues to go through (including the two screening ones as listed here). \n \n To give you a sense of comparison on how misleading people can be to themselves, before the screening process took place (the second half of my italic-ed text above) there were 45 respondents (compared to the final 19) with a combined estimated DGU of 23 million per year (compared to the post-screening value of 4.7 million). Before you ask for my source on these figures: they're right there in your survey.\n \n I'm still slightly confused why you're even trying to argue this. Your own survey states that it's figures are inaccurate, you're trying to prove it right and wrong at the same time. Each to their own, I guess...",
