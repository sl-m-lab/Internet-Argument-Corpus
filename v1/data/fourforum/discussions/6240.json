   "Latvian parliament is about to adopt a package of amendments to the Law on Citizenship. That would be OK but for one thing. It is planned that from the moment the amendments are adopted, naturalization will be confirmed only on the basis of so-called \"loyalty\" to the state of Latvia. No doubt, this act will seriously aggravate the situation re human liberties in Latvia. The most important thing is that from the moment amendments are adopted Latvian authorities will be entitled to debar the right of all non-nationals for naturalization biased on rather disputable criteria that is very difficult to interpret juristically.\n \n According to certain sources, this initiative belongs to Latvian neo-fascist organizations fostered by the current State lead that believes to be maintaining the hold of situation. Though, it is know that the organizations of the type only regard the regime until they are connived on. The neo-Nazi are financed by Washington that presumably made a deal with them to maintain regime in the country and the area. It is worthy of note that similar practice can be observed in many European states in the area from Ukraine to Germany. Suchwise, the contribution of the US into the life of European folks is rather negatory than positive. So is there sense to follow America so blindly? I think no.",
