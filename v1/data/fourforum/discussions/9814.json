   "Correct me if I'm wrong, as it happens very often, but in order for a tale to be considered folk lore, there needs to be at least a hint of truth to it. The real questions come from the authors, and those who say that god himself pronounced the words, this I find very hard to believe. There are also several questions as to the time the NT was written compared to the time frame of the stories there in.

For example wasn't there supposed to be another woman besides Eve, I believe her name might have been Lillith?\n\n \n IIRC the Jews hold that Moses wrote the first 5 books having them dictated to him by God.

   "God is not a liar you ignorant blasphemer.\n\n \n I never said he was. Like Shadow has stated, we are simply stating that your belief in literal Creationism requires God to be a liar, another reason why we question if you are actually a follower of Christ rather then a worshiper of the Bible. Again with the hostility. It is quite obvious that you are pretty much against any review or examination of your beliefs and you meet any outside examination with blatant hostility. \n \n \nThe only liar here is you.\n\n \n I'd ask you to provide evidence but I know you won't. \n \n \nNow if creationists did turn out to be wrong, and I'm not saying we are in any way. But what if I am completely wrong in my interpretation of the Word about my Creationist beliefs, how does that make the Creator of the World a liar?\n\n \n If you are wrong about your beliefs, then God is not a liar. Hence why we are all stating that your belief is quite heretical as it requires God to be a liar to function. If your interpretation is correct, then God is a liar. There's a reason why most of us are saying your interpretation is false. \n \n \nOnly in your small mind could He be blamed for my error.\n\n \n I never blamed God. This doesn't involve God.

So not only are you wrong about that, but you are putting words in my mouth despite several posts detailing how I made arguments very different from the ones you are saying I made.

Even a very common bacteria like group b strep. When infected say in the throat the typical treatment is Pcn for 7-10 days. Now what happens is many people feel better after just 3-4 days, so they stop taking the meds. The bacteria actually \"learn\" from this and become resistant to Pcn. The bacteria has adapted. Now this individual is still contagious, but the form of strep that he passes on is now resistant to Pcn and much harder to kill. If this was a product of ID, wouldn't the bacteria already be resistant?\n \n emoticon_xkill Arch I am sorry to shoot down your point but this just the way things are, when you are not adaptable to change.",

You posted a civil war picture of a flying dinosaur as proof against evolution. We proved it was from a Fox Tv show. Thus you presented a hoax as evidence for creation. Simply saying I did this or that and not explaining how I did such when challenged rather undermines your claims that I indeed did what you accuse me of. I accuse you of dishonesty and then present various examples of your dishonesty. This is how a argument works. Present a claim and then provide evidence.

Since geology supports evolution, explain to me how you power your car or your computer since geology is a fairy tale and isn't responsible for finding fossil fuels.

Going from my experience these are: \n Traditional; CofE / Catholic\n Immigrant; Afro-Carribean (Pentacostal usually) \n Evangelical; several groups but with a number of common factors.\n Each group has a different reason for belief and attracts a different section of the community, in particular Evangelical groups tend to make indirect approaches where people will be invited to attend some event or other without it being made clear (at least at first) that they are being asked to convert.\n\n \n Thank You for your open honesty.",

I tend to be a moderate when it comes to Biblical interpretation and studies anyway.\n\n \n Well, nearly all religious leaders suggest a deep understanding of their sacred scriptures as a foundation of belief. Devotional readings of said scriptures has also been cited by said leaders as an aid to the understandings. Paul in the bible mentions how the Bareans went behind his back to independently study scripture to ensure that what he said was factual or not and commendend them for doing so. Nearly everyone I've ever met who engaged in devotional readings (including my formerly fundamentalist wife) said such aided them in their faith.\n I'd say the real problem is you don't read. But, simply think that what you believe is enlightenment and you try to claim to be of both worlds, a believer and a humanist. Thus the basis of your posted beliefs. \n You're not the 1st nor will be the last. But, rather than simply asking why I suggested you read your bible OR even stating you do so, you come up with a diversionary defense about not throwing scripture about.\n You do know scripture (when we're talking about the bible) lets the reader know that you do know what you're talking about rather than think you know what you're talking about. Familiarity with scripture would allow you to have had ready made defenses for some of your beliefs that you say you got from the bible. Such as in the case of slavery. \n \n \n Throwing 'scriptutre around' has more to do with showing what the bible actually says as opposed to what you think or want it to say. It also lets the audience be more aware of where your basing your beliefs rather than having them think you pulled them out of your back side.\n \n You also have no idea what scripture citing does to others on this forum. Especially in context of biblical, religious and other related discussions.\n \n \n My comments on devotional readings were made because most religions leaders (whom you'd find sympathy from) would suggest so and because you appear to me (from cursory readings of your postings) to be someone who doesn't do so or only does so on occasion. Whether you make excuses for this like \"I'm too busy now\" or \"I already know what I need to know.\" is beside the point. Your response leads me to further believe that you don't read your bible.

And then, opinion is pretty much split evenly one the others mentioned.\n \n Plus the obvious Hebrews, which was traditionally attributed to Paul, but nearly absolutely considered to not be by him.\n\n \n You aren't going to convince anyone with Wikipedia, which has basically no oversight. Try a more reputable source, like academic papers. Look, I'm well aware of these theories--I've studied them myself. No one is saying some scholars don't think so. But the claim that MOST believe that is not true. There are a lot more scholars in the world who hold to the traditional view. Remember, Catholicism alone comprises most of Christianity, and few Catholic scholars would agree with you.\n \n This is typical revisionism that gets to where it's more a stretch than the traditional view.",

I have yet to see your own sources that claim that a majority of scholars ACCEPT those as being written by Paul, so you really have no place to talk, Jyoshu. There is nothing controversial about at least the Timothy 1&2 and Titus being considered by most to not have been written by Paul.\n \n \n Timothy 1 contains a huge amount of vocabulary NEVER seen in any of Pauls writings. It also contains vocabulary seen nowhere else in the New Testament. Funnily enough, over 2/3 of the vocabulary can be found in SECOND century christian writings. Funny that.",

   "The truth is, based on what I've read of your posts here, I suspect I read the Bible and study it MORE than you do. I don't say that to imply I know more than you--I'm not interested in tit for tats here, but since you brought it up ... I use mostly use 3 translations--the RSV, NASB and a newer one that I really like called the ESV. The problem with the NIV is that it translates based on the idea behind the passage rather than a literal word-for-word translation. Some people prefer that, but I don't. All of the translations I mentioned are geared toward translating on word-for-word literalism. I also have 2 years of formal koine Greek training (and many other years of experience with it), and so I do a good some of my studying in original greek, in terms of the NT. \n \n But think what you will. If prefering to bases assumptions on something someone is NOT doing (Bible-thumping) rather than what they do, that's your business. Because I believe that's really the heart of your comment.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n As to one of the bibles I use, it's the NIV study bible 10th anniv. ed by the Zondervan Corp. 1995. I have several others but, it's the most handy. \n\n I maybe shoud have added 'ATM' on the end of that. It was a gfift from the wife several years ago (pays some times to be seen using something she gave ;) ) She personally used the English Standard Version you mentioned. \n \n We can get into a tit for tat on who has the most religious books handy if you want, I have the book of Mormon and the JW stuff nearby too. And, the link I provided has ~50 translations. Heck, I even have a fatassed Strongs on the monitor here with the Greek, Hebrew and English. \n \n As to who knows more about the bible from postings, I leave that up to the readers. \n \n As to your own education, no way of verifying that here. Certainly sounds better than mine which I use Russian (based on the same language system) and only a smattering of Greek. \n \n This isn't an attack on you for NOT bible thumping but, nothing of what you've posted to date would lead me to believe you have ANY education about the book. Nothing shines through. Definatly not the 'literal translations' you'd personally get from studying in original Greek (NT only). AND if you DID have such study, you'd have easily been able to show it.\n I'd have hazard a guess that you would have used it to illuminate scriptue from time to time, especially to your fellow believers, certain aspects of the bible. And attacking the NIV version on 'meaning' rather than literalisms...wow, you trying to be a fundamentalist now?\n \n \n Dismissing Wiki which has links and references related to this specific subject is pretty juvenile. The post in wiki isn't challenged on bias (as some are) nor apears to be pushing an agenda (as some do). Afraid to admist you might have been wrong...thus showing a real lack of biblical knoweledge and history?\n \n As to posting styles, I'd have put you in the ~22-25 year old range. Mostly for your liberal beliefs in the bible that don't typically conform to a 40 year old Christian.",

   "Also, something that Shadow and others here are forgetting is that the Timothy and Titus letters of Paul were written to individuals who were friends of Paul. The other letters (which suppsedly have such different vocabulary) were institutional letters, written to entire city churches. (Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, etc.) I don't know about you, but when I write to a friend of mine, I tend to write quite a bit different, perhaps with even different words, than I would if I were writing a letter to an institution. I suspect the same would be the case for most people.\n \n Either way, it can be a reckless game to make assumptions of forgery over differences in vocabulary and style, given that the author wrote letters at VERY different times of his life and to VERY different recipients for VERY different reasons.",

Bit, seems there have been plenty of opprotunities for such indepth discussion...this IS a religion thread after all in the RELIGION forum section.\n In our past discussion that went on the side tangent of slavery, a few simple scripture tossings or in depth use of your knowedge of Greek and literal translations of scripture could have fostered a better discussion. You can't get the Greek 'true meaning' without bypassing the translated meanings (where the same or otherwise) as you seem to be saying.\n \n In the end, I'm still left with the feelings that you're full of it.

See, this is the sort of thing that gives me the impression the only experience you've ever had in Christianity is in U.S. conservative evangelical churches.\n\n As I've said, all kinds.\n I was raised a cultral Catholic as stated in a past thread and have known all sorts. Sitting in the congregations of liberals and conservative evangelicals alike. More than most can claim. I also note that one group would label some conservative evangelicals and others liberal wishy-washy sorta christians.\n It's a hobby.\n \n As for your asertation on learning new words.\n \n Tell me about the phrase\n \"I'm a huckleberry above that persimmon.\" \n \n What's it mean (without resorting to the Internet)?\n Was used over a century ago, now, few would know any meaning to it.\n Did you know 'Jimminy Cricket' used to be a swear word?\n \n Phrasology that was used a generation plus ago is not often repeated years later. Pauls 'letters' were written within the span of a few years. Something that a learned scholarly type such as yourself would know.\n So, the defense that he learnt new words doesn't hold water when you have an inkling of biblical history.\n His writing style wouldn't have changed.\n \n I mean, gnarly dude.\n \n But, you'd have us dismiss questions that arise rather than seek the truth. \"reckless game to make assumptions of forgery over differences in vocabulary and style, given that the author wrote letters at VERY different times of his life and to VERY different recipients for VERY different reasons.\"\n \n The 1st part is dismissive, the last isn't necessesarily true.",
