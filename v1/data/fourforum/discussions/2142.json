   "Congress created the commission -- initially opposed by the Bush administration -- in November 2002 and charged it with coming up with an authoritative account of the 9/11 attacks, including any security and intelligence lapses. (http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/911.commission/index.html)\n \n If the Bush administration was truly seeking justice to one of the most horrific incidents America has seen on it's soil, then why did they object to a commision to find the truth? I think it's beyond odd that the Bush Administration, being uncompliant until hairpulling was introduced, wouldn't go along with a program that could answer many questions that the families of victims deserved to know. I think it's great that our President will milk our homeland's pain for all it's worth, but when it comes to analyzing the Administration that was in office, they stand up and vehemently oject. Hypocritical to say the least, but I've come to expect no less from this tired, negligent group of so called representatives and leaders.\n \n Remi\n check out my new website, poeticinjustice.net, I have a forums page as well",
