   "Greetings to SilentPoet, Jim the Trucker and All:\n \n Originally Posted by SilentPoet << Every person should attempt to preserve what they hold dear. If the atheist is a objectivist who loves the ideal of freedom and capitalism then they will probably support a battle against the terrorists. If the atheist is a communist, he may not really care if America is destroyed.\n \n Terral's reply to SilentPoet << First off, let us try and remember that in the early days of the American colonies, our forefathers were also considered terrorists by the most powerful group of oppressors on earth. We had nothing but a band of people seeking freedom and liberty according to our own definitions of the words. The only way we gained our freedom was by forcing as many British soldiers to die for their country as possible. Also, we did not fight according to accepted rules of engagement for that day. Instead, we learned to fight from those we gave the title of Indians. \n \n SilentPoet Original << (I only mentioned objectivst and communist as examples I am aware that their are other forms of atheism and I do not need to be informed of this. I'm also aware that not all communists are atheists.)\n \n Terral's reply << Do you really mean Socialists? When was the last time a true Communist state existed on this planet?\n \n Jim the Trucker told SilentPoet << If you think the terrorists are only out to defeat America, you need to read up on it. They want the WORLDWIDE control, capitalist or comminist, christian, atheist, jewish, hindu, buddist, mormon, agnostic, eskimo, aboriginese, etc., etc., etc.\n \n Terral's reply << Are we talking about the Middle East Arab Terrorists, and particularly those coming out of Saudi Arabia? If so, then they appear more concerned about destroying the State of Israel than anything else. Their attacks against the west are aimed at destroying the machine that protects Israel. After all, that tiny Hebrew State (sons of Jacob) of about 5 - 6 million is surrounded by over a billion Arabs (sons of Esau). Bible prophecy says that Esau (the older) will serve Jacob (the younger). As it is written, \"The LORD said to her, \"Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger.\" Gen. 25:23. The Apostle Paul uses this as an example of God's divine choice, saying, \n \n \"For though {the twins} were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to {His} choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, it was said to her, \"THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.\" Just as it is written, \"JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.\" Rom. 9:11-13.\n \n Esau and Jacob have been fighting, even from the womb, for thousands of years. Please allow me to remind everyone that their current battle is over the 'Royal Grant' (Genesis 15:18) and the land that God promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Israel) that lies between Hamath (Ez. 48:1) and Kadesh (Ez. 48:28) between the boundaries of the Mediterranean (Great) Sea (Ez. 48:28) to the east and westward to the Euphrates River (Gen. 15:18). Therefore, Arabs (sons of Esau) are currently in control of land that the Lord God Himself promised to Israel. \n \n Jacob is currently awaiting the return of Elijah (Malachi 4:5+6) to come and restore the kingdom to Israel. BTW, he shall recapture this land from the hands of Esau without the firing of a single shot. So Esau (the Arabs) has every reason to be angry, upset and quite disturbed over what God's Word says about their future. But, their anger is not with Americans, other than that we support Jacob (Israel), nor is it with Israel (their cousins). Instead, they are driven to the boundaries of insanity by the Lord God Himself who says, \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\" Rom. 9:13. That is why a billion Arabs will never ever be able to destroy the tiny state of Israel. \n \n Jim << Haven't you read the objections to our holding some terrorists without access to lawyers and without formal charges. Why...we're violating their civil rights! God forbid this!\n \n Terral's reply << Americans are held to a higher standard than the rest of the world. Even the people of England are subjects of the Crown, but we are free citizens of a republic (in actuality, we are a republic under laws, and not a democracy under men). We believe that a person is innocent, until proven guilty in a court of law. Therefore, we cannot label anyone a 'terrorist,' until that person is found guilty by an assembly of free citizens. By allowing any individual to be cast into the dungeon forever (or put to death), over simple accusations without proper representation, violates everything that our fathers fought for against the tyranny of the British. \n \n How long before American citizens are also held indefinitely in cages, because some tyrant on a bench somewhere says 'He is a terrorist!\"? Americans today should take heed and wake up, before they also find themselves in some dark lonely place with no representation, and with only the tag of 'guilty terrorist' to hold onto. \n \n Jim says << I say, shoot the bastards and make room for more prisoners. \n \n Terral's reply << I am quite confident that the British soldiers of a few hundred years ago said the same exact thing about what we now call American Revolutionaries. The methods you are advising us to utilize are the tools of barbarians. That being said, I am with you 100 percent IF we use the same methods of establishing guilt that applies to all Americans today. If the government has no evidence at all against any one of them, then that person shall be released just like any of us. The burden of proof is still on the government, and not upon that person to prove his innocence. \n \n Jim << And don't give me this mess about innocent until proven guilty. If you are in a fire fight with a terrorist group and you kill a bunch of them, capture and impound the rest, the rest are guilty of being a part of the terrorist organization and should be put to death immediately. They have no rights to be observed.\n \n Terral's reply << Again, if the government possesses the evidence to prove any one of them guilty, before an assembly of free citizens, then that person should suffer the consequences. We are setting ourselves up for a fall by tagging people as 'guilty' without due process of public hearings. \n \n Suppose a terrorist firefight erupts outside your home/apartment, and in your attempts to escape, government soldiers take you prisoner by accident. Or, suppose an enemy sets you up to make it appear you are a terrorist. Who can come to your defense, if you are \"put to death immediately\"? No sir. By going around the basic underlying principles of establishing guilt, that was laid down by our forefathers, you (and all of us) become exposed to a much more vicious enemy than those you wish to eradicate without proper representation. And frankly, my children and my grandchildren deserve better.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
