   "Conservative group sues MSU for offering health insurance to partners of homosexual workers\n \n By DAVID EGGERT\n Associated Press Writer\n \n LANSING - A conservative group on Wednesday sued to stop Michigan State University from offering health insurance to the partners of gay workers and said the school is violating a 2004 amendment to the state constitution.\n \n The American Family Association of Michigan filed the lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court and hopes to get a ruling setting a precedent that would block domestic partner benefits at other state universities.\n \n Schools that provide benefits to gay couples include the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, Wayne State, Saginaw Valley and Oakland.\n \n \n The purpose of the suit is to ensure that courts rule on the constitutionality of domestic partner benefits at public universities, said Patrick Gillen, an attorney for the Thomas More Law Center in Ann Arbor.\n \n By providing same-sex benefits, Michigan State is \"recognizing same-sex marriage in substance if not by label,\" Gillen said. A related case is pending before the Michigan Court of Appeals.\n \n A Michigan State spokesman did not have an immediate comment Wednesday.\n \n In 2004, Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment that made the union between a man and a woman the only agreement recognized as a marriage \"or similar union for any purpose.\"\n \n Those six words spurred a legal fight over benefits for the partners of gay employees who work for state and local governments and other public employers. Gays say voters meant to prevent gay marriage but never intended to keep them from getting health insurance.\n \n Twenty-one gay couples sued the state in 2005 after Republican Attorney General Mike Cox issued an opinion interpreting the amendment as barring domestic partner benefits in future contracts.\n \n But Gillen said Wednesday's lawsuit is needed because there are questions about whether that case applies to universities, which have argued the constitution gives them autonomy to provide domestic partner benefits.\n http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060705/News01/60705016/CAT=News01",

This is motiviated by hate and intolerance, nothing more. Even religion can't excuse this behavior.\n\n And what slays me is the dishonesty typically employed in such measures.\n \n Here in California for the anti-gay marriage vote, the proponents SPECIFICALLY stated that the anti-gay marriage law WOULD NOT be used to attack domestic partner benefits.\n \n But after it was passed? What did they do?\n They used that exact same piece of anti-gay marriage legislation to try to destroy domestic partner legislation.",
