Gore's office explains: \n \n What Mr. Gore has asked is that every family calculate their carbon footprint and try to reduce it as much as possible. Once they have done so, he then advocates that they purchase offsets, as the Gore's do, to bring their footprint down to zero.\n \n The Tennessean elaborates, \"Gore purchased 108 blocks of 'green power' for at least each of the last three months, according to a summary of bills from Nashville Electric Service. . .

   "Gore's as big a hypocrite as his movie is a lie.\n \n http://blog.nam.org/archives/2006/05/an_inconvenient.php\n \n May 24, 2006\n \n 'An Inconvenient Truth': Does This Look Like Consensus to You?\n \n Well, today's the big day we've all been waiting for (not!): the release of Al Gore's movie on global warming. Well, in truth, the film's pretty much been seen by all the liberal and Hollywood (redundant, we know) glitterati. Says the film's trailer, \"If you live on this planet, if you love your children, you have to see this film.\" Hey -- wasn't that the trailer for \"Over the Hedge\"? Or was it \"RV\"? In any event, the film has rolled out to rave reviews by noted climatologists Sharon Stone and Garry Shandling. (Can Barbra be far behind...?) The film is the action version of a slide show that Gore has done some 1,000 times around the country, making us wonder if maybe the heat from the projector bulb isn't making matters worse. Throughout it all, at every interview, Gore repeats like a mantra that there is now scientific consensus about the so-called problem. And he has lots of friends in the press who lazily repeat the argument. What the hey -- it's a heckuva lot easier than making the case. And -- they voted for him, so they trust him, right?\n \n But for those of you not who are content to accept consensus like so much pablum from the Fourth Estate -- or from Al Gore, we have done just a little simple checking and present a few dissenting views. While Al schmoozes with the big donors in the globally warm environs of Cannes, let us present some cold, hard facts:\n \n -- In a new study from the National Center for Policy Analysis entitled, \"Climate Science: Climate Change and Its Impacts\", Dr. David Legates, the Delaware state climatologist, notes, \"Global warming alarmists have attributed increases in hurricanes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hail storms and heat waves to global warming caused by human activities. However, the evidence does not support their claims.\" This study was the subject of a great op-ed in the Wall Street Journal's Opinion Journal yesterday by Former Delaware Governor Pete DuPont. In it, DuPont cites some very strong evidence of improved environmental data and presents some scientifically-based skepticism about the various global warming claims. He also points out that on the first Earth Day in 1970, the New York Times predicted \"intolerable deterioration and possible extinction\" for humans due to pollution. Indeed, says DuPont, one environmentalist, Paul Ehrlich, predicted that 4 billion people (including 65 million Americans) would die from famine in the 80's. And yes, he meant the nineteen eighties. Hysteria is nothing new -- after all, it sells papers.\n \n -- A few days ago, we mentioned the new study by the Business and Media Institute entitled, \"Fire and Ice\", which pretty well documented the on-again, off-again claims by various pundits and media about global warming, cooling, and warming over the past 80 years or so.\n \n -- The Marshall Institute has done extensive work on the topic as well, publishing a book last year entitled, \"Shattered Consensus:The True State of Global Warming,\" a collection of ten essays on global warming, that, the Institute says, covers \"the earth's temperature history and disparities between what has been predicted about climate change and what has actually been observed.\n \n -- Our friend Bob Carter, whom we've written about and who has commented in this space before, from Down Under, sent us this link and this link to sites that are loaded with articles and research essentially poking holes not in the ozone but in Al Gore's premise.\n \n -- Finally, the Competitive Enterprise Institute website has a section dedicated to global warming, with some papers and articles as well as links to other like-minded groups like the Center for Science and Public Policy, GlobalWarming.org, CO2 Science and World Climate Report, the latter a blog dedicated to this topic.\n \n The fact is we have not made this our life's work, like Al Gore has apparently done. We don't have access to Gore's resources and we're not running for anything. What we have is a healthy skepticism, a blog and access to Google. It doesn't take long to find these sites, all of which are filled with information and science that debunks the global warming hysteria.\n \n At the end of the day, we believe that folks are entitled to their opinions. But they ought to be informed. Of late, the public has been subjected to nothing short of a carpet bombing of information from the left on global warming, all in the name of consensus. We just wanted to provide a little balance to this debate. As you watch the Gore-mania unfold these days, and hear all the fantastic claims, we note the many resources cited above and ask the question posed at the outset:\n \n \"Does this look like consensus to you?\"\n \n [Update] : More links have come in from readers today. Here's a page from the Association of British Drivers. Here's a link to a good piece in the National Review noting that Antarctica is actually gaining ice, due to a cooling trend, and Here's a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Harper-- signed by 60 scientists -- warning him that climate change is \"poorly understood.\" Finally, here's an article from the (UK) Telegraph), blaming it all on a hotter sun. \n \n Posted by Pat Cleary at May 24, 2006 7:26 AM",

In a true class system one could have all of those and be stuck in the class they were born into. My great grand father was a immigrant who worked on a farm who put all of his money into his children's education. My grandfather was one of the few to go to college and he then spent all of his money on my father and his sibling's education. Now I and my family are currently paying the AMT emoticon_xgood . Social mobility exists. \n\n \n Today, if you have genius, luck, and good ideas, what will almost certainly happen is this:\n \n You develop new product\n You produce and distribute new product\n Giant mega corporation finds that they own base patent for the concept behind that product\n You get used\n You spend everything you have defending yourself\n You run out of money\n You loose case.\n Giant corporation takes your product and remarkets it. \n \n It used to be that we patented \"things\". Now we patent concepts, which pretty much closes down the whole \"innovation\" thing for individuals. I have a pretty good example of this. A guy I went to college with came to me a while back with an invention. It was a set top media center (played Mp3s, AVI's, MPEGS, etc.. as well as having DVR capability and several other really cool features). He wanted help developing it for market. After a little research, we found that TIVO owns the concept of a set top DVR, and they refuse to license it in quantities that an upstart development could use. They just finished suing DishNetwork for infringing on their conceptual patent. \n \n SO, the guy has the genius, he has the luck, he has the idea. There is no doubt in my mind that he could have sold several million of his units. Unfortunatly even our patent system is set up now (I don't think it was originally) so only the wealthy and the mega corporations can derive any benifit from it.",

If you are not a huge multimillion dollar corporate interest, those who have the current insanely overbroad patents just keep you in court until you are broke, then kindly offer to drop their lawsuit and not seek damages if you just sign your patent over to them. People do it because by that point they realize that they can no longer afford to mount a defense, so the alternative is to loose the case, and have not only been wiped out but OWE damages.\n \n This is how we were going to fund the US into the 21st century.

The problem with this is that it limits creative thinking because no one wants to take the time if someone will steal it. But now you can't think of anything new because someone already might have covered it barely. It is like an extreme opposite. \n \n Perhaps they should start a requirement of of exact use of the patented item along with 1-2 yrs to start selling or anyone can use it. \n \n How the amazon patent made it is beyond me.
