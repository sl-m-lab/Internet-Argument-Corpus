The European robin, Erithacus rubecula, also bounds rather than walks: presumably that, plus the red breast (orange in your case?) led to the initial confusion.\n \n The muscle attachments of T. rex leg bones, together with measurements of stride length (there's a clue) strongly suggest it didn't hop.\n \n We all ask stupid questions.

   "We have found fossilized t-rex footprints. They put one foot in front of the other, just like we do.\nTechnically, I think it would be more accurate to say that we have found fossilized footprints that may have been made by a t-rex, or were probably made by a t-rex. Just like in the Paluxy River in Texas. The tracks there are thought to be made by a species of Acrocanthosaurus, a species of Pleurocoelus, and an Iguanodon. Fossils of all three have been found in strata of similar age in both Texas and Oklahoma. However, we can't exclude the possibility that the tracks were made by some organisms from which we haven't found a fossil record.\n \n Isn't it funny that Dinosaur Valley State Park has two \"life size\" models of dinosaurs; one is a \"brontosaurus\" donated by the Sinclair Oil Company, the other is a horrible model of a t-rex.\n \n Edit: I forgot. The tracks in the paluxy indicate that the theropod walked one foot in front of the other. No indication of hopping at all.\n \n I also notice that hopping is not necessarily a characteristic of birds. Even flighted birds walk. Around here we have grackles that I have never seen hop. Sparrows hop, doves don't. And of course, egrets and herons definitely don't hop. I've never seen a barn swallow on the ground, but I think that mockingbirds do both.",
