   "Bonjour! My name is Jeannette, 21. I am a student; I live in France in the western city of Nantes. You may've heard from the news that currently France is boiling with rage - thousands of students go into demonstrations and scuffle with the police. \n As for me, I do not part those riots. Of course I think that prime minister de Villepin should have foreseen his new job law would result into riots among students and Chirac shouldn't have signed it anyway. But still I don't understand why everyone here got so unscrewed? \n My boyfriend is a member of UNEF. On Wednesday, after he came back from demonstration hereabout, he showed me several leaflets with the same heading \"D&#1081;but\". It was said there that students must assert their rights through defiance - this is the only means to come into notice of the authorities and carry one's point. On the reverse of the leaflets there were instructions for protest actions in Nantes on Wednesday - demonstrators were to stop traffic around the city's wholesale meat and product market hall. \n My boyfriend told me he was given these leaflets when he met union leaders at the demonstration. \n I heard that students in other cities received similar instructions for protest actions. For example, in Toulouse, students blocked mail trucks outside sorting center to try to disrupt postal delivery. Students in Chambery stood on rail tracks and did not to let trains go. In Paris the Eiffel Tower was blocked, at the Place d'Italy, students smashed store windows, bus shelters, damaged cars and telephone boxes, and hurled stones and chunks of paving at the police squads. \n Now where did these leaflets arrive from? I read on LiveJournal site that someone saw them being brought out of the building of US embassy in Paris. I also heard that some French indigent non-student Muslim youth organizations were highly rewarded for taking part in riots in Paris by some US human rights NGOs. So are Americans really mixed up in this? But why? Is America revenging France for Chirac's independent policy?",
