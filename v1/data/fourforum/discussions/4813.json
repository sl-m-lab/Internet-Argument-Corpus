   "To recap; after a hundred or so years of colonial rule, by the Egyptians, French, British, Italians, foreigners established a Democracy in Somalia. The government was unstable and quickly overthrown in a 1969 coup by US backed Marxist dictator Siad Barre. \n \n Under Siad the Somali people suffered famine, invaded Soviet backed Ethiopia, being pushed back after Cuban troops were brought in. Siad's \"Red Berets\" terrorised dissidents, collectively punishing ethnic/tribal groups who opposed his rule. Genocidal operations were targeted at several groups, including the tribe who occupied the capital, Mogadishu. Siad was supported by copious amounts of western aid, some humanitarian, some military.\n \n Elderly and suffering from diabetes, he was in a car accident which resulted in a power struggle between Siad's generals and a revolt in the capital. He was forced to flee in 1991 to Kenya. No clear \"winner\" emerged, and Somalia became a \"failed state\".\n \n From 1992, UN \"peacekeepers\", situated themselves in Somalia, ostensibly to assist in humanitarian efforts, and were ordered not to intervene, \"don't shoot unless you are fired upon.\" While this occurred, there was a power struggle betwen Aideed and Mahdi, who had both participated in the coup. Mahdi had declared himself president, Aideed had been elected president in some manner of voting scheme among the clans, under a traditional Somali sytem of governance known as \"Kritarchy\" Mahdi refused to step down. Aideed, with the majority of clans on his side, controlled everything but a part of Mogadishu, and part of southern somalia where his troops fought Siad's remaining forces. Europe, especially Italy, was backing Mahdi, because he promised western style democracy. In 1993, the UN entered Mogadishu to shut down an Aideed controlled radio station broadcasting what they termed propaganda (anti-UN messages). They were unsuccessful in this endeavour, 24 Pakistani troops were killed, resulting in the US sending a contingent to get Aideed, culminating in the disastrous events of Black Hawk down. Over a 5 month period, dozens of US and UN troops were killed, dead US soldiers dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, and \"6000 - 10,000\" Somalis were killed in the fighting.\n \n The UN withdrew, its mission having failed, in 1995. Bin Laden expressed that the events in Mogadishu convinced him that the US was a paper tiger, that it could be defeated, at least in an urban environment.\n \n The News and Observer reported, \"The city has been generally quieter since U.N. forces left in early March, although there is sporadic factional fighting.\"\n \n In the end, no one was able to control Somalia. The consequences of stateless Somalia are controversial. There have been 14 attempts at reinstituting a standing government in Somalia since 1995, none yet have made it into the capital.\n \n A few quotes\n \n \nAt night, it is easy to tell good neighbourhoods from bad. The better ones have diesel generators for electricity, and people walk the streets. But in the Medina district - controlled by warlord Muse Sude Yalahow - there is only darkness and fear of his notoriously undisciplined gunmen. \n\n \n The World Bank reports \nAs a result [of creative private sector solutions], Somalia boasts lower\n rates of extreme poverty and, in some cases, better\n infrastructure than richer countries in Africa.... \n Many local companies have teamed up with\n international giants such as Sprint (U.S.) and\n Telenor (Norway), providing mobile phones\n and building new landlines. Vigorous competition\n has pushed prices well below typical levels\n in Africa, and Somalia now has 112,000 fixed\n lines and 50,000 mobile subscribers, up from\n 17,000 lines before 1991....\n Entrepreneurs have worked around Somalia's\n lack of a functioning electricity grid, payment\n systems, and metering. They have divided cities\n into manageable quarters and provide electricity\n locally using secondhand generators bought\n in Dubai. They offer households a menu of\n choices (daytime, evening, or 24-hour service)\n and charge per lightbulb...\n In 1989 the national carrier (partly owned by\n Alitalia) operated just one airplane and one international\n route. Today the sector boasts about 15\n firms, more than 60 aircraft, 6 international destinations,\n more domestic routes, and many more\n flights\n\n \n \n Douglas Long \n \nMogadishu has 1 million people, two airports, an ocean port, a TV station, and good cellular phone service, all of this without any government! While the gun battles were impressive with the tracer rounds flying across the city skyline, it would be more accurate to say that the place was peaceful 99.9% of the time. Most interestingly, poor people would sit next to the roads with a flag that indicated they needed some help. This was the Somali version of panhandling. Yet people would help. Very few people carried guns. After all these years without government, there is an equilibrium in which they don't need to carry guns on a daily basis. Other than the short burst of gunfire each evening that always seemed to happen at the same place (K4 Intersection) at the same time (just after sundown), the Somalis were very friendly to me and I saw no fighting of any type\n\n \n Peter Maas, May 2001, Atlantic Monthly\n \nthe very absence of a government may have helped nurture an African oddity - a lean and efficient business sector that does not feed at a public trough controlled by corrupt officials\n\n \n On the other side of the coin, the country plays host to a large number of \"Warlords\", a warlord being a kind of clan leader. They come in a number of varieties. Some may act as highway robbers, setting up \"checkpoints\" and demanding money. Others may simply be clan elders, and may organise voluntary \"police\" patrols to keep the peace. Sometimes warlords fight other warlords, with their \"militias\".\n \n The US has expressed it is concerned there may be terrorists in Somalia. Though there is no actual evidence of this, Aideed's son, himself a US marine, has expressed that his father had contact with Bin Laden. As a result, post 9-11, the US shut down the most popular Xawala, the traditional banking system Somalis use to transfer money internationally, under concerns (but without any evidence), that it was being used to finance terrorists. As a result, many Somali families whose heads were working abroad lost their life savings.\n \n There are reports of toxic waste having been dumped off the coast, and locals being poisoned eating fish, medical waste and other pollutants washing up on sure. Suspected are the Italian Mafia.\n \n There don't seem to be many roads. In commercial areas, shopkeepers maintain the roads in front of their own premises. It is debatable whether this lack of raods is because they are \"public goods\", and that without a government to tax and provide them, they will be \"undersupplied\", or whether in a developing nation, like Somalia, consumers have more urgent needs (like electricity, telecommunications, clean food and water, transportation) than paved surfaces to drive on, and that they will come later on, once the more urgent needs are taken care of.\n \n At present, the UN is attempting to install the Somali Transitional Government, to \"restore peace\", and law and order. To put an end to the rule of warlords, and install democracy. A parliament has been formed. The parliament is composed of the very same warlords the government is supposed to be about stopping. Many of them are former members of Siad Barre's marxist regime. The warlords and former bureaucrats have \"elected\" a President between them, so in some sense, this makes their government democratic. They are currently stationed in Kenya. They were supposed to return to Mogadishu in February, but their plane apparently had \"mechanical problems\".\n \n In light of \"security concerns\", namely, that if they entered Mogadishu, they would be shot, they have asked the UN to supply troops to accompany them. Initially 20,000 were hoped for, but it appears now that only 6000 will be suppled, from such regional powers as Sudan and Uganda, and who knows when.\n \n MPs in the transitional government occassionally battle \n each other, while a recent parliamentary meeting resulted in four MPs heading to the hospital, dozens others wounded, after they beat each other with walking canes and chairs.\n \n The World Bank has committed US $10 million towards the re-establishment of government in Somalia, noting also that it would work out arrangements with any new government the repayment of US $270 million in outstanding loans it had made the former dictator Siad Barre.\n \n At present whether the MPs return to Somalia and form a government remains up in the air. Kenya grows tired of playing host to their delegation, claiming it is causing \"untold harm\" to the Kenyan people. News stations misreported the brawl as being the Kenyan parliament, damaging Kenya's reputation, while Somali Ministers apparently don't pay their bills , to the tune of US $10 million.\n \n A hotel owner playing host to many of the delegates, who initially heralded their stay as a financial windfall , has gone into receivership after MPs did not pay their bills, and caused heavy smoking related damage. Donors who once footed the bills ceased in 2003, citing mismanagement of funds. They are appealing to the public for assistance in meeting their obligations.\n \n Somali newspapers and radio stations now openly refer to the Somali Transitional Government as the Ethiopian Puppet Government, while some Islamic Clerics have urged their followers to fight any African \"peacekeepers\" who enter the country.\n \n here is a video of the government that will bring peace to Somalia.",
