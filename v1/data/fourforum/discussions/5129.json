   "The main question that should be asked\n \n Should the american people support bad policy no matter what? Just to be patriotic and all?\n\n \n I have argued that the underlying strategy behind the Iraq policy cannot be revealed for obvious reasons. It is really impossible for anyone to know if it is bad policy unless they are privy to the plans and strategy that went into the Iraq policy. What we do know is that the U.S. policy prior to 9/11; namely waiting for the terrorists to strike us again and again was not working. \n \n The same argument could have been made for the Allied fighting the Nazis in North Africa during WWII. There was little or no threat to the Allies there but it was necessary to fight the Nazis where we could find them. As to Iraq we could hardly have parachuted troops into Iran (the foremost state sponsor of terrorism) but we could get rid of a troublesome dictator and murderous thug and have a base of operations to take down the terrorist network in the Middle East. The alternative might have been to operate off the decks of aircraft carriers or firing expensive cruise missiles \"up some camel's butt.\" \n \n The bottom line question here for the left to answer is this. Is Al Queda a stronger or weaker force than they were prior to 9/11? Is America safer than it was prior to 9/11? I would argue that the answer to those questions are self-evident. Therefore I would also argue that we are engaged in a correct policy in Iraq. But I, like you and everyone else, have not seen the strategic plan nor been engaged in the reasons for our policy. We can speculate but we can't know for sure. Since we cannot know, I am inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to our president who is provided with the most relevant and secret of information. No one should think this decision to invade Iraq was taken lightely.",

Who, in the light of reality, could possibly still believe Bush has adopted an effective course of action? \n \n To admit that the Bush fiasco is not the sucess that his supporters claim it to be, one would have to put politics aside. Also, to do that one would have to put aside their pride and deal with the bitter reality. It's much easier to spin for them, or so it appears. But then again, reality is perception. If you percieve that Bush is doing right by the US, then that is your reality. It is not my reality however. I have a problem with being unable to step outside of the facts. Real reality is all I can work with. But your loyalty is admirable none the less. Like him or not, he is still our president. He's all we got right now.\n \n They say when you get lemons, make lemonade. It would be much easier if I could get in line with the fallacy, I just can't seem to make myself fall for it though. But that is not the fault of my country. Our hearts are in the right place. I just feel that some have been disillusioned, but they feel the same about me so perhaps we all could be a little misguided. Who's to say? Even with our faults and the powers that be, America is STILL number one in my book. Never take my criticisms of the Bush administration as a knock against my nation.

(That's a rhetorical question for the \"mental midgets\" here.) Neither was I.

I read it three times it was so good. You really ought to learn more about history before you judge Bush.\n \n Specifically as to Bush's last press conference, he was well briefed and he responded to every question with knowledge and understanding seldom seen before. I listened carefully and I haven't heard any columnist/opiner or whoever find anything to fault. He knew what he was talking about and did a fine job. This business about Bush's mental ability is a cheap shot by those without an effective argument. They don't like his Texas twang and his enunciation of words, etc., and that somehow makes him stupid. \n \n I remember Harry Truman and I can tell you that Truman was about as coarse and non-intellectual a politician as you would find anywhere. He was in fact the only president in the 20th century who was not a college graduate. However he was a quick learner and made wise decisions as history has borne out. He is now considered by most historians to be a \"near great\" president and some have even gone so far as to label him a \"great\" president. The jury is still out on Bush 43 but one thing for sure, he will be no inconsequential president. Love him or hate him, he is making history and as I believe making the decisions that will keep this country safe from the barbarians who would destroy our civilization.",

   "Try this.\n \n DID HITLERISM DIE WITH HITLER? He Meant What He Said by Omer Bartov\n \n Post date 01.23.04 | Issue date 02.02.04\n \n Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf By Adolf Hitler Edited by Gerhard L. Weinberg (Enigma Books, 293 pp., $32) \n \n Adolf Hitler's so-called second book was not published in his lifetime. Written, as Gerhard Weinberg convincingly speculates, in late June and early July 1928, the book's publication was postponed because Mein Kampf, Hitler's first massive text, was selling very badly and could hardly stand competition with another publication by the same author. Later, after Hitler was appointed chancellor and Mein Kampf became one of the greatest (and allegedly most unread) best-sellers of all times, the second book was apparently seen as disclosing his foreign policy plans too explicitly to allow publication. It was locked away, only to be discovered by Weinberg in 1958. Published in German three years later, the second book came out in a pirated and unreliable English edition in 1962. It is only now that the public can read this text in an authoritative translation, accompanied by extensive and updated notes by Weinberg.\n \n Must we read another ranting book by Hitler? This book is certainly as close to the heart of darkness as a book can be. But it should have been read in its time, and it should be read now. It was an explicit warning to the world of what could be expected from the F\u00fchrer of what was to become for twelve terrible years the Third Reich. When Hitler wrote it, no one could tell whether his plans and fantasies would ever be transformed into reality. Much of what Hitler put together in this book could already be found in Mein Kampf, if anyone had bothered to read it, and other ideas were expressed unambiguously in his speeches. Yet it was difficult to believe that anyone in his right mind would try to translate such rhetoric into policy. It was generally thought that in power Hitler would be constrained by the realities of diplomacy, the limits of Germany's power, the national interests of the Reich, and the military, economic, and political partners with whom he had to make policy.\n \n Today we know that this was a fatal misunderstanding, rooted more in wishful thinking than in the kind of realism on which contemporary observers prided themselves and expected would eventually keep Hitler, too, in his place. Today we know that Hitler said precisely what he meant to say. We can also note, with the benefit of hindsight, that Hitler was neither insane, nor irrational, nor a fool. Several decades ago A.J.P. Taylor wrote that Hitler may have been mad or criminal as far as his plans and policies for world conquest and genocide were concerned, but in the conduct of his diplomacy in the 1930s he acted very much like everyone else, seizing opportunities and moving gradually toward the goals he had set himself. Reading this second book, I tend to agree. Hitler's rhetoric here is not more empty-headed than that of many of his contemporaries; his use of clich\u00e9s hardly exceeds what one encountered in the newspapers; his knowledge of history, his psychological observations, his criticism of his rivals, are in many respects typical of his place and time.\n \n But of course Hitler was about much more than this. He was also a pathological mass murderer who caused the death of millions and the destruction of Europe, and so it is important to know that he did precisely what he promised to do. For we still do not seem to have learned a simple crucial lesson that Hitler taught us more definitively than anyone else in history: some people, some regimes, some ideologies, some political programs, and, yes, some religious groups, must be taken at their word. Some people mean what they say, and say what they will do, and do what they said.\n \n Most liberal-minded, optimistic, well-meaning people are loath to believe this. They would rather think that fanaticism is merely an \"epiphenomenal\" fa\u00e7ade for politics, that opinions can be changed, that everyone can be corrected and improved. In many cases, this is true--but not in all cases, and not in the most dangerous ones. There are those who practice what they preach and are proud of it. They view those who act otherwise, who compromise and pull back from ultimate conclusions, as opportunists, as weaklings, as targets to be easily conquered and subdued by their own greater determination, hardness, and ruthlessness. When they say they will kill you, they will kill you--if you do not kill them first.\n \n Reading Hitler's second book is useful, of course, for students of Nazism. But they will have already read it in part or in whole, and nothing that Hitler says here will come to them as much of a surprise. This is a book that should be read, rather, by contemporary journalists, political observers, and all concerned people who have the stomach to recognize evil..\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1064474/posts\n \n https://ssl.tnr.com/p/docsub.mhtml?i=20040202&s=bartov020204",

I have a friend from Spain who thought people were making fun of her in shops when she came to England due to the amount of pleases and thankyous involved in even a simple transaction. I felt the Spanish were rude in shops for the opposite reason as they never seem to use por favor or gracias. I worked for a time in Bremen in Germany and found the older people there downright hostile and the younger ones friendly. In France, the key is to attempt to speak French. The Frence people are proud of their language. If you do not bother, they will not bother with you and will be rude. If you do try, they will normally be friendly (and will hurredly remember how to speak English themselves in order to avoid hearing an Englishman ruin their beautiful language with his awful accent ;)).\n \n Having said all that, Paris stands out as an oddity. They really do seem to be rude to everyone, including themselves. Again it's likely a culture thing: non Parisians (whether French or foreign) simply miss the subtleties of their politeness.
