   "Researchers find first clear genetic link to the complex disorder\n \n Fascinating. This may also explain why some victims of autism can recover later in life (rarely). Everyone has two copies of each gene (one from mother, one from father). In many cases, only one of those genes becomes active while the other is deactivated by some unknown mechanism. What if, as an autistic child matures, the unactive gene becomes active while the active one is deactivated. I wonder if that may be the case.",
