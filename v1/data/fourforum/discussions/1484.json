   "Some lengthy Christmas reading. It deals with a Christian understanding of Genesis, and has a small dig at science at the end :)\n \n \n \"If the world has a beginning, and if it has been created, enquire who gave it this beginning, and who was the Creator: or rather, in the fear that human reasonings may make you wander from the truth, Moses has anticipated enquiry by engraving in our hearts, as a seal and a safeguard, the awful name of God: 'In the beginning God created' - It is He, beneficent Nature, Goodness without measure, a worthy object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty the most to be desired, the origin of all that exists, the source of life, intellectual light, impenetrable wisdom, it is He who 'in the beginning created heaven and earth.'\" St. Basil the Great, The Hexaemeron quoted at http://www.orthodox.net/gleanings/creation.html \n \n Fr Seraphim Rose said this about Genesis \"Some Protestant fundamentalists tell us it is all (or virtually all) 'literal.\" But such a view places us in some impossible difficulties: quite apart form our literal or non-literal interpretation of various passages, the very nature of the reality which is described in the first chapters of genesis the very creation of all things) makes it quite impossible for everything to be understood 'literally'; we don't even have words, for example, to describe 'literally' how something can come from nothing. How does God \"speak\"? - does He make a noise which resounds in an atmosphere that doesn't yet exist?\" (Genesis Creation and Early Man, p69).\n \n However \"We (Orthodox) believe that the created world itself is a 'mystery' originating in the sovereign will of God accomplished by the action (energia) of the Holy Trinity. We confess in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed (325/381) that the Father is the \"Creator of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible\", the Son \"He through whom all things were made\", and the Holy Spirit, the \"Creator of life\" (zoopion).\" http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8050.asp \n \n \"And He is without beginning, because He is unbegotten; and He is unchangeable, because He is immortal. And he is called God [Qeos] on account of His having placed [teqeikenai] all things on security afforded by Himself; and on account of [qeein], for qeein means running, and moving, and being active, and nourishing, and foreseeing, and governing, and making all things alive. But he is Lord, because He rules over the universe; Father, because he is before all things; Fashioner and Maker, because He is creator and maker of the universe; the Highest, because of His being above all; and Almighty, because He Himself rules and embraces all. For the heights of heaven, and the depths of the abysses, and the ends of the earth, are in His hand, and there is no place of His rest. For the heavens are His work, the earth is His creation, the sea is His handiwork; man is His formation and His image; sun, moon, and stars are His elements, made for signs, and seasons, and days, and years, that they may serve and be slaves to man; and all things God has made out of things that were not into things that are, in order that through His works His greatness may be known and understood.\" So said Theophiuls of Antioch** in \"To Autolycus\" quoted at \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/theophilus-book1.html \n Further... \n \"For as the soul in man is not seen, being invisible to men, but is perceived through the motion of the body, so God cannot indeed be seen by human eyes, but is beheld and perceived through His providence and works. For, in like manner, as any person, when he sees a ship on the sea rigged and in sail, and making for the harbour, will no doubt infer that there is a pilot in her who is steering her; so we must perceive that God is the governor [pilot] of the whole universe, though He be not visible to the eyes of the flesh, since He is incomprehensible. For if a man cannot look upon the sun, though it be a very small heavenly body, on account of its exceeding heat and power, how shall not a mortal man be much more unable to face the glory of God, which is unutterable? For as the pomegranate, with the rind containing it, has within it many cells and compartments which are separated by tissues, and has also many seeds dwelling in it, so the whole creation is contained by the spirit of God, and the containing spirit is along with the creation contained by the hand of God. As, therefore, the seed of the pomegranate, dwelling inside, cannot see what is outside the rind, itself being within; so neither can man, who along with the whole creation is enclosed by the hand of God, behold God. Then again, an earthly king is believed to exist, even though he be not seen by all; for he is recognised by his laws and ordinances, and authorities, and forces, and statues; and are you unwilling that God should be recognised by His works and mighty deeds? \" \n (Ibid) \n Creation is thus a window onto God. We say that God is love, and it is because of His love that He created. To suggest that God just made the initial big bang and sat back to watch it unfold is to deny His love. What father would it be that conceives of a child and then abandons it? Not a loving one! Likewise God didn't abandon His creation, He constantly works with His creation. \n \n God is an active participant in the creation. Further, the relationship of a very real Adam is essential to Christianity, almost as much so as that of Jesus.\n \n \"If one is to vigorously and consistently maintains that Jesus Christ is the unique Savoir Who has brought salvation to a world in need of salvation, one obviously must know what is the nature of the need which provoked this salvation. (St. Athanasius, De Incarnatione Verbi Dei, 4) It would, indeed, seem foolish to have medical doctors trained to heal sickness if there were no such thing as sickness in the world. Likewise, a savoir who claims to save people in need of no salvation is a savoir only unto himself.\" http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frjr_sin.htm \n This 'sickness' then is sin. It is ancestral sin, the sin committed by Adam. \"And behold, as you see, the sentence of God remains forever as an eternal chastisement...For this reason the Almighty Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, came so as to humble Himself in place of Adam.\" (St. Symeon the New Theologian \"The First-Created Man\", p44). \n \"The sin committed by our progenitors in paradise, with all its consequences, passed and passes from them to all their posterity. What the first people became after the Fall, such also till now are their descendants in the world. \"Adam begat a son in his own likeness, after his image\" (Genesis 5:3, KJV). Estrangement from God, the loss of grace, the distortion of God's image, the perversion and weakening of the bodily organism, which ends with death - here is Adam's sad legacy, received by each of us at our very appearance in the world. \"As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream,\" teaches the Orthodox catechism, \"so from an ancestor infected with sin, and hence mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected with sin, and hence mortal.\" http://www.stjohndc.org/Homilies/9609a.htm \n \"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men (Romans 5:12 ).\" By refusing communion with God, Adam cut himself off from the Source of Life. Having separated himself from God, Adam, in a sense, starved his nature from the gifts of God. Because man was given dominion over all creation, St. Paul insists that all of creation has fallen as well.(Original Sin, p 2 as quoted on http://www.akins.org/matthew/paul.html#tthFtNtACH) \n \"Undoubtedly, one of the most important causes of heresy is the failure to understand the exact nature of the human situation described by the Old and New Testaments, to which the historical events of the birth, teachings, death, resurrection and second coming of Christ are the only remedy. The failure to understand this automatically implies a perverted understanding of what it is that Christ did and continues to do for us, and what our subsequent relation is to Christ and neighbour within the realm of salvation. The importance of a correct definition of original sin and its consequences can never be exaggerated. Any attempt to minimize its importance or alter its significance automatically entails either a weakening or even a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the Church, sacraments and human destiny.\" http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frjr_sin.htm. Thus, it is meaningless, or worse still utterly wrong to downplay the relationships established in Genesis. It is the beginning of the story of Man, and the story of Man's sin. Without it, why would Jesus come to us? \n \n This is not a novel approach to reading Genesis, in fact it is the allegorical approach that is novel! Countless Christian thinkers have throughout the centuries held to the literal truth... \n \"No on should think that the Creation of Six Days is an allegory\" said St Ephraim the Syrian \n \n St. Basil the Great in his Hexatemeron says \"Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.\" \n \n St.Macarius the Great of Egypt in commenting on Genesis 3:24 said \"This is a passage which many of us might have expected to have only a mystical meaning, but this great seer of Divine things assures us that is is also true \"just as it is written\" for those capable of seeing it.\" (pp85-6 Seraphim Rose \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision) \n *Properly speaking, the phrase ``original sin'' is not generally used by Eastern Fathers or contemporary Orthodox theologians. This phrase was introduced by St. Augustine in his polemics against Pelagians. The phrase continued to be used, primarily in the west, to denote the idea of ``original guilt.'' \n \n (Eastern theologians have long preferred the phrase \"ancestral sin,'' which connotes the sin of our first ancestor, Adam. The term was used to denote \"the sin of Adam, which was transmitted to his descendants and weighs upon them\" or \"sin-sickness.'' \n http://www.akins.org/matthew/paul.html )\n \n Further... \"With regard to original sin, the difference between Orthodox Christianity and the West may be outlined as follows: \n In the Orthodox Faith, the term \"original sin\" refers to the \"first\" sin of Adam and Eve. As a result of this sin, humanity bears the \"consequences\" of sin, the chief of which is death. Here the word \"original\" may be seen as synonymous with \"first.\" Hence, the \"original sin\" refers to the \"first sin\" in much the same way as \"original chair\" refers to the \"first chair.\" \n In the West, humanity likewise bears the \"consequences\" of the \"original sin\" of Adam and Eve. However, the West also understands that humanity is likewise \"guilty\" of the sin of Adam and Eve. The term \"Original Sin\" here refers to the condition into which humanity is born, a condition in which guilt as well as consequence is involved. \n \n In the Orthodox Christian understanding, while humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their wilful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death.\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/Q-and-A_OLD/St-Augustine-and-Original-Sin.html\n \n Thus the creation story, and that of the first real and actual man, Adam is fundamental to the Christian story. This story has been undermined by many Chrisitans.\n \"Liberal Protestantism can be fairly simply identified. It is a tendency which regards human reason as paramount and which begins its theologising from the agenda of the secular world. It thus appears as continual impulse to modernize the faith, to abandon the confines of the historic creeds, and to accommodate the thought and practices of the churches to those of the secular world...In many ways, liberal Protestantism was (an)... attempt to create an intellectually supportable version of Christianity, in the face of massive divisions within the body of those who claimed to worship the same God.\" Schaeffer, F, \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", pp193-4. \n \"In short, the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God an set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism. That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government, law and morality. It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity.\" (Fr. Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man\", p17) \n \"Today, confused and well-meaning Protestants of all denominational persuasions, having little or no historic foundation at all, take Scripture - as their only source of spiritual authority... Each individual becomes his or her own \"ecumenical council,\" \"bishop\" and \"priest.\" Each is a law unto himself as he reads the Bible and claims, \"God is speaking to me.\"\" Schaeffer, F, \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", p195\n \n But what of science, and man's capacity to summount all with the power of his mind?\n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught hat a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74.\n \n Science is based on the understanding of scientists who are flawed humans.\n \n Science is, for the most part about hypothesis, experiment and observation. If experiments can be repeated with the same observations, such events usually pass into the realm of scientific fact. \n Once, there was a belief in spontaneous generation; that life would instantaneously arise from non-life, usually decaying biotic matter. This belief existed because people could see maggots ?form? on rotting meat. The first serious attack on the idea of spontaneous generation was made in 1668 the Italian physician Francesco Redi. Up till that time, it was widely believed that maggots arose spontaneously in rotting meat. Redi believed that maggots developed from eggs laid by flies. To test his hypothesis, he set out meat in a variety of flasks, some open to the air, some sealed completely, and others covered with gauze. As he had expected, maggots appeared only in the open flasks in which the flies could reach the meat and lay their eggs. \n It was through hypothesis, experimentation and then observation that Redi showed spontaneous generation did not occur. But for the Darwinist, we must now reverse this ideal. NOW we must believe that life spontaneously developed from non-life, and all without benefit of observation. Worse still, at least with old theories of spontaneous generation life was believed to have come from organic material, now we are to believe that life came from non-organic material. \n How too, does a theory of natural selection or survival of the fittest account for the origins of life? What 'need' was there for a Carbon molecule to bind with another molecule, as Carbon does not need to 'survive' as it's not even alive... in fact it exists perfectly well by itself! What was the mechanism then behind the origins of life (in Darwinist terms)?*\n \n Science has thrown out its own methods; it replaces experiment in order to oust God.\n \n Here is a more easily understood and insidious use of science for socio-political ends. In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as you science to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex. Even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman?s sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204** They had a vast amount of scientific data to back them up, including physiology that showed that position of the clitoris made it impossible for it to be stimulated by penetrative sex.\n \n Science is only as 'objective' as scientists will allow.\n \n \"If you believe that man came up from savagery, you will interpret all past history in those terms. But according to Orthodoxy, man fell from Paradise. In evolutionary philosophy there is no room for a supernatural state of Adam. Thos who want to keep both Christianity and evolutionism, therefore, are forced to stick an artificial Paradise onto an ape-like creature. These are obviously two different systems which cannot be mixed.\" \n Fr. Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision\", pp324-5 \n \"The most important question which is raised for Orthodox theology by the modern theory of evolution is the nature of man, and in particular the nature of the first-created man Adam.\" (Ibid, p46) \n \n But, I repeat it can't be made more clear than... \n \"No one should think that the Creation of Six Days is allegory...\" St. Ephraim the Syrian (quoted in Ibid p86). \n \n \n *People will say abiogenesis has nothing to do with evolution should note:\n Darwin himself hypothesised a 'primordial soup' \n Here, for your information... \n Dawkins, Richard. 1996. \"Climbing mount improbable.\" W.W. Norton, New York. pp. 282-283. Where he deals with this issue. \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html is the web-site of a group who have as their banner \"Exploring the Creation/Evolution controversy\" \n Obviously these people include it in an over-arching godless theory.\n \n **See also \n Kearnon, P.

   "Most Christian denominations that share Aryan like interpretations of the bible believe that Jesus is not God.\n\n \n I believe you aren't referring to theories on race; therefore you mean Arian, not Aryan.\n \n Secondly most Christian denominations don't share Arian-like interpretations; the way you construct your sentence would ignore this, for you are in fact saying that 'the majority of Christian denominations that share a minority interpretation of the Bible believe...\"\n \n \nThe simplest reason that does not go in to tonnes of bible quoting is the logic of the Jesus redeeming mankind. For a person to be sacrificed they have to die. God can't die. So God can't be Jesus whom died for our sins. If God was Jesus then God died and Satan won the issue of sovereignty.\n\n \n Jesus is both man and God. For you to suggest He didn't die, is to suggest that His suffering, His sacrifice, was not real, but symbolic. Thus, by simple logic, you are denying an actual 'sacrifice'. Therefore, when it says that He died, you ignore it. When it says He suffered, you ignore it. When it says He bled and was tormented, you ignore it.\n \n You ignore the central tenet of 2,000 years of Christianity - that Christ came to save us, by His sacrifice. He is called Saviour, because He saved us. He didn't fake His death. He didn't trick us into believing that He suffered for nothing.\n \n These beliefs were dealt with about 1,700 years ago - or so I thought. See the Nicence Creed which was agreed to by most of Christianity - except for Arians, Nestorians* etc.\n \n How did Satan win? God is three-in-one beings. Part of Him, the Son, is both human and God together. The other parts of God continued to exist.\n \n \nThe problem is most scientist read a literal count of Genesis because it helps them disprove creation. \n\n \n There reading of it doesn't disprove it. It's just them reading it, and misinterpreting it. If I hold the truth, and you misread it, then the mere act of misreading it doesn't lessen the truth.\n \n Using a literal six days you can prove it is not correct by using the speed of light. The night sky would be black for the most part, and the sun which is the its main sequence would be an out of control baby star.\n \n If you read Genesis, it doesn't make 'sense' in the scientific sense because things are brought into being out of 'order' (as determined by science). This is because God shows us He can make it so.\n \n \nGod would have to build the universe in his \"mind\" and create a replication of it with our world only a few thousand years old. If you believe that I am not faulting you, but other branches of science would constantly step on your belief to a point in which you would think that Satan was handing out the Nobel prize himself.\n\n \n Your last sentence makes no sense.

I don't actually know the \"correct\" view of Genesis more than the genetics of humans and animals did not arrive by absolute chance, God controls the universe, and God has a sovereign right to rule.\n\n \n This contradicts itself. You attribute Godness to God - that He controls the universe, but that you have insisted on a timetable -suggesting that he would have to take His time... as according to how you perceive He is capable of acting.\n \n \nThe entire ransom sacrifice relies on the fact that God has complete control over birth, and can totally override genetics at whim. It also shows he has the right to destroy and punish creations, but is merciful enough to allow some of them to be saved.\n\n \n Yet you don't think He can die. He can do what you and I would think is paradoxical, because for God nothing is impossible. You create a situation that says \"God can't do this...\".\n \n *Nestorians claimed that Jesus was a complete Man, inhabited by the Spirit of God - almost like a parasite.\n \n \n PS\n Interestingly enough many take Christians mistake Jesus' words on the Cross, when He says \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" They suggest that God abandoned Him. This is not so.\n \n Jesus was in fact drawing His listeners (Pharisees and Sadducees that were there to witness His death) to a passage of the Bible that predicts His very crucifixtion.

   "this is a problem. when the Bible cant be taken literally, and we start to look at the scripture as all metaphorically speaking, then \"interpretation\" is giving theologians license to invent, delete and twist it to suit their agenda. this is the reason the \"church\" and \"christianity\" is so divided. as long as you declare something metaphorical, there are just about infinity ways it can be \"interpreted\". Also, if interpretation of the Bible is left up to the whims of theologians, then they might as well rewrite their own Bible, which is what a lot of them do, which is why there are so many \"non-denominational\" churches springing up everyday\n \n \"interpretation\" that is deviant from the literal meaning of the words of the Bible is a recipe for division, and I hardly believe thats what it was originally intended for\n \n \n Its actually in the Bible, in the new testament.

We have our own school of theology.\n \n Lots of people call Jesus God in our translation. The main reason for a new translation is the Jews, and others removed God's name Jehovah (The sometimes controversial Anglo equivalent for YHWH) from the bible because of superstition.

For a long time in laymen in America thought God's name was God, or that he didn't have one.\n \n Anyway is your point that the reason we don't believe in the trinity, hellfire, or that all good people go to heaven is bad grammar?

By treating Genesis as some kind of optional extra tacked onto the Bible you begin to lose the knowledge of God.\n \n *God has called Himself 'Father' because it is His way of revealing Himself to us. That does not mean He had male genitalis or such... it is His way of helping we feeble-minded creatures understand Him, He who is, He who is essentially unknowable.\n \n St. Gregory of Nyssa (d.386)\n \"Since then this doctrine is put forth by the Truth itself, it follows that anything which the inventors of pestilent heresies devise besides to subvert this Divine utterance,--as, for example, calling the Father \"Maker\" and \"Creator\" of the Son instead of \"Father,\" and the Son a \"result,\" a \"creature,\" a \"product,\" instead of \"Son,\" and the Holy Spirit the \"creature of a creature,\" and the \"product of a product,\" instead of His proper title the \"Spirit,\" and whatever those who fight against God are pleased to say of Him,--all such fancies we term a denial and violation of the Godhead revealed to us in this doctrine.\"\n http://www.synaxis.org/ecf/volume28/ECF00003.htm\n \n Thus Gospels accord us knowledge of the true nature of Christ, especially by the Gospel of John, Jesus is shown by that writer to be the Son of God, the Word of God, the Image of God etc. He is God.\n \n ST. CYRIL OF JERUSALEM (315-386) said...\n Again, I say, on hearing of a Son, understand it not merely in an improper sense, but as a Son in truth, a Son by nature, without beginning12 ; not as having come out of bondage into a higher state of adoption13 , but a Son eternally begotten by an inscrutable and incomprehensible generation. And in like manner on hearing of the First-born14 , think not that this is after the manner of men; for the first-born among men have other brothers also. And it is somewhere written, Israel is My son, My first-born15 . But Israel is, as Reuben was, a first-born son rejected: for Reuben went up to his father's couch; and Israel cast his Father's Son out of the vineyard, and crucified Him.\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-16.htm\n Footnotes...\n \n 12 Athanasius (de Synodis, \u00a7 15) quotes a passage from the Thalia of Arius, in which he says: \"We praise Him as without beginning, because of Him who has a beginning: and adore Him as eternal, because of Him who in time has come to be. He who is without beginning made the Son a beginning of things created.\"\n It is important, therefore, to notice the sense in which Cyril here calls the Son a!narxoj. The word has two meanings, which should be clearly distinguished, (I) unorginate, (ii) without beginning in time. The former referring to origin, or cause, can properly be applied to the One true God, or to God the Father only, as it is used by Clement of Alexandria (Protrept. cap. v. \u00a7 63: to\\n pa/ntwn poihth\\n. . . a'gnoou=ntej, to\\n a!narxou qeo/n. [Strom. IV. cap. xxv. \u00a7 164: o 9 Qeo\\j de\\ a!narxoj a'rxh\\ tw=n o!lwn pantelh\\j a'rxh=j poihtiko/j]. [Stromat. V. cap. xiv. \u00a7 142: e'c a'rxh=j a'na/rxou]. Methodius (ob. 312 A.D. circ) in a fragment (On things created, \u00a7 8, English Trans. Clark's Ante-Nic. Libr.) comments thus on Joh. i. 1-3: \"And so after the peculiar unbeginning beginning, who is the Father, He (the Word) is the beginning of other things, `by whom all things are made. 0'\"\n In this sense Cyril has said (iv. 4) that God alone is \"unbegotten, unoriginate:\" and in xi. 20 he explains this more fully, - \"Suffer none to speak of a beginning of the Son in time (xr\\ouikh\\n a'rxh/n), but as a timeless beginning acknowledge the Father. For the Father is the beginning of the Son, timeless incomprehensible, without beginning.\" From a confusion of the two meanings the word came to be improperly applied in the sense of \"unoriginate\" to the Son, and to the Spirit; and this improper usage is condemned in the 49th Apostolic Canon, which Hefele regards as amongst the most ancient Canons, and taken from the Apostolic Constitutions, vi. 11: \"If any Bishop or Presbyter shall baptize not according to our Lord's ordinance into the Father, and Son, and Spirit, but into three Unoriginates, or three Sons, or three Paracletes let him be deposed.\" (ii.) Athanasius frequently calls the Son a!narxoj in the sense of `timeless, 0'as being the co-eternal brightness (a'pau/lasma) of the Eternal Light: see de Sent. Dionys. \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16, 22; \"God is the Eternal Light, which never either began or shall cease: accordingly the Brightness is ever before Him, and co-exists with Him, without beginning and ever-begotten (a!narxon kai\\ a'eigene/j).\"\n 13 ei'j prokoph\\n ui 9oqesi/aj Cf. \u00a7 2, note 4.\n 14 Prwto/tokon. The word occurs in Heb. i. 6, which had been read in the Lesson before this Lecture. The exact dogmatic sense of the word is carefully explained by Athanasius (c. Arian. Or. ii. 62l): \"The same cannot be both Only-begotten and Firstborn, except in different relations; - that is, Only-begotten, because of His generation from the father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension to the creation, and His making the many His brethren.\" See Mr. Robertson's discussion of the word prwto/tokoj (Athan. p. 344, in this series), and Bp. Bull (Def. Fid. Nic. iii. 5-8).\n 15 Ex. iv. 22.",

   "\"Hardly 1931\" the name Jehovah's Witnesses was not coined until 1931 in an Ohio convention, you seem not to know much about us, and are aggressive to our religion. That plainly states the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The watchtower is an institution not our religion.\n\n \n That's really semantics. Our Church was founded in 33 AD, but we didn't call ourselves \"Orthodox\" until centuries later. No one would argue that we weren't the Orthodox Church before then.\n \n Certainly your JW sites say your history dates prior to 1931 and if you want to stick with the 1931 idea, then you are being deceptive.\n \n Such as the diversion you laid in your previous post; a rhetorical ploy to draw attention from the numerous false prophecies.\n \n \nI never claimed our version of the bible would explain anything. I never said it was \"correct\". I have stated our bible is controversial repeatedly. I never said your bibles are incorrect. In fact I said that we use your bibles, and did not get our own complete until 1960. All I said is Jehovah's Witness can better answer your questions in person.\n\n \n Using your translation of the Bible, yes.\n \n \nJesus is savior. No debate.\n\n \n I am wrong to suggest this. You do, however claim our notions of Jesus' divinity are misplace.\n \n \nI already told you I don't know much about the orthodoxy. I even asked for you to help me understand where you are coming from. Yet I never attacked it. I just told you we don't consider it a credible source to base our doctrine on. \n\n \n Then you are attacking it.* Our basis for all teachings is on our authority, which is given to us by Jesus. We only teach based on this authority. If we didn't have it, we'd be like all the man-made religions such as yours. It is a central part of Orthodoxy.\n \n Orthodoxy does not need to rely solely on the Bible for authority, because the Church itself is the authority; not the Bible. As an institution, we existed before the Bible, and we put the Bible together. The Bible was made to serve us, not the other way around.\n \n \n \n *I am not upset, and 'attacking' is quite a strong word to use, and it may give the impression that I need to 'chill-out'. But if you draw a criticism of someone's beliefs then I have every right to examine your statements, your beliefs, and draw you to the conclusions that I have made. I am not doing this for its own sake, but I see flaws in your argument based on certain facts...\n \n a) your faith claims a gift of prophecy, but this has been shown to be in serious error more than once\n b) your faith claims to have a knowledge of the Bible that they some how came upon 1,800 years after the fact.",

Further then, His suffering was never 'real' nor was His crucifixion.\n \n Which leaves us back at the starting point - who in history have shared your views and been persecuted by the Church?\n \n \n \n God quite clearly said \"There is one God\"\n \n Pharaoh's magicians simply had powers of demons.\n\n \n As for persecution I will reset my case. No matter what group \"share\" our belief they won't be exact (the JWs 75 years ago are not an exact match) and you will say they are not enought like JWs to count if they were presecuted.

Then this breaks the precedent of \"time indefinite to time indefinite\", because for three days there was no God. The other option is God remote controlled Jesus. This makes the ransom a hoax. Montalban's view of amputating pieces of God then restoring them would be just as bad, or worse even though Montalban does not see it, for God would have lost nothing. The option that we take is like God said Jesus is his Son that he approved. If I left any other view out I apologize. My point is I don't think JWs will ever have a \"revelation\" of the trinity because it would have blasphemous consequences, and totally conflict with things spelled out in the old testament of the bible by adopting things \"hinted\" at.\n\n \n Why do you come up with such nonsense about what you think I said. Jesus is both human and divine. The human part suffered, it was to show us that the suffering was real.\n \n Thus\n \"And we are destined to be reunited, body, soul and spirit, to enjoy the Kingdom of God forever. The resurrected Christ gave us an intimation of these joys as described by St John. The transfigured Body of the Risen Christ can go through doors and walls at the speed of light.\"\n http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/articles/answers/literal.htm",

And you won't get an argument from me about God being the only God as I don't even believe in lesser gods or demons or Satan or any other evil supernatural being. What I'm saying is that the Hebrews BELIEVED there were other gods. I appears to me that the Bible clearly states that in many places. And it also appears to me that the Bible clearly states that the Hebrew god stated out as a war god that was in competition with the other gods in the region. \n \n \n \n Someone a long time ago stated that the earth was 'more or less egg-shaped' on a thread that centered around the Bible saying the earth was a circle. Monty threw a hissy about the earth being flatter at the equator, not at the poles and that it was not pointed. I was pointing out that if you turned 'some' eggs sideways, then the description would fit. So for some eggs, it is a very accurate description because eggs come in a lot of different shapes. Evolution shapes them depending on where they are laid, etc. He's thrown that out every once in a while thinking it would get to me I guess. I just laugh about it.\n \n \n \n Yep I took your advice and was very nice and careful about what I said. We were having a decent back and forth when out of the blue he called me a liar about not reading some post of his. Because of the way I was raised, lying is a hot button for me. I usually control it pretty well but this caught me completely off guard. I'm over it now but that was my last attempt at being nice to the guy. Besides I have fun picking at the guy. At least when I have the time.\n \n What do you mean it's your turn. Is this a tag team. LOL\n\n \n I see your point. \"My turn\" is just an opener and really has little meaning. It was a good entrance. Sort of like Cramer on Seinfeld. LOL\n \n I think there are demons and Satan. I would not call satan a god not even with a little g. I would call him the father of lies and the adversary and much more powerful than I. I have a seminary professor friend who says, \"you are always under someone's influence, you just get to choose whose.\" Not sure what that has to do with the discussion but it seemed to fit concerning satan. \n \n The word lying is a hot button for me too. My wife uses it a lot in the same way. I don't think it is invalid. maybe a bit harsh, but essentially correct. She says it when I say certain things and the context tells her that something different is going on. I think Monty is actually very discerning that way. He himself has said that he can be kind of blustery and kind of jump in with that. There is also the cultural differences, although, I don't actually know what they are. \n \n Monty: Is Australian culture considered to be more \"in your face\" as it were?",

   "Monty: Is Australian culture considered to be more \"in your face\" as it were?\n\n \n \n We have what is called \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\". It is a national sport. The term stems from gardening, when one plant gets too high, it gets cut back. This translates itself as when one person thinks that they are too high and mighty, we cut them down to size. It is a part of egalitarianism which unfortunately, is not as strong an ethos here... as we begin more to follow the individualistic 'goal-orientated' money society of the USA.\n \n For instance, seldom will we call a boss 'sir'.\n \n I recall a story from WWI, which was not uncommon, of Aussie soldiers who'd only salute the officers that they liked.\n \n When evolutionaries pontificate about how they hold the side of rationality, then I go to work with my scythe.\n \n So many posters here have put scientists on a pedestal that they don't deserve; believing that they are beyond human foibles and biases.\n \n But, we don't go around invading countries all the time, so perhaps its better not to have so much pent up anger.",

   "If I said that the Romans worshipped many gods, that's not because I believe that there were many gods, but because I'm describing what the Romans believed. Please provide proof of your theory. Merely re-stating it over and over again is not an argument.\n\n \n I know that! LOL. That's exactly what I was saying. I don't believe there are many gods but the Hebrews did.\n \n \nWhere does it 'clearly state this'? \n\n \n You must not know it monty poly but there are books written on this subject.\n \n \nNo, I said it was flatter at the poles. Which it is. \n\n \n LOL. Another good one monty poly. I know you said it was flatter at the poles. That's why I said 'turn the egg sideways'. LOL\n \n \nIndeed, like you have about me believing in more than one god, which you repeat time and time again; because you think it's only funny, when you make fun of me.\n\n \n Does that bother you?\n \n \nSuch as when I admit that I don't know much on science, and the funny thing is, you've admitted the same thing! Only it's silly when I say it? Or, you forget so easily what you've said.\n\n \n Yes but I depend on the experts. \n \n \nOnly you actually said that the earth-was egg-shaped and it's not, excepting if you contort it to look at it from some odd angle as you describe above, which is so convoluted, like if I claimed that the world is flat, because if I squash it out to be like a map, it would then be flat. \n\n \n No there are some eggs that are almost an exact replicate of the shape of the earth.\n \n \nYou claimed not to know anything about those 4 schools of thought (with regard to the ascent of man). I even posted the message where you replied to one where I mentioned said same schools of thought. Therefore your pretence at ignorance is dishonest.\n \n You ALSO claimed it was my fault because you'd not read all my posts despite having\n a) replied to one of them\n b) had heaps of time\n c) decided to comment on them anyway. \n\n \n You continue to think that everything you write, I read. You write so much that if I'm not replying to that particular comment, I don't pay much attention. I had scanned over you talking about four schools of thought but didn't check anything out. We were having a decent debate and I simply said if you'll make a post saying what you are specifically talking about, I'll take a look. I wasn't going to go back over all the post you had made to try and find out exactly what you were referring to. There was no attempt to pretend ignorance. Now if you don't like that explanation, you know what you can do with it. This is the last time I'm addressing this subject because it's petty and I'm not wasting my time on it any more.\n \n \nYet you complain when I do the same. I get a laugh too sometimes, Hank, at your expense. When you state something such as \"Survival of the Fittest\" being such a poor phrase that not even Darwin used it, then turn around a month later to defend this phrase as a perfect describer of evolution.\n\n \n I don't complain about that. I'm not that thin skinned so have a go at it. If you somehow think that's funny, I'm not offended.\n \n It's not the best phrase to describe the process. But it's what everybody uses so I just go along with common usage. It gets the point across and when trying to have a discussion, that's what you try to accomplish. It's pretty pathetic when the best you can come up with for criticism is using a word like fittest to argue about. I guess to your so-called mind that somehow disproves evolution. LOL",

   "From a review of Fr Seraphim's book...\n \n \"\n Review of GENESIS, CREATION AND EARLY MAN: THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN VISION. By Fr Seraphim Rose\n Fr Seraphim details those Fathers who wrote on Genesis, and his list includes such luminaries as St John Chrysostom, St Ephraim the Syrian, St Basil the Great, and St Gregory of Nyssa. The author clearly demonstrates that almost invariably we are, according to the Fathers, meant to understand Genesis in a literal way, rather than symbolically, although this did not mean that symbolic interpretations of some points were excluded. Similarly, he establishes that the creative acts of God during the six days of Genesis were understood by the Fathers as being sudden, if not instantaneous?thus there is no room for gradual development, or for any form of evolution in reality. In fact there are only a handful of texts in the writings of the Fathers which can possibly be interpreted in an evolutionary way, and even these are more easy to interpret in the traditional sense.\"\n http://www.theotokos.org.uk/pages/breviews/dfoley/seraphim.html",
