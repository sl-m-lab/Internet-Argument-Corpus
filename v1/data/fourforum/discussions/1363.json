   "Is it time for our society to move beyond being politically correct? Is it at all possible that people don't have to be so sensitive about issues of race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation?\n \n We all know that there are racist, bigots, and general XXXX heads out there. But I think that enough of the people in our society have grown to the point that not only do they tolerate (god I think that is such a hateful word) they accept people for whatever they are without question.\n \n Maybe it's because I'm young (23) and perhaps I'm being a little bit naive. It just seems to me that we as a whole have moved beyond having to tap dance around other people because we are worried about offending them. That maybe just being open and honest with other people can be an acceptable way of communicating reguardless of ones personal opinions.\n \n I bring this up because I saw an article that said somebody actually got offended because computer companies lable hard drives as \"master\" and \"slave\". Not only that but the LA county affermitive action is moving to having all computer parts that show those lables taken down and relabled with something more \"appropriate\". \n \n If I'm wrong and society hasn't advanced to the point where we no longer need to be politically correct then do you think we might someday get there?",

   "First I want to say that I agree with you, tolerate is a horrible word, at least in terms of politics and society. It makes me think of going to a big barbecue and putting up with the bugs. As if social groups that you don't agree with are an annoyance, as if you would prefer everyone did agree....\n \n I can't believe they want to change the names of hardrives.... what's next?\n \n It reminds me of them renaming highway 666. (It runs from Cortez, CO to Gallup, NM. aptly named, for, in the summer months, its hot as hell!)\n What a waste of federal money... all those highway signs... all those poor people with maps that are now wrong. I heard on the radio that some guy petitioned to change the name of his road, which is called F.U. something or another. (probably a reference to the county or something)\n \n But unfortunately, these cases show that there are still people out there who are actually TRYING to be offended.\n \n Political correctness has always annoyed me... Yes, I think that ethnic groups should be called by a name that is not offensive, ( I'm as white as they come, but am still offended when i hear someone use outdated and hateful terms) but past that...\n \n People just go too far... like using person instead of man or woman, as in personhole covers...silliness.\n \n So, yes, I think political correctness has run it's course....fully. But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people who will be offended by anything they can come up with.\n Should we have to change our entire language because of a few... what's the word... oversensitive? people?\n I don't think so... people get so caught up in whatever meanings (either real or imagined) behind a word, and miss the message that those words are trying to get across.",
