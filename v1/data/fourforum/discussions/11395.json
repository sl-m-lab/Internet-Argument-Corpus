Surely you can see that?\n\n \n No it isn't charlie, it is the simple gospel truth, and the key to how one can meet the living God of Creation without trusting any man's word for it. The only way to confidently trust that one has found the truth is to learn it from God Himself. So ask Him directly to reveal Himself to you. If you are sincere and truly hunger for Gods truth, He will find you as promised. \n \n And let me clarify how it worked for me. After praying that same prayer asking God to reveal Himself to me if He existed at all, and telling Him I didn't care who He was as long as I knew the maker of my soul, I started meeting and running into people who told me about Jesus everywhere I went, and At every turn. During my high school years I would be at weekend keg parties with hundreds of friends who liked me and sought to hang with me, and yet I had this distinct feeling of being all alone in those crowds of friends. I felt like my reason for existing was missing and I hungered to have that question answered.\n \n What people can't possibly understand about being born again is that it's a distinct act of acceptance between a person and God. It has nothing to do with anyone else at all. It is between you and God alone. And the result of truly accepting Jesus as your personal savior is receiving the Holy Spirit of God within you. \n \n Rom 8:13 for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\n \n Phl 1:21 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.\n \n Hbr 9:27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this {comes} judgment,\n \n 1Pe 2:24 and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.\n When I became born again, I died to this world and became alive in Christ. I am a stranger in this world now and a foreigner here. My rightful place is in heaven with Him. The beauty of what I'm saying is, don't take my word for anything. Just SINCERELY ask God directly in prayer that if He is real, and if He created you in love, and if He is truly God, then to reveal Himself to you and you will follow him.Seleh...",

Explained here: http://www.carelinks.net/books/dh/cross/1-1-4-1flogging__scourging.htm Here's a diagram of a scourging: http://www.champs-of-truth.com/lessons/Scourging1.jpg Notice the sharp bones and metal balls in the whip end.\n \n Then, all one must do is seek Gods truth by simply reaching out into the spiritual darkness of this World and seeking Him. No hoops to jump through, no praying 5 times a day, no idols to worship or pray to. A person who was stranded on a desert Island all alone with no bible could find salvation just by reaching out to the living God with a sincere heart and a hunger for Gods truth. So I don't know what you're talking about when you imply that we must jump through a correct hoop in order to find him. It seems that is exactly what every man made cult out there requires of men, that they must jump through certain hoops in order to be acceptable.",

Those who reject His free gift of salvation are condemning themselves. God is Holy and perfectly sinless in His nature and character. He can neither sin nor be in its presence. Because He loves humanity, He took life upon Himself and died for our sins so that whoever receives Him shall not perish but will have everlasting life.\n \n Kronus has the skewed logic that believes that if people reject the free gift of salvation that God, through Christ freely offers us, then it is God who must be evil. Not those who rejected a perfect and righteous God. He can't comprehend that if a murderer who's already condemned to death refuses the pardon that the judge offers him, then it isn't the judge who is evil, it is the condemned murderer who is simply receiving the full punishment that he deserved for the murder HE HIMSELF committed and is guilty of. \n \n He is calling the judge evil because the condemned murderer has rejected the pardon that has so freely been offered. Well, that makes no sense at all. If kronus had a true sense of righteousness and holiness, then he would understand that Man is worthy of death since we fall short of Gods Glory, all of us. It is by grace that we are saved through faith in Christ, and not of ourselves, but is a free gift of God.

The question is - what drove them to believe so strongly in those views if those views were wrong? Very few Muslims convert from Islam to Christianity.

I, who had told my girlfriend that I was born a moslem and would proudly die a moslem every time she spoke to me about Jesus, went weak in my knees from the power of the Holy Spirit that flowed through that crowd and me also. The energy was palpable and before the pastor stopped praying, the rain stopped and the Sun shown through. And it didn't rain in Wilkes Barre PA for the rest of that weekend. The presence of Gods Holy Spirit was within me was undeniable and I could no longer deny that everything I was told from the bible about salvation and accepting Jesus as my savior was true indeed.\n \n Now I had to make the choice to give over my personal will to God or to continue to live life for myself. Would I live for an eternal perspective or just for the years I would have in this life? That was my choice, and I understood it. I remembered my prayer at 15 when i reached out and asked the living God to reveal Himself to me and that I would follow Him if He really existed. And now, here I was on august 16, 1975 at 22 years old and I couldn't deny anything I knew to be true. Beside that, I was filled to overflowing with an unconditional love that overwhelmed me with the knowledge that this was Gods Holy Spirit embracing me in a way that I had never experienced before in life. \n \n The joy and peace that permeated every cell of my being was undeniable. this was not my imagination. At 9:30 that night around a camp fire, I received the Lord as my savior in a verbal declaration as I gave my life to Him. I was at that point Born Again, alive to Christ and dead to this World.

I should have known better. Here is the simple truth smiley, see if you can wrap your brain around it. Let's take the Jehovah Witnesses as an accurate example of a true cult for my example, ok? So the JWs go around knocking on doors and use a charitable fund raiser as an excuse to proselytize for new members, and part of that money they raise really does go towards the intended charity. But the recipient group must acknowledge the gift came from them, thereby increasing the JWs public good will, and then you must count the new victims of their false teachings that they made contact with regarding their charitable fundraiser. In other words smiley, evil leads to evil and ultimately serves what is evil if it leads the innocent away from Gods truth in the end. So no lasting or real GOOD will ever come from any charitable work or so called good deeds that cults do. Here's how the bible put it since cults are nothing new and were around even when the church was young.\n \n 2Cr 11:13 \n For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.\n 2Cr 11:14 \n And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.\n 2Cr 11:15 \n Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.\n \nI haven't lied in the least about your beliefs. You would be the first to claim that your god answers your prayers and even that you have a personal relationship with him. Yet you claim that there is a great deceiver out there who is tricking people into worshipping false gods. Unless you have proof that your god is not one of these false gods then you have no case against me.\n\n \n Yes, I have proof smiley. But you wont get it. Jesus said this: Jhn 14:6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. Now consider the Jewish culture at the time. For Jesus to have said that one must go through Him to get to God, He was placing Himself on Gods own level. And to the Jews that was blasphemy if falsely stated. So Jesus would have had to have been a lunatic to say such a thing if it wasn't true, or at the very least, He was a liar. And yet His apostles who were all loyal Jews neither condemned nor abandoned Him for making that statement. That only leaves one other option smiley and that is that Jesus Christ was, and is the Lord. And since He defeated death and resurrected after 3 days in the grave, He proved His Lordship as the Lamb of God.\n \n \nSo you claim that you are indwelled by the Holy Spirit, and I'm sure it feels very real to you, but this great deceiver is no pushover. This is just the sort of stunt he would pull to convince the gullible into believing that theirs is the true god. There are people all over the world who would claim to have the same relationship, but with different gods. Your experience is no more reliable than any one of theirs.\n\n \n I have offered my evidence smiley, now that you're starting to repeat yourself again, it's time for you to prove your claims.

Scoffing, mocking and nay saying on every level as you deny the truth.\n \n \nI would suggest to you that you fall to your knees and sincerely beg Allah for his forgiveness (as you have rejected him). If you are truly sincere in your request I'm sure he will show you the TRUE path. If, however, he does not make himself known to you, then we can only assume that you are not sincere enough in your search for the ONE AND ONLY TRUE GOD.\n Smiley\n\n \n I feel sorry for you smiley. You think you're insulting me, but you're destroying yourself with your self deceptions and lies. And you know what is funny about this? I still care too much about you to return the slam and suggest that you turn to allah. That's because I understand his nature and know that he is in fact satan and it isn't within me to wish that on you.

   "No it wasn't smiley, the implication was that many are deceived by the father of lies on Earth. That doesn't make them fools, it makes them victims of deceit. AGAIN, Here is some of what I said exactly. \n\n Yet still you claim that they have been deceived, so are, presumably, spiritually inferior to you. They have been fooled. They are fools. Wrap it up how you like, you are still claiming that you are brilliant enough to have discerned the TRUE PATH whilst they have been deceived by lies.\n \n \nI'm sorry, I thought the repercussions of serving the enemy of truth was obvious. I should have known better. Here is the simple truth smiley, see if you can wrap your brain around it. Let's take the Jehovah Witnesses as an accurate example of a true cult for my example, ok? So the JWs go around knocking on doors and use a charitable fund raiser as an excuse to proselytize for new members, and part of that money they raise really does go towards the intended charity. But the recipient group must acknowledge the gift came from them, thereby increasing the JWs public good will, and then you must count the new victims of their false teachings that they made contact with regarding their charitable fundraiser. In other words smiley, evil leads to evil and ultimately serves what is evil if it leads the innocent away from Gods truth in the end. So no lasting or real GOOD will ever come from any charitable work or so called good deeds that cults do. Here's how the bible put it since cults are nothing new and were around even when the church was young.\n \n 2Cr 11:13 \n For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.\n 2Cr 11:14 \n And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.\n 2Cr 11:15 \n Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.\n\n So, you pick on one example that you twist into an 'evil' and extrapolate this into 'all who do not worship my god are servants of satan'. Are you claiming that no good deeds are done by those of other religions, or that even if they think they are doing good that their good deeds don't really count because they are done in the name of someone other than your chosen deity? How twistedly arrogant can you get?\n \n \nYes, I have proof smiley. But you wont get it. Jesus said this: Jhn 14:6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. Now consider the Jewish culture at the time. For Jesus to have said that one must go through Him to get to God, He was placing Himself on Gods own level. And to the Jews that was blasphemy if falsely stated. So Jesus would have had to have been a lunatic to say such a thing if it wasn't true, or at the very least, He was a liar. And yet His apostles who were all loyal Jews neither condemned nor abandoned Him for making that statement. That only leaves one other option smiley and that is that Jesus Christ was, and is the Lord. And since He defeated death and resurrected after 3 days in the grave, He proved His Lordship as the Lamb of God.\n\n Yet again you choose the words of this man-written tome as 'proof'. It is at best hearsay, nothing more.\n \n \nI have offered my evidence smiley, now that you're starting to repeat yourself again, it's time for you to prove your claims. Talks cheap and that is all you have. Scoffing, mocking and nay saying on every level as you deny the truth.\n\n And your lack of evidence is merely repeating itself. 'Talk' is all you have. I have nothing to prove, I merely feel that you should consider others to be on the same level as yourself rather than dismissing them as spiritual fools who can be deceived by some fallen angel, whilst you are spiritually superior and able to discern the TRUE PATH where others have failed.\n \n \nI feel sorry for you smiley. You think you're insulting me, but you're destroying yourself with your self deceptions and lies. And you know what is funny about this? I still care too much about you to return the slam and suggest that you turn to allah. That's because I understand his nature and know that he is in fact satan and it isn't within me to wish that on you. I realize you aren't limited by any such compunctions based on your reprobate value system though. That is why I pity you.\n\n Obviously you just can't see that the beliefs of others are equal to your own. You belittle everyone who thinks differently. Allah is just another god from the long list that is out there (yours amongst them). If there is a great deceiver out there you are just as likely to have been deceived as anyone else as your mind is completely closed. You are the one to be pitied as you are blinkered to simple concepts such as all people being equal. You are just an arrogant fool who is too proud to even consider the fact.\n \n Smiley",

   "You are certainly correct. I've always felt that the fewer assumptions you make at the start, the more likely you are to reach the truth in the end.\n\n Unfortunately, most religions explicitly try to prohibit thinking that is fully free of assumptions. So, being fully devout while trying to make a genuine fully open-minded search for truth often is contradictory. Most people who are devout will not fully allow themselves to question the existence of God or many of the most dearly held tenets of their faith, since that would be a betrayal of their faith.\n \n As for those that are undecided on a religion and are searching, there do seem to be a lot of assumptions that are culturally inbred about what a religion would be composed of - including the assumptions of a benevolent God, and the assumption that God plays some positive role in human events - either on a personal or global scale. I think that some of those assumptions about God come from the personal needs that people have about God that leads them to that search to begin with. \n \n Discarding an assumption, particularly one that you've made good use of, can be really hard. But you are quite correct that if one assumes God exists, one almost has to assume that he's more or less benevolent. The alternative simply can't be dealt with. I admit, that's why I tend towards the \"no true religion\" option. \n\n I tend to believe the same. I'm not sure whether or not God exists, but if he does, then I assume he would be benevolent and that we would be judged by our efforts, thoughts and actions in this world, not by how loyal we are to a particular version of faith.\n \nAnd as for people going with assumptions that give them a sense of superiority, check out Archie below, where he claims to have the inside scoop on higher reality! It's pitfalls like that that push me towards only making trully necessary assumptions when discussing God. In the end, I'm perfectly happy admiting that the correct answer is \"I don't know\"\n\n Archie had a personal experience which he sincerely interprets as a message and direction from God. If he were to admit that people of other religions could have similar experiences or that such experiences could be created purely by his imagination, then that would diminish his own strongly held personal experience. That is something that he is not ready to do. So, the only way that he can hold his experience as special is to belittle the experiences of others. I can understand why he does this, but it does make it much more difficult to hold a genuine open discussion with him since it does make him much more close minded.",

But that isn't my determiner of right and wrong at all. I siphon everything through the colander of Gods moral code as laid out in His Holy Word.

   "Why do you keep insisting that I am claiming some imaginary superiority over victims of religious deceptions who have been led into false cults smiley? These are your words and your warped perspective only, so please stop attributing it to me as a belief at all. It is only you who is inferring that they are somehow fools or inferior to me for ever believing the lies of the devil, and following these false religions.\n\n I insist on claiming your imaginary superiority (which it is), because it is ingrained in every post you make. The 'look at all those people who have been fooled by satan, whereas I sit here with my personal relationship with the one and only true god and laud it over all who dare to disagree with me' attitude you have says it all.\n \n \nThe JW example was just one random example that could have been applied to any of the hundreds of false religions/cults in the world today to make the same point that any alleged good deed that leads people away from God isn't a good deed at all, but is another deception designed to lead good people astray using a seemingly innocuous good deed as the lure, if you will. Sorry if that prospect offends you smiley, but the day will come when you will surely understand that I'm right and that what appeared to be good in life wasn't good at all. I find it so sad that this truth is beyond you.\n\n Yet again! You single out your beliefs as being the only ones that can lead to good deeds. You belittle everyone who does not share your beliefs and all the good deeds they perform. This is the height of arrogance, yet you fail to see that. I guess that's what blind faith is all about. You are to be pitied.\n \n \nI used the word of God which was written BY GOD, THROUGH MEN smiley. And I used it to show that Paul also dealt with and realized that false teachers and perversions of Christianity existed in his time also, see?\n 2Cr 11:13 \n For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.\n 2Cr 11:14 \n And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.\n 2Cr 11:15 \n Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.And also that they taught lies that led people away from Christ who is the only conduit between God and Man.Jhn 14:6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\n\n Yet again a baseless belief, not even close to fact. Your bible's words cannot stand up as proof. They are opinion, pure and simple, and their continuous repetition will not make them any more reliable.\n \n \nTalk is all any of us have on a debate forum smiley. I thought you understood that by now. But tell us, what have you offered at all that has been more powerful than what I have offered? Especially since nothing I offer is of my own creation but is the traditional teachings that are consistent with the long established biblical truths that every true believer, along with the founders of the faith have believed since the birth of christianity? While everything you have contributed is nothing more than bitter ramblings of an angry atheist who is in denial of Gods truth. So by what authority do you dare to question the quality of my evidence?\n\n I have offered an open mind, which is far more powerful than your innane ramblings. You are completely blinkered to the truths that can be found in any religion because your pride and arrogance do not allow you to look outside your own comfort zone.\n \n \nWrong! It isn't about anyones beliefs being equal to mine at all. It's about them being based in truth according to Gods definition of what truth is. remember smiley, that according to your moral center, the only colander that you siphon information through before determining if it's right or wrong is if it meets with your moral comfort zones. But that isn't my determiner of right and wrong at all. I siphon everything through the colander of Gods moral code as laid out in His Holy Word. So only one of us is the final arbiter of right and wrong smiley, and that is you.\n\n True, my moral centre is based fairly and squarely within my being. That means I take responsibility for my actions. My ethics are based on my experience and I have to live with each and every one of them. However, your moral centre is exactly the same. You just dress it up as the will of some fictional god in order to portray it as something superior, which brings us squarely back to your blatant arrogance.\n \n \nThis remains to be seen smiley, but I honor your right to believe anything you like about me. But just consider this for a minute if you will. If my mind is so closed, then how did a moslem kid from a well off family, end up meeting the most radical figure in history causing me to change my religion and refocus my life in a completely different direction than it was headed? Wouldn't a closed minded person be sure never to go outside the boundaries of my life long comfort zones? And I promise you this too smiley, the truth I speak will pass the test of time. In fact I can boldly proclaim that it is the eternal truth. emoticon_xangel\n\n I have no idea why you would change your religion so completely. If I had to make a guess, based on the evidence of your character on this forum, I would say that you chose the most prominent religion of your nation (USA - Christianity) so you could laud it over as many people as possible. You may have convinced yourself that you are following some higher moral code, but believe me it is far more likely that you are following a path that is based purely on what you can get out of it. You have shown over and over again that your values are far from that preached by your supposed saviour.\n \n And yu can make all the promises you like about the eternal truth you speak, I simply do not believe you. You have lied too many times on this forum to be taken seriously. In fact, your lies and deceipt would suggest that you are a star pupil of this father of lies you keep claiming has fooled everyone who thinks differently to you. I won't be fooled by your lies. You are far too transparent for that. Maybe you should ask for extra lessons from your true master.\n \n Smiley",

   "This would mean that God is simply a passive spectator that watches over us and allows everything to happen without initiating or intervening in events. In fact, this could go all the way back to the idea that God just wound up the universe, caused the big bang, then sat back with his cosmic bowl of popcorn and watched the show. If God isn't inclined to meddle in the affairs while we are alive, then what would indicate that he steps into the picture after we die?\n\n To start off with as background, I must first say that this is all speculation on my part since I myself am not a true believer but someone who wavers between agnosticism and some version of Christianity. That being said, I will continue my speculation...\n \n I can imagine that, if God exists and is an engaged God, then the engagement is very selective. I don't think that God would have to be fully engaged in all human activity to justify his playing a role in a hypothetical afterlife. Even if he is completely disengaged from human activity but still has the power to offer a paradise in Heaven, then one option is that he simply judges people for entrance into Heaven based on their performance in the totally human controlled world.

   "Or perhaps even not judged at all? The whole eternal suffering thing sounds pretty far fetched to me; how many people in the history of humanity have actually committed enough evil to deserve that? If we start with the assumption of a benevolent God, then I find the existence of a place like hell to be very unlikely.\n\n I remember once reading about an early version of Christianity whose belief in the afterlife was that we continue to learn and grow and change. I prefer that much better to the current range of Christian traditions that seem to say that our entire eternity is determined by how we act during our short lives. That seems to leave no room for further growth and development. It makes no sense to me that, if our souls and consciousness continues after life, that we should not continue to grow and change. Presumably, we will continue to have new experiences - at least experiences of interactions with other souls at least, if nothing else. Experience leads to growth and change. Even if someone as evil as Hitler changed through experience into a saintly individual in a hypothetical afterlife, then I think that his \"case\" would have to be reviewed - and given a cosmic parole. So, I also think that the idea of eternal hell is ludicrous. Personally, I think people who believe in eternal hell use it as a sort of cosmic vengeance against those who do not suffer just retribution during their lives.",

   "You hit the nail right on the head Ao, but that is the last thing you want to happen in reality. The last thing you want Ao, is to be judged by a perfect and holy God for your efforts to stand up to His moral perfection. That is the whole crux and purpose of the gospel of Christ. The bible clearly say's:Rom 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n Rom 3:24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;\n Rom 3:25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. {This was} to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;\n Rom 3:26 for the demonstration, {I say,} of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\n So Jesus died for our sins so that we wont be judged for our sins by God. He literally took our sins upon Himself on the Cross which justifies us so we can be received by a holy and perfect God.\n Eph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God;\n The only real choice anyone has Ao, is to stand before God on our own merits one day as unredeemed sinners, or under the covering of the blood that Jesus shed for us on Calvary's Cross 2000 years ago. That is it. Salvation is a free gift no matter what people say. All one must do is receive from God that which we can't do for ourselves.\n\n But all this assumes that God is such a perfectionist that only perfection will do, and all imperfect beings suffer torment. I have more trust in the potential benevolence of God to ever think him so cruel. I think of God more as a divine parent - one that judges and punishes when necessary, but really has our best interest at heart and realizes that we will never reach perfection - just pursue it as best as we can.",

That isn't it at all. The reality is that God is holy and according to His value system, He can't be in the presence of sin. That is why He had to figure a way to redeem fallen man to reunite us to Him as He originally intended when He created us for fellowship in the beginning before we inherited the sinful nature through Adam and Eve who fell from grace by disobeying God.\n \n \n I have more trust in the potential benevolence of God to ever think him so cruel. I think of God more as a divine parent - one that judges and punishes when necessary, but really has our best interest at heart and realizes that we will never reach perfection - just pursue it as best as we can.\n\n \n Again Ao, you have hit the nail right on the head regarding how our Heavenly Father views us and our fallen nature. That is why He did all of the work necessary to redeem us from eternal separation from Him. Because He knew that there was nothing we could do ourselves to cross the chasm between our sin and His holiness to save ourselves, or make us worthy of being in His presence. \n \n All you have to realize now is that what jesus did on the Cross was not offered as a threat to us, but was an act of unconditional love by a Holy God who became flesh and died for us as He took the sins of the World upon Himself. That isn't a bad thing, but is a sacrifice of love. It means that as Jesus died on the Cross He took upon Himself every sin that every human being would ever commit. The price has been paid for all of our sins whether we accept Him or not. but in order to receive the free gift of salvation, we must individually accept it through Christ who died for us. See what I mean? \n \n It's a free gift we can never earn on our own, and must only be accepted to be received. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one. Here's how the bible describes the act of Jesus sacrificing Himself for the sins of Man.\n \n Rom 5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n Rom 5:9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath {of God} through Him.\n Rom 5:10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\n Rom 5:11 And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.\n Rom 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--\n Rom 5:13 for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\n Rom 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\n Rom 5:15 But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.",

   "To start off with as background, I must first say that this is all speculation on my part since I myself am not a true believer but someone who wavers between agnosticism and some version of Christianity. That being said, I will continue my speculation...\n \n I can imagine that, if God exists and is an engaged God, then the engagement is very selective. I don't think that God would have to be fully engaged in all human activity to justify his playing a role in a hypothetical afterlife. Even if he is completely disengaged from human activity but still has the power to offer a paradise in Heaven, then one option is that he simply judges people for entrance into Heaven based on their performance in the totally human controlled world. Why do you think that would be a contradiction?\n\n Not a contradiction, just a terrible inconsistency. What we know about afterlife rewards, particularly heaven which we are referring to, comes primarily from the bible. What also comes from the bible are the claims, popularly referred to as promises, that detail the conditions for God's intervention, blessings and punishment. If we rely on the bible for information on what God's plans and actions are for the afterlife, then we are assuming that the authors knew what they were talking about in terms of how God operates. But if God really only passively spectates from his cosmic vantage point and doesn't actually interact with humans, then the bible authors were horribly clueless. So I have a hard time with the idea that they knew what they were talking about concerning the afterlife. And if not the bible as a source for what's in store for the afterlife, then where? What other source positions itself as an authority on God's doings, yet is consistent with the view of a passive spectator God during conscious life?",

   "I was trying to find something that could truly be called a belief (instead of a like/dislike a la taste). Perhaps I reached too far.\n \n \n Then I hope somebody can explain what beliefs are \"susceptible\" to faith and what beliefs are not. Furthermore, I'm finding it hard to believe (har har) that one chooses to have faith. A person has faith or doesn't. I left the stove on, or I didn't, and I think/believe that I didn't; I don't have no belief yet have faith that I didn't. As much as I want to believe that I didn't forget to turn it off because I don't want to return to the charred remains of my former residence, my wishful thinking has no effect on what I believe.\n\n In this case your wishful thinking IS your belief. You hope that you remembered to turn the stove off, and this is the belief you hold and act on. \n \n Faith is simply believing in something you cannot prove. If I tell you I'll respond to your post, there is absolutely no way you can prove I'll do it. For that matter, not even I can prove that I'll do it. Until I do, either of us can choose to put faith in the statement that I said I would reply. And for what its worth, not all faith-based beliefs impact our lives in major ways. We exercise faith all the time, without really giving much tought about it. We have faith in the tv guide, the weather report, the sales flier and ebay. \n \n To me, everything we believe have an evidence and faith component. The more evidence we have to support the thing we believe in, the less faith is required. We have things that are 100% evidence based, and some that are 100% faith based, and many things that are a blend of both. Also, we are compelled to support or faith based beliefs with evidence, I think its one of our strong psychological motivators. We are apparently not naturally comfortable with believing things on faith alone, as it creates a very unstable foundation on which to create our model of reality.",

   "Perhaps I could clarify:\n \n AA, do you believe it's possible that you are in truth one of the deceived?\n \n Assuming the answer is 'no', you have effectively asserted that your judgement in spiritual matters is flawless. That inference is inescapable. Thus you elevate yourself above all those whom you insist have been deceived.\n \n Hi Peeling,\n a couple of points need to be made right off the bat here. First of all, I marvel at how you all approach my arguments here as if I'm speaking only for Archangel as an individual who is raising his own spiritual enlightenment above every other belief system on Earth. That assumption is not only ridiculous but patently false. I am not alone here. I'm not even sharing my own thought up beliefs here but am sharing the wisdom of the bible. If you find that offensive, it isn't fair to hold me responsible for sharing those truths.\n \n \nLet me be clear about this: whether or not you are in fact right is not relevant to this issue. If you think it is, you're missing the point. The question is not whether or not you have been deceived, it is whether or not your judgement that you have not been deceived could be in error. Do you appreciate the difference?\n\n \n Yes, you're questioning my sanity. You're suggesting that I could have been deceived in my belief in Yahweh, yet I'm so stupid, I'm unaware that He doesn't really exist, right? And I must assume that you're also referring to the other billion or so born again believers on Earth that are alive today also, right? We're all crazy, right? \n \n \nImagine I have some terrible disease, but don't yet know. Now imagine I take a test, which comes up positive. Do I now know I have the disease?\n \n The correct answer is: it depends how accurate the test is. Only if the test is 100% accurate do I know I have the disease. The underlying fact of my illness is irrelevant to my confidence level.\n \n Your problem is, you have no idea how accurate your spiritual litmus test is. You don't have the first clue. Satan could be so astoundingly clever and experienced that you were trivially easy for him to fool. You can't know that's not the case. You have no benchmark against which to compare the supposedly divine epiphany you experienced. The fact it was better with Jesus than it was with Allah means nothing - that's one of the oldest con-tricks in the book.\n\n \n If I'm in fact crazy, you might have a valid point Peeling. But I'm not crazy, just as the other believers who understand the gospel just as I do aren't crazy at all. And God is more powerful than satan. By your way of thinking satan is so powerful he can fool and deceive believers in the living God. So only if the bible was false and the living God of Israel was a nonexistent God would your argument have any legs at all. What you're doing is a good example of circular reasoning.\n \n \nAgain, I emphasise that I'm not saying your wrong. You being right or wrong is not relevant. The question here is how certain you are that you have not been deceived, and what that says about how you see yourself (ie perfect) compared to others (ie flawed and fallible).\n \n Please don't be tempted to twist this around and say it's your god that is perfect, not you. You claim to personally have a perfect ability to recognise genuine divinity, something others plainly do not have.\n\n \n I claim nothing that every other believer in Christ doesn't also claim to have Peeling. We all have the unquestioning undeniable knowledge and belief that we know what we know. Why do you think that the first century christians who were taken to the colosseum to be killed in the games by Lions because they refused to deny Christ and pledge allegiance to the Emperor, refused to deny Christ to save their lives? Would they do that by the thousands if they didn't really know what they knew to be true? \n \n I know right from wrong, good from evil, and I'm able to discern the truth from the lie. Something I was unable to do before possessing Gods Holy Spirit within me. You can rationalize from here till the second tuesday of next week and my assurance and confidence in what I know regarding the living God of Israel in comparison to all of the other false gods/belief systems out there wont change at all.",

I myself don't hold the Bible as the whole truth. It has some stories in it that teach wisdom and compassion and others that teach vengeance and intolerance. I certainly do not believe the great majority of the theological aspects - as in the Creation, Noahs arc, etc. Even when it came to Jesus and his sacrifice, it never made sense to me why that sacrifice was necessary if God is assumed to be benevolent and omnipotent. I believe Jesus existed and was wise, good and heroic, but am completely uncertain whether he was purely human or divine and there is no independent evidence to proove things one way or the other.\n \n Since we don't have any solid evidence about whether or not there even is an afterlife, or whether or not there even is a supernatural, most of our views are sheer speculation and leaps of faith. It is much more comfortable and reassuring to take leaps of faith into the same directions as others we know, which explains much of organized religions, but that does not make those leaps of faith true. I make occasional religious leaps of faith but know full well that I cannot have any real confidence in those leaps without any evidence.\n \n All this says that we simply do not know about the afterlife. However, if we do assume the existence of an afterlife and do asssume some benevolence to the supernatural, then there should logically be some trends that we could speculate about. The speculations I have mentioned are simply attempts at trying to explore the range of potential involvement of God, assuming that there is a God and he/she/it is benevolent.",

Would they do that by the thousands if they didn't really know what they knew to be true? \n \n I know right from wrong, good from evil, and I'm able to discern the truth from the lie. Something I was unable to do before possessing Gods Holy Spirit within me. You can rationalize from here till the second tuesday of next week and my assurance and confidence in what I know regarding the living God of Israel in comparison to all of the other false gods/belief systems out there wont change at all.\n\n Archangel, EVERY devout\n believer of EVERY other religion believes exactly the same thing: that they know what they know is right. Why do you think muslim extremists are willing to strap dynamite to their bellies in obedience to the message of Allah? Why do you think hindus would maintain vegetarianism for thousands of years, of jehovah witnesses would keep coming back to your door, or rastafarians would grow long dreadlocks, or any other religious follower would adopt an identity that would result in ridicule or even death if they didn't think that they know what they know is right? And by your reasoning, it means that if any of us actually happen to right about our religious belief, then everybody else must be crazy",

   "\n Since we don't have any solid evidence about whether or not there even is an afterlife, or whether or not there even is a supernatural, most of our views are sheer speculation and leaps of faith. It is much more comfortable and reassuring to take leaps of faith into the same directions as others we know, which explains much of organized religions, but that does not make those leaps of faith true. I make occasional religious leaps of faith but know full well that I cannot have any real confidence in those leaps without any evidence.\n \n All this says that we simply do not know about the afterlife. However, if we do assume the existence of an afterlife and do asssume some benevolence to the supernatural, then there should logically be some trends that we could speculate about. The speculations I have mentioned are simply attempts at trying to explore the range of potential involvement of God, assuming that there is a God and he/she/it is benevolent.\n\n Some time back there was another discussion about the origin of religion as a product of human evoution. Besides creating a supernatural cause to explain phenomena that they didn't understand at the time (volcanic eruptuons, eclipses, etc), more detrimental to human survival was a way to escape emotional hardship, grief and other forms of psychological pain. Avoiding pain is our chief survival mechanism. So it would make sense to find a way to console oneself when bad things happen that we can do nothing about, such as natural disasters or death. It puts us in a much better frame of mind to believe that our dead friends and relatives are in a place of peace and happiness, or that disasters happen because evil people bring judgement upon themselves. It makes these negative events much more palatable, but more importantly it allows us to move out of what could be debilitationg bouts of depression and let us get on with being productive. The alternative could result in serious depression-related sicknesses and even death. So people who had the hope of death leading to a happy afterlife would by some measure live better than those without such a hope. Religion would therefore become an important survival tactic. And in many cases it still is today.",

What specifically was accomplished by that sacrifice? This is something that never made sense to me through all the years of Roman Catholicism I grew up with, and nobody has presented a clear picture since.\n\n Sin is a spiritual problem in its purest form. It doesn't affect anything in our lives except what we percieve to be our spiritual beings. And even at that it only applies to those who believe in the doctrine of the bible. Sin is defined exclusively in the bible as disobedience of biblical commandments. It doesn't apply to any other religious following. \n \n As a spiritual problem, sin can only be corrected by a spiritual solution. And since sin is exclusively defined by holy men inspired by God, then it logically follows that these men would be the ones to define the only solution. \n \n So this is how it works. Sin is the only problem God has with man. However its a major problem. Sin is punishable by death. It was first decreed when Adam was made and was first executed when Adam sinned. From then on, sin has plagued Adam's family and all his descendents, which is everybody on the entire planet. This is why everybody dies. Apparently, sin is in our nature; all humans sin at some point. We could argue that we are predestined to sin, that we're born that way. Regardless, sin is the reason we die. The fact that everybody dies is evidence that everybody has this sinful nature and get what they deserve. Its a little trickier explaining why babies and children under the age of accountability also die, but the explanation is that the sins of the parents are transferrable to the children to some extent. Some how this argument also makes sense if its the baby of christian parents. But that's another discussion altogether. \n \n Anyway, since the wages of sin is death, then in order to spare yourself from dying (or perhaps being put to death by zealous law enforcers), you needed to provide some other kind of sacrifice. Ideally this would be your prized animal or, if you didn't own animals, somebody else's prized animal that you bought. Basically at least once a year this sacrifice was required to remove the sins commited that year. The problem was that the ongoing ritual of animal sacrifice was costly and not effective for long-term forgiveness. \n \n That's why Jesus had to enter the scene. Up to the time of his death he was without sin, which meant that he was exempt form the death penalty of sin. In fact, he was the only human that didn't deserve the penalty of death due to this provision (except of course christian babies and toddlers), so taking on the death penalty without deserving it would make him the most suitable human sacrifice on behalf of other human sacrifices that DID deserve death. (We could also argue that since Jesus was God's direct offspring and therefore not a direct descendent of Adam, he was not born with the sinful nature that natural humans inherit, so he had an unfair advantage with his natural immunity to temptations. But anyway, the holy men that wrote the bible judged him as qualified for the job of being the ultimate sacrifice and solution for sin. You really can't argue with that. \n \n In a way, it all makes sense, and if you accept the bible as true then this all falls into palce nicely.",

   "These are your beliefs because you believe that the bible is absolutely true. You describe what the bible says as \"facts\" and \"ultimate truth\". \n\n \n I do and I stand by that belief.\n \n \nBecause of this belief, you allow the bible to be right from your veiwpoint, regardless of what it says, regardless of whether it conflicts with our internal moral code, regardless of whether is clashes with evidence or reasoning, and regardles of whether it contradicts the very bible itself.\n \n \n You see paulie, that is what proves that you can't fathom giving up your will to God which defines the born again experience. Who are you to consider your internal moral code more correct than His? Don't you watch the daily News? How can you even suggest that this world possesses an internal moral code? And the bible doesn't contradict itself. It's perfectly consistent if you understand it in proper context.\n \n \nYou claim that since the ends justifies the means, then converting others to the biblical doctrine is indeed more important that act of doing good deeds.\n \n \n Actually, it is your way of thinking that endorsed that scenario. I clearly said that according to God, the ends don't justify the means. And I quote:\n \nthis is a higher law than anything I could represent on my own. And why do you find it disturbing that the ends don't justify the means according to Gods laws? If a person does a good deed with the intent of deceiving the recipient in the end, how do you see that as a good thing, and standing against it as a disturbing thing?\n\n \n \nYet the means (killing, persecution, segregation, etc) violates what is in the bible. Spreading the doctrine of the bible trumps following the philosophy of the bible. That's why I find it disturbing. How do you reconcile this contradiction? How can you justify what even the bible refers to as evil deeds being good if it is in an attempt to spread the gospel?\n\n \n It's impossible to defend against this totally skewed interpretation of what Gods character is paulie. I have tried before and it's just a waste of time. You don't understand the truth of what God represents so you corrupt His character in your recollection of what His word say's.\n \n \nI don't condemn you for what the bible says, but I have a problem with you making excuses for people commiting henious acts in the name of spreading the very religion that preaches against commiting such acts.\n \n \n Please quote my statements that have done the bolded at all paulie. I would like to see them and defend against them one by one.\n \n \nI also have a problem with you putting what the bible says above questioning and examination. I cannot accept a source that contradicts itself as a source of absolute truth. And I certainly disagree with the notion that the ends justifies the means.\n \n \n Again, regarding the bolded: Why do you assume that I believe like some robot who has never questioned or examined any of my beliefs? I'm not some automaton which has been programmed or has surrendered my common sense or free will in any way. I have posted the actual scriptural reference that supports what I'm saying and you can go back and read it in proper context to get the flow of it. But not one of you has recopied the passage in order to refer to it or to break it down at all. You just judge me and the bible while condemning me for judging false religions for what they are defined as according to Gods word.\n \n \nyou claim that false religions (all non-christian religions) intend evil. It doesn't matter if the average follower of these other religion practices more charity than the average christian, because you believe that their doctrine is deceptive and that their religious beliefs will send them to hell. In other words, the outward actions are nothing (apostle Paul refers to this as dung) because the religion it derives from is non-christian. So it doesn't matter what your deeds are, your belief in Jesus is the only thing that will get you into heaven. \n \n Yes, this is disturbing.\n\n \n First of all, until you prove that the average follower of these false religions actually do more charitable work than christians do, then that statement is just more unfounded lip service and unproven assumptions. But regarding the bolded, as I have explained numerous times on this thread alone, because of our fallen natures, it doesn't matter how much good we do apart from Christ, it's all for nothing if we aren't covered by His shed blood which was sacrificed as propitiation for our sins. You are blind to that reality. So you are absolutely right when you say that it doesn't matter how much good one does, it's only ones belief in Christ that will get us to heaven.\n \n You speak about me as if I'm elevating myself above unbelievers when I too was no different than those I say are followers of false religions. So no matter how much this bothers you paulie, it isn't me who thought it up or has made it the spiritual law that we must live by whether we like it or not. You're free to deny these truths all you want to, but that wont change or nullify them as spiritual truths in any way.",

For example, the secular world view tells us that we die or when our loved ones die, there is only nothingness - so we will never again be with our deceased loved ones or even be able to imagine them happy elsewhere, and our lives are only restricted to our physical lives - no second chances or continued existence. When people committ evil acts and get away with it, the secular world view tells us that their victims will NEVER receive retribution. These and other examples show, to me, that religious belief will be with us for a very long time, no matter how much evidence is presented by the secular world. As long as there is so hope to grasp onto with a leap of faith, people will take that leap of faith.",

First is the idea that sin can be transferred - either from the parents to children or from general sinners to Jesus. If you did something wrong, you cannot transfer those wrong actions to someone who didn't - it just doesn't make sense to me.\n \n Also, I can understand that traditionally people would sacrifice an animal to atone for sins. I would see it as a form of self-punishment (depriving oneself of something very useful - in their case, a useful animal). In that sense, the sacrifice of Jesus would really only be a sacrifice for the population if the continued wordly existence of Jesus would have been something greatly desired and, thus, a sacrifice to the people who sinned. At the time, there were only a handful of followers who would have appreciated his continued existence, so they were the only ones (besides Jesus himself) that suffered due to his loss. The others couldn't care less. Those of us who live after his death also would not have benefited from his continued life, except, possibly if he had had a chance to pass on more wisdom that was curtailed by his early death. So, I don't see too much what we sacrificed by having Jesus die. The bottom line is that it is the sacrifice of the people that is most important in educating them, not of the sacrificial lamb themselves. \n \n Lastly, if we assume that God is omnipotent and benevolent, I do not see how sin should translate to the requirement of death - that is such an extreme overreaction and suggests a God that is far too harsh to ever be considered benevolent.",

   "Hi Peeling,\n a couple of points need to be made right off the bat here. First of all, I marvel at how you all approach my arguments here as if I'm speaking only for Archangel as an individual who is raising his own spiritual enlightenment above every other belief system on Earth. That assumption is not only ridiculous but patently false. I am not alone here. I'm not even sharing my own thought up beliefs here but am sharing the wisdom of the bible. If you find that offensive, it isn't fair to hold me responsible for sharing those truths.\n\n You're sharing your interpretation of the bible. There are others. You believe yours is correct and others are wrong. Beyond the bible there are a multitude of other religions, all of them according to you pursued by the sadly deluded - which leads us right back to the point at issue: you believe it is impossible that you have been deceived into following a false religion.\n \n Perhaps another analogy would help. Imagine I tell you that if we were to sit down together for a game of chess, I would unquestionably beat you. Since I have no knowledge of your chess-playing ability, I would effectively be claiming that I am perfect at playing chess. Such would be the only position from which I could make that assertion. If I were less than perfect - if I were actually pretty bad at it, which is lamentably the case - then my statement might well be erroneous.\n \n If we entertain for the sake of argument the notion that there is a Great Deceiver, you effectively sit opposite him, and you are stating that it is impossible that he has beaten you; that you have been successfully deceived. Just as in the analogy, such a statement can only be correct if you are perfect.\n \nYes, you're questioning my sanity. You're suggesting that I could have been deceived in my belief in Yahweh, yet I'm so stupid, I'm unaware that He doesn't really exist, right? And I must assume that you're also referring to the other billion or so born again believers on Earth that are alive today also, right? We're all crazy, right?\n\n Dear me no, I'm not saying anything of the sort.\n \n Your choice of term to describe someone who believes in a false god is 'crazy'. You want me to find the idea of a billion people being 'crazy' absurd. Yet you confidently and repeatedly assert that billions of people do follow false gods, and are thus by your judgement 'crazy'.\n \n I don't think you need to be 'crazy' to follow a false god. So the problem of billions of crazy people is yours, not mine.\n \n \nIf I'm in fact crazy, you might have a valid point Peeling. But I'm not crazy, just as the other believers who understand the gospel just as I do aren't crazy at all. And God is more powerful than satan. By your way of thinking satan is so powerful he can fool and deceive believers in the living God.\n\n Incorrect. If yours is the living god, then you aren't being deceived and thus satan is not more powerful. If yours isn't the living god, then satan hasn't deceived believers in the living god - so he's still not more powerful. You're still trying to turn this into an argument about god - it isn't. It's an argument about your belief that you are perfect.\n \nonly if the bible was false and the living God of Israel was a nonexistent God would your argument have any legs at all. What you're doing is a good example of circular reasoning.\n\n Precisely! That's exactly the point. For every circular line of reasoning like yours, there is a parallel, inverse one that is equally valid. \"If A, then A\" permits the retort \"If !A, then !A\". \n \nI claim nothing that every other believer in Christ doesn't also claim to have Peeling. We all have the unquestioning undeniable knowledge and belief that we know what we know. Why do you think that the first century christians who were taken to the colosseum to be killed in the games by Lions because they refused to deny Christ and pledge allegiance to the Emperor, refused to deny Christ to save their lives? Would they do that by the thousands if they didn't really know what they knew to be true?\n\n Variations on the same story could be told of any number of religions. But look at what you're doing: you're abandoning the 'bible is true because it says it is' argument and appealing to other evidences, like the fervour and commitment of a religion's followers.\n \nI know right from wrong, good from evil, and I'm able to discern the truth from the lie. Something I was unable to do before possessing Gods Holy Spirit within me. You can rationalize from here till the second tuesday of next week and my assurance and confidence in what I know regarding the living God of Israel in comparison to all of the other false gods/belief systems out there wont change at all.\n\n I don't expect it to. That isn't the purpose of this discussion. I'm just here to get you to say 'I'm infallible' in as many different ways as possible and see what happens when you realise what you're doing :)",

   "I do and I stand by that belief.\n \n \n You see paulie, that is what proves that you can't fathom giving up your will to God which defines the born again experience. Who are you to consider your internal moral code more correct than His? Don't you watch the daily News? How can you even suggest that this world possesses an internal moral code? And the bible doesn't contradict itself. It's perfectly consistent if you understand it in proper context.\n \n \n Actually, it is your way of thinking that endorsed that scenario. I clearly said that according to God, the ends don't justify the means. And I quote:\n \n \n It's impossible to defend against this totally skewed interpretation of what Gods character is paulie. I have tried before and it's just a waste of time. You don't understand the truth of what God represents so you corrupt His character in your recollection of what His word say's.\n \n \n Please quote my statements that have done the bolded at all paulie. I would like to see them and defend against them one by one.\n \n \n Again, regarding the bolded: Why do you assume that I believe like some robot who has never questioned or examined any of my beliefs? I'm not some automaton which has been programmed or has surrendered my common sense or free will in any way. I have posted the actual scriptural reference that supports what I'm saying and you can go back and read it in proper context to get the flow of it. But not one of you has recopied the passage in order to refer to it or to break it down at all. You just judge me and the bible while condemning me for judging false religions for what they are defined as according to Gods word.\n \n\n You are the one that declared that you belief that the bible is absolute truth and 100% fact. And you stand by that belief. Therefore, anything that the bible says trumps anyt\n hing else from any external source. \n \n You also said, and repeated here, that what we might consider good deeds, if derived from non-christian religions, are acts of deception and therefore evil deeds. Yet what we might consider evil deeds, if they are in accordance with the bible, are designed to further the kingdom of God and are therefore good deeds. \n \n Because of the above, what may be morally ok to us may be not ok in God's sight, and vice versa. In other words, we cannot rely on our own moral code because either we may be unaware of an underlying deception involved, or unaware of a greater kingdom-development plan that God has in store. \n \n Also, because you are of the belief that you are 100% right about what good and evil really is, and because your honed spiritual perception allows you to identify hidden agendas of deception or godliness which we the ungodly cannot, you have a superior moral map to everyone else. \n \n The things is, contrary to what you might think, I don't see you as conceited or haughty because of this. It might sound like I'm ridiculing your faith, but I'm actually quite empathetic to your position. Up until the age of 28 I was a christian just like you, with the same opinions about God and the same beliefs about the bible that you have. This is why I can describe christian doctrine and analyse scripture with such detail. \n \n Where we differ is at paragraph 1, which is the foundation of the other beliefs about morality I described. In my case, I questioned the bible. I allowed myself to entertain the possibility that the bible was not absute truth. The rest is history. \n \n \nFirst of all, until you prove that the average follower of these false religions actually do more charitable work than christians do, then that statement is just more unfounded lip service and unproven assumptions. But regarding the bolded, as I have explained numerous times on this thread alone, because of our fallen natures, it doesn't matter how much good we do apart from Christ, it's all for nothing if we aren't covered by His shed blood which was sacrificed as propitiation for our sins. You are blind to that reality. So you are absolutely right when you say that it doesn't matter how much good one does, it's only ones belief in Christ that will get us to heaven.\n \n\n Its a hypothetical scenario, no proof needed. And you concede to the point I was making anway. \n \n \nYou speak about me as if I'm elevating myself above unbelievers when I too was no different than those I say are followers of false religions. So no matter how much this bothers you paulie, it isn't me who thought it up or has made it the spiritual law that we must live by whether we like it or not. You're free to deny these truths all you want to, but that wont change or nullify them as spiritual truths in any way.\n\n Your belief doesn't bother me in the least. A few years ago it was my belief. Like I said above, I tested my beliefs and they failed. Of course, if you don't test them they can't fail",

   "The idea of doing good deeds in the service of a false, even demonic, god, puts me in mind of The Last Battle, by C. S. Lewis. It features a young Calormene who serves the demon-god Tash with good deeds and honest worship. When the world ends, Aslan accepts the man into his country (heaven, effectively), saying that any good deed is counted as service to Aslan, any bad deed as service to Tash. What do people make of this allegory as it applies to Christian ideas of salvation?\n\n \n On the other hand, I think one of the best aspects of Christianity--at least the Christianity I grew up with--is that it offers forgiveness despite bad deeds. That even if someone did do bad deeds, he or she can find atonement for those in Christ. The good-deeds=heaven / bad-deeds=hell approach seems too unlike Christ to me. And frankly, it's just too easy. In other words, I think of Christianity as going even farther than attributing any good deed to service of God, but offering acceptance even when people have done bad. Because of this, the whole idea put forth here so much by its critics that Christianity is such an exclusivist religion is very strange and ironic to me. The religion offers heaven despite bad deeds; the whole point of it is atonement and forgiveness. It's easy to accept people when they've done things considered good; where real acceptance comes in play is accepting them if they've done things some would consider bad, and that's the whole point of atonement.",

   "I suppose there are a few points that I have problems with. First is the idea that sin can be transferred - either from the parents to children or from general sinners to Jesus. If you did something wrong, you cannot transfer those wrong actions to someone who didn't - it just doesn't make sense to me.\n \n\n When adam sinned, God called him out on his disobedience, then unleashed the most vile curse in the entire bible. First he cursed tha man, then he cursed the woman, then he cursed the snake, then he cursed the earth. He declared every type of suffering and hardship that exists today in that curse. \n \n Part of the curse included transference to adam's children forever, which includes every man woman and child that ever lived and will ever live. \n \n Transference of sins to animals is also a very old custom. The term \"scapegoat\" comes from the old tradition of transferring the sins of a village onto a goat, then \n release the goat into the wilderness. Animal sacrifice was first mentioned with Cain and Abel and the infamous first murder. I'm not sure how they figured out that God required sacrifices or how the whole transference thing works, so I probably can't really answer your question properly\n \n \nAlso, I can understand that traditionally people would sacrifice an animal to atone for sins. I would see it as a form of self-punishment (depriving oneself of something very useful - in their case, a useful animal). In that sense, the sacrifice of Jesus would really only be a sacrifice for the population if the continued wordly existence of Jesus would have been something greatly desired and, thus, a sacrifice to the people who sinned. At the time, there were only a handful of followers who would have appreciated his continued existence, so they were the only ones (besides Jesus himself) that suffered due to his loss. The others couldn't care less. Those of us who live after his death also would not have benefited from his continued life, except, possibly if he had had a chance to pass on more wisdom that was curtailed by his early death. So, I don't see too much what we sacrificed by having Jesus die. The bottom line is that it is the sacrifice of the people that is most important in educating them, not of the sacrificial lamb themselves. \n \n\n Well actually I don't see how educating people is part of the plan. Once you sin, you pay for the sin. You're expected to sin again, and even if you could demonstrate that you didn't sin in a given year, you were required to offer a sacrifice for the sins you might have committed that you didn't know about, or for the sake of the possibility that you sinned in your thoughts. The priests were the most sinless people ever, yet they had to offer the most sacrifices, almost daily in some cases. The priests knew the laws inside out, and practiced absinence and holiness at all times, so this wasn't an educational experience for them at all.\n \n Basically, sacrificing really isn't about depriving yourself of your prized possessions. Its just about following the law. If God said do it, just do it. It didn't even have to be your animal. Selling animals for sacrifices was a big business, and for a reasonable to exorbitant fee you could buy an animal right outside the altar. Jesus' sacrifice was a requirement of the law, and not much else. \n \n \nLastly, if we assume that God is omnipotent and benevolent, I do not see how sin should translate to the requirement of death - that is such an extreme overreaction and suggests a God that is far too harsh to ever be considered benevolent.\n\n It is. God only thinks in extremes. There is no middle ground. He spews lukewarm out of his mouth. Get used to it.",

But not just the direct victims, but the indirect victims whom the shooter never sees as they commit their crime.

Because it sets up the false premise upon which the rest of the post is based.\n\n Whoa! Nothing you talk about has anything to do with sin. Bad things don't happen to people because they sin. People sin, bad things happen to people. The direct correlation doesn't exist. Have you ever seen anybody suffer as a result of working on a saturday? And why do obedient children still die young sometimes?\n \n Yes, cause and effect exists, and that's why people suffer negative cosequences, but it doesn't correspond to sin as defined in the bible. Its not a sin to fall off a 30-storey building, but you'll still die. Its not a sin to poke a bee's nest, or to run through a field during a lightning storm, or to skydive with a defective parachute. Yet these actions result in negative consequences just as if they were sins. \n \n Sin is something completely different. Achan sinned in not killing and utterly destroying all the men women, children, animals and property of the amalekites during the war. Lot's wife sinned by looking back at sodom and gomorah while it was being destroyed. Adam sinned by eating a fruit that God said don't eat. Sin isn't whatever we judge to be morally wrong, sin is ONLY defined as disobeying God's commandments, and nothing else. \n \n The fact that some of God's laws overlap with some of man's laws doesn't mean there's a direct correlation. And just because some things that are harmful to us are sins doesn't mean a correlation exists there either. Sin is exclusive to biblical doctrine, and is purely a spiritual issue.",

   "Fair enough. What I was saying is that we have beliefs that are based on zero evidence and 100% faith, which is what iangb is referring to as blind faith. An example might be \"I'll go to heaven when I die.\" Then we have beliefs that are supported by some evidence and some faith, which is what iangb is referring to as faith. An example might be \"the bus will be here at 4:30.\" I further went on to say there are some beliefs that are based entirely by evidence, and zero faith is required, which is what I am referring to as true facts. An example might be \"I am 6 feet tall.\" And finally we have absurd beliefs, which is an extension of blind faith, because it not only lacks supporting evidence, but it also contradicts existing evidence. An example might be \"I was born on Mars.\"\n \n All in all, I think we were all saying the same thing all along, although the labelling might have been off. If you guys still believe that what we are saying is still contrary, I'll be glad to try and come to a common understanding. \n \n Kronus, I just have a few thoughts on your extra distinction. Because blind-faith beliefs and absurd beliefs are equally based on zero evidence, the line between them can shift. If my belief is that I can fly, even though I haven't flown before and nothing suggests that its physically possible, then if I actually deliberately fly, I can add this to my list of things that make sense. The evidence is there, so it may have been an absurd belief before, but with this newly discovered evidence its not absurd anymore.\n \n Conversely, (not to turn this into a gay-rights thread but its what came to mind) if I was born a man, but believe I'm a woman, this is also a belief that is both lacking evidence (except the personal evaluation of my feelings) and contradicts existing evidence (I have male genitalia and features). However, in many cases this is not considered an absurd belief. \n \n How absurd a particular belief is may vary from time to time and from person to person, so it might be a good idea to use this labelling of beliefs carefully.",

   "I'm having a hard time reasoning with you paulie because you keep changing the goal posts midstream, which makes debating you very difficult. This is what you said previously which I responded to below.\n \n\n Sin is a spiritual problem in its purest form. It doesn't affect anything in our lives except what we percieve to be our spiritual beings. And even at that it only applies to those who believe in the doctrine of the bible. Sin is defined exclusively in the bible as disobedience of biblical commandments. It doesn't apply to any other religious following. \n \n \n And my response to you was in rebuttal to that statement and was right on topic. \n \n \nYa know paulie, I have respected your objectivity in looking at both sides in debates even though I have understood that we don't agree with each other in principle about most everything. I have respected your ability to be a critical thinker and to show some depth as you consider the available options being advanced in a debate. But you really disappoint with this post as it lacks any depth or even common sense regarding real world experience. I mean, have you not heard of the principle of cause and effect? \n \n The bible refers to sins as destructive to the participants of them and also to those who associate with the practitioners of the sinful activities. Have you ever seen a healthy illegal drug abuser? Or even a legal drug abuser for that matter? How about those who practice promiscuous sex? Aren't they carriers of STDs and don't they pass them on to the people they infect because of their promiscuity? Have you ever known a virgin who contracted an STD? But a person on their first sexual outing can get infected if they happen to meet up with a promiscuous person. And have you forgotten how the gun in the hands of a brutal criminal can end the lives of the innocent in order to feed the self destructive impulses of the murderer? But not just the direct victims, but the indirect victims whom the shooter never sees as they commit their crime. Cause and effect paulie, or as the bible puts it, the infectious nature of sin which never happens in a vacuum, ever. It always ripples along like a wave that is pushed forward by the energy of the sin behind it. \n \n So rethink your rationale, because it is seriously flawed which is why I only needed to respond to the first paragraph in your post. Because it sets up the false premise upon which the rest of the post is based.\n\n \n Your followup response is in no way on point with what I was saying but completely changes the subject. And most responses here have been more about my perspectives than about the subject being discussed. This isn't about Archangel, but about how to know which religion is the right religion.\n \n \nWhoa! Nothing you talk about has anything to do with sin. Bad things don't happen to people because they sin. People sin, bad things happen to people. The direct correlation doesn't exist. Have you ever seen anybody suffer as a result of working on a saturday? And why do obedient children still die young sometimes?\n \n Yes, cause and effect exists, and that's why people suffer negative cosequences, but it doesn't correspond to sin as defined in the bible. Its not a sin to fall off a 30-storey building, but you'll still die. Its not a sin to poke a bee's nest, or to run through a field during a lightning storm, or to skydive with a defective parachute. Yet these actions result in negative consequences just as if they were sins. \n \n Sin is something completely different. Achan sinned in not killing and utterly destroying all the men women, children, animals and property of the amalekites during the war. Lot's wife sinned by looking back at sodom and gomorah while it was being destroyed. Adam sinned by eating a fruit that God said don't eat. Sin isn't whatever we judge to be morally wrong, sin is ONLY defined as disobeying God's commandments, and nothing else. \n \n The fact that some of God's laws overlap with some of man's laws doesn't mean there's a direct correlation. And just because some things that are harmful to us are sins doesn't mean a correlation exists there either. Sin is exclusive to biblical doctrine, and is purely a spiritual issue.\n",

If there is a God and it happened according to OT history, it really makes no difference what a critic of God does or doesn't do; it's not like it's going to hurt or diminish God for a human being to decide not to worship him. If there is a God, then He is God completely independent of anyone refusal to worship him over perceived acts of evil on the part of said deity. As C.S. Lewis once said, \"A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word, 'darkness' on the walls of his cell. \"",

Numerous times in the old testament God commanded the Israelites to commit what we would undoubtedly consider acts of evil. However they were obviously not sins because they were in obedience to God's commandment, which is where the definition of sin comes from. At the same time, nobody would consider eating a fruit as an act of evil by any stretch of the imagination, yet it was a sin, by definition, and the consequences of that non-evil sin dwarfs those of any other sin that was ever commited, despite of how evil it is considered. \n \n But that was the old testament, so we can both acknowledge this and move on. \n \n I'm sure you remember in 2004 when the massive tsunami hit indonesia and killed over 123000 people there. This mass slaughter was undoubtedly considered an evil act, even though it was not caused by malicious people, the consequences were just as devastating. What I remember distinctly about that event was the rationalizations that came forth from the religious camp. Many christians (my own mother included) justified God causing this disaster on the grounds that these people worshiped false gods and practiced idolatry and other sins, and that's why God did that to them. Also, the destruction of hurricane katrina was similarly reasoned to be due to the sinful nature of the revelings that take place during mardi gras in New Orleans. Were the \"sins\" in these cases the cause of these tragedies? Christians seem to think so, despite the fact that thousands of innocent children, billions of dollars worth of property, and the lives of many christians themselves, were lost in these events. \n \n So does sin really equate to the reason everything bad happens. I'm not convinced, but what do I know...\n \n \nI don't think most Christians particularly like the idea of God wiping people out either, but it is what it is, and if someone chooses to not worship God over that, that's their prerogative.\n\n Well, most christians believe in the bible as inerrant fact, and the accounts of God wiping people out are plain and prominent, so like you said, it is what it is. If someone chooses to worship God despite this, that is their granted perogative as well. \n \n Its no doubt that malicious acts commited by one human to another is almost always considered sin (except for acts of war or religious genocide). But not all sins are malicious acts to others, and not all acts that cause harm are sins. The direct correlation just doesn't exist",

One is justified in accepting a belief when the evidence overwhelms the uncertainty. That is, we consider the evidence and the uncertainty, and this idea of \"faith\" (either definition) has no application. The difference between \"true fact\" and \"acceptable belief\" is simple uncertainty.\n\n For what its worth, here's how I view the faith-evidence issue. Let's say we start of with a statement, like \"cotton is a better insulator of heat than polyester\" and we quantitatively define better insulator to mean allows less change in temperature per minute or some other measurable attribute. The statement is a factual statement (as opposed to an opinion) and it may be tested to be true or false. We call this a hypothesis. \n \n Stage 1. If no tests have been made and no data is available about the insulating properties of these materials, then believing this statement will be based entirely on faith. \n \n Stage 2. If I say that the statement is true because I remember my mom getting burned lifting a pot off the stove with a polyester shirt, but when she used a cotton shirt she didn't get burned, then I have evidence to support the hypothesis, but not enough to consider it a fact. It is evidence nontheless. \n \n Stage 3. If I say that the statement is true because I have personally picked up a hot pot with a polyester cloth and got burned, but when I used a cotton cloth on the same pot, I could hold it longer before it was too hot to hold. This is stronger evidence than above, and makes accepting the hypothesis as true more reasonable than the second hand account of my mother. But it is still not enough to be considered scientific proof, and there still exists some degree of uncertainty. \n \n Stage 4. Finally, if we use 2 identical pieces of cloth, made with the same thread size, same weave, same color and same size, the only difference being one is made of cotton and the other of polyester, and we place them in identical environments wrapped around accurate thermometers in the same way, then we can accurately and conclusively test this hypothesis. We can conduct this experiment repeatedly and prove that cotton is indeed a better insulator of heat than polyester. All uncertainty will be removed and we have what we call a proven fact. \n \n Now, from the point of hypothesis to the point of fact, we gathered evidence along the way that helped us draw the final conclusion. At the hypothesis level we have zero evidence, and at the fact level we have 100% evidence. But we also had intermediate levels where evidence was present, but was more or less evidence and allowed us to reach conclusions with more or less uncertainty. \n \n The way I view it, if at any stage we make our statement into our belief, we must employ some measure of faith. At stage 1, since we have absolutely no evidence, we must believe the statement based only on faith. I call this 0% evidence and 100% faith. At stage 2, we have more than 0 evidence but less than complete evidence. At stage 3 we also have more than 0 evidence and less than complete evidence, and more evidence than in stage 2. This also means that at stage 2 we are more uncertain than at stage 3. The degree to which the uncertainty exists corresponds to the degree we must employ faith in order to accept the statement as true. So in my \"model\" you'll need more faith to accept the statement as true at stage 2 than at stage 3, but you still need some faith. At stage 4, the statement is completely supported by the evidence and there is no uncertainty about acceptingthe statement as true. Therefore, no faith is needed. \n \n Maybe you might still disagree, since you might think that my definition of faith is still mamsy-pamsy. But this model makes sense to me. I also think that we share the same concept, but its just the wording that you disagree with. I guess its fair to say that we can both live with that, huh?",

Faith is what stops people changing their minds long after step 4 has settled the matter.\n\n I don't quite get what you mean by \"Faith capital 'F\"'. If one insists on disregarding evidence that supports a statement, they must continue to hold on to their faith. Faith usually surrenders to evidence. This is the default nature of beliefs. However, we can choose to ignore the evidence that goes against what we want to believe, even if it may not be true. \n \n At any point we can disregard the evidence and still believe the statement is true. That's why I view faith as a form of placeholder that \"fills\" the gap where evidence is lacking. \n \n This is especially common when there exists ambiguous evidence, some that suggests the statement is true and some that suggests otherwise. By accepting the statement to be either true or false, we must reject evidence that suggests the opposite. Whether either position is \"reasonable\" is debatable, since both sides are supported by evidence. However, 2 contradictory statements cannot both be true. This is where most debates occur, since it becomes a joust of reasoning vs reasoning, not evidence vs faith.",

Given the example you mentioned, if ones own experience seems to show that cotton is more insulating and if one thinks it is possible that cotton might be more insulating than polyester but admits that one is unsure and that it could well be the other way around, then there would be little faith involved. If one is sure that cotton is more insulating and the evidence just happens to confirm your belief, I would call that faith. Faith is confidence in a belief independent of evidence. I would say that the degree of faith lies more in the degree of confidence than anything else.",

   "The point I got from your post is that sin is the reason bad things happen in the world. My response made the point that sin is not the reason that bad things happen in the world. You cited examples of sinful acts that result in bad things happening. I cited sins that are not acts of evil and doesn't cause bad things to happen to others but are still sins because of their biblical context. I also cited examples of things that do cause harm to people and are not sins. The point I made was that there is no direct correlation between sins and acts that cause bad things to happen.\n \n In smiley's reply the same point is made. \n \n I really shouldn't have to break down my responses in order to help you understand what I wrote. This isn't a comprhension issue at all. If you took your time and actually read what I wrote, rather than decide to become offended by what you must have thought were personal attacks toward you, then you would have saved us both time because you would have been reinforcing the points you made rather than throwing up your hands in a protest against attacks that don't even exist. \n \n I have been very patient with you in this discussion. I thoroughly read through your posts and sometimes even your snippets of indented scripture, and I respond directly to the points you make with counterpoints and reasoned arguments. Never have I attacked or insulted you in any of my replies, amidsts the obvious barrage of snide remarks and sarcasm you've been getting from some other participants here. Instead, you respond to parts of my posts and flippantly brush off what I say assuming that they're invalid without even reading them. You constantly play the victim card, accusing me of attacking your personal beliefs where no attacks exist. And you associate anybody who disagrees with your points as lumped with the rest of your adversaries here that have contempt for you. This reminds me so much of a very common trend I see here on one of the other sections in this site. \n \n Even now, after you've made it obvious that your baseless accusations of emotional victimization is clouding your ability to contribute to the discussion further, I'm still being very patient with you. I won't be responding to any more of your emotional knee-jerks here. If you can't get off your high horse and extend the same common courtesy of patience and respect to me, then cool. The discussion will go on and I'm sure some of the participants will actually be relieved.\n\n \n The question I must ask here is, when did I say anywhere that you attacked or insulted me? I said your response was off topic and I maintain that assertion. You, and by your statement of agreement with smileys response that not every sin results in another sin, you have shown that it is you who is misinterpreting my argument. Am I not allowed to make a general point without it being disregarded as if it was an all encompassing statement of fact and thereby dismissible because it doesn't apply in every instance? \n \n And your statement that: The fact that some of God's laws overlap with some of man's laws doesn't mean there's a direct correlation. Just reveals how little you understand about the nature of sin. You actually think that you can separate the spiritual from the natural in life which is the big mistake the natural world makes in running their lives. You seem to be saying that that because drug abuse isn't specifically mentioned in the bible, then drug abuse isn't an issue as a sin that is relevant to how it effects Society at large. Have you not read the passage that we aren't to quench the holy spirit? I guess in your mind drug abuse has no bearing on that issue. Do these spiritual laws sound vague to you? To me, they hit on every single corner of my physical life and also my private thought life too. \n \n 1Th 5:18 \n in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\n 1Th 5:19 \n Do not quench the Spirit.\n 1Th 5:20 \n Do not despise prophecies.\n 1Th 5:21 \n Test all things; hold fast what is good.\n 1Th 5:22 \n Abstain from every form of evil.\n 1Th 5:23 \n Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n And how about the larger impact on the community with side affects like drive by shootings, or the image of easy money to the younger generation that grows up witnessing this crime and thinking it's an acceptable way to earn a living? It leads to more of the same and the continued degradation of our Society. This same type of cause and effect can be seen in so many aspects of Societies ills, but that doesn't mean it is found in every single one of them across the board. \n \n \nYes, cause and effect exists, and that's why people suffer negative cosequences, but it doesn't correspond to sin as defined in the bible. Its not a sin to fall off a 30-storey building, but you'll still die. Its not a sin to poke a bee's nest, or to run through a field during a lightning storm, or to skydive with a defective parachute. Yet these actions result in negative consequences just as if they were sins. \n \n Sin is something completely different. Achan sinned in not killing and utterly destroying all the men women, children, animals and property of the amalekites during the war. Lot's wife sinned by looking back at sodom and gomorah while it was being destroyed. Adam sinned by eating a fruit that God said don't eat. Sin isn't whatever we judge to be morally wrong, sin is ONLY defined as disobeying God's commandments, and nothing else. \n \n The fact that some of God's laws overlap with some of man's laws doesn't mean there's a direct correlation. And just because some things that are harmful to us are sins doesn't mean a correlation exists there either. Sin is exclusive to biblical doctrine, and is purely a spiritual issue.\n",

   "Archangel, if you agree that not all sins cause bad things to happen, and that sin. Is not the causes of bad things, then what is your point? Sins are defined as transgressions against God's law. Not all sins cause harmful consequences, but they are sins nonetheless. \n \n The point I made in the first place was that sins are purely spiritual problems that do not correspond to problems in reality. You disagree, yet fail to show that sins is what causes bad things to happen. I pointed out examples of bad things happening that are not caused by sin. I also pointed out examples of sins that do not result in bad things happening. The only things that defines sin is that its against God's commandment, not that its the cause of bad things. \n \n This is the point I made before your reply and after your reply. You failed to show that sin is defined by anything other than what the bible defines it as. You also failed to show that sin is what causes bad things to happen. In short, you failed to refute my point. Instead you simply declare that my post was off topic, as if you just saying so making it the case. \n \n Cool",
