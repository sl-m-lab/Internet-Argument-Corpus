Lets just assume under your idea of gun control that five plane crashes happen per year, 9/11 style of course. This is a low ball assumption considering not even you can figure out how to stop it from happening. Each kills 3,000 on average. That is 15,000 per year. Of course air travel drops off after this and our economy begins to sink. Soon enough the funds we had to support your list up there becomes thinner and thinner. Based on your post above, a drop in support for these things would increase gun violence. With more people having guns this increase will be more dramatic than can be assumed at this time. After that, well we don't want to see what happens after that.\n \n Your list is valid, assuming your not going to mix it with your idea of no gun control laws. All these things already exist and I agree that they do reduce crime. But it is in the poorest neightborhoods that these things need to be supported. That is not always the case.\n \n But to contradict what your saying, I could argue that you will never get gun deaths down into the hundreds per year instead of thousands just by doing what you listed. With strict gun controls you could do much better. So don't presume that your solution will put all 'anti-gunners' in their place.",

O'Neal goes up for the rebound and comes down with a bullet in his chest. Now there is a shoot out as the Lakers fans retaliate. Oh why are all these guns here anyways? Is it really necessary?

I want you to examine the questions I brought up about your idea and let me know whether you think you can find ways to overcome them.\n \n Also you didn't say what you are trying to get out of this debate. I already got everything I wanted out of this debate which was to understand the view points of someone who is strongly pro-gun. Being that your opinion is the minority I'm guessing your testing it against the majority. Is that the case?\n \n To respond to your post, due process is necessary in the American society and it is already in place. It isn't like we have thrown it out the window as we did with the Japanese. If that is what you consider totally trashing the constitution, then we are a far cry from that.\n \n You're missing the big picture. You're the minority here. That is part of the big picture that I think your missing. You're acting like there are a few people who are trying to keep you down when in fact your the ones who are trying to boss the majority around. Your literally asking people to accept that guns will put their lives in danger every day from now on and you don't want to even explain how this system will work. Your also saying to our government that they should allow easy access to weapons without question and no matter what the situation. Our government would be put at risk, as would all public areas that they help to protect and yet you don't want to explain how this will work either. That is the big picture which you are missing. Your blinded by your own selfish needs and you need to wake up from that if you wish to determine whether your idea is realistic or not.\n \n You brought up 9/11? We have already established that 9/11 will occur frequently under your laws. So I hope this wasn't supposed to help your case because it doesn't.\n \n Unless your next post lays out the answers to all the questions concerning your idea or you accept that the questions are valid and that you don't know how your idea would work I'm not going to respond back. You're very willing to ignore the facts in this debate and of course a debate cannot occur when one person simply ignores all but what they want to hear and isn't willing to question what they are debating. If you're not in this to figure out whether your idea works or not then you have nothing more to gain from this debate anyways.",

As I demonstrated in previous posts backed up by neutral (and some not so neutral) sources, Gun control laws do NOTHING for crime rates and in fact can cause violent crime to skyrocket (see D.C. for example).\n\n \n I didn't call the other side of a debate fanatical. I called Kelvin fanatical in his opinion. I did so to distinguish him from the majority of pro-gun (pro-rights as you like to be called) enthusiasts. I wanted to make that point that I don't believe he is typical in that his point of view is held very strongly by him and his ideas are pretty far out. I can't say that he should be happy to have this title, but I don't think that he will deny that he is an extremist in his debate.\n \n I see you were confused by what I was saying but I'll give my views on your opinion that 'people who would interfere with an individuals' are fanatical. If your speaking of all people like this in general, I don't think you can call them fanatical as there are some of them that will be far, far more extreme than the group. They are the ones that will ignore reason and just yell their opinions even if they know they are lies and won't work. That is similar to what Kelvin has been doing, wouldn't you agree?\n \n If I were fanatical to remove your rights I'd be yelling for a police state, not casually debating against gun control while defending it as well. I am not even saying that all guns should be banned. I'm just saying we don't need Kelvin's ideas implemented as they are unsound.\n \n I see you too my use of the word 'fanatical' personally as if it was an attack on everyone who was pro-gun. Let me assure you that I was only labeling an individual. The idea of being pro-gun isn't fanatical nor is the idea of gun control. Fanatical is to demand that people have the right to carry automatics onto airplanes while wearing body armor in large groups and not even be questioned for doing so. Fanatical is demanding that all guns, free speech, and freedoms be repealed. Fanatical is not saying that we should be allowed to carry a gun as long as it seems reasonable and your open to logical thinking. Fanatical is not saying that you should be tested and have a background check before buying a gun as well as having laws in place to prevent you from carrying your gun around. They are opposite viewpoints but neither are fanatical to each other. The fanatics are few but there are some in each group.\n \n 'Is an armed People the natural defense of a free state, or does the state owe the people a free ride?' Excellent point. This is one reason I would never wish to see gun control overly enforced. If we ever get to a point where America is weak, I'll be glad to know our citizens are well armed.\n \n Gun control also is about control just like all our laws are. Do you think the government wants some control over you? Of course they do. They want the right to throw you in jail if you kill someone. They want the right to fine you if you're speeding or endangering lives. Do they want to tell you what to eat everyday? Hell no. That would be a definition of a fanatical government. As long as there is a government there will be a need for them to control us just as in a democracy we wish to have some control over them. Don't think that control will ever be completely removed otherwise you will have anarchy and chaos.\n \n You say gun control does nothing to reduce crime. Alright, now read Kelvin's ideas on gun control. Do you think he has some ideas that will reduce crime?\n \n \nSo may I ask point blank why do you want to violate my civil rights? what goal do you hope to accomplish. Please show me one country that has followed your path and lives in this eternal bliss?\n\n \n Goal? Order and safety. Pretty simple. I don't want to see the chaos and anarchy complete elimination of all gun controls would bring on. Think of the attacks we would face if just anyone could walk up to the president with a gun. What if it was common to see the president shaking hands or holding a conference with hundreds of people with guns around him? How well would that work out? That is what I'm saying cannot be allowed although Kelvin wishes for this to be common. Do you see it my way or Kelvin's?\n \n Bliss? No. I don't expect anything to bring eternal bliss and neither would having no gun control laws. If you think gun control is the only thing preventing you from achieving total bliss, perhaps you could show me a country that followed that path.",

   "How does this fix our terrorists on the plane scenario? Lets just assume under your idea of gun control that five plane crashes happen per year, 9/11 style of course. This is a low ball assumption considering not even you can figure out how to stop it from happening. Each kills 3,000 on average. That is 15,000 per year. Of course air travel drops off after this and our economy begins to sink. Soon enough the funds we had to support your list up there becomes thinner and thinner. Based on your post above, a drop in support for these things would increase gun violence. With more people having guns this increase will be more dramatic than can be assumed at this time. After that, well we don't want to see what happens after that.\n \n Your list is valid, assuming your not going to mix it with your idea of no gun control laws. All these things already exist and I agree that they do reduce crime. But it is in the poorest neightborhoods that these things need to be supported. That is not always the case.\n \n But to contradict what your saying, I could argue that you will never get gun deaths down into the hundreds per year instead of thousands just by doing what you listed. With strict gun controls you could do much better. So don't presume that your solution will put all 'anti-gunners' in their place.\n\n Suppose for a moment that you are a high quality black teen who has no choice but to live in a ghetto that is seriously dangerous.

Another hunter mistook him for game. In no way do I think that hunting or guns are at fault. The cause for his tragic death was poor judgement. This is a human quality. It was an accident. It could have been prevented if guns and hunting had been banned. In fact, almost all accidents could be prevented by banning the activity that results in them. Since gun owners are not proposing that we ban automobiles, there is an obvious flaw in their logic. Doing so would severely stifle our way of life. We all know this, and can agree that banning automobiles to prevent car related deaths is as ridiculous as it sounds.\n \n Still, banning automobiles would absolutely eliminate drive-by shootings and car bombings.\n For that matter, banning airplanes would completely prevent their use as weapons.\n \n We don't need cars or airplanes. They do make our life easier and more enjoyable. \n If you think there is no need for guns, then why not disarm the police? If we can trust police (who are citizens just like you and I) with guns, why can we not trust private citizens?\n \n There are ways to prevent vehicles from being used as weapons that do not involve banning or restricting their use. However, for some reason the gun grabbers don't have the same irrational hate for planes and cars that they do for guns.\n Perhaps we should institute an \"assault plane\" ban that limited passenger capacity to under ten people.
