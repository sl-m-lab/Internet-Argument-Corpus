   "I must admit I knew little about the beliefs of the people who on occasion--usually on Saturdays-- knock on my door wearing ill-fitting polyester suits and eagerly hand out tracts and pamphlets. But in researching them for this piece I have become of the firm opinion they are a cult more than a Christian sect.\n \n Here are some key factors Sociologists use to identify a cult:\n \n 1. It uses psychological coecion to recruit, indoctrinate and retain its members.  \n \n JW's estimate it takes about 700 house visits to get one recruit. Then intensive indoctrination begins where the new candidate is expected to attend bible class several hours, five night a week, for up to six months to become familiar with and memorize key bible verses which support JW's philosophies. They are then tested by local elders to assure all lessons are fully implanted before being baptized and becoming a member. Armed in this fashion they become a veritable wellspring of biblical information that is nearly impossible to argue against with normal religious folk. JW's can be relied on to use the same rhetoric, oftentimes word for word, whether in Peoria, Illinois or Capetown, South Africa. \n \n 2. It forms an elitist totalitarian society.  \n \n Members are told that they alone will be saved. In fact, if one is not a JW, one is of Satan. I wasn't aware that behind the smiling faces of the solicitors is a discriminatory mien. They are conditioned to expect rudeness and hostility and when it is encountered only bolsters their belief of battling head on with old Beezlebub himself.\n \n JW's founder Charles Taze Russell, preached that they were the 144,000 mentioned in Revelations as the ones going to heaven alone. The date was also divined through him as when the end of the world would occur, 1914, based on twisted chronologies in the Bible. Today JW's number roughly six million and the end has obviously not come. What to do? Proclaim that Jesus did come in 1914 and closed heaven! Yes, you read that right. Only the original JW's will be born again in heaven. The rest will live forever on earth. Non-JW's will perish. Even still, the excitement of 1914 and the burgeoning \n membership did not go unnoticed, so other dates were picked, based on new \"enlightened\" understandings of mathematics and historic timelines: 1918, 1925, 1929, 1945, 1975, and 1994. Each time a new frenzy ensued, coffers were filled and enrollment blossomed. Each date came and went, and a concommitant disappointment and falling away followed.\n \n 3. Its leader [are] self-appointed, dogmatic, messianic and not accountable.\n \n Ask a JW about the structure of the organization and most know relatively little. Very little is online about it either and delayed my posting of this until I could learn a few scraps of info about it. This is what I discovered:\n \n There are currently ten members who sit on the Anointed Governing Board in New York City. They are never elected, but rather \"chosen\" by unknown, completely secretive means. There is no known minimun or maximum number of seats available and fluctuates over time. They alone dictate dogma and policy. Members are not allowed to study the bible apart from the organization, but only in the context of the Governing Body's dictates. Being the chosen people of God, the Anointed Governing Board is infallible in its pronouncements and prohecies. In short, members are told what to study and how to interpret it. How do they reconcile the infallible part with the failed prohecies? Members are not allowed to read outdated tracts. Also, the Anointed Governing Body operates on the premise that Jehovah has given them alone the light, and the light is ever increasing in wattage! \n \n Outside of the Governing Board, there are about 100 branch offices, which are little more than printing shops staffed with volunteers.\n \n There are several other parallels between the JW's and cults but in the interest of brevity I wish to simply point out some of the more non-mainstream Christian beliefs that are held by its members:\n \n The rejection of the Trinity. God alone is their focus of worship. Jesus is not a divine figure but rather Michael the Archangel in human form. He died on a stake (hence the cross as a demonic symbol) but did not bodily arise, only \"spiritually'. The holy spirit (never capitalized) is simply a force of Jehovah's.\n \n JW's cannot vote, salute the flag, serve in the armed services, have blood transfusions, celebrate birthdays or Christmas. Once a member, it is expected of you to don your polyester suit and go door to door evangelizing to the evil, lost hordes. They are apocalyptic to the core--Revelation is never far from their teachings--but believe the earth will be habitable after Armageddon, where most of its members will live. \n \n Members who leave are apostates, a particularly dirty, sinful word, and must be shunned, as should other family members not of the one true faith. \n \n I have always responded civilly to JW's when they come to my door, I suppose. Their meetings have been brief and they seemed most interested in leaving me with their tracts which I accepted, mostly to get them to leave sooner. But I think from now on I will hand the literature back and ask them not to return. Why encourage cultish activity? Especially when I cannot sensibly argue with them. They are beyond reach, the true children of a selective, intolerant god.",

   "My only encounter with JW was about 5 years ago, billsco, so I don&#8217;t know that much about them. Two older men came to the house and wanted to get me to join. When they had finished their spiel, I asked them what they would do if a man entered their house, beat the eldest son and daughter and threatened to beat and rape the wife. They said in effect that God would take care of it afterwards. I told them that I wouldn&#8217;t tolerate such behavior and would have to take care of it right then. They told me thanks and left. Of course that was my first encounter and cannot base the whole religion on two old men. :)",

We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. \n \n Peter tells us, \"David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is \"the Lord\" who speaks to \"my Lord,\" Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, \"Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. \n \n In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: \"[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\" This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: \"I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? \" Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will \"confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh.\" The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). \n \n Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh (\"I AM,\" in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\" His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. \"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple\" (John 8:59). \n \n With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. \n \n The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp\n \n \n Ignatius...\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n God and Jesus, Jesus and God.

   "Your wrong about the founder of our beliefs being convicted of fraud, I'd like to know where you heard that as the Watchtower org' is in the process of legal action against hateful website owners to get some of these false stories erased.\n \n Before we go into this can you please provide your sources for the information that you have heard so I can pass it on to the Watchtower org' then they can then pass it on to the respective legal bodies, Thanks.\n \n The \"Founder of our beliefs\", Charles Taze Russel, never claimed to be able to read Greek, he never produced a new translation and he was never asked to read Greek in a court of law, so already I can see that you are being fed lies. Sources please.\n \n LF,\n\n \n Charles Taze Russell?s Fraud:\n It is well to note that the man who started this cult was, according to record, a fraud and as dishonest as they come. When Mr. Russell was asked in Court to answer under oath the question, ?Do you know Greek?,? he answered, ?Oh, yes.? They then handed him a copy of the New Testament in Greek and they asked him to read even the letters of the alphabet and he could not do it. He was then asked by the Attorney, ?Now are you familiar with the Greek language?? He was then forced to admit that he didn?t know it. It is clearly seen that this cult was started by a hypocrite who declared under oath that he knew Greek, but it was proven that he didn?t know a Greek letter from a chicken track. According to record, when his wife sued him for divorce because of his improper relationship with one Rose Ball, he denied the truth most violently until cornered and forced to admit it. \n \n \n \n To fraud his wife, according to record, he transferred $617,000 to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society and corporations over which he himself had complete control. These are just a few things about the man who started the so-called Jehovah?s Witnesses, to show that the founder of this cult was a fraud and a hypocrite. After the death of this man, which took place November 9, 1916, the ex-judge J. F. Rutherford became the leader of the cult.

(see also http://www.watchman.org/jw/jwcourt.htm)\n \n \n \n Here is the JW spin\"A Presbyterian Minister from Ontario, Canada, slandered Pastor Russell in a widely published booklet. Pastor Russell was advised that the best way to deal with this was to take him to court. During the court proceedings Pastor Russell was asked if he knew the Greek alphabet. He said that he did, and was then asked if he would be able to recognize them in print. He said he could, but might make some mistakes. He then was asked a different question, \"Are you familiar with the Greek language?\" To which Pastor Russell answered: \"No.\"\n \n http://www.pastor-russell.com/life/lie2.html\n \n That he was asked if he knew the Greek Alphabet - he said 'yes', when actually presented with an opportunity to be tested, he admitted he might make some mistakes - this is just in reading letters of the alphabet!\n \n \n \n I think though your argument will be based on the fact that he was not actually 'convicted' of perjury. Another spin - because quite clearly he made one claim in court - and then changed it.\n \n \n \n Hence he?d not be able to understand Greek rules.\n \n See ?It's Greek To Me! Grammar Rule Supports Christ's Deity?\n \n http://www.watchman.org/jw/greekfeb.htm\n \n \n \n What other mistakes have been made in interpretations? (or rather, he changed his mind a number of times on certain issues?)\n \n Resurrection of the Men of Sodom\n \n 1879 - They will be resurrected.\n \n 1952 - They will not be resurrected.\n \n 1965 - They will be resurrected.\n \n 1988 - They will not be resurrected.24\n \n \n \n The 'Lord' in Romans 10:12-16\n \n 1903 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n \n 1940 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.\n \n 1978 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n \n 1980 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.25\n \n \n \n 'Higher Powers' of Romans 13:1\n \n 1916 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.\n \n 1943 - 'Higher powers' refers to Jehovah God & Jesus Christ.\n \n 1964 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.26\n \n \n \n Separating 'sheep and goats' (Matt. 25:31-46)\n \n 1919 - will take place after the time of tribulation.\n \n 1923 - is taking place now, before the tribulation.\n \n 1995 - will take place after the tribulation.27\n \n http://www.irr.org/English-JW/jwfacten.html\n \n \n \n This is on top of the failed predictions about the end of the world, based on the Bible.\n \n \n \n Check out the debates in the \"Who is Jesus\" thread.\n \n \nI think you need to start a new thread to discuss where exactly you think we have re-written the Bible\n\n Not at all. I gave you a comprehensive list from Biblical sources that prove the Trinity. You don't believe in a Trinity therefore you misunderstand the Bible. I even gave evidence from Early Christian writers - so even as the church progressed, peoples such as St. Ignatius of Antioch understood it. Later to sum up the idea, they coined the word 'Trinity'.\n \n \nI have a question;\n Do you believe the God who authored the Bible to be more authoritive than those that interpret it? I mean you seem to quote alot of outsiders to bolster your argument, is that because you realise that your doctrine is not found in the scriptures? Just curious.\n \n LF,\n\n \n I believe that man wrote the Bible but was inspired, and guided by the Holy Spirit. No where does it say that the Bible should be supreme. I believe that the church that compiled the Bible - and used it in conjunction with other Christian writings is supreme as it put together the Bible - unless you believe the Bible fell from heaven fully written.\n \n They weren't 'outsiders'. They were men from the living church - just as you read writings by Charles T Russell and his followers within the framework of your church. However, mine were more qualified to write - as they understood what they were talking about. C T Russell didn't even understand Greek, yet claimed to base JW beliefs on his translations of ancient texts.\n \n Again, as to 'outsiders'; Jesus taught St. Peter. St. Peter in turn taught St. Ignatius of Antioch - from whom I quoted. There is a direct link passed down to him.\n \n I note too that besides this, you didn't even address any of the Biblical texts.",

You have to ignore a lot of the Bible for this one. \n \n Similarities between the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Pharisees: Both deny the Trinity and the Deity of Christ\n Both deny the physical resurrection of Christ and salvation by grace alone.\n \n My thanks to the following sites...\n \n http://www.gksa.org.za/evangelisasie/jwe.htm#hg\n http://www.carm.org/jw/jwresponse.htm\n http://www.equip.org/free/DJ535.htm\n \n \n \n Recall about adding or subtracting from the Bible?\n Col. 1:15-17 in the Jehovah's Witness Bible has an addition of four words. Their version reads, ?He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All [other] things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist,? (Their word ?[other]? is in their Bible with the brackets. They maintain that they know it isn't in the original Greek Scriptures but the word is implied and should be there.)\n Instead of refuting the bad translation, simply ask them if this means that Jesus created everything. They will say yes. Review this and be very clear and get them to admit that it was Jesus who created everything. Then turn to... Isaiah 44:24 ?This is what the LORD says -your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.?\n If Jesus created everything, then why does it say that the Lord (Jehovah in the Hebrew) did it by Himself?\n The only answer is that Jehovah is not simply the name of the Father, but that it is the name of God the Trinity. Therefore, since Jesus is God in flesh, it could be said that Jesus created all things and that Jehovah did it alone.\n Ibid\n \n \n Here are a ?few? passages of the Bible JW?s have to ignore in relation to death...\n \n The Bible teaches a conscious continued existence after death: Stephen prays to Jesus to receive his spirit (Acts 7: 56, 59).\n Paul desires to depart and be with Christ (Phil. 1:23).\n When we leave our earth, we will live with God (2 Cor.. 5:6, 9).\n Abraham, Isaac and Jacob live in Jesus? time (Luke 20:37, 38).\n Moses and Elijah appear to Jesus [after their deaths](Matt. 17).\n The souls of people talk and wear clothes (Rev. 6:9-11).\n Who believes in Jesus will live, even though he dies (John 11:25, 26).\n Death is without sting and has been conquered by Christ (1 Cor.. 15:55-57).\n Death cannot separate the believer from God (Rom. 8:38, 39) \n The enemies of God are consumed by a raging fire (Heb.. 10:26-31)\n \n A ?real? hell\n Jesus calls the eternal punishment (Matt. 25:46). The following passages of Scripture emphasize the hell as a terrible place of punishment for the unbelievers: Daniel 12:2; Matthew 5:22; 8:12; Mark 9:42-49; John 3:36; Hebrews 10:31, 32; Revelation 19, 20; 20:12-15; 21:8.In these passages God very clearly teaches us that as opposed to eternal life (in the glory of God), there is eternal death which will last forever, will be terrible, will burn day and night over all the wicked (those who do not believe in Him and obey Him). This is an eternal punishment - forever dreadful.\n The enemies of God are consumed by a raging fire (Heb.. 10:26-31).",

   "OK, let's see who is guilty of deception shall we Montalban, I will quote the website you gave (http://www.gdcoc.org/religiousgroups/jehovahwit.htm) and then I'll show how they are SO dishonest that they even have to contradict themselves; \n \nCharles Taze Russell?s Fraud:\n It is well to note that the man who started this cult was, according to record, a fraud and as dishonest as they come.\n\n I'll repeat this amusing statement at the end.\n \n When Mr. Russell was asked in Court to answer under oath the question, ?Do you know Greek?,? he answered, ?Oh, yes.?\n\n Well no, that just isn't true, is it? Lets find out...\n \nQuestion: (Attorney Staunton) \"Do you know the Greek Alphabet?\"\n Answer: (Russell) \"Oh yes.\"\n\n Does it, or does it not state, that what he actually said was that he knew the Greek alphabet? He was never asked; \"Do you know Greek\" big difference.\n If you knew only the Alphabet of English, would that qualify you to read and write the English language?\n \nThey then handed him a copy of the New Testament in Greek and they asked him to read even the letters of the alphabet and he could not do it.\n\n Again, very misleading, lets see why...\n \n Question: (Staunton) \"Can you tell me the correct letters if you see them?\"\n Answer: (Russell) \"Some of them, I might make a mistake on some of them.\"\n Question: (Staunton) \"Would you tell me the names of those on top of the page, page 447 I have got here?\"\n Answer: (Russell) \"Well, I don't know that I would be able to.\"\n Question: (Staunton) \"You can't tell what those letters are, look at them and see if you know?\"\n Answer: (Russell) \"My way ...\" [he was interrupted at this point and not allowed to explain]\n\n If it's not already clear to the impartial reader what is wrong with this whole thing, it's simply that, Charles Taze Russell never lied in court, when asked to read names in Greek he truthfully said \"Well, I don't know that I would be able to\", and then when unnecessarily pressed on what the actual letters were, he was interrupted and couldn't give a full answer. Wonder why!\n \nHe was then asked by the Attorney, ?Now are you familiar with the Greek language?? He was then forced to admit that he didn?t know it. It is clearly seen that this cult was started by a hypocrite who declared under oath that he knew Greek, but it was proven that he didn?t know a Greek letter from a chicken track. \n\n \nQuestion: (Staunton) \"Are you familiar with the Greek language?\"\n Answer: (Russell) \"No.\"\n\n He wasn't forced to admit anything, he would have given this very same answer at the outset to this specific question, but he wasn't asked this at the outset, was he? He was asked if he knew the Greek alphabet, which is a far cry from knowing an entire language, is it not?\n --- \"It's is well to note that man who started this cult was, according to record, a fraud and as dishonest as they come\"-Really? Who really is \"dishonest as they come\" in this case Montalban?\n Why does this website feel the dire need to mislead people in this way? They've even got you believing them Montalban, Do you consider yourself to be easily led?\n \nAccording to record, when his wife sued him for divorce because of his improper relationship with one Rose Ball, he denied the truth most violently until cornered and forced to admit it. \n\n Once again, Montalban I have to ask you for the source of this information, because all you have done is quote someone else who's now in the same boat as you and has provided NO proper quotes. I'm waiting.\n \n \nTo fraud his wife, according to record, he transferred $617,000 to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society and corporations over which he himself had complete control. These are just a few things about the man who started the so-called Jehovah?s Witnesses, to show that the founder of this cult was a fraud and a hypocrite. After the death of this man, which took place November 9, 1916, the ex-judge J. F. Rutherford became the leader of the cult. He was the author of a number of books among which was one entitled ?Millions Now Living That Will Never Die.? Somehow the Judge was not in that number, for he passed away to his reward a number of years ago in San Diego, California. The Judge preached his unfounded theories over the radio for a. while, and in books, recordings and trained workers, his human theories went from door to door.\n \n http://www.gdcoc.org/religiousgroups/jehovahwit.htm\n\n What record? This is now where you provide this mysterious record.\n I'm going to give you a list of references that I need to see to determine if this website has got it's story straight. You have to admit though; it hasn't got off to a very good start has it?\n \n 1) where is the record that his wife sued him for divorce after an \"improper relationship\"?\n 2) Where is the record that he became violent as a result?\n 3) Where is the record that he transferred $617,000 to the Watchtower bible and Tract Society in order to fraud his wife?\n This should be good.\n \nThere was his ?miracle wheat?\n \n http://www.watchman.org/jw/jwwheat.htm\n\n Again, a complete, and probably deliberate lack of proper quotes, it's all written to mislead those that enjoy hearing the worst about Charles Taze Russell. Quotes please Mont.\n \n \nThey put this in a light-hearted way at:\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/2919/fbi.html\n\n Would you consider it \"light-hearted\" if someone accused you of Child molestation and was unable, unwilling or simply didn't want to prove it anyway? But instead just said things to make you look bad. Shall I ask everyone on this forum if they know your home address because I know for fact that you are a paedophile, shall I? That would be a laugh wouldn't it?\n \n Anyway thanks again for proving your religion false and mine true - Revelation 12:10 === John 17:14,\n \n \nThe idea of Charles T Russell?s knowledge of Greek (or actually, lack of knowledge) is all important to know because he based all his beliefs on claims that he understood the original texts, when in fact he couldn?t understand them. (see also http://www.watchman.org/jw/jwcourt.htm)\n\n As I've shown you Montalban he never claimed to be able to understand the original texts, sorry, wrong again!\n \n \nHere is the JW spin\"A Presbyterian Minister from Ontario, Canada, slandered Pastor Russell in a widely published booklet. Pastor Russell was advised that the best way to deal with this was to take him to court. During the court proceedings Pastor Russell was asked if he knew the Greek alphabet.

Or if you couldn't, would you just say that you might make some mistakes. It's simply honesty Mont.\n \n \nI think though your argument will be based on the fact that he was not actually 'convicted' of perjury. Another spin - because quite clearly he made one claim in court - and then changed it.\n\n LOL, He wasn't in court for perjury was he Montalban. So how could my argument be that he was never convicted? Did you even read those website cut'n'pastes?\n Nonetheless, a quote from your opening post reads;\n ---Montalban---<\"Depends on what you call \"kind\" because I've debated two other JWs on this forum in the past and they didn't take kindly to the fact I pointed out that the founder of your beliefs was a man convited of fraud. One who also claimed to be able to read ancient Greek - (from which he further claimed to have got to the true translation/meaning of the New Testament) - but later, in court withdrew this claim under qustioning - he was asked to read from a New Testament in Greek - and he couldn't. He couldn't even tell people which letters were which.\"---\n Do you still hold to this dishonest text Mont? Yes or No? I will ask this simple question again Montalban, so it's probably a good idea to answer it in your next post.\n \n He made a claim in court and was unable to back it up, fact!\n\n Correct, he was interrupted so he couldn't finish his answer, FACT, only my FACTS are with a bit more detail, are they not? \n \nHence he?d not be able to understand Greek rules.\n See ?It's Greek To Me! Grammar Rule Supports Christ's Deity?\n \n http://www.watchman.org/jw/greekfeb.htm\n\n Good job he never translated a Bible then isn't it? Do you still mistakenly assert that this is what he did? (Translate a bible a mean, or will we now all see some back-pedalling from Montalban?) This is funny!\n \n \nWhat other mistakes have been made in interpretations? (or rather, he changed his mind a number of times on certain issues?)\n \n Resurrection of the Men of Sodom\n \n 1879 - They will be resurrected.\n \n 1952 - They will not be resurrected.\n \n 1965 - They will be resurrected.\n \n 1988 - They will not be resurrected.24\n \n \n \n The 'Lord' in Romans 10:12-16\n \n 1903 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n \n 1940 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.\n \n 1978 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n \n 1980 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.25\n \n \n \n 'Higher Powers' of Romans 13:1\n \n 1916 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.\n \n 1943 - 'Higher powers' refers to Jehovah God & Jesus Christ.\n \n 1964 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.26\n \n \n \n Separating 'sheep and goats' (Matt. 25:31-46)\n \n 1919 - will take place after the time of tribulation.\n \n 1923 - is taking place now, before the tribulation.\n \n 1995 - will take place after the tribulation.27\n \n http://www.irr.org/English-JW/jwfacten.html\n\n How can Charles Taze Russell have \"changed his mind\" regarding watchtower magazines that were printed 150 years or so after he was born?\n Can you quote these Watchtower Magazines in full Montalban as I don't have access to them all, so neither myself, or the impartial reader, knows if you're telling the truth, and lets face it Mont, from what has already been discussed I wouldn't blame them! LOL. emoticon_emb \n \n As for the rest of your post, no. #9, I'm going to start a new thread as I'd like to, if I may, keep this one for the relentless accusations directed at members, the organization or those who take the lead among us, as I feel a discussion of Jehovah's Witnesses, in general, would lead to a massive thread which generally tend to put others off from posting their opinions about us, and jump from one issue to the other.\n Before I posted this I also notice you have added another post no #10, which I will also respond to shortly in a new thread.\n But it seems so far Mont, that you have failed to present the impartial reader with an accurate account of what was said, but instead seem to rely on website owners that you don't even know, very weak Mont! You have even failed to give sufficient evidence for your assertions which is laughable to say the least. I'll leave this with you and I hope to respond to your other points in new threads tomorrow as i've got a heck of alot on at the mo' with work and stuff.\n \n LF,",

Charles Russell. He minced no words in his denunciation of Russell, his qualifications as a minister, and his moral example. Russell took him to court and tried to prove that it wasn?t true. But he lost the case and was shown to be a perjurer in court as he lied and the transcripts of the court case still remain.\"\n http://www.bethanybaptist.org.au/jw.htm\n \n \n--- ?It?s is well to note that man who started this cult was, according to record, a fraud and as dishonest as they come??Really?

They?ve even got you believing them Montalban, Do you consider yourself to be easily led?\n\n \n You don't even realise that he declared one thing in court, under oath, then reversed this. Is this the dealings of an honest man; lying under oath? How do you think he arrived at the new translations of Scripture? That is why Russell lost his case!\n \n You are in a bit of a logical bind. If Pastor Russell couldn't read the ancient Greek, then how was he able to ascertain that his version of Scripture was more accurate than any others? (Considering the amount of differences you have in belief as opposed to the majority of Christendom.) Where did he get his revelations from?\n \n Why do you re-work things. He says he knows the alphabet, then he admits he doesn't. He lied under oath in a court of law. That is what perjury is - though he may not have been convicted of it. He was forced to admit he didn't even know the basics of a language.\n http://www.watchman.org/jw/greekfeb.htm \n \"This was not always the view of the Watchtower organization. For example in \"Zion?s Watch Tower\" April,15 1893 Pastor Charles Taze Russell translated Jn.1:1 as \"In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.\" These all refer to God with a capitol G while today?s Watchtower refers to him with a little g obviously the new J.W. disagrees with their founder and restorer of the true organization of God.\"\n http://www.letusreason.org/JW13.htm\n \n \nGood job he never translated a Bible then isn?t it? Do you still mistakenly assert that this is what he did? (Translate a bible a mean, or will we now all see some back-pedalling from Montalban?) This is funny!\n\n \n I have shown you verses of the Bible that have been re-worked.\n Here's another...\n We find the Bible contradicts the Watchtower interpretation in Isa.44:24 \"I am the Lord who makes all things?\" Isa.45:11 \"I have made the earth and created man on it I my hands have stretched out the heavens.\"Isa.45:18 \"For thus says the Lord who created the heavens, who is God, who formed the earth and made it.\"(see also Isa.40:28, 42:5)\n http://www.letusreason.org/JW13.htm\n \"The Nature of God. The Bible teaches that there is only one true God (Isa.43:10-11; 44:6,8). Father, Son and Holy Spirit are identified as distinct Persons within the one Triune Godhead (Matt.3:16-17; 2 Cor.13:14). Throughout the New Testament the Son and the Holy Spirit, as well as the Father are separately identified as God.

Ask them questions like Montalban is asking me, ask them to prove from the Bible that God will turn the world you live in into a place where there is total peace, ask them when this will happen, ask them how they know this will happen.\n \n JW's are a peace loving religion (proven by action) who do not wish to cause you discomfort, but firmly believe that what they are teaching is the truth.\n \n LF,\n btw, I have AC/DC cd's at home, perhaps I should play them when the bills come in, see if they go away! emoticon_idea emoticon_smile",

He was never asked; ?Do you know Greek? big difference.\n If you knew only the Alphabet of English, would that qualify you to read and write the English language?\n\n Firstly... he affirms that he knows the Greek alphabet... with an unequivocal \"Oh, yes!\" Later when asked to read particular letters its then he has to face the truth that he didn't.\n\n Fantastic twist Mont, as I shown he was interrupted and unable to give an answer, is this not the truth of the matter?\n \nYou miss one important fact, Pastor Russell lost his case for defamation!\n \"In 1912 Pastor J Ross of James St. Baptist church in Ontario published a pamphlet called, ?Some facts about the Self-Styled ?Pastor? Charles Russell. He minced no words in his denunciation of Russell, his qualifications as a minister, and his moral example. Russell took him to court and tried to prove that it wasn?t true. But he lost the case and was shown to be a perjurer in court as he lied and the transcripts of the court case still remain.\"\n http://www.bethanybaptist.org.au/jw.htm \n\n Again, I'll say I have just proven that he didn't lie in court, as he didn't have a proper opportunity to prove himself, FACT.\n When I read the above cut 'n' paste I thought that you might be presenting everyone with more transcripts from the court case, but you haven't and insist on repeating an accusation that has been proven false, if you feel that he lied then please show everyone using the transcripts from the court case.\n \n \nYou don't even realise that he declared one thing in court, under oath, then reversed this. Is this the dealings of an honest man; lying under oath? How do you think he arrived at the new translations of Scripture? That is why Russell lost his case!\n\n emoticon_smile LOL, still the bearing of false witness continues, every question he was asked was answered truthfully.\n Do you know the alphabet? ---\"Yes\",\n Do you know the language? ---\"No\",\n It's very simple Montalban.\n What new translations of scripture is he supposed to have arrived at? It is a historic fact that he used, for the most part, the King James Version in his preaching and teaching.\n \nYou are in a bit of a logical bind. If Pastor Russell couldn't read the ancient Greek, then how was he able to ascertain that his version of Scripture was more accurate than any others? (Considering the amount of differences you have in belief as opposed to the majority of Christendom.) Where did he get his revelations from?\n\n What versions of scripture? The 'New World Translation' (Jehovah's Witness Bible), wasn't published until the 1950's, a long time after his death. Now if that's not a \"logical bind\" Mont then I don't know what is. BTW, he didn't get any \"revelations\".\n \nWhy do you re-work things. He says he knows the alphabet, then he admits he doesn't. He lied under oath in a court of law. That is what perjury is - though he may not have been convicted of it. He was forced to admit he didn't even know the basics of a language.\n http://www.watchman.org/jw/greekfeb.htm \n\n You call it \"re-working\"; I call it explaining truthfully what was said.\n He DIDN'T admit that he didn't know the Greek alphabet, because when asked what the letters were, he was NOT ALLOWED to answer. You are the one who has to do a lot of \"re-working\" to make your accusations sound valid, and that is the truth of the matter Mont.\n \n\"This was not always the view of the Watchtower organization. For example in \"Zion?s Watch Tower\" April,15 1893 Pastor Charles Taze Russell translated Jn.1:1 as \"In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.\" These all refer to God with a capitol G while today?s Watchtower refers to him with a little g obviously the new J.W. disagrees with their founder and restorer of the true organization of God.\"\n http://www.letusreason.org/JW13.htm\n\n Again this website fails to quote the watchtower in context so can you please see if you can find it anywhere, otherwise your evidence is invalid as it doesn't prove a single thing either way. You can make a watchtower magazine say anything you want if you only quote little snippets.\n Anyway, I and all other JW's have no problem with a translation such as this because, if you understand the Greek, then it's plain to see that this verse is not saying that Jesus is the Almighty God who he is said to be \"with\", but just simply expresses his authority.\n \n\n Good job he never translated a Bible then isn?t it? Do you still mistakenly assert that this is what he did? (Translate a bible a mean, or will we now all see some back-pedalling from Montalban?) This is funny!\n\n I have shown you verses of the Bible that have been re-worked.\n Here's another...\n\n Why side step this question with a Red Herring Montalban? Did Charles Taze Russell translate a Bible, yes or no? \n \nWe find the Bible contradicts the Watchtower interpretation in Isa.44:24 \"I am the Lord who makes all things?\" Isa.45:11 \"I have made the earth and created man on it I my hands have stretched out the heavens.\"Isa.45:18 \"For thus says the Lord who created the heavens, who is God, who formed the earth and made it.\"(see also Isa.40:28, 42:5)\n http://www.letusreason.org/JW13.htm\n\n I fail to see how this is supposed to contradict the Watchtower.\n \n\"The Nature of God. The Bible teaches that there is only one true God (Isa.43:10-11; 44:6,8). Father, Son and Holy Spirit are identified as distinct Persons within the one Triune Godhead (Matt.3:16-17; 2 Cor.13:14). Throughout the New Testament the Son and the Holy Spirit, as well as the Father are separately identified as God. Each has divine attributes and acts as God (Son: Mark 2:5-12; John 20:28; Heb. l :8; Holy Spirit: Acts 5:3-4; 2 Cor. 3:17-18).\n \n By contrast, the WTB&TS denies the triune nature of God and teaches that such a belief is inspired by Satan and teaches that Jehovah, the name of the one true God, corresponds only to God the Father. JWs also deny that Jesus is God (see next point). They deny the Holy Spirit is a person, and instead teach he is merely God's active force, similar to electricity.\"\n http://cnview.com/on_line_resources...s_witnesses.htm\n \n There are further examples at\n http://www.jehovahswitnesstruth.com/luke23_43.htm\n and\n http://www.bethanybaptist.org.au/jw.htm\n The faulty translating still continues\n http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/ripoff4377.htm\n \n You re-work the Bible to ignore the divinity of Jesus Christ (as part of the Trinity), to acknowledge the person of the Holy Spirit etc.\n\n As I said in my last post I'll deal with doctrine in another thread, you seemed to have ignored that, so now by entering this it seems clear that all you are doing is trying to distract the impartial readers attention by committing the fallacy of \"many Questions\"\n Personally I'm looking forward to discussing doctrine with you, I can't wait, but as I said before you'd put off anyone else from posting if you make this thread to broad.\n Before I tidy my house, I'll pick up all the rubbish! emoticon_xgood \n \nThis list of changes of interpretation remains.

If you were in a court of law and said to the judge that you have evidence that will help the case, but then only provide a reference to it, the judge will undoubtedly ask for you to look up the reference, correct? \n \nThere's a heap of material for you to work your way through. Take your time, you've not even begun to address all the changes to the Bible doctrines that you've made.\n\n There have been changes of doctrine, correct! But probably not where you're suggesting. emoticon_ic \n \n Some points that were ignored from my last post;\n \n 1) Where is the record that his (Charles Taze Russell) wife sued him for divorce after an \"improper relationship\"?\n 2) Where is the record that he became violent as a result?\n 3) Where is the record that he transferred $617,000 to the Watchtower bible and Tract Society in order to fraud his wife?\n \n You are the one who makes these assertions Mont, so surely you must be able to back them up, or can we confidently say that Montalban bears a false witness?\n \n \n There was his ?miracle wheat?\n \n http://www.watchman.org/jw/jwwheat.htm\n\n Again, a complete, and probably deliberate lack of proper quotes, it's all written to mislead those that enjoy hearing the worst about Charles Taze Russell. Quotes please Mont.\n\n Still no quotes Montalban, perhaps you should try sending this website an email to see if even they know what was reported or even if they know what they are talking about.\n \nThey put this in a light-hearted way at:\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/2919/fbi.html\n\n Would you consider it \"light-hearted\" if someone accused you of Child molestation and was unable, unwilling or simply didn't want to prove it anyway? But instead just said things to make you look bad. Shall I ask everyone on this forum if they know your home address because I know for fact that you are a paedophile, shall I? That would be a laugh wouldn't it?\n\n You have failed to address any of my questions here Montalban! I'm waiting for an answer. IS it light-hearted to accuse someone of child molestation without proper grounds?\n \nLOL, He wasn't in court for perjury was he Montalban. So how could my argument be that he was never convicted? Did you even read those website cut'n'pastes?\n Nonetheless, a quote from your opening post reads;\n ---Montalban---<\"Depends on what you call \"kind\" because I've debated two other JWs on this forum in the past and they didn't take kindly to the fact I pointed out that the founder of your beliefs was a man convited of fraud. One who also claimed to be able to read ancient Greek - (from which he further claimed to have got to the true translation/meaning of the New Testament) - but later, in court withdrew this claim under qustioning - he was asked to read from a New Testament in Greek - and he couldn't. He couldn't even tell people which letters were which.\"---\n\n Do you still hold to this dishonest text Mont? Yes or No? I will ask this simple question again Montalban, so it's probably a good idea to answer it in your next post.\n\n You have demonstrated a total failure to answer the above question Montalban. Here they are again broken down;\n 1) Was Charles Taze Russell a man who was \"convicted of fraud\"?\n 2) Did Charles Taze Russell ever claim to be able to read ancient Greek?\n 3) Why was Charles Taze Russell unable to read \"even the letters\" of the Greek language in this court case?\n 4) Did he have a full and fair chance to answer all the questions asked?\n \n I promise you Montalban, we will move onto doctrine shortly, but at the moment I would like to stick with this subject.\n \n LF,",

But how can we trust our eternal destiny to an organization that during its brief time in existence has accumulated such a woeful history of doctrinal contradictions and flip-flops? Consider the following examples of ever-changing Watchtower theology.\n \n In 1975 the WTB&TS taught that the man who sows the seed in the parable of the mustard seed (Matthew 13) is Satan.

So would yours.\n\n I think we'd all prefer some honesty, if we had more of that then web-sites like the ones Montalban is copying would go out of business. To say that Charles Taze Russell couldn't answer a question because of a lack of knowledge, when in reality he was not allowed to answer the question, is in my mind vey dishonest.\n There is examples of this with other court cases of JW's on the net that do pretty much the same thing, when in reality it's all blown out of proportion. \n \n LF,",

   "[QUOTE=Montalban] \"Yes\" is what he said to the question on the Alphabet. Then later, when pressed, he reversed this and admitted he didn't know it. He lied. \n [quote=LogicalFallacy]Incorrect! All you have to do is show me where, in that short transcript, that this was the case, then you have proven me wrong. I?m waiting! \n So, when the lawyer asks him \"Do you know the Greek?\" and Russell says \"Yes\", the lawyer was referring to a person who was Greek? Your own cites say that Russell said 'yes'. But again you just keep insisting it's not there!\n \n If he used the KJV then how is it he derived from it a number of meanings unknown to the vast body of Christianity? Is it because he was God's chosen conduit? \n\n \nThere are many denominations in the world that use the same Bibles that are very different in their beliefs. If he didn?t use the KJV then what Bible did he use?\n\n How did he get so many new and strange doctrines? I respond like this because when I post something you just say it doesn't exist. I need you then to figure things out for yourself. As before, with 'do you know Greek?' what do you think was 'Greek'?\n \nThat is not my problem. You asked previously to put in the sources of those magazines. I did that. Now the problem is you want someone to actually show you these in front of your face, and even then you'd smell the pages for fresh ink! \n\n \n I did not ask you to put in the references for these allegations, I asked you to quote the actual magazines as neither myself or the impartial reader has access to them. This seems to have upset you somewhat Montalban, and for that I am sorry, but you must understand that your allegations cannot be verified until you provide some proof that we can all read. It?s simple Mont, quote the mags or we all laugh at your elusive argument.\n\n Let's look at this history.\n I made an allegation about changes in JW policy.\n You wanted to know the sources\n I cited the web-site.\n You wanted to know the magazines\n I cited the editions\n Now you want the quotes from the magazines.\n As I said, you're just going to keep doing this. Even when in post #23 I give direct quotes from those magazines you said\n \n It's not lawful to \"quote\" someone without actually quoting the source.\n\n So regardless of the evidence, you just insist that it doesn't exist.\n \nAlso it is your problem Mont, as you are the one with the assertion, so it?s up to you to be in full knowledge of your argument, not me. \n\n No, the problem is trying to argue in a way for you to understand your way through this. We know that Ross accused Russell of making things up based on his non-knowledge of ancient languages. We know Russell took him to court for defamation and lost.\n \n \n Oops! Zero quotes once again. \n \n \nObviously you don't know what the \" symbol is, \n\n \nConfused, but anyway, here?s what you posted originally;\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Montalban\n \"The WT Society claims to be Jehovah's organization and God's only channel of spiritual instruction for today.21*The Watchtower, October 1, 1967, p. 590) It stresses that the Bible is an \"organizational book\" and cannot be understood by individuals no matter how sincere they are. But how can we trust our eternal destiny to an organization that during its brief time in existence has accumulated such a woeful history of doctrinal contradictions and flip-flops? Consider the following examples of ever-changing Watchtower theology.\n\n What and that's not a quote? It's quoted from a web-site with a source given at the bottom. But then again, even references you simply say don't exist. Quotes don't exist. etc\n \nnor the fact I referenced this too ... \n Man's Salvation Out Of World Distress. . . (1975), p. 208; The Watchtower, October 1, 1975, p. 600.) \n\n \nI'm aware of your references Mont and have read the mags, but unfortunately for you they don't actually say anything of the sort.\n Still waiting for you to back up your claims Mont, can you, or can you not?\n\n I think that you and Mizmaxx have hit upon the perfect way of debating. Just denial.\n \nAs I?ve said to you before Mont, it?s a good job he didn?t translate a Bible then. My problem is not with the FACT that he new comparatively little of these dead languages, but with the constant slandering of a man which is unwarranted and un-Christian. \n\n It's not slander. It was proven in court not to be slander. That's the test for slander in western society - trial.\n \n I pointed these out previously...\n you believe\n a) no Trinity\n b) Jesus as a separate God created by God.\n c) the return of Jesus in 1914\n d) no hell\n etc. \n\n \nThat?s right Mont.\n\n Be careful, this is the first admission to something. So you've still got to work out from your illogical claim that he picked up a normal KJV and got meanings out of it that run contrary to Christian thought for 1,800 years.\n \nI promise you Montalban, we will move onto doctrine shortly, but at the moment I would like to stick with this subject.\n LF, \n\n Why? You just say \"No it's not\"\n \nAny evidence I bring forward now is moot, because regardless of it being primary or secondary, you're still going to say that you don't personally have it in front of you, therefore it does not exist. \n\n \nNo Montalban, if you want to convince someone that your right, who doesn?t have the magazines to look at, then it?s simple logic, you must quote them directly. \n\n Unfortunately, this is exactly what you've done. Even direct quotes from the magazines you deny.\n \nAnyway, according to the above that is not what I asked evidence for. \n I think all this is simply because you can?t argue that Russell was convicted of fraud, you also can?t argue that Russell claimed to read Greek, or that he was unable to read even the letters, and you can?t argue that he had a full and fair chance to answer the questions, because he simply didn?t, did he?\n LF,\n\n I think you are in total denial.",

   "Now that we've got the issue of Pastor Russell lying in court out of the way, LF, we can move onto the dogmatic differences between your sect, and those set out in the Bible, and the current of Christian thought.\n \n Particularly, I'd like to look at the Trinity.\n Proofs for a Trinity\n \n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held.\n \n Jesus and God are united\n Ignatius' Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n They are one\n I John 5:7\n \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n \n Jesus said John 10:38\n But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" \n \n They are of one accord\n John 5:21\n For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. \n \n Jesus is equal to God\n Colossians 1:19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n Jesus has the power and wisdom of God\n 1 Cor 1:24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Jesus is eternal like God\n Hebrews 13:8 \n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.\n \n \n Jesus Himself commanded\n Matthew 28:19\n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\n In this passage, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are said to share one name (notice that the term \"name\" is singular, not plural), and that name is almost certainly Yahweh, the personal name of God in the Bible. We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. \n \n Peter tells us, \"David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is \"the Lord\" who speaks to \"my Lord,\" Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, \"Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. \n \n In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: \"[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\" This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: \"I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? \" Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will \"confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh.\" The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). \n \n Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh (\"I AM,\" in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\" His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. \"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple\" (John 8:59). \n \n With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. \n \n The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp\n \n \n Ignatius...\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n God and Jesus, Jesus and God. He says Jesus is the only Son of God, no mention that Satan is a co-creation equal to Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God, He is also God.\n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n That is, unity of the community, of the church, of Christ with God.\n \n But also 'three' comes up so many times,\n Further in his Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 19\n 19:1 And hidden from the prince of this world were the virginity of Mary and her child-bearing and likewise also the death of the Lord -- three mysteries to be cried aloud -- the which were wrought in the silence of God.\n Ibid\n \"The episkopoi's immediate subordinates were the `presbyteroi' and the `diakonoi' who together with him constituted the higher Kleroi, a trinity if you will: the Father (episkopos), Son (diakonos) and spirit-filled apostolic council (presbyteroi)\"\n http://www.thecosmiccontext.de/chri.../Ignatius1.html\n As stated earlier, the organisation of the Church reflected the triune nature of God. One Church, three offices of clergy.\n \n This reflects the passages in Scripture that say that Jesus was with the fullness of God, that is, they are united, and they are equal.\n 1 Cor 1\n 24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Which is why Jesus Himself commanded\n \n Thus the Didache* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...\n 7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.\n 7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise {in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit} in living (running) water.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The ball's in your court, LF.\n __________________ emoticon_xbye",

   "Greetings to LogicalFallacy, Montalban, Anastasia and All:\n \n Terral's opening comments << Only one side can be right in any debate over opposing views. And there is the distinct possibility that both sides are in error. In reading the posts on this thread, I am wondering which side is more wrong. For example: montalban quotes Hebrews 13:8 to prove the trinity, \"Jesus Christ {is} the same yesterday and today and forever.\" While I also believe that Scripture teaches the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as One (1John 5:8). Scripture does so in places like where Christ commands to the Twelve. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" Matt. 28:19. \n \n Fallacy on the other hand says << \"I have read the opening post and saw that there were many areas of dispute, so I would ask please if we could discuss one thing at a time as this seems to get answers across in a more audible manner.\" \n \n Terral << He then responds to Montalban by cutting and pasting well over 7000 characters (07-22-2004, 03:44PM) with this question, \"I have a question; Do you believe the God who authored the Bible to be more authoritive than those that interpret it? I mean you seem to quote alot of outsiders to bolster your argument, is that because you realise that your doctrine is not found in the scriptures? Just curious.\"\n \n If you want to consider one thing at a time, please cut and paste one of montalban's points and give us your reply using Scripture. I also hold the opinion that those from the Catholic denomination quote outside of the Bible, because many of their doctrines are not contained within the Holy Text. Since we are debating in a 'Bible Doctrines' forum, please try to support your arguments from the 66 books of our Bible. Holding to that guideline, there is almost nothing contained in these messages to debate, except for the Trinity Doctrine itself.\n \n Montalban writes << JWs have to ignore a lot of the Bible \n \n Terral's reply << We agree, but the Catholics are no better. Holy Scripture shows Peter still going to the circumcised (Israel) twenty years after the crucifixion. \"And recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we {might} {go} to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.\" Galatians 2:7-9 (9). Paul wrote these words almost thirty years after the crucifixion, about events that took place in Acts 15. \n \n The Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome. In fact, examine the letters of Peter, John and James very carefully. None of them address the Gentiles in the first person at all. Peter is writing to Jews only, \"But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR {God's} OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" 1Peter 2:9 (OT parts in CAPS). \n \n It is the Apostle Paul who says, \"But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.\" Rom. 11:13. Paul is the steward of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:1-3 (2)), and not Peter. They have chosen the wrong apostle on which to build their Gentile church. \n \n Those holding to Catholicism will not even discuss the fact, that Paul was sent down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James twenty years after the crucifixion (Gal. 2:2), and that Peter and Paul sat on opposite sides of the table. It is from that position that Paul writes, \"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, I said to Cephas [Peter] in the presence of all, \"If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how {is it that} you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?\" Gal. 2:14 (CAPS for emphasis).\n \n Those arguing for Catholicism fail to recognize that Paul even has a separate gospel (my gospel; Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.) from what Peter preached in Matt. 10:7 or Acts 2:38. Instead, they pretend that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) is the same message as Paul's gospel (Christ crucified; 1Cor. 15:1-4). Therefore, your claim that JW's must ignore a lot of the Bible also applies to you. I will assume that montalban has never practiced being a JW at all. I was a practicing Catholic for six years, before being called to Christ. So I fully understand their positions on doctrine, and am not arguing out of ignorance.\n \n Arguments over Mr. Russell's Greek:\n \n Terral explains << I could also find myself in the same predicament as Mr. Russell having also studied the Bible in the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. Do I know the languages? Yes. Your Bible contains 5624 (not counting the common stuff; \"a, an, the, etc.\") of approximately 21,000 Greek words used 2000 years ago. Do I know it well enough to carry on a conversation? No. \n \n Working in the original manuscripts is not the same as speaking the languages. For example: The Greek for the word 'grace' is charis, and no English scholar on earth would disagree. The word is translated 'grace' exactly 83 times in the Pauline Epistles; six times in Romans chapter 5, and does not appear at all in Matthew or Mark. NASB. But this (charis) is how we see the word in our English letters. In Greek the word looks similar to this (xapiti). So an advocate of Mr. Russell could conclude that he knew the Greek, while his adversary could make a case for the opposite. Therefore, all of the points over Russell's Greek seem mute. And, arguing over whether Mr. Russell has been persecuted for his beliefs seems fruitless. After all, who among the apostles and prophets was not persecuted, and accused of far worse? \n \n Montalban wrote << The JWs predicted that space-travel was impossible...\"It was claimed in 1943, that...\n \n LogicalFallacy writes << OK, let?s see who is guilty of deception shall we Montalban.\n \n Terral's reply << Holy Cows! We certainly have a lot of time on our hands. Hopefully at some point we will circle back around to the doctrinal aspects of the debate. When the Bible was written, there was no such thing as a Catholic, JW, Mormon, Baptist, etc.. Your Bible only mentions 'Christians.' Acts 11:26. Also, being the one to compile the original manuscripts is no guarantee of knowing how to interpret them. Paul teaches that we are all members of the body of Christ. Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. \n \n Paul says, \" But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.\" 1Cor. 12:18.

   "Hi terral,\n \n I'm not comfortable with the direction your post is, in all probabilities, going to lead to. I am interested in staying on topic with JW's and if it can't be done I'll ask administration to split it off. Too much of your post is an anti-Catholic diatribe and appears to be bait which some may not be able to resist, IMO. To date, I've enjoyed the in-depth aspect of JW's faith and am hoping it can continue in that vein. \n \n You're correct that Mormonism and JW are both Christian denominations, even though both downplay Jesus' importance and attempt to insert their own human figures to positions of near-divinity. \n \n regards",

   " Greetings to LogicalFallacy, Montalban, Anastasia and All:\n Terral?s opening comments << Only one side can be right in any debate over opposing views.\n\n This is not true. You will have trouble dealing with absolutes (a statement which is itself a paradox). If I were to say \"I believe Ham & Pineapple pizza is the best\" and you disagree, one could never 'prove' one point over the other.\n \n And there is the distinct possibility that both sides are in error.\n\n Then this contradicts your opening statement of position.\n \n In reading the posts on this thread, I am wondering which side is more wrong. For example: Montalban quotes Hebrews 13:8 to prove the trinity, ?Jesus Christ {is} the same yesterday and today and forever.? While I also believe that Scripture teaches the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as One (1John 5:8). Scripture does so in places like where Christ commands to the Twelve. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.? Matt. 28:19. \n\n Yes, Logical Fallacy and JWs ignore a huge amount of teaching, even within the Bible. I am also interested in extra-biblical sources; from Holy Tradition. I could also introduce these, but we'd need to have established a ground rules for what we consider admissible evidence.\n \nFallacy on the other hand says << ?I have read the opening post and saw that there were many areas of dispute, so I would ask please if we could discuss one thing at a time as this seems to get answers across in a more audible manner.\n Terral << He then responds to Montalban by cutting and pasting well over 7000 characters (07-22-2004, 03:44PM) with this question, ?I have a question; Do you believe the God who authored the Bible to be more authoritive than those that interpret it? I mean you seem to quote alot of outsiders to bolster your argument, is that because you realise that your doctrine is not found in the scriptures? Just curious.\"\n If you want to consider one thing at a time, please cut and paste one of Montalban's points and give us your reply using Scripture. I also hold the opinion that those from the Catholic denomination quote outside of the Bible, because many of their doctrines are not contained within the Holy Text. Since we are debating in a ?Bible Doctrines? forum, please try to support your arguments from the 66 books of our Bible. Holding to that guideline, there is almost nothing contained in these messages to debate, except for the Trinity Doctrine itself.\n\n Why do we need to just quote the Bible when discussing the Bible? St.Peter's letters are contained in the Bible, but he also taught St. Ignatius of Antioch; who's letters are still true to the teachings of the Bible but are not contained within the bounded volume called the Bible.\n Martin Luther, for instance, wrote tracts where he quotes themes of the Bible.\n \nMontalban writes << JWs have to ignore a lot of the Bible \n Terral?s reply << We agree, but the Catholics are no better. Holy Scripture shows Peter still going to the circumcised (Israel) twenty years after the crucifixion. ?And recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we {might} {go} to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.? Galatians 2:7-9 (9). Paul wrote these words almost thirty years after the crucifixion, about events that took place in Acts 15. \n\n Just a thought, do you think that I'm a Roman Catholic? I'm not. I'm an Orthodox Christian. As such, I see no need to defend specifically Catholic questions, so there's no point directing these to me.\n I will however debate in favour of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession, both of which, incidentally are Biblical.\n \nThe Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome. In fact, examine the letters of Peter, John and James very carefully. None of them address the Gentiles in the first person at all. Peter is writing to Jews only, ?But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR {God's} OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.? 1Peter 2:9 (OT parts in CAPS). \n\n You need to direct this to Maxiums\n \nIt is the Apostle Paul who says, ?But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.? Rom. 11:13. Paul is the steward of this ?dispensation of God?s grace? (Eph. 3:1-3 (2)), and not Peter. They have chosen the wrong apostle on which to build their Gentile church. \n Those holding to Catholicism will not even discuss the fact, that Paul was sent down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James twenty years after the crucifixion (Gal. 2:2), and that Peter and Paul sat on opposite sides of the table. It is from that position that Paul writes, ?But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, I said to Cephas [Peter] in the presence of all, \"If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how {is it that} you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?? Gal. 2:14 (CAPS for emphasis).\n Those arguing for Catholicism fail to recognize that Paul even has a separate gospel (my gospel; Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.) from what Peter preached in Matt. 10:7 or Acts 2:38. Instead, they pretend that the ?gospel of the kingdom? (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) is the same message as Paul?s gospel (Christ crucified; 1Cor. 15:1-4). Therefore, your claim that JW?s must ignore a lot of the Bible also applies to you. I will assume that Montalban has never practiced being a JW at all. I was a practicing Catholic for six years, before being called to Christ. So I fully understand their positions on doctrine, and am not arguing out of ignorance.\n\n Same, see Maximus\n \n Arguments over Mr. Russell?s Greek:\n Terral explains << I could also find myself in the same predicament as Mr. Russell having also studied the Bible in the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. Do I know the languages? Yes. Your Bible contains 5624 (not counting the common stuff; ?a, an, the, etc.?) of approximately 21,000 Greek words used 2000 years ago. Do I know it well enough to carry on a conversation? No. \n Working in the original manuscripts is not the same as speaking the languages. For example: The Greek for the word ?grace? is charis, and no English scholar on earth would disagree. The word is translated ?grace? exactly 83 times in the Pauline Epistles; six times in Romans chapter 5, and does not appear at all in Matthew or Mark. NASB. But this (charis) is how we see the word in our English letters. In Greek the word looks similar to this (xapiti). So an advocate of Mr. Russell could conclude that he knew the Greek, while his adversary could make a case for the opposite. Therefore, all of the points over Russell?s Greek seem mute. And, arguing over whether Mr. Russell has been persecuted for his beliefs seems fruitless. After all, who among the apostles and prophets was not persecuted, and accused of far worse? \n\n Actually Russell said he didn't know the Greek - according to the JW apologists.\n \nMontalban wrote << The JWs predicted that space-travel was impossible...\"It was claimed in 1943, that...\n LogicalFallacy writes << OK, let?s see who is guilty of deception shall we Montalban.\n Terral?s reply << Holy Cows! We certainly have a lot of time on our hands. Hopefully at some point we will circle back around to the doctrinal aspects of the debate. When the Bible was written, there was no such thing as a Catholic, JW, Mormon, Baptist, etc.. Your Bible only mentions ?Christians.? Acts 11:26. Also, being the one to compile the original manuscripts is no guarantee of knowing how to interpret them. Paul teaches that we are all members of the body of Christ. Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. \n\n My point in introducing this was to show that JW teaching is resplendent with examples of ''interpretation' (in the light of Pastor Russell's example), and these lead them to make some of the silliest predictions and mistakes - it goes to the idea that you'll know the tree by the fruit it bears. And the JW fruit is poisonous.\n \n Paul says, ? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.? 1Cor. 12:18. And also, ?But now there are many members, but one body.? 1Cor. 12:20. And, ?On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.? 1Cor. 12:22. And lastly, ?Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.? 1Cor. 12:27. Therefore, if the members of both groups have heard and believe the gospel, then they are just as ?sealed in Him? (Eph. 1:13+14) as anyone else. \n\n That's your interpretation. Why does St.Paul continually urge Christian groups to unite not only in their way of faith, but in their practices? He never says \"Okay folks, you've now been saved, go work things out for yourself'. He continually urges groups/communities to watch each other.\n \nTerral?s reply << Actually, both groups (like those professing Catholicism) are denominations of Christianity, and there are well over 2000 of them. \n Terral's final comments << Our Bible is the inspired word of God. 2Tim. 3:16+17. All of those other people you two (montalban and LogicalFallacy) quote provide their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures. Please try to cut down on the emotionalism and restrict yourselves to presenting us with ?your? interpretations, that can be supported by the appropriate Bible references.\n God bless,\n Terral\n\n The Bible also mentions that people kept to non-written teachings...\n \"Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you\" (I Corinthians 11:2)\n \"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle\"\n (II Thessalonians 2:15)\n Further, there is clear evidence that not everything was written down in the first place...\n John 21:25\n Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.?\n In other words, the Bible doesn't cover everything.\n (It's the last thing written in the last Gospel)\n There's evidence for needing to be taught...\n The Ethiopian\n Acts 8\n 30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. ?Do you understand what you are reading?? Philip asked. \n 31 ?How can I,? he said, ?unless someone explains it to me?? So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. \n In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word.\n Also, the Ethiopian finds faith, but needs to be baptised (a sacrament).\n Further evidence that the acceptance of Jesus was not enough...\n Acts 10\n Cornelius the Roman soldier, finds faith in God, but needs Peter to come to his house before he receives the Holy Spirit. Faith alone was not enough.\n In fact, the very name ?Acts of the Apostles? not ?Faith of the Apostles? tells you something. If faith were alone, then the Bible would have finished at the time Christ rose into heaven; instead it goes on to show what the Apostles did; they taught, they organised, they conferred the gifts of the Holy Spirit upon people.\n \n There are problems with relying on the Scipture alone...\n If you look at Scripture you can interpret the Last Supper as\n a) merely a commandment for a commemorative meal, or\n b) as a one off occurrence, or \n c) a command to partake in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n The Sacrament of the Eucharist was established by Jesus.\n See... \n Matthew 26\n 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, ?Take and eat; this is my body.? \n \n 27 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, ?Drink from it, all of you.\n \n 28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n \n My church believes the later point. How do we determine which is true? We can look at how the early Christians themselves participated. Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" (meaning Body of Christ... It is so clear that the early Christians partook of Holy Communion...in fact, so strong was the belief, that pagans mistook the Sacrament as cannibalism (here's a Protestant site that shows this...)\n ?Christian beliefs and practices were misunderstood, with rumours spreading that they were cannibalistic (?Take and eat; this is my body broken for you? = Eucharist),?\n http://www.libertymagazine.org/arti...eview/214/1/34/\n \n Thus sometimes you need to look beyond the Bible to understand its context",

However, you are quoting the steward of this dispensation of God's grace. Paul writes, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38. Our risen Lord Christ Jesus continued to give Paul important revelations, as he writes, \"but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.\" 2Cor. 12:1. \n \n Paul spoke many times concerning that which had, \"been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested. . . ' Rom. 16:25+26. Therefore, he established traditions among the believers that previously did not exist. He writes, \"For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet {you would} not {have} many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.\" 1Cor. 4:15. \n \n Paul's authority as steward of this dispensation is no license for you to quote the words of men, and use their human interpretations to support arguments over the Word of God. But of course, you can quote from Jungle Book or Bambi for support if you wish.

Let us look at this one again: \"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for EVERY good work.\" 2Tim. 3:16+17 (Caps for emphasis). So you are saying that God's Word is profitable so that we are equipped for 'some' good works, and that is where the men with your human interpretations take over. No sir, I am not buying what you are selling. With over 2000 denominations of professing Christians, and that many ways of interpreting Scripture, a man's lifetime is not nearly long enough to examine all of them well enough to determine whether or not your humanistic approach to righteousness is sufficient. But then again, who knows? Maybe someone will be moved more by your human authors, than by Holy Scripture. \n \n Montalban << If you look at Scripture you can interpret the Last Supper as\n a) merely a commandment for a commemorative meal, or\n b) as a one off occurrence, or \n c) a command to partake in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n \n Terral's reply << Or, you might read up on what the steward of this dispensation has to say about it. Paul writes, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. I look very much forward to see how you remove the 'not' from Paul's commands to us. Let's see . . . who among your interpreters can accomplish that for you?\n \n Montalban << The Sacrament of the Eucharist was established by Jesus.\n See... Matthew 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, ?Take and eat; this is my body.? \n \n Terral's reply << The Sacrament of what?

Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" \n \n Terral's reply << Where on earth did you get that from? Didache (#1322) is a doctrine or teaching. The root of the word (didasko, #1321) means \"to teach.\" Lockman's Exhaustive Concordance. Please try again.\n \n Montalban continues << (meaning Body of Christ... It is so clear that the early Christians partook of Holy Communion...in fact, so strong was the belief, that pagans mistook the Sacrament as cannibalism (here's a Protestant site that shows this...)\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. Paul uses the phrase 'body of Christ' in Ephesians 4:12, and I am not seeing Eucharist anywhere nearby. Please try again.\n \n Montalban << Thus sometimes you need to look beyond the Bible to understand its context.\n \n Terral's reply << This is true in cases where accurate interpretation OF THE WORDS in Scripture require historical, or even traditional, references that do not appear in the Text. That is when we use outside references TO LEND SUPPORT to our original interpretation. \n \n Thank you very much for using some Scripture in your reply. I hope you will offer a reply to my posts in the Biblical Contradictions section. That should prove really interesting indeed.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

And, ?All SCRIPTURE is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.? 2Tim. 3:16+17.\n\n You take 2 TIm 3:16 differently from I.\n Look at what was written prior to 2 Tim...\n 30-60 Passion Narrative \n 50-60 1 Thessalonians \n 50-60 Philippians \n 50-60 Galatians \n 50-60 1 Corinthians \n 50-60 2 Corinthians \n 50-60 Romans \n 50-60 Philemon \n 50-80 Colossians \n 50-90 Signs Gospel \n 50-95 Book of Hebrews \n 50-120 Didache \n 50-140 Gospel of Thomas \n 50-140 Oxyrhynchus 1224 Gospel \n 50-200 Sophia of Jesus Christ \n 65-80 Gospel of Mark \n 70-100 Epistle of James \n 70-120 Egerton Gospel \n 70-160 Gospel of Peter \n 70-160 Secret Mark \n 70-200 Fayyum Fragment \n 70-200 Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs \n 73-200 Mara Bar Serapion \n 80-100 2 Thessalonians \n 80-100 Ephesians \n 80-100 Gospel of Matthew \n 80-110 1 Peter \n 80-120 Epistle of Barnabas \n 80-130 Gospel of Luke \n 80-130 Acts of the Apostles \n 80-140 1 Clement \n 80-150 Gospel of the Egyptians \n 80-150 Gospel of the Hebrews \n 80-250 Christian Sibyllines \n 90-95 Apocalypse of John \n 90-120 Gospel of John \n 90-120 1 John \n 90-120 2 John \n 90-120 3 John \n 90-120 Epistle of Jude \n 100-150 1 Timothy \n 100-150 2 Timothy\n List compiled from http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/\n Surely you're not going to say that we should consult the Gospel of the Egyptians? SO, not ALL scripture is what is meant in 2 Tim, but all APPROVED scripture.\n NOTE: Clement was written prior to, not only 2 Tim, but before the compilation of the Bible. St. Clement, like St. Ignatius was taught by St. Peter. I believe that Clement too was written with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.\n NOTE ALSO: The Didache was written earlier, too.\n Of course your obvious rebuttal is that not all of these were 'inspired' by God. I have no problem with this - as I agree - however how do you know which were inspired by God, and which were not? We have the great minds of the early church to thank for that, for giving us the authorised collection we call the Bible.\n \n You would like for the third party reader to ?have trouble dealing with absolutes,? by dirtying the water with the writings of men. If the Bible does not say what you are saying, then please refrain from trying to distort the facts.\n\n You're assuming several things including that the writings of St. Clement et al divers writers whilst being extra-biblical are anti-Biblical... they are not.\n Who APPROVED Scripture of the Bible? The Church did. Those that carried the teaching of Jesus down through St. Peter and other Apostles (hand-picked by Jesus Himself), who in turn picked men, and so on for 300 years before the Bible was compiled. They had so many books floating around (see web-site cited above) that they were, guided by the Holy Spirit, picking those books that were consistent with their traditional faith.\n As I said, we might have to first debate what is considered admissible evidence. I have no problem with accepting the Bible as presented to us by this Church, but it seems rather silly not to accept any of the other books they also offer.\n \nJust a thought, do you think that I'm a Roman Catholic? I'm not. I'm an Orthodox Christian. As such, I see no need to defend specifically Catholic questions, so there's no point directing these to me.\n\n \nThe assumption was made, because of your selection of supporting links like this from your post: \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp \n\n Okay, but I've set it for the record. I'm not Catholic. Not only Catholics believe in a Trinity. The majority of Christians do.\n \nI will however debate in favour of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession, both of which, incidentally are Biblical.\n\n \nVery good. Then you will have no problem sticking to the Bible, as support for your arguments.\n\n Is your church square or round? Where does your Pastor stand? Does your service go for an hour, or two? Do you meet on a Sunday? Why not a Monday (as well)?\n Please provide Biblical evidence to demonstrate why you answered the way you did for the above questions. Please cite the references for why your church is set out the way it is. Not everything about Christianity is set out in the Bible. Sure, the heart of Christianity is there, but a heart needs a body.\n (I did a word search of the entire Bible at www.biblegateway.com, for the word \"Sunday\". It's not there)\n \nThe Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome . . . \n\n \nYou need to direct this to Maxiums\n\n \nSo much for willingness to debate in favor of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession. Do you know the meaning of those terms? Maximus and I have gone around and around already. I was hoping you would pick up where he left off. That being said, you are most wise to refuse. \n\n I think this is quite arrogant. Why should I have to debate another person's faith? I tell you I am not Catholic. However I like a challenge. Why do you doubt the fact that Sts Peter and Paul were in Rome, simply because it's not in the Bible? I'm not in the Bible either. Not everything is. It's absolutely absurd to suggest that it should be... how many Apostles die in the Bible? Are you assuming then that those not mentioned didn't die?\n Not much of a challenge after all :)\n \nMy point in introducing this was to show that JW teaching is resplendent with examples of ''interpretation' (in the light of Pastor Russell's example), and these lead them to make some of the silliest predictions and mistakes - it goes to the idea that you'll know the tree by the fruit it bears. And the JW fruit is poisonous.\n\n \nWe agree. Although, I would have skinned the cat differently.\n\n Good for you. I am not you.\n \nOur Bible is the inspired word of God. 2Tim. 3:16+17. All of those other people you two (Montalban and LogicalFallacy) quote provide their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures. Please try to cut down on the emotionalism and restrict yourselves to presenting us with ?your? interpretations, that can be supported by the appropriate Bible references.\n\n Why should I be reliant wholly on the Bible? The majority of Christians have, for the majority of Christianity, relied on more than the Bible. The first person to come up with this novel idea (sola scriptura - Bible alone) was Martin Luther, who lived 1,500 years after the event. You need to show why, after so long a period of time, he was right to abandon every other Holy teacher.\n \nThe Bible also mentions that people kept to non-written teachings... \"Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you\" (I Corinthians 11:2) \"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle\" (II Thessalonians 2:15)\n\n \nThe Bible mentions a lot of things. However, you are quoting the steward of this dispensation of God?s grace. Paul writes, ?If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.? 1Cor. 14:37+38. Our risen Lord Christ Jesus continued to give Paul important revelations, as he writes, ?but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.? 2Cor. 12:1.\n\n So? I follow what St.Paul says in his scriptures! I also follow the writings of St.Clement, St.Ignatius as well.\n \nPaul spoke many times concerning that which had, ?been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested. . . ? Rom. 16:25+26. Therefore, he established traditions among the believers that previously did not exist. He writes, ?For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet {you would} not {have} many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.? 1Cor. 4:15.\n\n Again what's your point? Jesus started the tradition of selecting a very few to teach His Word. The Apostles passed this down - see Acts where they choose another steward to do the teaching. You simply mistake the traditions of man for those of God. Jesus didn't say do away with ALL traditions.\n \nPaul?s authority as steward of this dispensation is no license for you to quote the words of men, and use their human interpretations to support arguments over the Word of God. But of course, you can quote from Jungle Book or Bambi for support if you wish. This side of the debate will depend solely upon God?s Word.\n\n This is rather odd to say, as I don't quote Bambi or any of their ilk. I quote from people taught the traditions of God.\n \nFurther, there is clear evidence that not everything was written down in the first place... John 21:25 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.? In other words, the Bible doesn't cover everything.\n\n \nThat is indeed so, but that gives your history books no more credibility than John Smith?s or Mr. Russell?s. In this Bible Doctrine Forum, you should expect to use the Bible to support the content of your presentations. That is certainly a reasonable request.\n\n Not at all. That you accept the Bible means you accept a certain amount of books chosen from the following list:\n (The numbers on the left are for an estimated range of dating.)

They did so mainly to combat the many heresies springing up. It was therefore a book made by the Church (that Jesus had founded), for use by the Church. This same church practiced the Divine Liturgy - with the Eucharist, they had Chrismation, Baptism, etc, and other sacraments. Somehow your logic is that you decide to snap up this particular book given at a particular time, and ignore what went on before, during, and after its compilation.\n \nThere's evidence for needing to be taught...\n\n \nYou are preaching to the choir here. Little babies come into the world with empty minds my friend.\n\n \nThe Ethiopian Acts 8:30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading\"? Philip asked. 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?? So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. \n In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word. Also, the Ethiopian finds faith, but needs to be baptised (a sacrament). Further evidence that the acceptance of Jesus was not enough...\n\n \nPlease see my posts, and offer us your reply using Scripture: \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509 \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506\n \n\n a) why? Which bits are relevant, if any to the debate at hand\n b) why base things solely on the Bible? We've yet to establish this point\n Simply waving your hand to a very large corpus of works and say 'find the answer buried somewhere in there' is not worth my time.\n \nThere are problems with relying on the Scripture alone...\n\n \nOh really? Let us look at this one again: ?All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for EVERY good work.? 2Tim. 3:16+17 (Caps for emphasis). So you are saying that God?s Word is profitable so that we are equipped for ?some? good works, and that is where the men with your human interpretations take over. No sir, I am not buying what you are selling. With over 2000 denominations of professing Christians, and that many ways of interpreting Scripture, a man?s lifetime is not nearly long enough to examine all of them well enough to determine whether or not your humanistic approach to righteousness is sufficient. But then again, who knows? Maybe someone will be moved more by your human authors, than by Holy Scripture.\n\n 100,000 different Christian Churches all rely on the Scripture alone\n Baptists place emphasis on Adult Baptism.\n Church of England follow sacraments Baptists don't.\n Lutherans have sermons different from Methodists\n Charismatics allow for a wide range of emotionalism than does the Church of Scotland.\n etc. etc.\n All are following the divine Word of God, taken out of context\n In this case the context is the church that compiled the Bible in the first place.\n Of course, you can close your eyes and pretend none of the differences exist.\n \nIf you look at Scripture you can interpret the Last Supper as\n a) merely a commandment for a commemorative meal, or\n b) as a one off occurrence, or \n c) a command to partake in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n\n \nOr, you might read up on what the steward of this dispensation has to say about it. Paul writes, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20. I look very much forward to see how you remove the ?not? from Paul?s commands to us. Let's see . . . who among your interpreters can accomplish that for you?\n\n In fact the verses prove my point. Look at verse 29 especially\n The Lord's Supper \n 1 Cor 11\n 17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, 21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. \n 27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 32 When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. \n 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. \n And when I come I will give further directions.\"\n He is in fact saying that he has heard that people are coming together FOR A COMMEMORATIVE MEAL. BUT he says if you want to just eat, eat at home. He then repeats that Jesus took the Bread and Wine and said \"THIS IS MY BODY AND BLOOD\"\n Thus you simply prove my point. You took a single verse out of the Bible to build a case.\n \nThe Sacrament of the Eucharist was established by Jesus.\n\n See... Matthew 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, ?Take and eat; this is my body.? \n \nThe Sacrament of what? I find it interesting that you refuse to defend other aspects of Catholic dogma, but then present us with their unscriptural invention (Eucharist).\n\n I find it odd that you call it Catholic dogma. Catholics do it, so do Anglicans, so do Copts, so do we Orthodox. It is dogma established by Jesus, recognised by St.Paul.\n I think you've a very limited notion of Christian history.\n \nparticipated. Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" \n\n \nWhere on earth did you get that from? Didache (#1322) is a doctrine or teaching. The root of the word (didasko, #1321) means ?to teach.? Lockman?s Exhaustive Concordance. Please try again.\n\n Oh dear. Sorry. I stated it was another Christian work (by this I meant book) (called) 'the Didache\" I was not aware you were not well versed in Christian writing. I apologise.\n See http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html\n Oddly enough you are happy to search through a non-Biblical book :)\n You have a very limited and narrow view of Christianity, based on western Protestantism, and a bit of knowledge about Catholicism as you seem to think that anything that's not Protestant is \"Catholic\". There's a vast world of Orthodoxy out there. We were founded in 33 AD at Pentecost.\n \n(meaning Body of Christ... It is so clear that the early Christians partook of Holy Communion...in fact, so strong was the belief, that pagans mistook the Sacrament as cannibalism (here's a Protestant site that shows this...)\n\n \nNo sir. Paul uses the phrase ?body of Christ? in Ephesians 4:12, and I am not seeing Eucharist anywhere nearby. Please try again.\n\n This doesn't disprove my point at all. I don't even know why you raise it.\n \nThus sometimes you need to look beyond the Bible to understand its context.\n\n \nThis is true in cases where accurate interpretation OF THE WORDS in Scripture require historical, or even traditional, references that do not appear in the Text. That is when we use outside references TO LEND SUPPORT to our original interpretation.\n\n Indeed, and that's what Orthodoxy does. It uses Biblical and extra-biblical quotes to support itself. There is nothing in Orthodoxy that is anti-Biblical.\n \nThank you very much for using some Scripture in your reply. I hope you will offer a reply to my posts in the Biblical Contradictions section. That should prove really interesting indeed.\n\n One debate at a time.",

   "terral03, it seems you are sort of making an argument that is not against what I am saying.\n \n You've repeated a number of times about the greatness of God's Words in the Bible. But is that all of God's Words?\n \n Surely not? Jesus Himself was the Word made flesh, and He existed before and outside of the Bible. Therefore God's words aren't solely in one book.\n \n You are sort of making the argument akin to \"The Mona Lisa is a great painting\", but I'm saying that there's more to Leo Da Vinci than just this one work.\n \n Thus continually repeating the mantra about God's great Bible is rather odd because I accept this. What we need to do is argue\n a) is that all there is?\n b) how did it come together?\n \n I contend a) is answered by 'no' as touched upon above, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, etc are found within and without the Bible. God is all around. I think it wrong to suggest that all there is of God is in the Bible.\n \n The answer to b) is \"The Church\".\n \n I look forward to your next post, except the annoying habit you have of not using the 'quote' options provided by this forum. emoticon_idea \n Perhaps you might want to avail yourself of the technology?",

   "Hi Montalban:\n \n Montalban << Protestantism makes everyone a Pope. Catholics believe that Biblical interpretation relies on the authority of one man; the Pope. Protestants make everyone a Pope - having the same ultimate authority to interpret scripture. Orthodox view Protestants and Catholics as different sides of the same coin.\n \n Terra's reply << Thank you for making this clear. By professing to be an Orthodox Christian, you really mean Greek Orthodox. Please herd me into the non-denominational crowd, as none of the Protestants would have me. \n \n Montalban << I don't know why you raise Roman Catholicism again, I am not one of them. \n \n Terral's reply << Nor am I a Protestant.

Just go ahead and admit that you have no desire to engage me on Bible Doctrine in this forum of debate. \n \n Montalban << And, just because you state that extra-Biblical sources aren't relevant, doesn't make it so. Oddly enough you say it's okay later on, and even quote a non-Biblical source when questioning \"The Didache\". \n \n Terral's reply << Obviously they are relevant to you, and mean absolutely nothing to me. I quoted from a Bible Dictionary of the Greek language to prove 'your definition' to be errant. You and I are here to debate the Biblical Doctrine aspects, and not to redefine the Greek. Also, be very mindful of the fact each of us are here to present the opposing views. The third party reader then decides if either position has merit. Please continue to mishandle the Greek, and also to chastise me for simply quoting the Greek dictionary. \n \n Montalban << You take 2 TIm 3:16 differently from I. Look at what was written prior to 2 Tim... 30-60 Passion Narrative \n \n Terral's reply << Nothing written prior to or after Paul's Second Epistle to Timothy negates a single word of Scripture. \n \n Montalban << List compiled from http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/\n \n Terral's reply << The words of 2Tim. 2:15 are compiled from the mouth of God. \n \n Montalban << Surely you're not going to say that we should consult the Gospel of the Egyptians?

Have you heard the expression, \"Where you are is where you are at?\" It sounds really simple right? Well, you are writing on BIBLE DOCTRINE threads in the Religion section of 4forums.com. The BIBLE part refers to the source from which the DOCTRINES are taken. Clement my eye . . . \n \n Montalban << not only 2 Tim, but before the compilation of the Bible. St. Clement, like St. Ignatius was taught by St. Peter. I believe that Clement too was written with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Terral's reply << I suggest contacting the 4forums.com administrator with the request to start a Clement Doctrine section. \n \n Montalban << NOTE ALSO: The Didache was written earlier, too.\n \n Terral's reply << I seem to remember someone defining that Greek word as \"body of Christ.\" Then the same guy chastised me for actually picking up the Greek Dictionary and defining the word for everyone. Nice touch.\n \n Montalban << Of course your obvious rebuttal is that not all of these were 'inspired' by God. I have no problem with this - as I agree - however how do you know which were inspired by God, and which were not? \n \n Terral's reply << Our God breathed Text came from the Apostles and Prophets (Luke 11:49, 1Cor. 12:28) just like the Church, \"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner.\" Eph. 2:20. \n \n Here is where the rubber meets the road in this discussion: While you have spent your life learning about what all of these teachers had to say about Holy Scripture, I have done the same with the Word of God. You wish to focus upon the human contributions to the interpretation of Scripture, while I insist on going directly to the God breathed source. \n \n The Greek word 'didache' (#1322) means doctrine or teaching. This word is one of a family of Greek words used in Scripture. Didaktikos (#1317) means 'able to teach,' while didaktos (#1318) means 'instructed or taught.' Didaskalos (#1320) is the one doing the instructing or the 'teacher,' and didasko (#1321) means 'to learn or teach' depending upon the context. \n \n Your book 'Didache' is some man's attempt at writing doctrine. Paul warns us, \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine (didaskalia; #1319); but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires.\" 2Tim. 4:3. \n \n Men invented this 'Sacrament of the Eucharist' mobo-jumbo, which is NOT found anywhere in Scripture. Your teachers had to distort the Greek to come up with such a thing. And even if this Greek word had been tied to the Lord's Passover ritual, Paul specifically says 'not' to do it. 1Cor. 11:20. Paul also writes, \"Therefore NO ONE is to act as your judge in regard to FOOD OR DRINK or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day -- things which are a {mere} SHADOW of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.\" 2Cor. 2:16+17.\n \n Montalban << We have the great minds of the early church to thank for that, for giving us the authorised collection we call the Bible. \n \n Terral's reply << What does Scripture say? \"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave {opportunity} to each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters IS ANYTHING, but God who causes the growth. Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.\" 1Cor. 3:5-9. \n \n If Paul and Apollos are not ANYTHING, then how much less are your teachers of human interpretation? After all, I do not see Clement's name on any of the Epistles. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << You would like for the third party reader to \"have trouble dealing with absolutes,\" by dirtying the water with the writings of men. If the Bible does not say what you are saying, then please refrain from trying to distort the facts. \n \n Montalban << You're assuming several things including that the writings of St. Clement et al divers writers whilst being extra-biblical are anti-Biblical... they are not.\n \n Terral's reply << Well, if you say so . . . Maybe see the administrator about including a section on 'Extra-Bible Doctrine.' That's the ticket. \n \n Montalban << Who APPROVED Scripture of the Bible? The Church did. \n \n Terral's reply << Are you trying to say that God Almighty is incapable of delivering His own mail? Again, the co-workers of God are not ANYTHING, but God causes the growth. The remainder of your treatise on compilation is irrelevant to this discussion.\n \n Originally Posted by Montalban << I will however debate in favour of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession, both of which, incidentally are Biblical. \n \n Terral's Original Reply << Very good. Then you will have no problem sticking to the Bible, as support for your arguments. \n \n Montalban backtracking << Is your church square or round? Where does your Pastor stand? . . . \n \n Terral's reply << Okay then, perhaps you do have a problem adhering to the Bible to support your man-made doctrines. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << The Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome . . . \n \n Montalban's Original reply << You need to direct this to Maxiums \n \n Terral's Original reply << So much for willingness to debate in favor of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession. Do you know the meaning of those terms? Maximus and I have gone around and around already. I was hoping you would pick up where he left off. That being said, you are most wise to refuse. \n \n Montalban then says << I think this is quite arrogant. Why should I have to debate another person's faith? I tell you I am not Catholic. \n \n Terral's reply << Apostolic Succession is another man-made doctrine that leads straight back to Peter and Christ's words, \"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.\" Matt. 16:18. You claim that Apostolic Succession is Biblical. Very good . . . enlighten us; debate away, but please start a thread describing that particular Bible Doctrine. Note that this letter is not addressed to \"All,\" as is my practice, because most of this is irrelevant to Bible Doctrine. Also, you are boasting loudly on the JW thread, and this meandering around will likely not be noticed by many folks. My guess is that your tone will be much different on a thread under your \"Doctrine of Apostolic Succession\" heading. GL.\n \n Montalban << However I like a challenge. \n \n Terral's reply << That is wonderful, Montalban. I look forward to your replies to my 'gospel' and 'baptism' posts; and seeing your posts on Apostolic Succession and the Holy Eucharist.\n \n Montalban << Why do you doubt the fact that Sts Peter and Paul were in Rome, simply because it's not in the Bible? \n \n Terral's reply << Because, Peter's mission was to gain acceptance of the Gospel of the Kingdom from Israel of the flesh. You an I know that Israel rejected the offering of the 'gospel concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12). Paul was sent in chains to Rome, as Festus says, \"You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.\" Acts 25:12. Again, Peter is seen going to Jews only some twenty years after the crucifixion (Gal. 2:9). And he mysteriously drops from mention in the middle of Acts (Chapter 15). \n \n Montalban << I'm not in the Bible either. Not everything is. \n \n Terral's reply << We are not here to debate everything. Another hint: \"Bible Doctrine.\"\n \n Montalban << It's absolutely absurd to suggest that it should be... how many Apostles die in the Bible? Are you assuming then that those not mentioned didn't die? Not much of a challenge after all \n \n Terral's reply << Pounding a thousand such straw men to pieces is evidence of just that. \"Let not him who girds on {his armor} boast like him who takes {it} off.\" 1Kings 20:11. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Our Bible is the inspired word of God. 2Tim. 3:16+17. All of those other people you two (Montalban and LogicalFallacy) quote provide their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures . . . \n \n Montalban << Why should I be reliant wholly on the Bible? The majority of Christians have, for the majority of Christianity, relied on more than the Bible. The first person to come up with this novel idea (sola scriptura - Bible alone) was Martin Luther, who lived 1,500 years after the event. You need to show why, after so long a period of time, he was right to abandon every other Holy teacher. \n \n Terral's reply << Again, \"Bible Doctrine.\" The fact is that you are well aware of the fact that many of your invented man-made doctrines are not supported at all by the Bible. Why should anyone rely upon your teachers of doctrine, and their man breathed dogma, over those of any other denomination? Ultimately everything mankind has written about the Holy Text must be supported by the Scriptures themselves. I am perfectly willing to depend 100 percent upon the Word of God, because I am not selling any man-made doctrines. Can you say the same? BTW, even if the Text was written in modern English, we should expect to use a dictionary to define our terms.\n \n Originally Posted by Montalban << The Bible also mentions that people kept to non-written teachings... \"Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you\" (I Corinthians 11:2) \"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle\" (II Thessalonians 2:15)\n \n Original Reply by Terral << The Bible mentions a lot of things. However, you are quoting the steward of this dispensation of God's grace. Paul writes, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38. Our risen Lord Christ Jesus continued to give Paul important revelations, as he writes, \"but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.\" 2Cor. 12:1.\n \n Montalban's reply << So? I follow what St.Paul says in his scriptures! I also follow the writings of St.Clement, St.Ignatius as well. \n \n Terral's reply << No sir, you do not. Paul writes, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. Not only do the teachers of your man-made doctrines eat the Lord's Supper, they invented a 'Sacrament of the Eucharist' around it. \n \n The steward of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) received revelations from the Lord and included those things in Scripture. HE was qualified to establish early Christian tradition, based upon those revelations. That is no license for the teachers of your doctrines to do the same. Again, Paul warns us against subscribing to those kinds of things. 1Tim. 6:1-3, 2Tim. 4:3.\n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Paul spoke many times concerning that which had, \"been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26. Therefore, he established traditions among the believers that previously did not exist. He writes, \"For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet {you would} not {have} many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.\" 1Cor. 4:15.\n \n Montalban seeks to derail the train of thought << Again what's your point? Jesus started the tradition of selecting a very few to teach His Word. The Apostles passed this down - see Acts where they choose another steward to do the teaching. \n \n Terral's reply << Heh . . . See Acts . . . You mean the entire book? And exactly who is 'they?' For the record: Why did Christ send Paul down to Jerusalem, to meet with Peter, John and James, in the first place? \n \n God chose Paul as steward over a particular household (body of Christ) in Scripture. Paul writes, \"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles -- if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given TO ME FOR YOU; that by revelation there was made known to ME the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.\" Eph. 3:1-3. Paul is 'the' steward of this dispensation, and everyone else is a 'tutor' at best. 1Cor. 4:15.\n \n Montalban << You simply mistake the traditions of man for those of God. Jesus didn't say do away with ALL traditions. \n \n Terral's reply << Now who is being arrogant? And who said anything about doing away with traditions? Again, Paul writes, \"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word {of mouth} or by letter from us.\" 2Thes. 2:15. However, he also warns us, \"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.\" Col. 2:8. \n \n You sir are offering up the traditions of men that are not found in the Bible. Montalban is the one insisting on 'extra-biblical' sources. This side of the debate insists on debating over Bible Doctrines, and Pauline authority, for the members of this dispensation, over that of every other man. Therefore, you can sit there and pretend to occupy the moral high ground, but the only one being deceived is you. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Paul's authority as steward of this dispensation is no license for you to quote the words of men, and use their human interpretations to support arguments over the Word of God. But of course, you can quote from Jungle Book or Bambi for support if you wish. This side of the debate will depend solely upon God's Word.\n \n Montalban << This is rather odd to say, as I don't quote Bambi or any of their ilk. I quote from people taught the traditions of God. \n \n Terral's reply << Odd? Not at all. These works of fiction carry as much weight with me, as the teachers of your Eucharist doctrine. If your people are teaching the traditions of God, then you can easily support them from the Word of God. Right? \n \n (Terral deletes all of the compilation nonsense)\n \n Originally Posted by Montalban The Ethiopian Acts 8:30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading\"? Philip asked. 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?? So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word. Also, the Ethiopian finds faith, but needs to be baptised (a sacrament).\n \n Original Reply by Terral << Please see my posts, and offer us your reply using Scripture: \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509 \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506\n \n Montalban << a) why? Which bits are relevant, if any to the debate at hand\n \n Terral's reply << The debate at hand? We are not debating any particular Biblical Doctrine on this thread. This is a bunch of posturing over whether or not the writings of your history people are equal to or greater than the Word of God. You are going on and on about other things, under the pretense of 'accurately handling the word of truth.' 2Tim. 2:15. \n \n This post answers your point about the Ethiopian: \"There Is One Baptism/Are Three Baptisms For Us Today\" (#2506). \n \n This post presents the argument about why your point is mute: \"There Is One Gospel/Four Gospels In The New Testament,\" (#2509) because the Ethiopian was teaching under a different dispensation, and taught the gospel of the kingdom. Acts 8:12. \n \n But, you and I know that you are not here to actually debate Bible Doctrine at all. You are here to push the interpretations of the teachers of your Orthodox dogma. Please do everything to stay on the shallow end of the pool, my friend, lest you find yourself in the deep end and get swallowed whole. Please accept the challenge; the water is fine. \n \n Montalban << b) why base things solely on the Bible? We've yet to establish this point. Simply waving your hand to a very large corpus of works and say 'find the answer buried somewhere in there' is not worth my time. \n \n Terral's reply << Obviously, because you are not here to debate Bible Doctrine. But you certainly have time to present all of this Clement stuff, and your \"Didache\" (body of Christ; NOT) interpretations. Please forgive if I make some attempt at pointing our attention back to the Word of God, His Truth and Bible Doctrine.\n \n Originally Posted by Montalban << There are problems with relying on the Scripture alone... \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Oh really? Let us look at this one again: \"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for EVERY good work . . .\"\n \n Montalban's reply << 100,000 different Christian Churches all rely on the Scripture alone Baptists place emphasis on Adult Baptism.\n \n Terral's reply << Our 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) is performed by the Spirit of God (1Cor. 12:13), and we are 'sealed in Him' (Eph. 1:13) the moment we hear (Rom. 11:17) and believe. We are 'buried' (Rom. 6:3+4) into Christ Himself and not into any water ritual. Our one baptism is spiritual, as we are 'clothed . . . with Christ.' Gal. 3:27. Therefore, the act of Adult Baptism has absolutely nothing to do with our salvation or Paul's gospel. The fact that they have it wrong does not support any aspect of your case here. \n \n Montalban << All are following the divine Word of God, taken out of context\n In this case the context is the church that compiled the Bible in the first place. Of course, you can close your eyes and pretend none of the differences exist. \n \n Terral's reply << More compilation nonsense. The denominations you describe are not alone in taking God's Word out of context. Although, I do not believe they are guilty of defining \"Didache\" as 'the body of Christ.' Your statements only serve to prove the futility of debating over 'denominational' interpretations of the Text, instead of sticking to exactly what the Bible says. \n \n Originally Posted by Montalban << If you look at Scripture you can interpret the Last Supper as\n \n a) merely a commandment for a commemorative meal, or\n b) as a one off occurrence, or \n c) a command to partake in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n \n Terral's Original Reply << Or, you might read up on what the steward of this dispensation has to say about it. Paul writes, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20. I look very much forward to see how you remove the 'not' from Paul's commands to us. Let's see . . . who among your interpreters can accomplish that for you?\n \n Montalban's reply << In fact the verses prove my point. Look at verse 29 especially The Lord's Supper . . . \n \n Terral's reply << My God man, cut and paste the whole chapter next time. Do you recognize these things from Mosaic Law? \n \n Deut 5:17 'You shall not murder.'\n Deut 5:18 'You shall not commit adultery.'\n Deut 5:19 'You shall not steal.'\n Deut 5:20 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.'\n \n Just how far down the page should we read to also remove the 'not' from those verses? Again, Paul writes, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. \n \n Montalban << Thus you simply prove my point. You took a single verse out of the Bible to build a case.\n \n Terral's reply << My case? All I did was quote one verse from the Word of God. Please start a thread on the \"Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist,\" and you will see my case. Are you aware of the fact that this is the only verse where this phrase (Lord's Supper) appears in the entire Bible? That's right, and with the word 'not' in bold black letters. But, if the 'not' (1Cor. 11:20) were removed from the Scriptures, then my foot would be in my mouth.\n \n Your pagan ritual is based upon the 'Lord's Passover' supper that is performed once a year by those practicing Judaism, which is a celebration of their freedom from Egyptian bondage. Scripture says, \"Now you shall eat it in this manner: {with} your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste--it is the LORD'S Passover.\" Exodus 12:11. Performing this ritual every Sunday is not even in accordance with Mosaic Law. It is an invention of Gentiles who are duplicating the weekly rituals associated with the Temple of Aphrodite (your Greek Goddess of Fertility). \n \n The Passover points to Christ's coming, and our deliverance from death, but He already came and died on the cross for our sins. Therefore, Paul writes, \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\" Rom. 10:4. By performing this pagan form of Mosaic Law, you act as if Christ never died for anyone; and pretend that your priest is dispensing something that is actually of the Spirit of God. We are members of Christ's body already. 1Cor. 12:27. You are just feeding people crackers. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << The Sacrament of what? I find it interesting that you refuse to defend other aspects of Catholic dogma, but then present us with their unscriptural invention (Eucharist). \n \n Montalban << I find it odd that you call it Catholic dogma. Catholics do it, so do Anglicans, so do Copts, so do we Orthodox. It is dogma established by Jesus, recognised by St.Paul.\n \n Terral's reply << Okay, you are not Maximus' brother, but his cousin. You guys can argue over the facts about which is the chicken, and which the egg. Both of you teach a 'Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist,' and continue to give us non-denominational Christians a bad name. \n \n Montalban << I think you've a very limited notion of Christian history. \n \n Terral's reply << Very well said, and a complete understatement indeed. Paul writes that the secrets of men will be judged according to 'my gospel.' Rom. 2:16. The history of your Orthodox denomination will probably not be part of the deal. But then again, we are presenting arguments on Bible Doctrine threads, and not on those about Christian History. \n \n Originally Posted by Montalban << participated. Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Where on earth did you get that from? Didache (#1322) is a doctrine or teaching. The root of the word (didasko, #1321) means \"to teach.? Lockman?\" Exhaustive Concordance. Please try again. \n \n Montalban's arrogance shows << Oh dear. Sorry. I stated it was another Christian work (by this I meant book) (called) 'the Didache\" I was not aware you were not well versed in Christian writing. I apologise.\n \n Terral's reply << Touch\u00e9, my friend, but at least I can spell apologize. Life certainly has its tradeoff's. The fact that \"Didtache mentions the Eucharist\" means nothing at all. Please . . . \n \n Montalban << Oddly enough you are happy to search through a non-Biblical book. \n \n Terral's reply << Bible Dictionaries of the ancient Greek (and modern English ones) come in handy for defining words like 'Didtache,' and 'apologize,' and many other words. The same will happen the next time you try to deceive the third party reader with errant definitions. \n \n Montalban << You have a very limited and narrow view of Christianity, based on western Protestantism, and a bit of knowledge about Catholicism as you seem to think that anything that's not Protestant is \"Catholic\". There's a vast world of Orthodoxy out there. We were founded in 33 AD at Pentecost. \n \n Terral's reply << Then you hold to the doctrine of repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. That means that you also preach precepts of the 'gospel of the kingdom,' and add those things to Paul's gospel. Please direct yourself to my post on that topic above. And I am a Protestant now . . . Some among us believe that denominationalism is actually 'demon-ationalism.' No sir, I do not belong to any denomination of Christianity. \n \n Terral's Original Challenge << Thank you very much for using some Scripture in your reply. I hope you will offer a reply to my posts in the Biblical Contradictions section. That should prove really interesting indeed. \n \n Montalban's reply << One debate at a time.\n \n Terral's reply << This is not a debate about any particular Bible Doctrine at all. My points on this thread have been presented well enough for the third party reader to draw his or her own conclusions. I have drawn the line in the sand by offering to debate with you on the threads given above, which pertain to our 'one baptism' and 'the gospel.' My side of the debate is already at your disposal. \n \n Please feel free to attack me personally, distort the Greek, lean on your old history pals, and anything else you can think of to lead the third party reader's mind away from the fact that you are in no way prepared to give us a thoughtful reply to either of those posts. Or, stay here and continue to go on and on about things unrelated to Bible Doctrine, and pretend that someone might be impressed with your knowledge of Christian history. Why those things should have application to Bible Doctrine is beyond my ability to fathom. But good luck with it anyway.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Hi Montalban:\n \n \nMontalban << It seems you are sort of making an argument that is not against what I am saying. You've repeated a number of times about the greatness of God's Words in the Bible. But is that all of God's Words?\n\n \n Terral's reply << I was saving my best for later in the discussion, but what the hay . . . Here is Paul's take on your position, and you can take it to heart or toss it in the dust bin: \n \n \"Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other.\" 1Cor. 4:6.\n \n \nMontalban << Surely not? Jesus Himself was the Word made flesh, and He existed before and outside of the Bible. Therefore God's words aren't solely in one book.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Are you aware of the tenses of your statements here? It is not that Christ 'was' the Word made flesh, but He is the Word made flesh. He not only exists before the Bible, but before the creation of time and space. \"He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.\" Col. 1:17.\n \n My goal in this forum is to build up the members of the body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16, etc.), so that they can begin to understand that our Bible is not Two Testaments at all. It is three witnesses of spirit, water and blood (1John 5:8). Our completed Text is the 'perfect' of 1Cor. 13:10, \"but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.\" \n \n Your Bible was fashioned by the hand of God Himself into His Triune Image (Father, Son and Holy Spirit), which is the image of creation itself (heavens, heaven, earth), the image of the Tablernacle/Temple (Holy of Holies, Holy Place, Court), the image of the family (male, seed, female), and the image of a man (spirit, soul, body). Even bread is according to this image (oil, broken seed, water). Just as God lives, and man lives, the Holy Text lives, breathes and speaks to he who has ears to hear. Nothing ever written by any man can begin to compare to what God has done in our Bible. \n \n \nMontalban << You are sort of making the argument akin to \"The Mona Lisa is a great painting\", but I'm saying that there's more to Leo Da Vinci than just this one work.\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. \"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, NOT IN WORDS TAUGHT BY HUMAN WISDOM, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual {thoughts} with spiritual {words.}\" 1Cor. 2:12+13.\n \n \nMontalban << Thus continually repeating the mantra about God's great Bible is rather odd because I accept this. What we need to do is argue\n a) is that all there is?\n b) how did it come together?\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. We are going to continue writing ten page posts about nothing here, until you get back to the topic of Bible Doctrine. Christian History and Bible Doctrine are not the same thing. I would be willing to wager that you subscribe to translations based upon the Critical Text, while I prefer the Received Text. We can argue those points, until the cows come home, and still remain within the context of Bible Doctrine. \n \n \nMontalban << I contend a) is answered by 'no' as touched upon above, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, etc are found within and without the Bible. God is all around. I think it wrong to suggest that all there is of God is in the Bible.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Then your 'perfect' has yet to come. 1Cor. 13:10.\n \n \nMontalban << The answer to b) is \"The Church\".\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. All Scripture is inspired by God. Again, the servants of His Word shall receive a reward for their efforts, but indeed are not ANYTHING. \"So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.\" 1Cor. 3:7.\n \n \nMontalban << I look forward to your next post, except the annoying habit you have of not using the 'quote' options provided by this forum. Perhaps you might want to avail yourself of the technology?\n\n \n Terral's reply << Okie. emoticon_xgood \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Hi Montalban:\n\n G'day\n \nProtestantism makes everyone a Pope. Catholics believe that Biblical interpretation relies on the authority of one man; the Pope. Protestants make everyone a Pope - having the same ultimate authority to interpret scripture. Orthodox view Protestants and Catholics as different sides of the same coin.\n\n \nThank you for making this clear. By professing to be an Orthodox Christian, you really mean Greek Orthodox.\n\n No I do not! I am an Orthodox Christian. The Orthodox Church has many component parts, of which one is the Greek. Just like America has 50 states, each state runs largely its own things, but if you're Californian, you're American. It's not true to say all Americans are Californian. Equally true is that not all Orthodox are Greek Orthodox. I am an Orthodox Christian, of the Antiochian Orthodox Church. We are united with Greeks, Russians, Serbs etc as one big Orthodox family, in that we all believe the same things.\n \nPlease herd me into the non-denominational crowd, as none of the Protestants would have me.\n\n I'm not amazed by this.\n \nI don't know why you raise Roman Catholicism again, I am not one of them.\n\n \nNor am I a Protestant. You wish to play ring around the rosy . . . Just go ahead and admit that you have no desire to engage me on Bible Doctrine in this forum of debate.\n\n I do, but I see no reason to answer Catholic-based questions, nor to conform to your restrictive and un-natural rules of debate.\n \nAnd, just because you state that extra-Biblical sources aren't relevant, doesn't make it so. Oddly enough you say it's okay later on, and even quote a non-Biblical source when questioning \"The Didache\". \n\n \nObviously they are relevant to you, and mean absolutely nothing to me. I quoted from a Bible Dictionary of the Greek language to prove ?your definition? to be errant.\n\n That's not true. I gave you the title of a book called \"The Didache\" you quoted from something you now claim is about the Greek Language. If I talk to you about a book (my favourite novel) \"Bliss\" (by Peter Carey), and you go look up the word \"bliss\" in a dictionary to debate me, then you're barking up the wrong tree... because there's no way you're going to know about the book by a dictionary definition of the book's title. I have absolutely no idea why you would in fact even attempt this as it's really quite strange.\n \nYou and I are here to debate the Biblical Doctrine aspects, and not to redefine the Greek. Also, be very mindful of the fact each of us are here to present the opposing views. The third party reader then decides if either position has merit. Please continue to mishandle the Greek, and also to chastise me for simply quoting the Greek dictionary. \n\n Your whole debate here is based on the illogical assumption that you can tell me about a book you've not read, based on the meaning of the title word. How any other person can work out your sense of logic - well, good luck to them.\n \nYou take 2 TIm 3:16 differently from I. Look at what was written prior to 2 Tim... 30-60 Passion Narrative\n\n \nNothing written prior to or after Paul?s Second Epistle to Timothy negates a single word of Scripture.\n\n What then is Scripture? Scripture is either 'just words written' - i.e. script, in which case all the books written before 2 Tim are also script. Or, as I suggested, if you interpret it to mean Scripture - those scripts that are given authority, that's another thing. For then we can look at any Scripture those authorities also deem to be good - and the same church that chose 2 Tim for the Bible did not reject the Didache, or Clement, or the books of Ignatius etc. They just didn't include them in the same anthology - which is what the Bible is.\n \nList compiled from http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/ \n\n \nThe words of 2Tim. 2:15 are compiled from the mouth of God.\n\n How do you know? Have you read any of the other books? I have (not all, of course). How do you know that God's hand is not at work in any of the others?\n \nSurely you're not going to say that we should consult the Gospel of the Egyptians? SO, not ALL scripture is what is meant in 2 Tim, but all APPROVED scripture.\n\n \nNo sir. The sixty-six books of our Bible.\n\n What about Ignatius' works? Or, are you going to say God's not to be found there?\n \nNOTE: Clement was written prior to . . . \n\n \nPlease allow me to draw you a picture . . . I do not give a rat?s behind about one thing from Clement?s interpretations. Duty in . . . duty out. Have you heard the expression, ?Where you are is where you are at?? It sounds really simple right? Well, you are writing on BIBLE DOCTRINE threads in the Religion section of 4forums.com. The BIBLE part refers to the source from which the DOCTRINES are taken. Clement my eye . . . \n\n How do you know if Clement is not about the Bible? As stated, you're quite happy to quote from a concordance which you must believe is about the Bible.\n \n Not only 2 Tim, but before the compilation of the Bible. St. Clement, like St. Ignatius was taught by St. Peter. I believe that Clement too was written with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.\n\n \nI suggest contacting the 4forums.com administrator with the request to start a Clement Doctrine section.\n\n I suggest making up your mind about whether you're allowed to quote extra-biblical sources or not, and also to actually know if the one's you reject are in fact inspired by God.\n \nThe Didache was written earlier, too.\n\n \nI seem to remember someone defining that Greek word as ?body of Christ.? Then the same guy chastised me for actually picking up the Greek Dictionary and defining the word for everyone. Nice touch.\n\n No, I never said the Didache means the Body of Christ. I said the Eucharist can be found in \"the Didache\". It is a book. It's quite absurd that you should make this line of argument\n Post 39\n \nAnother early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" (meaning Body of Christ... It is so clear that the early Christians partook of Holy Communion...\n\n See a book called \"The Didache\" uses the word \"Eucharist\" which is a word that means \"The Body of Christ\". I see what you've done. You've gone and looked up the word \"Didache\" to see if it means \"The Body of Christ\" That's rather silly of you.\n It mentions the word a few times:\n 9:1 But as touching the Eucharistic thanksgiving give ye thanks thus.\n and\n 9:10 But let no one eat or drink of this Eucharistic thanksgiving, but they that have been baptized into the name of the Lord;\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html\n \nOf course your obvious rebuttal is that not all of these were 'inspired' by God. I have no problem with this - as I agree - however how do you know which were inspired by God, and which were not? \n\n \nOur God breathed Text came from the Apostles and Prophets (Luke 11:49, 1Cor. 12:28) just like the Church, ?having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner.? Eph. 2:20.\n\n BUT when it came to decide which were 'God breathed' text, they had more than 200 to pick from. These books were circulating around the ancient world. There was no Bible in the time of the Apostles. Some books they wrote, some they didn't. Some were written by well meaning but erroneous Christians, some by pagans, some by God-inspired Christians. Early Christian Writings site shows a mere 156 of these. How do you think the Bible was chosen? Do you think that they put all the books in a pile and God made the Gospels and Epistles fly out?\n \nHere is where the rubber meets the road in this discussion: While you have spent your life learning about what all of these teachers had to say about Holy Scripture, I have done the same with the Word of God. You wish to focus upon the human contributions to the interpretation of Scripture, while I insist on going directly to the God breathed source.\n\n But the Bible was never meant to be the only book of God.\n \nThe Greek word ?didache? (#1322) means doctrine or teaching. This word is one of a family of Greek words used in Scripture. Didaktikos (#1317) means ?able to teach,? while didaktos (#1318) means ?instructed or taught.? Didaskalos (#1320) is the one doing the instructing or the ?teacher,? and didasko (#1321) means ?to learn or teach? depending upon the context.\n\n So?\n \nYour book ?Didache? is some man?s attempt at writing doctrine. Paul warns us, ?For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine (didaskalia; #1319); but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires.? 2Tim. 4:3.\n\n So? What has St.Paul's words to do with the Didache? The Didache is also inspired by God. St. Paul is not saying \"Reject all non-Biblical books\" simply because when he wrote, there was no Bible.\n You have some fear about the Didache, which you've probably never heard of until now. You are judging a book you know little about.\n \nMen invented this ?Sacrament of the Eucharist? mobo-jumbo, which is NOT found anywhere in Scripture. Your teachers had to distort the Greek to come up with such a thing. And even if this Greek word had been tied to the Lord?s Passover ritual, Paul specifically says ?not? to do it. 1Cor. 11:20. Paul also writes, ?Therefore NO ONE is to act as your judge in regard to FOOD OR DRINK or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day -- things which are a {mere} SHADOW of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.? 2Cor. 2:16+17.\n\n Jesus said to \"Do this in memory of me\"\n St.Paul said not to do it just as a meal, for if you are hungry, eat at home. (see your last posting where you quoted one verse out of context) You re-state this again. 1 Cor 11 does not say \"Don't partake of the Eucharist\" it says that if you are going to eat - eat at home, because the Eucharist is not a meal. It is a sacrament - see verse 29 where he says when you eat you must recognise it as the Lord - because it is the Body of Christ you are taking.\n St.Paul is actually saying... in the context of the whole chapter, the very opposite of what you think he is saying.\n As for 2 Cor 2 16-17 it states...\n 16 To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task? 17 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.\n I see no reason for you to cite it.\n \nWe have the great minds of the early church to thank for that, for giving us the authorised collection we call the Bible.\n\n \nWhat does Scripture say? ?What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave {opportunity} to each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters IS ANYTHING, but God who causes the growth. Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.? 1 Cor. 3:5-9. \n If Paul and Apollos are not ANYTHING, then how much less are your teachers of human interpretation? After all, I do not see Clement?s name on any of the Epistles. \n\n See THE EPISTLE OF S. CLEMENT\n TO\n THE CORINTHIANS.\n Translated by J. B. Lightfoot\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/lightfoot/pt1vol2/translation1.html\n His name is there. And St. Clement is, like St.Paul and Appollos \"Only servants, through whom you came to believe\" as your scripture quote says. Here's the illogic of your argument... St. Paul says Apollos is a servant, like himself through whom people can come to believe in God. Where is the Epistle of Aplollos? Obviously he didn't need one, he is just a man bringing people to God, like St.Paul, who happened to write an Epistle, and like St. Clement, who also happened to write an Epistle.\n \nYou would like for the third party reader to ?have trouble dealing with absolutes,? by dirtying the water with the writings of men. If the Bible does not say what you are saying, then please refrain from trying to distort the facts. \n Montalban << You're assuming several things including that the writings of St. Clement et al divers writers whilst being extra-biblical are anti-Biblical... they are not.\n Terral?s reply << Well, if you say so . . . Maybe see the administrator about including a section on ?Extra-Bible Doctrine.? That?s the ticket.\n\n Maybe you would think it wise to take Biblical verses out of context - as you do above with regards the Eucharist and St.Paul. Perhaps you should start a \"Take one verse of the Bible to mean what ever\"\n \nWho APPROVED Scripture of the Bible? The Church did.\n\n \nAre you trying to say that God Almighty is incapable of delivering His own mail?\n\n Are you being serious? Did God speak through men? Yes. Obviously He chooses men to work through.\n \nAgain, the co-workers of God are not ANYTHING, but God causes the growth. The remainder of your treatise on compilation is irrelevant to this discussion.\n\n Then you've made a 'just-so' argument, and not proved anything.\n \nI will however debate in favour of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession, both of which, incidentally are Biblical.\n\n \nVery good. Then you will have no problem sticking to the Bible, as support for your arguments.\n\n Montalban backtracking[/quote]\n That's very nasty that you should suggest this.\n \n Is your church square or round? Where does your Pastor stand? . . . \n\n \nOkay then, perhaps you do have a problem adhering to the Bible to support your man-made doctrines. \n\n Why don't you answer the question?\n \nThe Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome . . . \n\n \nYou need to direct this to Maxiums \n\n \nSo much for willingness to debate in favor of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession. Do you know the meaning of those terms? Maximus and I have gone around and around already. I was hoping you would pick up where he left off. That being said, you are most wise to refuse.\n\n \n I think this is quite arrogant. Why should I have to debate another person's faith? I tell you I am not Catholic.\n\n \nApostolic Succession is another man-made doctrine that leads straight back to Peter and Christ?s words, ?I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.? Matt. 16:18. You claim that Apostolic Succession is Biblical. Very good . . . enlighten us; debate away, but please start a thread describing that particular Bible Doctrine. Note that this letter is not addressed to ?All,? as is my practice, because most of this is irrelevant to Bible Doctrine. Also, you are boasting loudly on the JW thread, and this meandering around will likely not be noticed by many folks.\n\n Hang on, it is you who introduced these arguments. I was happily debating LogicalFallacy, and in you waltzed. If the heat's getting to hot, you're free to leave the kitchen.\n \nMy guess is that your tone will be much different on a thread under your ?Doctrine of Apostolic Succession? heading. GL.\n\n By the way, I don't even count the Mat 16 verse as establishing Apostolic Succession. As I said, I am NOT Catholic. But you're confused you seem both to want to argue this, and not. Which is it?\n \nHowever I like a challenge.\n\n \nThat is wonderful, Montalban. I look forward to your replies to my ?gospel? and ?baptism? posts; and seeing your posts on Apostolic Succession and the Holy Eucharist.\n\n What number were these? I am debating you on this issue HERE because you raise this issue HERE\n \nWhy do you doubt the fact that Sts Peter and Paul were in Rome, simply because it's not in the Bible?\n\n \nBecause, Peter?s mission was to gain acceptance of the Gospel of the Kingdom from Israel of the flesh. You an I know that Israel rejected the offering of the ?gospel concerning the kingdom of God? (Acts 8:12). Paul was sent in chains to Rome, as Festus says, \"You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.\" Acts 25:12. Again, Peter is seen going to Jews only some twenty years after the crucifixion (Gal. 2:9). And he mysteriously drops from mention in the middle of Acts (Chapter 15). \n\n How does this prove that Sts.Peter and Paul did not die in Rome?\n \nI'm not in the Bible either. Not everything is.\n\n \nWe are not here to debate everything. Another hint: ?Bible Doctrine.?\n\n That's absurd. You're questioning whether Sts.Peter and Paul ever made it to Rome, simply because it's not in the Bible. Sure, it's not in the Bible, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen - which is your assertion, so we'd in fact need to look outside the Bible to determine this. You've got the ultimate illogical argument...\n Something didn't happen because it's not in the Bible, and only Biblical evidence can be used to debate the very thing that's not in the Bible.\n \nIt's absolutely absurd to suggest that it should be... how many Apostles die in the Bible? Are you assuming then that those not mentioned didn't die? Not much of a challenge after all \n\n \nPounding a thousand such straw men to pieces is evidence of just that. ?Let not him who girds on {his armor} boast like him who takes {it} off.? 1Kings 20:11. \n\n It's not a straw-man argument. You maintain that Sts.Peter and Paul did not die in Rome based on lack of evidence for the event in the Bible. The same lack of evidence exists for the deaths of heaps of Apostles. Do you go around questioning how they died? Maximus obviously has a wealth of patience.\n \n Our Bible is the inspired word of God. 2Tim. 3:16+17. All of those other people you two (Montalban and LogicalFallacy) quote provide their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures . . . \n\n Pot calling kettle black. See you're judicious quoting from St.Paul, where he says in fact the opposite of your verse taken out of context.\n \nWhy should I be reliant wholly on the Bible? The majority of Christians have, for the majority of Christianity, relied on more than the Bible. The first person to come up with this novel idea (sola scriptura - Bible alone) was Martin Luther, who lived 1,500 years after the event. You need to show why, after so long a period of time, he was right to abandon every other Holy teacher.\n\n \nAgain, ?Bible Doctrine.? The fact is that you are well aware of the fact that many of your invented man-made doctrines are not supported at all by the Bible.\n\n You're just like a broken-record. You've not established this at all. Your very evidence, from St. Paul supports my case.\n \nWhy should anyone rely upon your teachers of doctrine, and their man breathed dogma, over those of any other denomination? Ultimately everything mankind has written about the Holy Text must be supported by the Scriptures themselves. I am perfectly willing to depend 100 percent upon the Word of God, because I am not selling any man-made doctrines. Can you say the same?\n\n I've already stated this. There's no dogma of Orthodoxy that's non-Biblical\n \nBTW, even if the Text was written in modern English, we should expect to use a dictionary to define our terms.\n\n Yes, but you used a concordance to look up a word to argue about the title of a book, not the book itself.\n And, how do you know the concordance is reliable?\n \nThe Bible also mentions that people kept to non-written teachings... \"Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you\" (I Corinthians 11:2) \"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle\" (II Thessalonians 2:15)\n\n \nThe Bible mentions a lot of things.\n\n Ouch, that must hurt. You've in fact just nailed the argument I've been making. You can't just rely on the Bible. That's why there's 100,000 different Protestant sects.\n \nHowever, you are quoting the steward of this dispensation of God?s grace. Paul writes, ?If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.? 1Cor. 14:37+38. Our risen Lord Christ Jesus continued to give Paul important revelations, as he writes, ?but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.? 2Cor. 12:1.\n\n Again you've repeated a previous claim... and not answered the question. St. Paul is simply saying \"All that I speak is from God\", he's not saying \"All that God speaks is found here in the Epistles\"\n Some of what St.Paul speaks of is not written down - the traditions he mentions. And, as you accept that all that is from St.Paul is from God, then you must accept all that came from St.Paul - the written, AND THE NON-WRITTEN teachings.\n \nSo? I follow what St.Paul says in his scriptures! I also follow the writings of St.Clement, St.Ignatius as well.\n\n \nNo sir, you do not. Paul writes, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20. Not only do the teachers of your man-made doctrines eat the Lord?s Supper, they invented a ?Sacrament of the Eucharist? around it.\n\n St.Paul is saying it's not a Supper. He's saying if you want supper - go home. BUT the as to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, it is different, it is not a commemorative meal. He says .\"....28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.\"\n He's saying that you are bringing judgment upon yourself if you don't recognise that body of the Lord - that's the Eucharist.\n \n The steward of this ?dispensation of God?s grace? (Eph. 3:2) received revelations from the Lord and included those things in Scripture. HE was qualified to establish early Christian tradition, based upon those revelations. That is no license for the teachers of your doctrines to do the same. Again, Paul warns us against subscribing to those kinds of things. 1Tim. 6:1-3, 2Tim. 4:3.\n\n Irrelevant. The Eucharist was a scrament established by Christ - I've already quoted Matthew where Jesus says \"DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME\" and \"THIS IS MY BODY\"\n \nPaul spoke many times concerning that which had, ?been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested . . .? Rom. 16:25+26. Therefore, he established traditions among the believers that previously did not exist. He writes, ?For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet {you would} not {have} many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.? 1Cor. 4:15.\n\n Again, so?\n \nAgain what's your point? Jesus started the tradition of selecting a very few to teach His Word. The Apostles passed this down - see Acts where they choose another steward to do the teaching.\n\n \nHeh . . . See Acts . . . You mean the entire book? And exactly who is ?they?? For the record: Why did Christ send Paul down to Jerusalem, to meet with Peter, John and James, in the first place?\n\n Yes, I do mean the entire book. The very title 'Acts' is the doings of the Apostles. It is not called \"Faith of the Apostles\" They meet together, choose another of their number to replace Judas. They create minor offices - deacons. Deacons go out and preach - but the people need the laying on of hands to obtain the gifts of the Holy Spirit\n \n This is about enough as I can deal with for now, as I said... Maximus has far more patience.\n I look forward to you ignoring the difficult bits of your own quote from 1 Cor 11",

   "You simply mistake the traditions of man for those of God. Jesus didn't say do away with ALL traditions.\n\n \nNow who is being arrogant? And who said anything about doing away with traditions?\n\n You quoted about bad traditions, not me.\n \nYou sir are offering up the traditions of men that are not found in the Bible. Montalban is the one insisting on ?extra-biblical? sources. This side of the debate insists on debating over Bible Doctrines, and Pauline authority, for the members of this dispensation, over that of every other man. Therefore, you can sit there and pretend to occupy the moral high ground, but the only one being deceived is you.\n\n No. I am offering you traditions found in the Bible, supported by extra-biblical sources.\n Such as the Eucharist\n Established by Jesus (see Gospel of Matthew)\n Supported by St. Paul, the Didache etc.\n \nPaul?s authority as steward of this dispensation is no license for you to quote the words of men, and use their human interpretations to support arguments over the Word of God. But of course, you can quote from Jungle Book or Bambi for support if you wish. This side of the debate will depend solely upon God?s Word.\n\n I'd like to halt for a moment. My version of the Bible doesn't call St. Paul a steward, in fact the word is absent from a search at www.biblegateway.com so you are quite happy to refer to St.Paul by a non-Biblical title.\n Secondly St.Paul is a man. So I am quoting from a man, and so are you.\n \n This is rather odd to say, as I don't quote Bambi or any of their ilk. I quote from people taught the traditions of God.\n\n \nOdd? Not at all. These works of fiction carry as much weight with me, as the teachers of your Eucharist doctrine. If your people are teaching the traditions of God, then you can easily support them from the Word of God. Right? \n\n Yes, you keep up with a just-so argument. So far all you've done to show this to be the case is repeating your notion that the Eucharist is a man-made institution - and backing this up by a misquote from St.Paul\n Originally Posted by Montalban The Ethiopian Acts 8:30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading\"? Philip asked. 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?? So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word. Also, the Ethiopian finds faith, but needs to be baptised (a sacrament).\n \n But, you and I know that you are not here to actually debate Bible Doctrine at all. You are here to push the interpretations of the teachers of your Orthodox dogma. Please do everything to stay on the shallow end of the pool, my friend, lest you find yourself in the deep end and get swallowed whole. Please accept the challenge; the water is fine.\n\n So far you've displayed a total lack of insight. You can be insulting here, and later you whinge when you think I've made a personal attack - the only difference is you add the word 'friend' here, and \"God bless\" at the end. And you also don't believe you're presenting any particular version of the Gospel is just absurd. I really would like you to address the misquote you've made of St.Paul, and why you've not even responded to the challenge in Matthew when Jesus said \"This is the New Covenant\" and \"Do this in memory of Me\"\n \nb) why base things solely on the Bible? We've yet to establish this point. Simply waving your hand to a very large corpus of works and say 'find the answer buried somewhere in there' is not worth my time.\n\n \nObviously, because you are not here to debate Bible Doctrine. But you certainly have time to present all of this Clement stuff, and your ?Didache? (body of Christ; NOT) interpretations.\n\n You're still pushing this other error of yours. The Didache is the name of a book. In that book it mentions the Eucharist. I have trouble fathoming your line of reasoning where you'd actually expend some time to research the title of the book, when that's not the issue :) I've never claimed \"Didache = Eucharist\" But it suits you to repeat ad infinitum you're great revelation which addresses nothing but your very own and very strange line of reasoning.\n \nPlease forgive if I make some attempt at pointing our attention back to the Word of God, His Truth and Bible Doctrine.\n\n You've still not established that the Bible is the sole Word of God. I've already mentioned that Jesus was the Word made Flesh. God works through many means. You've become fixated with only one, and then determine to prove or not any and all others, based solely on the Bible.\n \nThere are problems with relying on the Scripture alone... \n\n \nOh really?\n\n Yes, really.\n \nLet us look at this one again: ?All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for EVERY good work . . .?\n\n Let's try a different way of putting this. The Gospel of St. John is 'scripture inspired by God and profitable for teaching etc'. But we don't rely wholly on the Gospel of St.John to understand Jesus' ministry. This does not make the Gospel of St. John any less inspired. You again seem to be arguing something I'm not stating. Just as Jesus taught, and we know that not all teachings of Jesus were laid down in the Bible, doesn't mean that the Bible is less than God's inspired Word. BUT God's inspired Word can be found in other places too, such as the works of St.Clement, St.Ignatius, the Didache etc - which of themselves also don't contradict the Bible.\n \n100,000 different Christian Churches all rely on the Scripture alone Baptists place emphasis on Adult Baptism.\n\n \n Our ?one baptism? (Eph. 4:5) is performed by the Spirit of God (1Cor. 12:13), and we are ?sealed in Him? (Eph. 1:13) the moment we hear (Rom. 11:17) and believe. We are ?buried? (Rom. 6:3+4) into Christ Himself and not into any water ritual. Our one baptism is spiritual, as we are ?clothed . . . with Christ.? Gal. 3:27. Therefore, the act of Adult Baptism has absolutely nothing to do with our salvation or Paul?s gospel. The fact that they have it wrong does not support any aspect of your case here. \n\n Yes, in fact it does. BECAUSE they rely solely on the Bible. Just as you, and you take words out of context as you do with 1 Cor 11. The fact that each one of those 100,000 churches all rely solely on the Bible tells of the problems caused.\n \n All are following the divine Word of God, taken out of context. In this case the context is the church that compiled the Bible in the first place. Of course, you can close your eyes and pretend none of the differences exist.\n\n \nMore compilation nonsense. The denominations you describe are not alone in taking God?s Word out of context.\n\n Then why are they all different?\n \nAlthough, I do not believe they are guilty of defining ?Didache? as ?the body of Christ.?\n\n Yawn. How many times do you repeat this monumental mistake?\n \n Your statements only serve to prove the futility of debating over ?denominational? interpretations of the Text, instead of sticking to exactly what the Bible says. \n\n As your mistake is made, your conclusion is on faulty ground too.\n \n If you look at Scripture you can interpret the Last Supper as\n a) merely a commandment for a commemorative meal, or\n b) as a one off occurrence, or \n c) a command to partake in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n\n \nOr, you might read up on what the steward of this dispensation has to say about it. Paul writes, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20. I look very much forward to see how you remove the ?not? from Paul?s commands to us. Let's see . . . who among your interpreters can accomplish that for you?\n\n Egad. This mistake of your again! It's rather sad.\n \nin fact the verses prove my point. Look at verse 29 especially The Lord's Supper . . . \n\n \nMy God man, cut and paste the whole chapter next time. Do you recognize these things from Mosaic Law?\n\n Hypocrite. You took a single verse! I took several to show context. You ignore verse 29 which is a key verse. St.Paul is showing you the way, and it's difficult for you, I know, but then you have to go and quote a whole lot of irrelevant verses such as ...\n \n\n Deut 5:17 'You shall not murder.?\n Deut 5:18 'You shall not commit adultery.?\n Deut 5:19 'You shall not steal.?\n Deut 5:20 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.?\n Just how far down the page should we read to also remove the ?not? from those verses? Again, Paul writes, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20. \n\n Indeed. IT IS NOT TO EAT THE LORDS SUPPER. IT IS NOT A SUPPER. IT IS THE EUCHARIST. THE EUCHARIST IS A SACRAMENT. IT IS NOT A MEAL. I hope that makes it clearer for you... but I think you don't understand this, because most Protestants call \"THE EUCHARIST\" by the name \"THE LORD'S SUPPER\", you are in fact showing that they are wrong. It is not a 'supper'. St. Paul is saying if it were a supper - that is, a celebratory meal - you should eat at home. Verse 29 says you must think of it as THE BODY OF CHRIST which is what EUCHARIST means.\n I have trouble understanding why you argue points I'm not making.\n \nThus you simply prove my point. You took a single verse out of the Bible to build a case.\n\n \nMy case? All I did was quote one verse from the Word of God. Please start a thread on the ?Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist,? and you will see my case.\n\n Yes, you are putting forward a case, an argument. Have you no idea what you are doing?\n \nAre you aware of the fact that this is the only verse where this phrase (Lord?s Supper) appears in the entire Bible? That?s right, and with the word ?not? in bold black letters.\n\n So what?\n The Eucharist is NOT the Lord's Supper.\n Further, the fact a word does not appear (at all or only once) there is irrelevant. The word \"Trinity\" doesn't appear at all in the Bible. The concept is there though. As is the concept of the Eucharist.\n \nYour pagan ritual is based upon the ?Lord?s Passover? supper that is performed once a year by those practicing Judaism, which is a celebration of their freedom from Egyptian bondage.\n\n NO it is a NEW COVENANT. Jesus says so. He happened to institute the sacrament at Passover, and at a gathering of the Apostles for a final meal. Neither the meal, nor the Passover are the Eucharist.\n Matt. 26:26; Mark. 14:22; Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n 1 Cor. 11:24 - the same translation is used by Paul - \"touto mou estin to soma.\" The statement is \"this is really\" my body and blood. Nowhere in Scripture does God ever declare something without making it so.\n I cited even early pagans were aghast when they heard Christians 'eating the Body of Christ'; they thought we were cannibals. It goes to show that the early church understood this, has always understood it to be so.\n I've deleted all your Passover stuff as it's irrelevant.\n \nThe Sacrament of what? I find it interesting that you refuse to defend other aspects of Catholic dogma, but then present us with their unscriptural invention (Eucharist).\n\n I'm not sure if you're attempting to be funny here. I know some posters pretend to be stupid in order to frustrate debate.\n \nI find it odd that you call it Catholic dogma. Catholics do it, so do Anglicans, so do Copts, so do we Orthodox. It is dogma established by Jesus, recognised by St.Paul.\n\n \nOkay, you are not Maximus? brother, but his cousin. You guys can argue over the facts about which is the chicken, and which the egg. Both of you teach a 'Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist,' and continue to give us non-denominational Christians a bad name.\n\n What a rebuttal!\n \nI think you've a very limited notion of Christian history.\n\n \nVery well said, and a complete understatement indeed. Paul writes that the secrets of men will be judged according to ?my gospel.? Rom. 2:16. The history of your Orthodox denomination will probably not be part of the deal. But then again, we are presenting arguments on Bible Doctrine threads, and not on those about Christian History.\n\n They aren't exactly separate issues, Einstein. For you to understand how best to interpret Scripture, it might be wise to ask \"What have Christians said about this?\" But then you don't think there's any problem with 100,000 different Protestant denominations interpreting it differently.\n \nparticipated. Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\"\n\n \nWhere on earth did you get that from? Didache (#1322) is a doctrine or teaching. The root of the word (didasko, #1321) means ?to teach.? Lockman?? Exhaustive Concordance. Please try again.\n\n You're kidding, right? You mean to say you're honestly going to present an argument that the Book called the Didache which mentions the Eucharist in it, is going to be judged by you judging the title of the book? That's a really original theory.\n \nOh dear. Sorry. I stated it was another Christian work (by this I meant book) (called) 'the Didache\" I was not aware you were not well versed in Christian writing. I apologise.\n\n \nTouch\u00e9, my friend, but at least I can spell apologize.\n\n Again you show your really narrow view. Apologise is perfectly legitimate spelling outside the USA. Hence I will write\n 'colour' for 'color'\n 'theatre' for 'theater'\n 'defence' for 'defense'\n 'maths' for 'math'\n I'll say 'lift' instead of 'elevator', 'Maccas' instead of \"Mickey-D's', 'jam' instead of 'jelly', and 'jelly' instead of 'jell-o'\n There's a very big world out there beyond your small one.\n (See, I'm aware of how you spell things :) ) (So much for your cheap shot!)\n However, I find it insane that you'd criticise the Didache based on an examination of the title word.\n \nLife certainly has its tradeoff?s. The fact that ?Didtache mentions the Eucharist? means nothing at all. Please . . .\n\n Yes, in deed it does. It shows that the early church practiced the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n \n Oddly enough you are happy to search through a non-Biblical book. \n\n \nBible Dictionaries of the ancient Greek (and modern English ones) come in handy for defining words like ?Didtache,? and 'apologize,' and many other words. The same will happen the next time you try to deceive the third party reader with errant definitions.\n\n You're in error. Analysing the book by the title word! That's hilarious, and also somewhat scary - to think someone would expend so much time debunking the title word! It's totally irrelevant.\n \nYou have a very limited and narrow view of Christianity, based on western Protestantism, and a bit of knowledge about Catholicism as you seem to think that anything that's not Protestant is \"Catholic\". There's a vast world of Orthodoxy out there. We were founded in 33 AD at Pentecost.\n\n \nThen you hold to the doctrine of repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. That means that you also preach precepts of the ?gospel of the kingdom,? and add those things to Paul?s gospel.\n\n Such a huge sweeping statement you just made can't go unanswered. Show me what Orthodox have 'just added'?\n \nPlease direct yourself to my post on that topic above. And I am a Protestant now . . . Some among us believe that denominationalism is actually ?demon-ationalism.? No sir, I do not belong to any denomination of Christianity.\n\n Prot\u00b7es\u00b7tant P Pronunciation Key (prt-stnt)\n n. \n A member of a Western Christian church whose faith and practice are founded on the principles of the Reformation, especially in the acceptance of the Bible as the sole source of revelation, in justification by faith alone, and in the universal priesthood of all the believers.\n A member of a Western Christian church adhering to the theologies of Luther, Calvin, or Zwingli.\n One of the German princes and cities that supported the doctrines of Luther and protested against the decision of the second Diet of Speyer (1529) to enforce the Edict of Worms (1521) and deny toleration to Lutherans.\n protestant (also pr-tstnt) One who makes a declaration or avowal.\n adj. \n Of or relating to Protestants or Protestantism.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=protestant\n You are a Protestant.\n \nThank you very much for using some Scripture in your reply. I hope you will offer a reply to my posts in the Biblical Contradictions section. That should prove really interesting indeed.\n\n \nOne debate at a time\n\n \nThis is not a debate about any particular Bible Doctrine at all. My points on this thread have been presented well enough for the third party reader to draw his or her own conclusions. I have drawn the line in the sand by offering to debate with you on the threads given above, which pertain to our ?one baptism? and ?the gospel.? My side of the debate is already at your disposal.\n\n So? I need not address other debates now. Just because in your majestic way you wave your hand to other debates elsewhere.\n \n Hi Montalban:\n\n G'day\n Note: I'm from Australia. Our spelling of words follows English-English, not American-English conventions. You seemed not to have picked up on that.\n \nIt seems you are sort of making an argument that is not against what I am saying. You've repeated a number of times about the greatness of God's Words in the Bible. But is that all of God's Words? \n\n \nI was saving my best for later in the discussion, but what the hay . . . Here is Paul?s take on your position, and you can take it to heart or toss it in the dust bin: ?Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other.? 1Cor. 4:6.\n\n This doesn't answer it at all. St.Paul is just saying he's written some stuff. He's not stated \"This is the only place you'll find God's words\" In fact, as I've pointed out already, he does say that the teachings of Christ are to be found in written and oral teachings.\n \nSurely not? Jesus Himself was the Word made flesh, and He existed before and outside of the Bible. Therefore God's words aren't solely in one book.\n\n \nAre you aware of the tenses of your statements here? It is not that Christ ?was? the Word made flesh, but He is the Word made flesh. He not only exists before the Bible, but before the creation of time and space. ?He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.? Col. 1:17.\n\n I stand corrected. However, this still shows that Jesus is the WORD OF GOD outside of the Bible. How does it help your case?\n \n My goal in this forum is to build up the members of the body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16, etc.), so that they can begin to understand that our Bible is not Two Testaments at all. It is three witnesses of spirit, water and blood (1John 5:8). Our completed Text is the ?perfect? of 1Cor. 13:10, ?but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.? \n\n So? You can have several perfect things together. The Bible, the teachings of Christ outside the Bible etc.\n \n Your Bible was fashioned by the hand of God Himself into His Triune Image (Father, Son and Holy Spirit),\n\n Wait just a moment. Before you argued against the Eucharist based on the fact you believe it's mentioned but once. Now you say you believe in the Trinity (as do I). Show me the Bible verse where the word \"Trinity\" appears?\n \n which is the image of creation itself (heavens, heaven, earth), the image of the Tabernacle/Temple (Holy of Holies, Holy Place, Court), the image of the family (male, seed, female), and the image of a man (spirit, soul, body). Even bread is according to this image (oil, broken seed, water). Just as God lives, and man lives, the Holy Text lives, breathes and speaks to he who has ears to hear. Nothing ever written by any man can begin to compare to what God has done in our Bible.\n\n Nice poetry, what's it mean? Did the Bible fall out of heaven fully written?\n Here's what some Protestants say...\n 14. When was the Bible canonized?\n The entire New Testament as we know it today, was canonized before the year 375 A.D. The Old Testament had previously been canonized long before the advent of Christ.\n 15. What does \"canon\" mean?\n \"Canon\" is derived front the Greek word \"Kanon,\" signifying a measuring rod. Thus, to have the Bible \"canonized\" meant that it had been measured by the standard or test of divine inspiration and authority. It became the collection of books or writings accepted by the apostles and leadership of the early Christian church as a basis for Christian belief. It is the standard by which all Christians throughout the ages live and worship.\n http://www.bible.com/answers/afacts.html\n (note, the Bible didn't 'test itself'. It was tested by men, with the guidance of the Holy Spirit)\n This is borne out at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/a/canon.html which states...\n \"Development of the New Testament Canon\n C. AD 51-125: \n The New Testament books are written, but during this same period other early Christian writings are produced--for example, the Didache (c. AD 70), 1 Clement (c. 96), the Epistle of Barnabas (c. 100), and the 7 letters of Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110).\"\n In fact the Bible underwent a series of changes until settled by the Orthodox Church, in council.\n Marcion c. 140 AD \n Gospel according to Luke \n Romans \n I Corinthians \n II Corinthians \n Galatians \n Ephesians (Laodiceans) \n Colossians \n Thessalonians I \n Thessalonians II \n Philemon \n \n Irenaeus c. 180 AD \n Gospel according to Matthew \n Gospel according to Mark \n Gospel according to Luke \n Gospel according to John \n Acts \n Romans \n I Corinthians \n II Corinthians \n Galatians \n Ephesians \n Philippians \n Thessalonians I \n Thessalonians II \n I Timothy \n II Timothy \n Titus \n James (?) \n 1 Peter \n 1 John \n Revelation of John \n Shepherd of Hermas \n \n Muratorian c. 200 AD \n Gospel according to Matthew (?) \n Gospel according to Mark (?) \n Gospel according to Luke \n Gospel according to John \n Acts \n Romans \n I Corinthians \n II Corinthians \n Galatians \n Ephesians \n Philippians \n Colossians \n Thessalonians I \n Thessalonians II \n I Timothy \n II Timothy \n Titus \n 1 John \n 2 John \n Jude \n Revelation of John \n Revelation of Solomon \n Revelation of Peter\n \n Eusebius c. 325 AD \n Gospel according to Matthew \n Gospel according to Mark \n Gospel according to Luke \n John \n Acts \n Romans \n I Corinthians \n II Corinthians \n Galatians \n Ephesians \n Philippians \n Colossians \n Thessalonians I \n Thessalonians II \n I Timothy \n II Timothy \n Titus \n 1 Peter \n 1 John \n Jude \n Revelation of John \n \n Athanasius of Alexandria (A.D. 293-373) \n Gospel according to Matthew \n Gospel according to Mark \n Gospel according to Luke \n Gospel according to John \n Acts \n Romans \n I Corinthians \n II Corinthians \n Galatians \n Ephesians \n Philippians \n Colossians \n I Thessalonians \n II Thessalonians \n I Timothy \n II Timothy \n Titus \n Philemon \n Hebrews \n James \n I Peter \n II Peter \n 1 John \n 2 John \n 3 John \n Jude \n Revelation of John\n from http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_canons.htm\n \" The Christian Church, it must be remembered, was still only loosely organised, and although all of our New Testament books are continually quoted, and often quoted as authoritative, by Christian writers from the third century on, it was not until the close of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century that the Canon of the New Testament, as we know it, can be said to have obtained almost \"\n \"The first official recognition of a complete NT canon consisting of all twenty-seven books by the Church in the West came at the Third Council of Carthage in A.D. 397. Augustine was present and gave his stamp of approval of the canon. The Council of Hippo (A.D. 419) reiterated that decision with the same list of twenty-seven books. Later (c. A.D. 508) the Church of the East recognized the remaining books in its canon (viz. II Peter, II, III John, Jude and Revelation). Thus, by the beginning of the sixth century the Church in all the known world had a completed canon of the NT.\"\n http://www.tmch.net/ntcanon.htm\n \"A Long Time in Coming\n The first list of \"canonical\" books that names the same twenty-seven writings found in our New Testament appears in the Easter letter of Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, Egypt, in 367 C.E. He names them in a different order, to be sure. Even so, the first list that agrees with ours was a long time in coming.\"\n http://westarinstitute.org/Periodicals/4R_Articles/Canon/canon.html\n Even the Methodists believe it\n http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/canons.stm\n The weight of churches that hold to this belief might be a cause for you saying we're all practicing wishful thinking... but just saying that 'it might comfort me' is not an argument, but is in fact, a case of wishful thinking itself.\n On this particular point, I conclude with...\n \"For various reasons it was necessary for the Church to know exactly what books were divinely authoritative.\"\n http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/ffbruce/ntdocrli/ntdocc03.htm\n http://www.religion-online.org/cgi-bin/relsearchd.dll/showchapter?chapter_id=546\n How the Bible canon was formed is explained at http://www.pastornet.net.au/rtc/canon.htm. I have taken pains to provide non-Orthodox sources for the formation of the Biblical canon - for you may not believe them. But the sheer volume of non-Orthodox agreeing with my stance must alert you to the error you make\n \n You are sort of making the argument akin to \"The Mona Lisa is a great painting\", but I'm saying that there's more to Leo Da Vinci than just this one work. \n\n \nNo sir. ?Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, NOT IN WORDS TAUGHT BY HUMAN WISDOM, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual {thoughts} with spiritual {words.}? 1Cor. 2:12+13.\n\n That's not what I'm saying. I have no problem with \"The Bible is the Word of God\". But God is to be found outside the Bible, in Jesus, the Word made flesh, in the workings of the Holy Spirit etc. AND in other Christian works inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n \nThus continually repeating the mantra about God's great Bible is rather odd because I accept this. What we need to do is argue\n a) is that all there is?\n b) how did it come together? \n\n \nNo sir. We are going to continue writing ten page posts about nothing here, until you get back to the topic of Bible Doctrine. Christian History and Bible Doctrine are not the same thing. I would be willing to wager that you subscribe to translations based upon the Critical Text, while I prefer the Received Text. We can argue those points, until the cows come home, and still remain within the context of Bible Doctrine.\n\n They are if you dismiss non-Biblical texts. You have to have a reason to do so. So far you've not come up with a valid one.\n \nI contend a) is answered by 'no' as touched upon above, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, etc are found within and without the Bible. God is all around. I think it wrong to suggest that all there is of God is in the Bible. \n\n \nThen your ?perfect? has yet to come. 1Cor. 13:10.\n\n I'm not sure what you're on about\n \nThe answer to b) is \"The Church\". \n\n \nNo sir. All Scripture is inspired by God. Again, the servants of His Word shall receive a reward for their efforts, but indeed are not ANYTHING. ?So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.? 1Cor. 3:7.\n\n Yes, it is inspired by God. How did the Bible come into being though? If it weren't for the Church compiling the Bible - to put together these inspired words, we'd have to sift through hundreds of different boos.\n \nI look forward to your next post, except the annoying habit you have of not using the 'quote' options provided by this forum. Perhaps you might want to avail yourself of the technology?\n\n \n Terral?s reply << Okie.\n\n You don't need to actually write \"Terral's reply<<\" either.\n \nPlease feel free to attack me personally\n\n You do the same by saying...\n \n, distort the Greek,\n\n Basing this attack on your absurd notion of analysing the title of a book :)\n \nlean on your old history pals, and anything else you can think of to lead the third party reader?s mind away from the fact that you are in no way prepared to give us a thoughtful reply to either of those posts. Or, stay here and continue to go on and on about things unrelated to Bible Doctrine, and pretend that someone might be impressed with your knowledge of Christian history. Why those things should have application to Bible Doctrine is beyond my ability to fathom. But good luck with it anyway.\n\n I think if you argue that you're ignorant of Christian history, that doesn't go well as a defence.",

   "Please note Terral, your use of 1 Cor 11 deals not with the Eucharist, but with the \"Lord's Supper\" see below...\n \n \"Various names used for the Holy Eucharist\n a) Mass\n This is derived from the Latin word ?missa?, used in the dismissal at the end of the Holy Eucharist in the Roman Catholic church. The Roman Catholic Church uses this name.\n b) Holy Communion\n The communion between Christ and men and also communion among men are meant here (1 Cor. 10:16,17). The Anglican Church and the Protestant Churches use this word.\n C) Holy Eucharist\n The word Eucharist comes from the Greek word ?Eucharistia?, which means ?offering thanks?. St. Paul says, ?when He had given thanks, he broke it?. St. Paul does not say ?blessed?. Giving thanks is the way of blessing (1. Cor. 11:24).\n d) The Lord?s Supper\n The Protestant Churches use this name. In the Orthodox Churches, love-feast or ?Agape? is different from Holy Eucharist. St. Paul says about the love-feast in 1 Cor. 11:20.\n e) Mystery\n Eastern Orthodox Churches use the word ?Mystery? for Holy Eucharist, the word which comes from the Greek word ?Mysterion?. They call all sacraments ?the mysteries of the church?. The word mystery means the hidden reality The fulness of the saving acts of God, hidden in olden days was manifested through the only begotten Son. We participate in this saving acts of God today, through our participation in the mysteries. Sacraments in general and Holy Eucharist in particular, are referred to, by the word ?mystery?. The bread and wine become the body and blood of our Lord in a manner not comprehensible to human senses. Hence it is a ?mystery?.\n http://www.castlecomputers.com/stthomasla/holy_eucharist.htm\n \n Your quoting of St.Paul in fact shows that Protestants have it essentially wrong - for they (many of them) only partake of a celebratory meal. St. Paul says, if you're hungry eat at home, if you think of this as something OTHER than the Body of Christ, you are sinning.\n \n It would be handy if you address the argument, not an argument you think I am making.\n \n Another example of this is where you question my contention about the Didache containing the \"Eucharist\". I said the word is to be found in the book. Sadly you do some weird analysis of the title of the book to show that Didache does not mean Eucharist, which is in fact not an argument I've made. It's one of the oddest re-workings of an argument of mine yet. :)",

   "Greetings Montalban:\n \n \nOriginally Quoted by Terral << . By professing to be an Orthodox Christian, you really mean Greek Orthodox.\n\n \n \nMontalban << No I do not! I am an Orthodox Christian . . . . We are united with Greeks, Russians, Serbs etc as one big Orthodox family, in that we all believe the same things. \n \n \n Terral's reply << An outsider would say that Christianity is divided into three lumps of dough; Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Protestant; to which you belong to the second lump. A non-denominational Christian claims to belong to none of the above. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Nor am I a Protestant. You wish to play ring around the rosy . . . Just go ahead and admit that you have no desire to engage me on Bible Doctrine in this forum of debate. \n \n \n \nMontalban << I do, but I see no reason to answer Catholic-based questions, nor to conform to your restrictive and un-natural rules of debate. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Un-natural? Why, because you are the natural man? What does Scripture say? \"But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.\" 1Cor. 2:14+15. I conceded to you and said to go ahead and quote anybody in the world you like, including the writers of children's books. Just do not expect those words to carry the weight of the Word of God. \n \n When Christ was tempted, He quoted the Scriptures. Christ opened the minds of the Disciples for what purpose? \"Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.\" Luke 24:45. The Bereans consulted what to find out if Paul's words were truth? \"Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily {to see} whether these things were so.\" Acts 17:11. Apollos was distinguished by what? \"Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.\" Acts 18:24.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Obviously they are relevant to you, and mean absolutely nothing to me. I quoted from a Bible Dictionary of the Greek language to prove 'your definition' to be errant.\n\n \n \nMontalban << That's not true. I gave you the title of a book called \"The Didache\" you quoted from something you now claim is about the Greek Language. \n \n \n Terral's reply << After further review, it appears I was in error. Please allow me to correct that mistake here. Here are your original words:\n \n \nMontalban's original statement << My church believes the later point. How do we determine which is true? We can look at how the early Christians themselves participated. Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" mentions the \"Eucharist\" (meaning Body of Christ...) \n \n \n Terral's correction << I mistakenly read your words to say \"Didache means the Eucharist (meaning the Body of Christ . . .) Please forgive my error. What I meant to challenge was your meaning of \"Eucharist!\" So your favorite novel mentions the Eucharist. Heh. What a convincing proof this is indeed. I cannot go to the Holy Text, nor the Greek Dictionary, to define this word for anyone, because it is not present in either. \n \n \nMontalban asks << What then is Scripture?\n\n \n Terral's reply << For the umpteenth time . . . The sixty-six books of your Bible, my Bible and the Holy Text of the third party reader. This is the 'Word of God,' and all of your novels (even your favorite one), and other uninspired writings ARE NOT! 'Bible Doctrine' comes from the sixty-six books of the Bible. \n \n \nMontalban tried desperately to confuse things << Scripture is either 'just words written' - i.e. script, in which case all the books written before 2 Tim are also script. Or, as I suggested, if you interpret it to mean Scripture - those scripts that are given authority, that's another thing. \n \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. This point is actually very simple. Prove to us what you can from what appears between the covers of your Bible. I must assume that you have one, and that it contains all 66 books that also just happen to be in the bibles of the rest of us. \n \n \nMontalban << For then we can look at any Scripture those authorities also deem to be good - and the same church that chose 2 Tim for the Bible did not reject the Didache, or Clement, or the books of Ignatius etc. They just didn't include them in the same anthology - which is what the Bible is. \n \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. God's Word = contents of your Bible. Everything else represented the uninspired words of men. True Bible Doctrines come from the Bible. The teachings of men come from all other sources, if they have no basis in God's Word. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << The words of 2Tim. 2:15 are compiled from the mouth of God. \n \n \n \nMontalban's reply << How do you know? Have you read any of the other books? I have (not all, of course). How do you know that God's hand is not at work in any of the others? \n \n \n Terral's reply << The words of Paul to Timothy are part of our Bible. All of the other sources you quote are not. The fact that you need these other sources to justify your doctrines is evidence that your faith is built upon sand, instead of the Rock Himself. This is your proof that God inspired Clement and the others? \"How do you know . . .?\" Do you hear that? In the background? The sound of laughter. Although, I must admit that you have plenty of gall to come into a Bible Doctrine forum with the intention of selling precepts of doctrine from your favorite novel, Clement and the like. \n \n \nMontalban just does not get it << What about Ignatius' works? Or, are you going to say God's not to be found there? \n \n \n Terral's reply << Please cease from beating that dead horse into bits. Is that the smell of fear in the air? What does Scripture say about this type of spiritual warfare? \"Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\" Eph. 6:13. And with this armor, God has given us what? Along with everything else, Paul writes, \"And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\" Eph. 6:17. \n \n The 'sword of the spirit' is the word of God, i.e., His Word and His truth. Again, please feel free to challenge this side of the debate with your toy swords and paper armor. \n \n \nMontalban << How do you know if Clement is not about the Bible? As stated, you're quite happy to quote from a concordance which you must believe is about the Bible. \n \n \n Terral's reply << About the Bible? Are all your arguments weak as this one? The strength of God's Word is magnified by the fact that we all translate from this one form of ancient Greek. After all, the words of the ancient language do not change like the words and phrases of our modern languages. Therefore, our 'biblical' terms should have the same meanings. The fact that Clement (or anyone else) wrote about the Bible does not make their word SCRIPTURE (God breathed). Your words and my words will never be God's Word. Our words are interpretations, and we are mere tutors of Christ. Now let's try and move on to something more substantial. \n \n \nMontalban << I suggest making up your mind about whether you're allowed to quote extra-biblical sources or not, and also to actually know if the one's you reject are in fact inspired by God. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Again, quote every source under the sun to prove your man-made doctrines. I will stand upon God's Word over the words of men. The third party reader is well capable of drawing his own conclusions.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Paul warns us, \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine (didaskalia; #1319); but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires\". 2Tim. 4:3.\n\n \n \nMontalban << So? What has St. Paul's words to do with the Didache? The Didache is also inspired by God. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Oh really? According to you maybe. I suppose if you gather together enough novels, you can make the case for just about anything. But will it stand in this Bible Doctrine Forum. I feel that you are totally unaware of just how foolish you appear. \n \n \nMontalban << St. Paul is not saying \"Reject all non-Biblical books\" simply because when he wrote, there was no Bible.\n\n \n Terral's reply << That's right, the 'perfect' (1Cor. 13:10) had yet to come. But, it is here now. As already quoted above, Paul warns us about 'they' who \"will not endure sound doctrine.\" You have certainly accumulated many teachers \"in accordance to\" your \"own desires.\" 2Tim. 4:3. If your bible teaches the same thing, then who can build a case against you? However, if your goal is to push man-made doctrines that only exist in your favorite novel, then do not expect that boat to float here. \n \n \nMontalban jests << You have some fear about the Didache, which you've probably never heard of until now. You are judging a book you know little about. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Fear? Heh. One Word from God is greater than everything that man has written. Please try to build a case from your Didache. Go ahead . . . make my day.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Men invented this \"Sacrament of the Eucharist\" mobo-jumbo, which is NOT found anywhere in Scripture. Your teachers had to distort the Greek to come up with such a thing. And even if this Greek word had been tied to the Lord's Passover ritual, Paul specifically says 'not' to do it. 1Cor. 11:20. Paul also writes, 'Therefore NO ONE is to act as your judge in regard to FOOD OR DRINK or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day -- things which are a {mere} SHADOW of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.' 2Cor. 2:16+17.\n\n \n \nMontalban's reply << Jesus said to \"Do this in memory of me\"\n\n \n Terral's reply << And in what context? Just how many Gentiles were present, when Christ was fulfilling this aspect of Mosaic Law? Was this before or after the crucifixion? Was this before or after Paul wrote, \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\"? (Rom. 10:4). And even if Christ was speaking to Gentiles (which He was not), and did indeed mean for them to 'do this in remembrance of Me,' He was still performing the rites of the Passover Supper. This ritual still performed by every practicing Jew (head of household) exactly one day every year on the Passover. Christ did this same ritual one day every year His entire adult life. If he lived in the house of His supposed father Joseph, then Joseph was the focus of everyone else in the house. \n \n There is absolutely no precedent anywhere in Scripture for performing this Mosaic ritual every Saturday or Sunday or any specific day of the week. Gentiles made up this mombo-jumbo to bring in membership from those who worshipped Aphrodite (Roman goddess Diana). Those groups of heathens practiced a 'love feast' ritual at every meeting, which played right into the hands of these newly formed denominations of Christianity. \n \n \nMontalban << St.Paul said not to do it just as a meal . . . \n \n \n Terral's reply << If you feel up to the challenge of debating on the topic of your Sacrament of the Eucharist, then please start a thread under that title. Who is really yellow here? And what is with this practice of adding St. in front of certain names? Are you unaware of the fact that all the saved are children of God? And all saints? \n \n What does Paul say? \"To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their {Lord} and ours.\" 1Cor. 1:2. And to the Romans, Paul writes, \". . . and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to {the will of} God.\" Rom. 8:27. The 'saints' represent all the saved. Peter and Paul are Apostles. Thus, \"the Apostle Paul said . . .\" That is the key feature that distinguishes Peter and Paul from you and me. \n \n \nMontalban trying to remove the 'not' from 1Cor. 11:20 << St.Paul is actually saying... in the context of the whole chapter, the very opposite of what you think he is saying.\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. Please send me a truckload of what you are selling here to fertilize my garden. \n \n \nMontalban << See THE EPISTLE OF S. CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS.\n\n \n Terral's reply << You are kidding right? Please, just the one truckload this year. Whatever bit of credibility you had with me just went right out the window. Anyone who reads this forum, and is taken in by such nonsense, is deserving of the same deluded fate. Please feel free to challenge anything I have written in the forum. Bring quotes from your novels, Clement, the Lion King or anything else 'you' feel supports your case for Bible Doctrine. \n \n Regards,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings Montalban and All:\n \n Terral opens << Montalban, please start a thread describing the Bible Doctrine of your \"Holy Eucharist.\" The points of that debate deserve their own thread, instead of being buried here. I can hardly write that very important post for you, as it does not appear anywhere in my Bible. But, I look very much forward to presenting the opposing views, and hearing your replies.\n \n \nMontalban << Please note Terral, your use of 1 Cor 11 deals not with the Eucharist, but with the \"Lord's Supper\" see below...\n\n \n Terral's reply << Nobody on this side of the debate has associated anything with the Eucharist. My Bible does not contain the term. You have taken a verb, turned it into a noun, and fashioned a man-made ritual out of it. It is the Apostle Paul who associates his words in 1Cor. 11:20 with the Lord's Last Passover Supper, before His crucifixion. The context is taken from the words that follow, \"For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread . . .\" 1Cor. 11:23. \n \n You can try to prove that Paul's words \"Lord's Supper\" = \"Love Feast Ritual\" if you like, but I am not buying it. No sir. Paul is telling the members of this Corinthian Church, that when they meet together, it is not to do the Lord's Supper (Lord's Last Passover Supper performed just prior to His crucifixion). \n \n \nMontalban << \"Various names used for the Holy Eucharist a) Mass This is derived from the Latin word ?missa?, used in the dismissal at the end of the Holy Eucharist in the Roman Catholic church. The Roman Catholic Church uses this name.\n\n \n Terral's reply << You have part right anyway. But what this man has to say will ruin the basis of your case. These words are taken from here: \n \n http://research.umbc.edu/~dkusic1/98reddell-report321.htm\n \n James Reddell writes << \"The term Mass comes from the Latin missa, meaning a 'gathering', 'congregation', 'mass of people'. Thus, the Mass is a gathering of people to worship God, as well as a celebration and commemoration (remembering) of the Last Supper, also known as the Communion, taken by Jesus Christ and his disciples.\" \n \n Terral continues << This fellow also equates the Catholic Mass with the Last (Lord's) Supper \"taken by Jesus Christ and his disciples just prior to His crucifixion. This is the same Lord's Supper that Paul addresses in 1Cor. 11:20. Missa = mass, and not Holy Eucharist. Also, we must conclude that this ritual is much more than a celebration and commemoration of the Lord's Last Supper performed at His Last Passover. Even members of their own congregations must meet certain standards in order to receive their Holy Communion. Been through a divorce? Forget about it. \n \n \nMontalban continues << b) Holy Communion The communion between Christ and men and also communion among men are meant here (1 Cor. 10:16,17). The Anglican Church and the Protestant Churches use this word.\n\n \n Terral's reply << As do the Catholics . . . Holy communion between Christ and men? What is that about? Let's look at Paul's words in context:\n \n \"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say. Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ? Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.\" 1Cor. 10:14-17.\n \n Paul is talking about blessing the food and drink at every meal, and not to any Holy Man-Made ritual. Creating a special Church Ritual out of the Lord's Last Supper is the IDOLATRY part he warns about. Paul is leading up to his descriptions about the fact that we ourselves are members of the body of Christ. \"Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.\" 1Cor. 12:27. Therefore, feeding people crackers and calling it the 'body of Christ' is contrary Scripture. What are we? Cannibals? Also, we should be mindful of the fact that Christ is our Intercessor to the Father Himself. As it is written, \n \n \". . . Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.\" Rom. 8:34. We have been joined to the Head, to be also joined to God. \"For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\" Col. 3:3. This joining is a spiritual operation of God that one undergoes by hearing and believing the gospel. As it is written, \n \n \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14. \n \n The Spirit of God also intercedes for us to God, \"And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to {the will of} God. And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to {His} purpose.\" Rom. 8:27+28.\n \n And, note again that it is not just Paul, Peter and Clement who are called 'saints' by Scripture. \"He intercedes for the saints . . . \" The common trait of these man-made rituals is that they all seek to replace an operation of the Spirit of God with the works of man. A man is going to hand me a piece of Christ? Heh. What does Paul say? \"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized INTO CHRIST have clothed yourselves with Christ.\" Gal. 3:26+27.\n \n \nMontalban << C) Holy Eucharist The word Eucharist comes from the Greek word \"Eucharistia,\" which means \"offering thanks.\" St. Paul says, \"when He had given thanks, he broke it.\" St. Paul does not say \"blessed.\" Giving thanks is the way of blessing (1. Cor. 11:24).\n\n \n Terral's reply << the Biblical Greek is \"Eucharisteo\" (#2168), and it simply means 'to be thankful' (from #2170 Eucharistos). And Christians commonly 'give thanks' at every meal. Nothing here justifies anything close to 'Holy Eucharist,' or any sacred ritual to be done at church. The cracker and wine ritual performed by certain denominations is derived from our Lord's Last Passover Supper in the Four Gospels. That is the same 'Lord's Supper' where the Apostle Paul says, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. Since Paul says to, \". . . eat at home . . . \" (1Cor. 11:34), that is where we 'give thanks.' As it is written, \"For AS OFTEN as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.\" 1Cor. 11:26. Again, we do this at every meal.\n \n \nMontalban << d) The Lord's Supper The Protestant Churches use this name. \n \n \n Terral's reply << The Apostle Paul uses the phrase in 1Cor. 11:20. \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" Paul himself proves this by his own words in 1Cor. 11:26. Again, we know that the Catholic's make the same assumptions, according to the words of Mr. James Reddell above.\n \n \nMontalban << In the Orthodox Churches, love-feast or \"Agape\" is different from Holy Eucharist. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Heh. This is certainly a strange and unusual little jewel. Perhaps you felt this statement important, because at the time Paul wrote these words, there were perhaps 100 times as many temples to Aphrodite in Greece than there were Christian churches. The average visitor to those temples would feast upon a wide range of exotic foods for a price, and then visit his favorite temple prostitute. \n \n \nMontalban << St. Paul says about the love-feast in 1 Cor. 11:20.\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. The words \"love feast\" are not present in the verse. Since it is impossible to remove the negative from the Greek, you simply re-work the meaning of 'Lord's Supper' into something negative. You say that the Apostle Paul is actually saying not to participate in this Love Feast ritual. Again, no way Hosea, and not even a good try. The Greek does not agree with you, and neither do I. \n \n \nMontalban << e) Mystery: Eastern Orthodox Churches use the word 'Mystery' for Holy Eucharist, the word which comes from the Greek word 'Mysterion.' They call all sacraments 'the mysteries of the church.' \n \n \n Terral's reply << Hey, a half point here for accuracy (musterion; from 3453 mueo; to shut the mouth), but, from where do you derive the word 'sacrament?' This should prove interesting. \n \n \nMontalban << The word mystery means the hidden reality The fulness of the saving acts of God, hidden in olden days was manifested through the only begotten Son. \n \n \n Terral's reply << That is a bit of a stretch. The word mystery (Greek musterion, #3466) means \"a mystery or secret doctrine.\" Holman's Expository Dictionary. Anyone can look up the Greek here:\n \n http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines.pl?tofrom=m\n \n Vine says, \"Topic: Mystery <3466,musterion< \n primarily that which is known to the mustes, \"the initiated\" (from mueo, \"to initiate into the mysteries;\" cp. Phil. 4:12, mueomai, \"I have learned the secret,\" RV). In the NT it denotes, not the mysterious (as with the Eng. word), but that which, being outside the range of unassisted natural apprehension, can be made known only by Divine revelation, and is made known in a manner and at a time appointed by God, and to those only who are illumined by His Spirit.\"\n \n \nMontalban << We participate in this saving acts of God today, through our participation in the mysteries. Sacraments in general and Holy Eucharist in particular, are referred to, by the word 'mystery.' The bread and wine become the body and blood of our Lord in a manner not comprehensible to human senses. Hence it is a 'mystery.'\n\n \n Terral's reply << We can agree on some of that part. Scripture says, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16) is itself \"according to the revelation of the mystery.\" Rom. 16:25. \n \n This Holy Eucharist deal has nothing at all to do with descriptions of the 'mystery' in my Bible, and we are saved by God's grace through obedience to the gospel. The only places in the Four Gospels where the word 'mystery' appears are in Matt. 13:11 (mysteries of the kingdom of heaven), Luke 8:10 (mysteries of the kingdom of God) and Mark 4:11 (mystery of the kingdom of God). This is no 'mystery' associated with the Lord's Last Passover Supper at all. Paul makes two references in this first letter to the Corinthians (chapter 2 and 15), but nothing close to where you would like. Please clarify this point using Scripture. \n \n \nMontalban << Your quoting of St.Paul in fact shows that Protestants have it essentially wrong - for they (many of them) only partake of a celebratory meal. St. Paul says, if you're hungry eat at home, if you think of this as something OTHER than the Body of Christ, you are sinning.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Well, it is difficult to place all Protestants into one barrel, but my quoting of the Apostle Paul is a simple statement of the Biblical facts. \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. I do not add to it, nor take away from it. I do not translate \"Lord's Supper\" into \"Love Feasts,\" or anything else. We say grace at every meal and bless our food. Any eating at church in my experience was done after services during fellowship time. Nobody makes any big deal over food and drink, according to the Apostle Paul's commands in Col. 2:16+17. \n \n \nMontalban << It would be handy if you address the argument, not an argument you think I am making.\n\n \n Terral's reply << I believe we both are making clear presentations of our opposing views. \n \n \nMontalban << Another example of this is where you question my contention about the Didache containing the \"Eucharist\". I said the word is to be found in the book. \n \n \n Terral's reply << Actually, you said, \"Another early Christian work, \"The Didache\" *mentions the \"Eucharist\" (meaning Body of Christ...). That point was addressed in the last post. If I bring up a title that mentions the tooth fairy, does that make it true? \n \n \nMontalban << Sadly you do some weird analysis of the title of the book to show that Didache does not mean Eucharist, which is in fact not an argument I've made. It's one of the oddest re-workings of an argument of mine yet. \n \n \n Terral's reply << That was my mistake, a thousand pardons for misreading '*mentioned' as 'meaning.' An honest mistake. \n \n BTW, before you said of \"Eucharist\" (meaning Body of Christ). In this recent post, you said, \"The word Eucharist comes from the Greek word \"Eucharistia,\" which means \"offering thanks.\" Please note carefully again that the original Greek here is a verb, and you are using it as a noun. What will your Eucharist mean by the time we discuss this again? I like your re-worked version better than the first. Keep reworking it and perhaps one day we shall agree.\n \n Regards,\n \n Terral",

   "Hi Montalban and All:\n \n \nMontalban << Terral, as you refuse to stop calling me Greek Orthodox, I want no further part of this debate.\n \n \n Terral's reply << This is clearly an excuse, Montalban. Perhaps the heat in the kitchen became a bit unbearable? My instructions to you were not to come into the deep side of the pool, but to remain knee deep in the shallows, least you be swallowed whole. Now that you realize this to be absolute fact, not only have you retreated back to the kiddy side, but have been seen by others leaving the building, and running for your life. And this from a guy who said to me, \n \n \n\"Originally Posted by Montalban << I will however debate in favour of Holy Tradition and Apostolic Succession, both of which, incidentally are Biblical.\" \n \n \n \nAnd, \"Montalban << However I like a challenge.\" \n \n \n \nAnd he says to me, \"Montalban << If the heat's getting to hot, you're free to leave the kitchen.\" Haaa. What a baby. \"Mommy, he called me names.\"\n\n \n Terral << Listen up . . . boy. Yes, that is how you are acting. You appreciate the outside writers on various subjects. Let's see how they divide modern Christianity. Let's go here: \n \n http://www.christianchallenge.org/ask/CatholicProtestantDiff.html\n \n The pastor writes, << \"There are three major divisions in the Christianity, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Protestant. The term Protestant is sort of a generic term for denominations who are neither Roman Catholic nor Greek Orthodox. (Greek Orthodox has a number of branches who are in communion with one another.)\"\n \n Terral continues << Montalban has told us, \n \n \nMontalban << \"Just a thought, do you think that I'm a Roman Catholic? I'm not.\" \n \n \n Okay, that means you do not belong with the first group. Is Montalban a Protestant? With statements like this, \n \n \nMontalban << \"Protestantism makes everyone a Pope.\"\n \n \n I would definitely conclude that he is not. Guess what Montalban? You are out of categories. Montalban makes eloquent statements like this, \n \n \nMontalban << \"Indeed, and that's what Orthodoxy does. It uses Biblical and extra-biblical quotes to support itself. There is nothing in Orthodoxy that is anti-Biblical.\" \n \n \n And yet, he is offended to the point of removing himself from this debate, because someone called him Greek Orthodox. \n \n \nMontalban caught telling a lie << \"No I do not! I am an Orthodox Christian. The Orthodox Church has many component parts, of which one is the Greek.\" \n \n \n Terral's reply << Bullony, Montalban. The Greek Orthodox Church has many component parts, just like the other two major divisions of Christianity. After over 20 years of debating God's Word, I cannot tell you are deluded or just a yellow liar. Yes, my words here are a bit tough, but I we have had the privilege of reading your words to others on this thread.\n \n \nMontalban wrote, \"Orthodox view Protestants and Catholics as different sides of the same coin.\" \n \n \n Terral's reply << Here you seem to understand the three main divisions of Christianity very well, and you feel confident enough to assess the view of Protestants and Catholics from the perspective of the Orthodoxy. Now come back out here and admit to everyone that you are part of the Greek Orthodox division of Christianity. Of these things I am absolutely sure: \n \n 1. Your intentions here are not to debate Bible Doctrine, but to do everything possible to lead everyone into believing that your 'Extra-Biblical' sources = Scripture. \n \n 2. Your demeanor towards others who disregard Clement, \"The Didache,\" and the like, as uninspired writings, is revolting, and you attack them personally to entice the third party reader into believing that they are somehow uneducated and stupid. Well, who is looking that way today?\n \n 3. When the Greek does not say what you are saying, then you rework it until your points appear to have merit. The perfect example is where you change \"Lord's Supper\" into \"Love Feasts\" in 1Cor. 11:20. And then have the gall to say, \n \n \nMontalban << \"St. Paul is actually saying... in the context of the whole chapter, the very opposite of what you think he is saying.\"\n \n \n 4. Your view is that the interpretations of your teachers mean more than the Word of God. You wrote, \n \n \nMontalban << \"SO, not ALL scripture is what is meant in 2 Tim, but all APPROVED scripture. NOTE: Clement was written prior to, not only 2 Tim, but before the compilation of the Bible. St. Clement, like St. Ignatius was taught by St. Peter. I believe that Clement too was written with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.\" \n \n \n Then you conclude: \n \n \nMontalban << \"I have no problem with accepting the Bible as presented to us by this Church, but it seems rather silly not to accept any of the other books they also offer.\" \n \n \n \nMontalban << Ignorance is no excuse, I explained I'm not Greek Orthodox. You seemed genuinely concerned I was calling you Protestant, but you don't want to give me the same respect.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Sticks and stones, Montalban. I am a big boy, and have experienced far worse. You speak of knowing Anglican Dogma, but I have been physically removed from their churches for teaching the truth. These sandals have kicked off the dust from European cities, and I have actually been there and debated the word. You seem totally unaware that the denomination you follow is part of the Greek Orthodox division, and you call me ignorant. \n \n I told you from the beginning, \"Please feel free to attack me personally, distort the Greek, lean on your old history pals, and anything else you can think of to lead the third party reader's mind away from the fact that you are in no way prepared to give us a thoughtful reply to either of those posts.\" Go Ahead . . . Make My Day. One side of this debate is standing firm, according to Paul's words in Eph. 6:13. The other side is heading for the hills.\n \n I understand your feelings there Montalban. Although, if the shoe fits . . . wear it. This Last Supper discussion obviously has you on the run. The old temple services to the Greek Goddess Aphrodite certainly appear to play a large role in your Eucharistic ritual. How do you answer the facts pertaining to Eucharisteo\" (#2168; 'to be thankful'), and how you have taken a verb and transfigured it into a noun, and your Holy Eucharistic Ritual? How do you justify performing this same ritual over and over and over again, week after week, month after month, year after year, when even Christ Himself did it only once a year on the Passover? Who is really eating the Love Feast ritual at every meeting? You are Montalban. \n \n What does Paul say? \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Love Feast?\" 1Cor. 11:20. No, the steward of this dispensation says, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. He also tells these same Corinthians this, in the same letter, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38.\n \n The superiors from the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Churches feel themselves authorized from God Almighty to decide who is and is not allowed to partake in their daily Holy Communion (Eucharist) offerings. They sit and judge over one another to decide which members are good enough, and which have crossed the line of the most dreaded . . . excommunication. Are we on the same page here? Ex-communication. Do you all see the communion in that word? Has anyone reading these words been excommunicated from any of these denominations? \n \n Paul tells us all, (CAPS for emphasis) \"Therefore NO ONE is to act as YOUR JUDGE in regard to FOOD OR DRINK or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a SABBATH DAY -- things which are a {mere} SHADOW of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.\" Col. 2:16+17. But they are simply handing out crackers and grape juice, and we are already members of the body of Christ. Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, Eph. 5:30, etc..\n \n And, I have done my best to lead everyone into God's Word, as their ONLY source for Bible Doctrine. Paul solemnly warns us about being taken in by others who seek to delude us with the teachings and traditions of men. He writes, \n \n \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.\" 2Tim. 4:3+4.\n \n Final note to Montalban << Should you ever feel up to the task of engaging me in this or any forum of debate, be most careful to choose your words more carefully, and keep them soft . . . because, you will most certainly eat them with your waffers and whine. \n \n Best advice: Choose smaller prey.\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

Thank you again, BTW.\n \n ------------------------------------\n \n \nThank You \n \n Hi Waxy:\n \n Thank you for the excellent presentation.

Shame on me.\n \n Lesson learned,\n \n Terral\n-------------------------------\n \n \nWaxy << That's some world class hypocrisy there terral03. \n \n \n This situation is a horse of a different color. Mr. Montalban and I have been exchanging ten page posts on precepts of Bible Doctrine, Christian History, etc.. As my post says, he came to me with statements like, \"If the heat's getting to hot, you're free to leave the kitchen. Haaa. What a baby. Mommy, he called me names.\" So he was egging me on. When I cornered him on just about every point, he responded by leaving the kitchen himself, and over being called a Greek Orthodox? So the hypocrisy charge is better laid upon Montalban. \n \n \nWaxy << The entire post was colorful in its arrogance though. \n \n \n Your accusation here has merit. Guilty as charged. I am the first to admit that we have been emotionally engaged in this discussion, and when emotion takes part then we tend to make mistakes. My mistake was becoming overly emotional over the accusations of ignorance, when he said, \"Ignorance is no excuse.\" Another mistake was made, when the debate over the \"Holy Communion/Eucharist\" was not taken to another thread, which was Billco's ( 08-04-2004, 06:49 PM; Post #38) point from the beginning. However, in my own defense, I asked Montalban to take this to another thread. \". . . but please start a thread describing that particular Bible Doctrine.\" (08-06-2004, 02:28 PM). And even to the point of naming my response, \"Please Start Your Own Thread On The Holy Eucharist,\" with the opening, \"Terral opens << Montalban, please start a thread describing the Bible Doctrine of your \"Holy Eucharist.\" \n \n Thank you again for making your presence known in the Bible Doctrine forum. While you may not possess the skills to present and defend any actual Bible Doctrines, you certainly have every right to stop in and take jabs at those who take these things seriously. Please feel free to drop by and poke at me again, when you have another twenty-eight words and plenty of smiley faces to spare. But, allow me this opportunity to present one verse of Scripture, which I believe applies to third party readers in your position. \n \n \"Behold, you scoffers, and marvel and perish; for I am accomplishing a work in your days, a work which you will never believe, though someone should describe it to you.\" Acts 13:41.\n \n Thanks again,\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "Waxy, there is no need to reply to Terral. It is true I used the 'heat/kitchen' phrase, (Post 45) but that is different to actually ignoring his arguments, as he does mine.\n \n He calls this 'egging him on', therefore he believes I am responsible for his actions in being insulting... note this was when was was challenging me to defend Catholic dogma, which I see no need to do - this is because it took many posts to get through to him that I'm not Catholic... He was basically being rude for me not wanting to defend Catholic notions of Papal Supremecy, which I don't believe in anyway. More specifically, because he introduced into a JW debate certain arguments against Catholicism, and because I didn't answer these, he got upset. I then pointed out that it was he who introduced these into the argument, and that he should basically get out.\n \n I have said I'm not Greek Orthodox, but he insists on calling me this.\n \n Post 37 Terral introduced into this debate on JWs his post containing a large tract against Catholicism\n \n I had said\n \nJWs have to ignore a lot of the Bible\n\n \n He replied\n \nWe agree, but the Catholics are no better. Holy Scripture shows Peter still going to the circumcised (Israel) twenty years after the crucifixion. ?And recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we {might} {go} to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.? Galatians 2:7-9 (9). Paul wrote these words almost thirty years after the crucifixion, about events that took place in Acts 15. \n \n The Bible itself never places Peter anywhere near Rome. In fact, examine the letters of Peter, John and James very carefully. None of them address the Gentiles in the first person at all. Peter is writing to Jews only, ?But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR {God's} OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.? 1Peter 2:9 (OT parts in CAPS).\n\n \n Billsco picked up on this irreleavncy in post #38\n \n I stated post #39 there was no point directing specifically anti-Catholic stuff at me. He replied (Post #40), stating he had believed I was Catholic, because I'd quoted a Catholic source.\n \n \nThe assumption was made, because of your selection of supporting links like this from your post: \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp \n\n \n I stated I was Orthodox\n Then the hole got deeper...Post #43\n \nThank you for making this clear. By professing to be an Orthodox Christian, you really mean Greek Orthodox. Please herd me into the non-denominational crowd, as none of the Protestants would have me.\n\n \n Post #45\n \nNo I do not! I am an Orthodox Christian.\n\n \n And deeper!\n \nAn outsider would say that Christianity is divided into three lumps of dough; Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Protestant; to which you belong to the second lump\n\n \n But then he's also added things to quotes...\n \nAnd this from a guy who said to me,...\n And he says to me, ?Montalban << If the heat's getting to hot, you're free to leave the kitchen.? Haaa. What a baby. ?Mommy, he called me names.?\n\n For the record, he included several words in a quote that I didn't make. Everything after and including Haaa is Terral's own addition. Honest quoting doesn't come into Terral's post.\n \n Further he still can't understand that Orthodoxy consists of Greek Orthodox, but Greek Orthodox is not all of Orthodoxy, no more than the USA contains California, but California is not all of the USA - I'm trying to 'dumb down' my analogies in order to get this point through to someone who is having a tremedous amount of difficulty on what is a relatively simple point.\n \n I would not expect him to actually admit that he's been often caught out refuting the wrong thins, especially the title of a book :)\n \n He picked up on a supposed spelling mistake. I pointed out that Australian- English follows different spelling conventions - that of English-English, rather than American-English.\n \n He keeps arguing about 1 Cor 11 and \"The Lord's Supper\" in a retaliation to the concept of the Eucharist. Even though these are, to Orthodox, different things, so he's refuting the wrong thing.\n \n This pales in comparison to his gem of illogical argument... he refuted \"The Didache\" based on the meaning of the title, and not what the book contained - which is what I argued; that it contains the Eucharist. Oddly enough although he believes in the Trinity, and the word Trinity doens't appear in the NT, he denies the Eucharist, based on the fact it's mentioned only once. He applies the same rule - lack of the actual word, in two totally different ways. Both are accepted; the Trinity and the Eucharist, because the concept is there.\n \n In summary, I make arguments, and he refutes something else. I state I'm Orthodox, he brands me a particular type of Orthodox. In fact he seems to miss half of what I say.",

This one is being terribly misused, and we should move on. What you are saying above is simply untrue. I quoted references to show your error, and you choose to ignore them. All of this 'consists of this and that' is hogwash. \n \n Let's ask the Pastor:\n \n http://www.christianchallenge.org/ask/CatholicProtestantDiff.html\n \n Here is his reply:\n \n \nThere are three major divisions in the Christianity, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Protestant. The term Protestant is sort of a generic term for denominations who are neither Roman Catholic nor Greek Orthodox. (Greek Orthodox has a number of branches who are in communion with one another.)\n\n \n Here is another:\n \n http://www.answerbag.com/q_view.php/1598\n \n \nThere are three branches of the Christian church: Catholicism, Greek Orthodox, and Protestantism. \n \n Catholicism and Greek Orthodox  are the oldest. I am not a Church historian in any way. But I believe that these two branches came out of the original Church, or evolved, seperately. They did not split from each other. Greek Orthodoxy is not as prominent in North America as it is in other parts of the world, and is the smallest of the three branches.\n\n \n Here is an article describing the break between the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Church:\n \n http://jtf27.tripod.com/ltc-2.htm\n \n Here is part of the paragraph:\n \n \nThe process started slowly after the first council, and was delayed in Europe by the fall of Western Empire in 476 CE. In 554 CE Justinian had restored the Roman Empire in the West which would eventually become known as the Holly Roman Empire. He began to use the full weight of the civil authority to enforce Council decrees. On August 14 540AD Justinian formally recognised the Pope's power over civil authority. This date in a real sense marks the beginning of the Catholic Church as we see it today. It also marks in a real sense the split between the Greek Orthodox  and the Catholic Church.\n\n \n This is the way I have understood the three major divisions of Christianity my entire life. Obviously others learned it the same way. You can agree or disagree, but to come out here and try to belittle me and my views (dumb down) is very unkind indeed. The fact is that most of the parrot dribble you type is not worth anyone's time. You have already been left to your own devices. \n \n You are a Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Protestant or Non-denominational Christian. Take your pick, because those are the only divisions. You should know that all the divisions began through the major civilizations from the times that the Bible was written. It is written in Greek for God sakes, because that was the language of commerce for the whole known world; like English today. Rome (iron age) was the center of the greatest civilization of that day; surpassing Greece (bronze age). Where do you think your church started? Over there in Australia? \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "Proofs for a Trinity\n \n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held.\n \n Jesus and God are united:\n \n Ignatius' Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n \n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n They are one\n \n I John 5:7\n \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n \n Jesus said John 10:38\n But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" \n \n They are of one accord\n John 5:21\n For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. \n \n Jesus is equal to God\n Colossians 1:19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n Jesus has the power and wisdom of God\n 1 Cor 1:24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Jesus is eternal like God\n Hebrews 13:8 \n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.\n \n \n Jesus Himself commanded\n Matthew 28:19\n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\n In this passage, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are said to share one name (notice that the term \"name\" is singular, not plural), and that name is almost certainly Yahweh, the personal name of God in the Bible. We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. \n \n Peter tells us, \"David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is \"the Lord\" who speaks to \"my Lord,\" Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, \"Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. \n \n In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: \"[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\" This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: \"I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? \" Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will \"confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh.\" The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). \n \n Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh (\"I AM,\" in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\" His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. \"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple\" (John 8:59). \n \n With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. \n \n The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp\n \n \n Ignatius...\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n God and Jesus, Jesus and God. He says Jesus is the only Son of God, no mention that Satan is a co-creation equal to Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God, He is also God.\n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n\n \n Right on!
