   "Japan has missed many good chances to improve its relations with its neighbors, and this year the time comes for Japan to admit his wrongdoings and attitude when the whole world celebrate the 60th anniversary of WWII victory. Japan should apologize to Asian countries and their people, who suffered so much during the WWII. The apology is not just words, but should be the real deeds. Thus Japan and its neighbors can let the bygones be bygones. Asian people should work together for a peaceful, prosperous Asia. \n However, up to now, we didn't see any true deeds of apology from Japanese politicians. It will be no good if Japan can't realize the importance.",
