   "In other words, the idiotic idea that markets are rational and self-correcting.\n \n Of course, it came from the economically-and-intellectually-challenged pointy-headed school of thought out of the University of Chicago.\n \n However, behavioral economists -- Richard H. Thaler, also at the University of Chicago and Robert J. Shiller, Yale -- have convincingly showed that mass psychology, herd behavior , etc., have more of an effect on stock prices, the mass hysteria effect. Perhaps the market isn't quite so efficient after all.\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/business/06nocera.html\n \n Mass hysteria seems more a factor in stock prices than anything else.\n \n You call that rational?\n \n According to Jeremy Grantham, a respected market strategist with GMO, an institutional asset management company:\n \nThe incredibly inaccurate efficient market theory was believed in totality by many of our financial leaders, and believed in part by almost all. It left our economic and government establishment sitting by confidently, even as a lethally dangerous combination of asset bubbles, lax controls, pernicious incentives and wickedly complicated instruments led to our current plight. 'Surely, none of this could be happening in a rational, efficient world,' they seemed to be thinking. And the absolutely worst part of this belief set was that it led to a chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking.\n\n \"The incredibly inaccurate efficient market theory was believed in totality by many of our financial leaders...\" That would be boneheaded Alan Greenspan, a rejected but still besotted would-be lover of Ayn Rand.",

   "The efficient markets hypothesis is incorrect, I think even the chicago school knows it's incorrect, but they believe it is suitable for the kind of mathematical modelling that's their methodological approach. The efficient markets hypothesis isn't about markets being \"self-correcting\", if they're perfectly efficient, they never need \"correcting\" to begin with, because they're never wrong.\n \n Ayn Rand's connection with economics is largely with the Austrian school, she was familiar with the work of Ludwig von Mises, although in later years Rothbard was extremely critical of the cult that sprung up around her, and her support of McCarthyism and the Vietnam war. The Austrians ardently oppose the efficient markets hypothesis.\n \n Alan Greenspan headed a government organisation that is basically based on the premise that markets are not an efficient way of determining the supply of money, that instead a central bank needs to do it.\n \n I think it's worth quoting Rand, \n \n \"Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, &#8216;Account overdrawn.&#8217;&#8221; \n \n pretty much sums up what's happening to the US about now.",
