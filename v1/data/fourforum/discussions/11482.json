   "but everyone argues what's true and false in the bible and what the bible condems, what's a sin, and many different things. when i look around this tread, i see so many negitive and angry replies to everything. almost in every thread you have people arguing over facts dealing with relgion or daily life; how they use god against one another and try to tell them what's right. it might be just me, but i really dont think god (if there is one) would want his fellow men fighting against eachother even if someone is wrong or someone's right. if a person is wrong, wouldn't he let them know in some way that wasn't in the form of anger?\n \n i dunno that's just my view of it. not trying to tick anyone off.",

   "There are abundant examples in the bible where God exhibits insurmountable jealousy and rage at the humanity he created. Start with Eden and the condemnation of all mankind. Look at the Noachian flood and the extermination of all life bar a handful. Look at the endless slaughter in battles.\n \n But God loves you!\n \n Perhaps now you can see why so-called Christians can be at each other's throats depending on how they interpret the bible. If the bible truly is the Word of God, then it shouldn't need interpreting, should it?",

   "It's an old forum with a long posting history on hot topics.\n \n The core problem is that the religious ones keep trying to prove science wrong, except that they usually fail right at the start because they have no idea what they're talking about (showing various bits of ignorance, like that light has a speed and similar), and many other, more scientifically inclined, posters have tried correcting them so many times already, only to find out they just won't listen.\n \n So it becomes an issue of shouting at one another without anyone hearing anyone else...",

   "I'm seeing a pattern with your threads. My advice, let go of worrying whether your opinions will offend anyone. Its not your job to be an emotional babysitter. If you are passionate about what you believe in, don't worry about breaking a few eggs along the way. This is an adult forum generally and the level of maturity is well above the average online communities I've participated in. So don't think you're doing people any favors by going out of your way to be gentle to other peoples feelings. And don't expect any favors either. I'd advise you to be a little tougher on us, we can take it :-)\n \n With that said, if the bible is true in the slightest, then we give God a lot more credit than he deserves. The bible says that God sent satan to inhabit the earth, then, when he decked out the planet and put adam in the presidental suites known as the garden on eden, he yanked his paradise out from under mankind within what must have been a matter of days because of adam's single slip up. The bible also says that God loves us. The bible says that God annihilated the entire world population except for noah and his family. The bible also says that he won't judge mankind until the final judgement day. Whether you accept the bible as what it is or not is up to you. But read the fine print before you buy. \n \n As far as religion affects the world today, in my view it has its positives and negatives. More charity work is done in the name of religion than any other cause. More slaughter is committed in the name of religion than any other cause. Religion has brought hope and fulfillment to millions, and has caused oppression and suffering for millions. In my view, it sort of balances out. \n \n Its similar to a lot of people's opinion of God concerning heaven and hell. Is God evil if he sends people to hell, yet good if he sends people to heaven? If God sent one person to hell and everybody else to heaven, would he be evil? Or how about if he only sent bad people to hell? It balances out, that's the way I see it.",
