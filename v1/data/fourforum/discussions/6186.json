   "read this article and tell me what you think.\n \n Also answer some of the questions:\n Is it ok for a vegetarian to eat clone meat from an animal that has not been killed?\n Would cloning meat solve world wide hunger? End food shortages?\n Would it be able to stop the mass slaughtering of animals for meat?\n Would it be just morally wrong?\n \n Personally I think it would be great. Hopefull it would taste the same as the real thing. And some of my friends are vegetarian who don't eat meat because of the slaughter of animals would probably eat this new clone. Hopefully this would stop the mass killing of animals on farms but I dont think it would solve world hunger. And no I don't think its wrong no animal dies from the cloning.",
