I shouldnt be wasting time debating you on this non-issue, but for some odd reason I am.\n\n \n Let me clarify your misunderstanding. I do not believe good citizens should carry firearms for protection. They should be ALLOWED if they want to. That is the purest form of freedom, being allowed to decide for yourself.\n \n Again, to clarify your misunderstanding. I do not believe the government sould prohibt the behavior. Again the most purest form of freedom, being not prohibited. The airlines can decide for themselves if they want customers to have a firearm on thier PRIVATE property. The airlines are not public, they are private. You can not force another person or corporation to do something they do not want to do. Forcing someone to do something against thier will is textbook slavery. I would not want pro-gun owners to force airlines to accept passengers with guns.\n \n When an airline decides not to have passengers carry firearms, then I will find another airline, or take another option. We do not need to government to step in. The airlines know what is good for themselves. If they start to loose passengers because they gun bans, then that is too bad. It is thier choice. If airlines get more passengers with banned guns, then so be it. If all the others airlines follow suit, so be it. That is the purest form of freedom. Everyone decides what is best for themselves. If a gun owner wants to carry a gun and all the airlines ban them. So be it, the gun owner is out of luck. That is the purest form of freedom. \n \n In my case there is no moral dilemma, there is no special case, there is no violation of anyones rights.\n \n The last posts do not even come close to an argument. All you have is \"your and idiot\" and \"that is retarded\".\n \n Please convince me I am wrong without a moral delimma, a special case, or a violation of anyones rights.",

   "Man oh man, there are two threads spewing this idiotic idea of bringing guns onto planes? Do you guys even realize that if the terrorists really are suicidal that they would be fine with simply crashing the plane? Lets say you have only 3 terrorists on board and they are just casually walking around with their guns like everyone else on the plane. Suddenly one makes a run for it into the cockpit, shoots the pilots, shoots the controls, while the other two are shooting into the crowd. Now the plane is doomed. Or how about if they opened fire into the windows and walls of the plane? That won't be easy to fix. Or what if they simply put a homemade bomb inside one of their guns and blew that up on the plane?\n \n Out numbered 100 to 1 it is my opinion that the terrorist will have the upper hand because he will have planned what he is doing and no one else will be aware of what is happening until it is already done. On a plane, it is especially volatile and everyone seems to be assuming that there will be people everywhere willing to stop a terrorist. My guess is that the terrorist would act when half of them are sleeping and the other half or working or eating. I also would guess that almost none of them would want to have a gun anyways. There are families there who would refuse guns and there would be business people who are content working on laptops, not handling a gun. Lets say that maybe 10% of the people have guns. How hard would it be to assume that half of those would be terrorists and it would basically be a 1 on 1 against people who are unprepared? And how many of those people with guns who are not terrorist will accidentally fire a shot per year? Can you picture it now, a man accidentally shoots a child on board a plane. The child's father shoots the man and other not knowing what is happening shoot the father while others shoot back at the guy who just shot the father. Wow, now that would be exciting! I can't wait to see guns on board a plane.\n \n Now come back to reality people. This idea makes zero sense on a plane. I know for sure there would be a no gun section that would be very extensive to accommodate those who refuse to be anywhere near guns which will be maybe 90% of all people who fly. The only realistic idea that there is would be to give pilots guns and guards on the plane guns. Giving the average person a gun on a freaking plane is absolutely insane.",

It is no simple matter to watch your back aboard a plane even if you have a gun. I assure you the good citizen is not going to play fair when they are dealing with terrorist. They are going to attack from concealment and from behind.\n\n \n First off lets assume that if you are allowed to bring guns on board, then the terrorist will be wearing bullet proof vests just for protection. Also they will have the additional help from being organized and having a plan. They will likely have more ammo, they will likely have better guns, they will likely be better trained, they will likely be more willing to use them, and they will be more willing to die than the common person on the plane. All this will work towards their advantage. Plus they may not even want to know who has a gun. Maybe they will take the policy of shoot first and ask questions later. If they want to 9/11 the plane into a building, what do they care if everyone on board is dead already? So your theory that average citizens will defeat the terrorists is a hope. Maybe a 50/50 chance?\n \n Even if it is a 90/10 chance of victory the risks are still too great. Right now if terrorists took another plane, do you think they would have any better odds than this? I think at this time people would be willing to go hand to hand with terrorists or hand to knife or hand to gun. The terrorists won't have a huge supply of ammo if they were to get a gun on board, they would likely have weak guns compared to what they would have with your idea, they would be lightly armored if at all, they would maybe have knives but the average person will have an ink pen that is a good substitute for one in that sort of situation, and I don't think any terrorist is going to even want to risk going up against 30 or 40 angry passengers as long as they are basically unarmed. I'd say we have a system in place right now and passengers on board planes right now that will solve the terrorist threat for the most part.\n \n \nIt is not about your trust. It is about freemen allowed to control thier own destiny. Lack of trust is not a good enough reason to restrict someones rights. You must be able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before you start to take rights away from a person.\n\n \n For you its about that. Are you more important than anyone else who will be on the plane? How many people on the plane will have their family with them including kids? Will they be able to be as care free about guns being on the plane as you seemingly are? I bet your thinking that every single person feels comfortable around guns, right? I bet you think that guns are everyone's passion and they would all love to bring one on board a plane because it truly makes them feel safe. I'd love to see a study done on this because the numbers would be against you in a bad way. But I'm sure you don't care. You just have this insane idea that makes no sense and since you consider yourself and people like you more important than the vast majority, you feel your ideas are perfect and without flaws. Fine, you go tell some Joe Blow business man to get on a plane with 30 guys stroking guns. Tell a few elderly people to bring guns with them when they get on the plane. Ask children to bring Gun Bingo along with them as they name the guns they see being carried freely around the plane. Does this all sound reasonable to you? I'm sure it does!\n \n \n\"Crazy\" is not a good enough reason to restrict a persons rights. Only 1 group of people have thier rights automatically taken away: convicted criminals.\n\n \n Convicted criminals only? Hey lets assume your on a plane with your family, assuming you have one. Lets say a person with a clean criminal record is sitting behind you with his gun aimed squarely at your kid or father or whatever. What will you do about this? How about if he starts acting a little crazy and starts waving it around as his eyes roll back in his head and you hear him chant something about being Satan's chosen one? You still alright? He starts sweating and gripping the gun tighter and fingers the trigger. His eyes are getting wider and wider as his pupils dilate. I bet your thinking ah, the sweet feeling of complete safety. *Bang*\n \n Oh, but this won't happen to you though, right? It will happen to someone else, so why should you be concerned? Let the crazy and suicidal bring guns on board as well.\n \n You want to debate that this could happen without guns on a plane? Fine, be my guest. I doubt you will be able to find one case of it.\n \n \nThe legally insane and spouse batters also get their rights taken away. The insane after a judge declares them insane. Wife abusers only after a judge says so. NEVER before.\n\n \n Sweet. Lets also not try to discriminate against the Arabs walking onto the plane in a huge pack with about 5 guns each, full body armor, and their last will and testament at their sides.

Do you debate this?\n\n \n \n ok, so if American's have a 90% chance of coming out on top on a Hijacking senerio (assuming all hijackings are suicidial to begin with) once it's began, you'd have to honestly beleive that hijacking attmpts would rise by 900% as a result of letting peopel bring guns on airliners.\n \n i contend that the terrorist hijackers who want us all dead CAN NOT muster 900% more terrorists trained well enough to pull off another set of 9-11 attacks.\n \n and even if they COULD bring 170 terrorists to bear instead of just 17, 300 million americans will survve over 170 terrorists. most exspecially if 153 of them wind up dead in the middle of their attempt. that's 153 WASTED terrorists. terrorists that were trained, that infiltrated the US, evaded detection and capture, and got on a plane and initiated their plan.\n \n the terrorists do NOT have those kind of resources to waste. It would be a better use of their resources to shoot up schools, burn down orphanages, blow up pizza parlors, and poison water supplies.\n \n or, actually, it would be a better use of their resources to do something CONSTRUCTIVE with their time, but thats getting off point.\n \n \n \n also remember that the 9-11 hijackers only had a 75% success rate because some of the passengers FOUGHT BACK.",

(gasp!). Listen up... We have a choice. If an Airline refuses to allow me to bring my hammer er I mean my gun on the plane it is MY CHOICE as to wether I get on or not. <- Period. That does not preclude the Airlines culpability if it is hijacked and sent into a building as they would be partially negligent for the deaths of the people in the building had they not provided the airplane with adequate security (armed pilots and stewardesses, etc) This of course should not be translated into aboslute security as even if every pilot, stewardess, and other employee were all packing MP5s and yet the terrorists succseed it would be reasonable to say in that case the private industry did all it could and they should start the lessons learned proccess perhaps with voluntary government help (military trainers etc) the key being voluntary. It is the same for guns themselves... If my brand new Kimber Ultra Eclipse II blows up in my hand because of shoddy workmanship (not likley with a Kimber) then I should be able to sue.

   "I CAN REMAIN SILENT NO LONGER. \n \n Let me start by saying that I am an airline pilot. There are people right now that are allowed to carry firearms aboard commercial aircraft, if they have the proper documentation. HOWEVER, as pilots...we have veto power. If i don't like the way you look at me when you hand me your FS508 form, I will ask you to leave my airplane. It ultimately is the captains decision, but if I as the first officer object, you will get off my airplane. Let me also state, I am a gun lover! I own 3 rifles, a shotgun, and revolver, and a pistol. I value my rights as an American to carry my gun, but please don't tell me you stand behind the constitution to win this arguement for you. Yes, it does give us the right to bear arms, but times have changed, and the wording has not. Should the government be able to take my guns? NO! Should I have to register my guns into a government database? NO! Should I have the right to get a permit and carry it in MOST places. YES! Should i be allowed to cary a gun on a plane, in a school, in a government building, in your home if you object? NOT ONLY NO, BUT NO! Think on this. The FAA (in their infinate wisdom...gee I hope the FSDO is looking!) decides to let everyone with a weapons permit to carry on a gun. So I have 37 armed people sitting behind me. The bulkhead doors within an aircraft are not bulletproof. Suppose while you are duking it out with Mr. Hijacker you put a round through me and one through my captain? Now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. A weapons permit does not make you a \"good shot\", and it is unthinkable to say that everyone who starts blasting away will only hit Mr. Hijacker. Ok, second. I am sure many of you have flown before. You guys remember the little safety lecture? \"In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure an oxygen mask will deploy from the ceiling...secure the mask over your nose and mouth...blah blah blah.\" What do you think the loss of cabin pressure comes from. A HOLE IN THE FREAKING AIRCRAFT XXXXX. Aircraft are pressurized inside, meaning that the pressure inside the aircraft is greater than the pressure outside the aircraft. If it was not, we would take off with live people and land (or crash) with a plane full of dead people. A bullet, creating a hole in a window, or the skin (pressure vessel), will cause something known as rapid decompression. Does anyone remember the United flight that had to make an emergency landing in Hawaii? A small crack in the fuselage was present, caused a large section of the aircraft to structurally fail, and several people were sucked out. This flight was extremely lucky to even have the chance to land. Many times, when an aircraft rapidly depressurizes, it becomes structurally damaged to the point it is no longer aerodynamic (does not fly) or is no longer able to be controlled (cannot be flown). Either case...now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. Suppose someone accidently shoots into the wing or through the floor of the aircraft while slugging it out with Mr. Hijacker. Assuming that the aircraft does not depressurize...what about the 1000's of gallons of jet fuel in the tanks. (most fuel thanks are in the wings and some aircraft have fuselage tanks) So now the plane blows up...now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. I agree with one question I keep seeing in this post...WHAT NEED DO YOU HAVE TO CARRY A GUN ON A PLANE ANYWAY? Would guns on aircraft have prevented 9/11? Probably not, because the terrorists would then have guns too. If you were to allow guns on airplanes now, you would be arming the terrorist with deadly weapons, that not only could kill you, could take the plane down by themselves...and still kill you anyway. This will never happen, nor should it ever be seriously considered. It will make it much harder to hijack a plane with a boxcutter or nail file, especially in todays climate. I think we all now know that terrorists don't hijack planes to cuba anymore, and I think that the public is going to be much more empowered to act in the face of a threat to an aircraft. This has actually occurred several times since 9/11, anyone remember that shoebomber guy? Last, and most important, almost all of the other pilots that I know feel the same way I do about this, and not one of them will fly an aircraft with armed passengers other than Federal Air Marshalls or Law Enforcement officials authorized to carry them FOR A REASON. If the general public is ever allowed to carry guns on board a commercial aircraft, they will do so. However, it would be quicker to take the bus, because there will be no pilots willing to fly them. WE PILOTS DEAL WITH ENOUGH DANGERS UP THERE, WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AN AIRCRAFT OF ARMED HILLBILLIES WITH GLOCKS KILLING US BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE MAN WHO STOOD UP TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIS CARRY-ON WAS ACTUALLY HABIB Q. TERRORIST.",

   "Debating an ***** is never as much fun as debating an intelligent person...but here goes. If you feel the need to call me a gun hater...hmmm...what can i call you?\n \n \nHey gun hater!\n \n \n Hey *****...i like guns, i own guns, i believe in my right to carry a gun...nuff said.\n \n What if a terrorist or airline pilot that has gone postal hijacks a plane and is threatening to kill all on the plane. \n \n Hey *****...he would still be easier to deal with if he has a sharpened pen rather than a 40 cal.\n \n \nWould guns have prevented 9/11.

And it is completely feasable to believe that if the terrorists were able to apply for pilots licenses and get them, why could they not get a weapons permit. A pilots license requires application to the Federal Aviation Administration and The Department of Transportation. I know that they did this just like everyone else. (the examiner that flight tested me for my private pilots license and my instrument rating gave flight tests to several of the terrorists) How hard is it to get a weapons permit? Not very hard, a little money, fill out a form, send it in, wait for your permit. Even if they were not issued a permit, I could make you one on my computer in about 5 minutes.\n \n \nOh and yes I was waiting for the gun hater to claim they had guns. This can be compared to the racist that would claim they are not racist because they have black friends, but they still want them there racist laws!\n \n \n Hey *****...I am neither a gun hater nor a racist. Your argument is irrational and invalid. I believe very strongly in my right to own a gun, and I also believe in the equality of man...even ******.\n \n \n I defended the airlines right to deny people to carry guns on the planes.

The courts have ruled the airlines and port authority can be held responsible for the people killed on 9/11 \n \n \n Hey *****...good for you. But think about one thing my little *****, If a terrorist were to carry a gun on a plane because the airline allows guns on board and did not know he was a terrorist; he takes it over, and crashes it...are the airlines not then responsible for that too? If citizens carry guns on board an aircraft because the airline says it is ok, and they kill someone accidentaly while shooting it out with a terrorist, the airline would still be responsible for the death because they allowed the gun to be carried aboard the aircraft. What if they accidentally bring the plane down while shooting at a terrorist like I said, then the airline that allowed that gun on board is still responsible. It is a catch .22 (little joke there). You cannot have it both ways. Asking any rational, non-***** will yeild you the same result, there is far more danger with guns on board than if they are not on board. Are you saying that you and six friends (or strangers sitting around you on the plane) would not fight or wrestle with a terrorist? It has been done since 9/11, and it worked. Oh yeah *****...you have the right to not get on my plane in the first place if I deny you your right to carry a gun on board. So if you get on board without your gun, YOU are responsible. There are other means of transportation...like you own car. In your case, I would recommend the car, even if going to Europe.\n \n \nOnce more gun hater did the gun free zones at schools prevent the columbine killings? \n \n \n Hey *****...no, they did not. But is the answer to take down the gun free zones...and just allow kids to carry guns to school? Sure, both Columbine and 9/11 caught us with our pants around our ankles, but we need to learn from these lessons...and in many respects we have. We have improved security, better bomb detection, better screeners, and more security on the aircraft itself. \n \n Hey *****...grow up. I am not trying to infringe upon your right to carry a firearm, just not on my plane. And unless you are a Federal Air Marshall or a criminal, you will NEVER do so on any commercial flight originating or entering the United States.",

   "He is a self proclaimed gun lover. He even lists the guns he owns. How can he possibly be a gun hater?\n \n \n \n I think the response to your what if scenario has already been listed. What if a bullet hits the pilots? What if a bullet goes through the floor or a window? What if a bullet hits the jet fuel? This are legitimate concerns wouldn't you agree? Isn't it hypocritical that you haven't listed the concerns of the 'gun haters' in any of your posts yet you demand that those opposing you list your concerns?\n \n I think the best solution for the topic of having guns on a plane is to let the pilots and trained guards have guns on board to defend against a terrorist attack. This way the terrorist would still have the task of trying to sneak a gun on board just to have a chance at all and of course he would have to face off against trained professionals in order to take the plane. I think this would stop a vast majority of all hijackings as well as prevent any dangerous criminals from taking a gun onto a plane.\n \n \n \n Like we debated earlier, you don't know who is and who isn't dangerous until they reveal themselves. How will the state know if it is issuing a CCW to a terrorist or a model citizen?\n \n \n \n Do you support guns in schools? What age limits should there be?\n\n \n \n yeah but using that logic remember that pilot who was screaming ALLAH AKBAR! as he (THE PILOT) crashed the plane full of people...

   "\n \n \n \n Hey XXXXX...good for you. But think about one thing my little XXXXX, If a terrorist were to carry a gun on a plane because the airline allows guns on board and did not know he was a terrorist; he takes it over, and crashes it...are the airlines not then responsible for that too? If citizens carry guns on board an aircraft because the airline says it is ok, and they kill someone accidentaly while shooting it out with a terrorist, the airline would still be responsible for the death because they allowed the gun to be carried aboard the aircraft. What if they accidentally bring the plane down while shooting at a terrorist like I said, then the airline that allowed that gun on board is still responsible. It is a catch .22 (little joke there). You cannot have it both ways. Asking any rational, non-XXXXX will yeild you the same result, there is far more danger with guns on board than if they are not on board. Are you saying that you and six friends (or strangers sitting around you on the plane) would not fight or wrestle with a terrorist? It has been done since 9/11, and it worked. Oh yeah XXXXX...you have the right to not get on my plane in the first place if I deny you your right to carry a gun on board. So if you get on board without your gun, YOU are responsible. There are other means of transportation...like you own damn car. In your case, I would recommend the car, even if going to Europe.\n \n \n \n Hey XXXXX...no, they did not. But is the answer to take down the gun free zones...and just allow kids to carry guns to school? Sure, both Columbine and 9/11 caught us with our pants around our ankles, but we need to learn from these lessons...and in many respects we have. We have improved security, better bomb detection, better screeners, and more security on the aircraft itself. \n \n Hey XXXXX...grow up. I am not trying to infringe upon your right to carry a firearm, just not on my plane. And unless you are a Federal Air Marshall or a criminal, you will NEVER do so on any commercial flight originating or entering the United States.\n\n \n Once again we see how gun hater pilot responds to people that speak out against gun hater pilot. Would anybody want to fly with gun hater pilot? I mean gun hater pilot uses racial profiling to keep law enforcement that gun hater pilot does not like simply because of their looks off of gun hater pilots plane!\n \n Now gun hater pilot I have compared gun haters such as you to the other hate groups that are blinded by their hatred of other peoples rights.\n \n As seen on 9/11 and at columbine people are not safer because of gun free zones. The dangerous criminals gun haters like gun hater pilot are trying to unarm will simply not obey these laws. Actually the terrorist did obey the gun free zones on the airplanes on 9/11. It made it easier to take the airplanes over using box cutters! \n \n Gun haters must think being killed in a gun free zone with anything other then a gun is a kinder gentler death. \n \n I guess the people on the airplane that decided to fight before they were killed on the gun free airplane saved some people because the airplane did not reach it's target! I guess keeping these terrorist from killing even more people then what were on the airplane is not the kind common sense gun haters like!\n \n Hey gun hater pilot try negotiating with terrorist that plans on dying and taking their hostages with them.\n \n I know what gun hater pilot will say, the US Air Force will send up F16's to save the airplane. Got news for you gun hater pilot them there F16 's are there to shoot down any airplane that does not land where they want them to. You know gun hater pilot to keep the airplanes full of people from killing even more innocent law abiding people!\n \n So gun hater continue your attack on peoples rights. \n \n Hey gun hater pilot the only thing I have said that gun hater pilot does not like is, if the airlines or even gun hater pilot denies a person the right to self defense that airline or gun hater pilot is responsible for that persons safety. I guess a person is a XXXXX for wanting to be safe in gun hater pilots mind!\n \n Gun haters says guns are the problem. Well gun hater pilot there were no guns on the airplanes on 9/11! At columbine there were no guns except for the ones the criminals had! Gun hater logic is unarmed victims die a kinder gentler death!\n \n The gun haters attack a book called more guns less crime because they hate guns. I guess no guns on the airplanes on 9/11 and gun freee zones proved that gun hater logic wrong.\n \n Law abiding citizens bearing arms is not the propblem. But this is the only group of people that obey gun control laws! \n \n We see even more of what gun haters call common sense!",

I do not think guns are a problem in this country. But a terrorist on a plane with a gun could very well be a problem.

   "Which will help solve the \"problem with criminals getting guns\" oh so much more than the 20,000 laws on guns we have today. Which one protected the kids at colimbine? which ones?\n \n \n True. Keeping prisoners in jail does prevent them from getting guns and using them to rob the local 7-11. This much is obvious. But agsin, it is not a measure of gun control. This is prisoner control resulting in crime prevention. \n \n The \"gun free school zone\" laws obviously did not help anyone at Columbine. Proper enforcement of these laws probably would have though, and this is what we need. Enforcement of the laws. \n \n Yes, in tests they have gotten guns, knives, explosives past the screeners, this is very true. But if you just simply allow everyone to carry a gun, then you allow the terrorists to be armed as well. I would rather that we find 99% of the weapons before they go on the plane, than to know that anyone intent on doing harm can carry a weapon on with the proper credentials. Wouldn't you?\n \n \nSTOP RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT YOU!\n \n \n \n Then who am I to rely on, I sit in the cockpit remember? Am I to just assume you will be there? Am I to assume that every flight I take there are law abiding citizens on board who are porperly trained in the use of a firearm, willing to shoot it out with a terrorist? Suppose the only one that gets on my flight with a gun that day is the terrorist. That would make it fairly one sided in my opinion. That is very dangerous assumption. \n \n \nYou can't make the connection? Plane gets hijacked.. tangos have guns (which were smuggled past that holy grail called the TSA... Air Force comes up and shoots you down....GAME OVER.... STANDING ORDERS. \n \n \n Could happen.\n \n \nSecond scenario... Some (3) passengers have guns Kills tangos... 1 civillian not involved killed in crossfire 10 are injured. 200+ saved on plane countless on ground....\n \n \n Could happen.\n \n Third scenario...Some (3) \"tangos\" have guns...kill armed law abiding citizen passenger. Lose 1 tango in the process. By my math, 2 tangos left. 0 armed law abiding citizen passengers. 1 hijacked aircraft now on approach at JFK veers off coarse, and takes out the next big landmark, 200 on plane dead, thousands killed on ground. \n \n Could happen. The fact here is that we could argue scenarios to death with the same result. Could happen. Of coarse the best is your scenario (#2), the worst is mine. But look at the probabilty factor. If we screen all passengers, the probability is very low that any of these will happen. If we allow firearms to be carried on, the probability of these scenarios increases exponentially. It is a simple matter of risk assessment. The idea is to make it as risk free as possible. It will never be 100% risk free. \n \n And does anyone see the irony that the policies I am defending are the current policies in place? Someone other than me must have thought them up, and some group of people must have reviewed all the options and decided that this was the safest course of action. Until we have a safer policy, these are the ones that we will use. I am more than willing to give up my civil right to carry a gun on an airplane if it makes it safer for my family, myself, and those around me. I am sure the majority of Americans are willing to do the same.",

A debate is a fluid thing...we make a point, argue/defend, and move on. Your gun hater slogans may make sense to you, but to logical people on this thread they are really nothing more than illogical rantings. Calling me a gun hater shows your level of ignorance in this world. I have said that I am a gun owner. I have said that I shoot these guns. I have said that I carry my pistol with me (concealed with a ccw) quite often. You may chose to think I am making this up in some grand gesture to win your hearts so I can change your minds. Well, you are entitled to your belief, I really don't care. Just do me a favor, COME UP WITH A VALID ARGUEMENT FOR YOUR POSITION. Don't just keep spouting off your pointless XXXX telling everyone else what I, your so called gun hater pilot, want to do. If you think I just want to disarm law abiding citizens then you need to go back and reread the posts I have put up. If you think I don't want to address criminals and terrorists, you are an *****. You never did understand what I was saying about a pilots authority to kick someone off an airplane. It was not about me being prejudice about someone bringing a gun on my plane. Maybe you need to go back and reread some more. It was an example, but you continue to shout that with just about every post. The whole point pretty much is that as a pilot, I can tell someone to get off my plane. I would probably never do that to a law enforcement officer with the proper paperwork, I would however do this to ordinary citizens with guns if the law was ever changed to accomodate you. Almost every pilot I know has said they would do the same thing. Either that, or we would all walk off the airplanes, and you would not be able to fly anyway. I really find it quite funny that I am defending the current policy and you are trying (although not logically) to agrue for the opposite. I may not agree with kelvin and rev either, but they actually argue with some degree of intelligence. They know how to present an opinion, argue it, back it up with facts, and most importantly the listen and respond to other peoples opinions. If you want to debate...then debate. If you want to continue to call people gun haters and tell other people our so called agenda, you might as well stop posting. As of now, you have no credibility with me, and I bet that a lot of logical people, no matter what side of the debate they are on, would feel the same way.",

You should realize that you are the extremist here and not everyone who is arguing you.\n \n Show me an example where allowing guns on planes will save lives. It is just theoretical. I could prove to you that the elimination of all guns will save lives by simply subtracting all gun deaths from our national total of deaths per year. That would theoretically work except the fact that more knife murders may occur then and perhaps guns will be brought in illegally to murder people.

There are situations where I'll be more in control of my destiny without a gun and you corner yourself and lost complete control of your destiny because of your gun. It is situational. You could just as easily die on your knees while I walk away. You can't just assume that a gun puts you in a better position as you seem to be doing.

The low paid government workers control you destiny because they won't allow you to look dirty at pilots?

Oops, your logic just failed.\n \n \nI am a much more deadly weapon unarmed than armed... As I would be in much more fear of my life and would more likley resort to deadly force in defense of myself and others... \n\n \n Of course you are and so is everyone else. This doesn't give you any advantage as long as everyone else is armed. It could even put you at more of a disadvantage if the group opposing you is coordinated against you and you do not know it.\n \n \nYou mean gun control not gun rights don't you? And no gun control laws have not been 100% effective in your case... Your brother has almost killed you on how many occasions? Which gun law protected you there?\n\n \n Gun rights work just fine as they stand today. You call it complete gun control but there are gun rights as well. They work well hand in hand as it stands. I see no problem right now.\n \n My brother is the proof that gun control is necessary.

I for one would like to have the score evened...\n\n \n Once again, you are not the master of your own destiny. If you were then you would be in complete control which of course you are not regardless as to whether you have a gun or not. Your actions may even prove to be responsible for something that isn't righteous or true.\n \n Guns are a tool that can fail. You have to realize that. You are also possible of failure because of a gun. This again shows that you are not the master of your own destiny.\n \n I'd debate that if the criminal wants to kill you then you are already dead. My friend is a black belt and awesome in karate. I could beat him in a hand to hand fight if he was unsuspecting enough. If he doesn't anticipate my criminal intentions then he would lose. The same would go for you if a criminal was to attack you while you were unaware of his intentions. Again, proof that you are not the masters of your own destiny.\n \n A gun being aimed at you may not even give you time to draw your own gun before you are dead especially if you don't see it coming or you are outnumbered. A gun can get you killed just as it can save you. Guess what this shows?\n \n \nI do not believe guns are the answer to my problems... Just another tool for dealing with the realities of life.. Your extremist logic is portrayed here as viewing my stance as an all or nothing stance... As one well trained in armed and unarmed combat techniques and as a vet from GW1. I know oh so much better than you the reality of combat as demonstrated by your lax attitude regarding your life....\n\n \n You believe guns are the key to controlling your destiny and this is of course false, you just don't realize it. I never suspected that you were this blinded by the power of a gun until now and I have to begin to question some of the stuff you have said in previous posts. If you believe a gun is the ultimate answer to controlling your destiny then you are blinded by your love of guns and cannot rationally debate them. I can see why you also think that conventional logic is extremist logic. You don't think like a conventional person would and you therefore see everyone who disagrees with you as using logic that doesn't seem realistic and therefore is extreme. To each his own I guess as I cannot even begin to believe that I can show you my point of view if you believe that I am an extremist and you believe that guns are the controller of destiny.",

   "Your \"conventional logic and methods\" disarm law abiding citizens. You are the one being irrational due to your phobia about guns. My radical changes are to go back to what the constitution says. Show me an example where the ban on machine guns has saved one life?\n \n Yes, at an airport they do disarm the law abiding citizen. They also prevent criminals from carry dangerous weapons aboard an aircraft. I think that the majority of law abiding citizens (which most law abiding citizens do not carry guns by the way) understand that this is a measure enacted for safety. I wonder if people would feel safe knowing anyone is able to carry a gun onto a plane (law abiding citizen and criminal), or that we are screening for weapons and attemting to ensure that none pass through. And as far as that machine gun ban saving lives, that is a pointless question. If it has saved lives, we would really never know, think about that.\n \n \nWhen they refuse you the right of self defense and pilots don't allow individuals on because of a \"dirty look\" They in effect are in control of your destiny... HOWEVER. I choos to fly with these XXXXXX and allow the fedgov to search me like a common criminal... But I will not stand down and sit idle and hope others will come to my resue in the event of a disaster....\n \n The dirty look thing is really getting old, I have explained that several times and I will not do so again. I would not refuse the law abiding citizen with a gun based on how he looks at me, I would simply refuse the law abiding citizen with a gun. There is a difference. Again, most other pilots that I know have said they would do the same thing. If a law was enacted allowing citizens to carry guns on board planes, the majority of pilots would be on strike so fast, the airline industry would grind to a halt. And if you feel so strongly about you convictions, why would you go against them and fly on a plane unarmed? Seems you would be better off not flying at all.\n \n \nI am a much more deadly weapon unarmed than armed... As I would be in much more fear of my life and would more likley resort to deadly force in defense of myself and others... \n \n Then why would you need a gun on a plane? This is the point. You can defend yourself without one, and 100 unarmed passengers against 3 unarmed terrorists kinda puts the odds in your favor. \n \n \nYour brother has almost killed you on how many occasions? Which gun law protected you there?\n \n Gun laws do not prevent stupidity. They do however provide a penalty for stupidity with guns. Seems like common sense would handle this problem. Take his guns and lock them up if he cannot handle them responsibly. He is the kind of person that would accidentally kill someone with a gun and thereby make some flower toting liberal say \"oh my god, guns are so dangerous...let's get rid of them all!\" Don't be part of the problem by allowing him to be an idiot. Take them, hide them, lock them up. \n \n \nGuns are a tool and I control the tool... If I fail and am killed I will know that I did everything I could to protect myself and my family... If the criminal is the only one with the tool and I don't Who's hands is my destiny in? \n \n You said above that your destiny is in your hands even if you fail, you said that you are a weapon even without your gun. \n \n \nSomeone points a gun at you whos life is your hands in.. I for one would like to have the score evened...\n \n That is what they are trying to do by verifying that nobody carries a gun on board. They may be disarming the law abiding citizens, but they disarm the criminals as well.",

   "Hey DHARD, could you please make a logical arguement if you want to continue your posting on this thread. You spout off the same illogical banter in every post, and it is getting to the point where I just want to avoid even reading them...because i know what they say already. A debate is a fluid thing...we make a point, argue/defend, and move on. Your gun hater slogans may make sense to you, but to logical people on this thread they are really nothing more than illogical rantings. Calling me a gun hater shows your level of ignorance in this world. I have said that I am a gun owner. I have said that I shoot these guns. I have said that I carry my pistol with me (concealed with a ccw) quite often. You may chose to think I am making this up in some grand gesture to win your hearts so I can change your minds. Well, you are entitled to your belief, I really don't care. But if you want to continue sounding like an idiot, you may continue to call me gun hater pilot, I guess it makes you feel special or something. Just do me a favor, COME UP WITH A VALID ARGUEMENT FOR YOUR POSITION. Don't just keep spouting off your pointless XXXX telling everyone else what I, your so called gun hater pilot, want to do. If you think I just want to disarm law abiding citizens then you need to go back and reread the posts I have put up. If you think I don't want to address criminals and terrorists, you are an idiot. You never did understand what I was saying about a pilots authority to kick someone off an airplane. It was not about me being prejudice about someone bringing a gun on my plane. Maybe you need to go back and reread some more. It was an example, but you continue to shout that with just about every post. The whole point pretty much is that as a pilot, I can tell someone to get off my plane. I would probably never do that to a law enforcement officer with the proper paperwork, I would however do this to ordinary citizens with guns if the law was ever changed to accomodate you. Almost every pilot I know has said they would do the same thing. Either that, or we would all walk off the airplanes, and you would not be able to fly anyway. I really find it quite funny that I am defending the current policy and you are trying (although not logically) to agrue for the opposite. I may not agree with kelvin and rev either, but they actually argue with some degree of intelligence. They know how to present an opinion, argue it, back it up with facts, and most importantly the listen and respond to other peoples opinions. If you want to debate...then debate. If you want to continue to call people gun haters and tell other people our so called agenda, you might as well stop posting. As of now, you have no credibility with me, and I bet that a lot of logical people, no matter what side of the debate they are on, would feel the same way.\n\n \n \n Interesting how gun hater pilots logic is to ban the right of law abiding Americans to bear arms!\n \n Typical gun hater logic.\n \n Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!\n \n I guess gun hater pilot would call this common sense gun control!\n \n Ban the right of law abiding American to bear arms while allowing dangerous criminal to remain free!\n \n Oh and yes gun hater pilot you did state you would ban a law enforcement officer the right to carry their gun onto your airplane even if they had the proper paperwork. Gun hater piloted stated that this would be based solely on how the law enforcement officer looked at gun hater pilot!",

   "Even if I am irrational I am still part of the conventional logic. You should realize that you are the extremist here and not everyone who is arguing you.\n \n\n \n What?!?!? The Nazis were irrational and were the \"conevtional logic\" of the time!\n \n \n\n Show me an example where allowing guns on planes will save lives. It is just theoretical. I could prove to you that the elimination of all guns will save lives by simply subtracting all gun deaths from our national total of deaths per year. That would theoretically work except the fact that more knife murders may occur then and perhaps guns will be brought in illegally to murder people. I can answer the question you are asking but you will simply be able to show how my answer is just theoretical just as your response would be. This would be pointless.\n\n \n All through the 70's pilots were permited to carry guns on planes... in the 40's anyone could.... how many deaths? 0\n \n \n \n \n\n Your teeth can fail and my belly can succeed, it just depends on the situation. There are situations where I'll be more in control of my destiny without a gun and you corner yourself and lost complete control of your destiny because of your gun. It is situational. You could just as easily die on your knees while I walk away. You can't just assume that a gun puts you in a better position as you seem to be doing. I'll admit that it will often come in handy although I doubt you will ever admit that it could work against you.\n \n\n \n your extermist slim view is most frustrating. Did you even read my last post? I am the weapon, My gun, my rifle, my fists and my boots are tools How would I ever corner myself and \"loose control\" simply because I would carry a gun? This is extremist logic.. You seem to think I would go nuts and get myself killed simply for carrying a gun... Well I turn this around on you.. You are a phsycopathic civil rights violator who is willing to put me in harms way for your ideology. You are essentially violating the 14th amendment by denying me my civil rights. You have shown your propesnity for the absurd and it is YOU who should be regulated.\n \n \n \n\n Who is they? The low paid government workers control you destiny because they won't allow you to look dirty at pilots? The pilots control your destiny more by flying the plane than they do by not allowing guns on it! I suppose in the case of disaster you will push the pilot out of the way and fly the plane? Oops, your logic just failed.\n\n \n They is the federal government and civil right vilolator extremists like yourself who are more worried about me and my 2nd amendment rights than his VERY OWN LIFE when it comes to the scenarios you have put YOURSELF in.\n \n In case of disaster a monkey with headphones on could land a plane... Don't believe the pilot hype that planes are hard to fly.... XXXX I could talk you down by reading the instructions on the internet.....\n \n \n \n\n Of course you are and so is everyone else. This doesn't give you any advantage as long as everyone else is armed. It could even put you at more of a disadvantage if the group opposing you is coordinated against you and you do not know it.\n \n\n \n Even more extreme. I am not for a 100% armed society I am for the choice... most likley (number pulled out of air) 15% will carry... But it will deter the criminal element from violent crimes as they have a 15 in 100 chance of being shot if they attack somebody. \n \n Besides I train in 3 man tactical scenarios all the time...\n \n \n\n Gun rights work just fine as they stand today. You call it complete gun control but there are gun rights as well. They work well hand in hand as it stands. I see no problem right now.\n\n \n How many crimes did the 1994 assault weapons ban stop? How many gangstas attacked people by bayonet charge? (one of the things the AWB made illegal) WHY DO POLICE AND THE FEDGOV get these very weapons that are supposed to be \"bad\"? How many legal gun owners have killed innocents? How many cops and fedgov agents killed? look at Waco.... 75 percent of ATF casualties were from \"friendly fire\" they killed all those people all over a $200 tax? And don't give me that \"he thought he was jeezus and he has sec with lots of women\"... So did clinton. And WTF were tax agents doin there if that was what it was about?\n \n Remember 170 million killed by governments this last century alone....\n \n \n\n My brother is the proof that gun control is necessary. I don't see how you think that he is evidence that there should be no gun control at all.\n \n\n \n No you brother is proof that you are a sheep... Made to lick the bootheels of your fedgov masters... While you hope and pray for them to save you from the one day your brother kills you or someone you love...\n \n \n Don't legislate YOUR stupidity on law abiding citizens like myself. Comparing me to your brother is an insult and your bigotry is now well noted. If your predjuces (based on one case) can't allow you to see the whole picture I can no longer say I care. Your attempts at making me a criminal by violating the constitution all for the sake of your personal well being is selfish and narrow sighted. \n \n You are whats wrong with this country... \n \n \n Would you make these same arguments at an NRA meeting?\n \n \n \n\n Once again, you are not the master of your own destiny. If you were then you would be in complete control which of course you are not regardless as to whether you have a gun or not. Your actions may even prove to be responsible for something that isn't righteous or true.\n \n\n \n You as a sheep simply do not understand.\n \n \n\n Guns are a tool that can fail. You have to realize that. You are also possible of failure because of a gun. This again shows that you are not the master of your own destiny.\n\n \n Round and round... Of course guns can fail... people can fail.... hammers can fail... But I am willing to die trying. YOU won't even stand up for yourself... You have rolled onto your back and shown your belly already! And when that day your brother kills your sister/mother/family member what will you say at the funeral... what will the eulogy be? \"I knew my brother was out of control, I only wish I could have enacted more gun control laws in time!\"\n \n Pitiful\n \n \n\n I'd debate that if the criminal wants to kill you then you are already dead. My friend is a black belt and awesome in karate. I could beat him in a hand to hand fight if he was unsuspecting enough. If he doesn't anticipate my criminal intentions then he would lose. The same would go for you if a criminal was to attack you while you were unaware of his intentions. Again, proof that you are not the masters of your own destiny. \n\n \n Karate for the most part is whats at the mall.. USELESS! CQB, Stamina drills, Boxing/kickbocing and Brazillian Jiusitsu (my opinion of course) but thats another subject..\n \n Your theme is well noted.... \"Might as well give up cause they will probably win anyways!\"\n \n Pitiful\n \n \n\n A gun being aimed at you may not even give you time to draw your own gun before you are dead especially if you don't see it coming or you are outnumbered. A gun can get you killed just as it can save you. Guess what this shows?\n \n\n \n Your solution? Stand there and get shot... My solution... Look for all posibillities and act decisevly...

You do improve your strength and stamina as well as becoming more disciplined and confident in yourself. Plus you get the added ability of being able to protect yourself in a hand to hand combat and even help prevent injury in a major fall. I think the benefits of karate are almost endless but your right, this is another topic.\n \n My theme is that you are wrong in your assumption that you are in complete control as long as you have a gun. If someone wanted to kill you then you are already dead. So yes you will always be open for defeat even if you have a gun. The knowledge and weapon doesn't hurt to have but it doesn't make you in complete control of your destiny. I hope you realize that.\n \n \nYour solution? Stand there and get shot... My solution... Look for all posibillities and act decisevly... (I would not pull my gun if one were that close to my head)\n \n You?\n \n Pitiful\n\n \n lol, my solution is your solution, not to pull a gun if one were close to my head. At least we agree on something :) But again my point was that you are not going to be in complete control of your destiny just because you have a gun. If someone gets the jump on you then it doesn't matter if you have a gun or not. Your destiny will be in their hands. I just want to make you see this.\n \n \nOH FOR THE LOVE OF G-D! I AM THE MASTER OF MY OWN DESTINY! I do not carry a gun it is not allowed in my \"state\". I am in no less control than when I someday will be able to.. You are projecting a stance I simply do not have. If you are looking for an excuse to \"bow out\" with your belly shown just go as this display of victimhood turns my stomache and makes me want to weep for my countrymen.\n\n \n Well I still fail to understand what you mean by you are the master of your own destiny. Do you really know what destiny even is? Of course your stance is as I've stated and I only am quoting what you have stated in your posts. If your stance is otherwise then why do you keep repeating it the same way?\n \n lol victimhood? I'd rather be a victim than a corpse. I have a feeling that in the case of an actual crime you would be more likely to be a corpse than I would be. You would create a problem without the need to do so by bringing guns into a tense situation while I would try to diffuse the situation. So who is more likely to walk away, you or me? You just sound like you're out to cause trouble.\n \n \n I'm proud of this country and am glad to see that the majority is sensible in their wants. I don't believe that you are trying to be sensible and nor do you seem to be asking for something that is in the interest of this nation. You just seem to want to have your way and I don't know what your intentions are if you were to get your way but I for one would be suspicious of them.",

   "I am going to condense this as its getting too long\n \n \n The majority of the time you will be just fine if you cooperate with the criminal although resisting him may result in death. You could easily lose control of your fate simply by pulling your gun at the wrong time or having it be seen by the wrong person. That is conventional logic. \n \n\n \n Show me the statistics on your first point. Of the disproportionate number of rape victims I have had come through one of my unarmed combat classes the majority were told to not to resist. You know what... They were raped 100% of the time. These women sought out a way to protect themselves so that it would never happen again. To them some things are much worse than death. If your brother killed someone you loved and shot you within an inch of your life I would bet my arsenal your opinion to be \"a good doggie\" and roll to show your tummy and XXXX yourself would change... Either that or you would break down. That my friend is reality.\n \n knowing I may be killed, Knowing that I may be killed no matter what I do. I choose to say no to being the victim. I refuse to die on my knees. I refuse to let this criminal be 100% in control. This is how I am (or my students) are the masters of my/thier destiny. \n \n Most of these women when they joined have told me they would kill themselves before they would let it happen again. Now they make a similar comment but the killing part is on a slightly different \"subject\". \n \n Which of these women are you? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You seem to think that I will simply get killed because I don't have a gun. I don't know why you assume this but you do so have at it. I'd rather have a gun than be unarmed but I'm not going to be so blind as to believe that without a gun I will die and with a gun I am in control. I cannot see why you think this way and it is most frustrating to me.\n \n\n \n \n \n NO I DONT! How many times do I have to say this. Please quote me so I can see where I failed to convey this message to you!\n \n \n \n\n The federal government is now an extremist as well? This went from a single person being an extremist to the entire government in a matter of moments? Shesh, no wonder you want anarchy.\n\n \n Was waco an extreme response to a suposed tax violation? was shooting randy weaver's son in the back and his wife thhrough the head and extreme reaction for supposedly selling a shotgun with a stock 3/8 too short?\n \n I don't want anarchy. Please read the link at the bottom of my tagline to see what I want.\n \n \n \n \n\n It may deter but it still doesn't mean that you are in total charge just because you have a gun.\n \n\n \n Never said I did. You applied this reasoning to me. I keep telling you its just another tool\n \n \n\n You train for this but you have to admit that even a single person could defeat you if they wanted to and there is really nothing you could do about it. The extremist government would actually have the best chance of protecting you if someone was out to get you.\n \n\n \n \n Didn't I already cover this? Show me where I ever said a gun was an absolute?\n \n \n\n lol, if you want to debate statistics I have to do no more than point out how many gun deaths the US has per year already to debate that guns are not going to save lives. If you want to end gun deaths you can eliminate the guns and in the US that saves a lot of lives on paper.\n\n \n Eliminating guns? OK eliminate guns.... Will you do this before or after you eliminate drugs and prostitution... oh oh what about gambling.... then I guess you better eliminate knives too... don't forget cars! \n \n \n\n Wow, that whole statement there makes you look really intelligent. Good job trying to stay on target here instead of using ad hominem arguments.\n \n\n \n That was not ad hominen.. Actually its an observation. You said that \"people like my brother are why we need gun control\" Now while I did not respond with happy words my point was made. You want to restrict MY rights because you allow your brother to point a gun at you and refuse to diffuse a life threatening situation because you don't want to get your mommy mad.\n \n \n\n lol, to follow up your last paragraph you now show that you are unwilling to read before responding. I never compared you to my brother so I hope you will do the right thing and retract this entire paragraph.\n \n\n \n \n \"people like my brother are why we need gun control\" Either you think that I am like your brother and need to be regulated or your willing to assume I am guilty before innocent simply because I have a gun. You want to regulate my lawful activities based on your pshycopath of a brother. My feeling that you compared me to your brother is so much less of a stretch than this mis information you keep using stating that a gun is an absolute. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I don't understand? Are you sure that you believe that having a gun means you have complete control over your destiny? lol, talk about not understanding :)\n \n \n There you go again. You love the idea that guns kill and you are so sure that they will kill. I can't believe you support guns at all with how much killing you say that they do.\n \n \n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n \n\n Nah karate is beneficial in my opinion. You do improve your strength and stamina as well as becoming more disciplined and confident in yourself. Plus you get the added ability of being able to protect yourself in a hand to hand combat and even help prevent injury in a major fall. I think the benefits of karate are almost endless but your right, this is another topic.\n\n \n heh heh heh.. (laughing at this notion..) moving on....\n \n \n \n\n My theme is that you are wrong in your assumption that you are in complete control as long as you have a gun. If someone wanted to kill you then you are already dead. So yes you will always be open for defeat even if you have a gun. The knowledge and weapon doesn't hurt to have but it doesn't make you in complete control of your destiny. I hope you realize that.\n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n (I will be using this line everytime you bring up this wrong assumption)\n \n \n \n\n lol, my solution is your solution, not to pull a gun if one were close to my head. At least we agree on something :) But again my point was that you are not going to be in complete control of your destiny just because you have a gun. If someone gets the jump on you then it doesn't matter if you have a gun or not. Your destiny will be in their hands. I just want to make you see this.\n \n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n But I will say this.. Having a gun potentialy increases your odds of survival in some circumstances[/b] in which you would otherwise be killed..\n \n \n \n\n Well I still fail to understand what you mean by you are the master of your own destiny. Do you really know what destiny even is? Of course your stance is as I've stated and I only am quoting what you have stated in your posts. If your stance is otherwise then why do you keep repeating it the same way?\n \n\n \n Lets just leave this as you don't get it. \n \n \n\n lol victimhood? I'd rather be a victim than a corpse. I have a feeling that in the case of an actual crime you would be more likely to be a corpse than I would be. You would create a problem without the need to do so by bringing guns into a tense situation while I would try to diffuse the situation. So who is more likely to walk away, you or me? You just sound like you're out to cause trouble.\n \n\n \n This is why you are sheep. You are leaving the choice of being a victim or a corpse up to your assailiant. I am moving it to myself. You assume I would not try to \"diffuse\" the situation but rather come out swinging, shooting, whatever. You are so one sided that you wouldn't even consider that I might. 1. Play victim to a point  that the scumbag thinks he is in control. 2. try to talk the guy out of it. 3. run The difference is that I am choosing what my response would be to the point that best suits my life. I do not leave it up to the criminal. He does not have my interests in heart.\n \n Answer these:\n \n A mugger approaches you with a knife which ones would you allow him to do?\n \n 1. take your wallet?\n \n 2. take your girlfriends wallet.\n \n 3. fondle your girlfriend\n \n 4. fondle you.\n \n 5. put you in the back of his van\n \n 6. handcuff you\n \n 7. blindfold you\n \n 8. rape your girlfriend\n \n 9. rape you\n \n 10. Kill your girlfriend\n \n 11. Kill you?\n \n Now answer the same question if this guy had a gun\n \n \n I am not trying to trap you here. I use a questionare very similar to this at my CQB school. \n \n \n\n I'm proud of this country and am glad to see that the majority is sensible in their wants. I don't believe that you are trying to be sensible and nor do you seem to be asking for something that is in the interest of this nation. You just seem to want to have your way and I don't know what your intentions are if you were to get your way but I for one would be suspicious of them.\n\n \n \n \n You suspicious of me? I don't want ANYTHING from you... You however want something from me.\n \n Are you sure you are in the majority?\n \n (ok so I didn't really condense this yet)",

Any thirteen year old with \"flight simulator\" could do as good a job as you. How to land a plane Why are you pilots so arrogant... This explains your snobbish attitude towards those who you suppsedly agree with you. I was a loadmaster in the Air-force for a while and practiced emergency drills with the pilot so I could (in an emergency) be guided (which became obviously unneccesarry) to land both 130s and 141s. So I know the drill. \n \n \n Besides... don't most commercial airlines have planes that all but land themselves? Those guys aren't even bus drives anymore... More like subway drivers.... get off yourself!\n \n \n \n What is the ideal cockpit crew? A pilot and a dog...the pilot is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to bite the pilot in case he tries to touch anything.\n \n How many pilots does it take to change a light bulb? Just one. He holds the bulb and the world revolves around him.\n \n How do you know if a pilot is at your party? He'll tell you.\n \n How do you know when you are half way through a date with a pilot?\n Because he says: \"That's enough about flying, let's talk about me\"!\n \n Little boy to airline pilot: \"You're a pilot?!?!?

Either that or you would break down. That my friend is reality.\n\n \n What percent of those who resisted are now dead? That is exactly the point. You encourage resistance but won't admit that resistance has its disadvantages! Also you must be assuming that your arsenal would be an option at all if you were attacked. Reality would be that the criminal is looking to accomplish something with minimal difficulty and making as clean of a get away as possible. You would make both impossible and therefore people would of course get hurt. That is reality.\n \n \nknowing I may be killed, Knowing that I may be killed no matter what I do. I choose to say no to being the victim. I refuse to die\n on my knees. I refuse to let this criminal be 100% in control. This is how I am (or my students) are the masters of my/thier destiny.\n\n \n That still doesn't make you master of your destiny. If you have no control then you are not master of your destiny. You can refuse to die on your knees but that doesn't prevent death from coming to you. Therefore the criminal would be 100% in control. You can try and convince yourself that you are in control just because you refuse to get on your knees but that doesn't mean that you are in control at all.\n \n \nMost of these women when they joined have told me they would kill themselves before they would let it happen again. Now they make a similar comment but the killing part is on a slightly different \"subject\". \n\n \n I congratulate them for their willingness to die to protect themselves. That takes a lot of guts to do but that still doesn't make them master of their destiny. I'd also encourage them to learn some karate to go along with weapons skills as it will improve their hand to hand combat which will be most beneficial in that situation.\n \n \nWhich of these women are you? \n\n \n I'm the pretty blonde I think. Watch it, I practice the open hand :)\n \n \nNO I DONT! How many times do I have to say this. Please quote me so I can see where I failed to convey this message to you!\n\n \n lol, need I remind you that you said you are master of your destiny. This would mean that you are in control. You also preach resistance and use of force. This would indicate violence will occur anyways so be pre-emptive. I just get the feeling that you are obsessed with the idea that violence will occur and you need a gun to save your life. But if you don't think that this is the case then at least I can see you have not lost complete touch with reality. Still I cannot understand your obsession with being in control of your reality based on having a gun.\n \n \nWas waco an extreme response to a suposed tax violation? was shooting randy weaver's son in the back and his wife thhrough the head and extreme reaction for supposedly selling a shotgun with a stock 3/8 too short?\n \n I don't want anarchy. Please read the link at the bottom of my tagline to see what I want.\n\n \n I'm not sure what your saying here. We were discussing how a screener at the airport was an extremist government agent and suddenly you then jumped to accusing the entire government of being extremists. Now I'm not really sure how you got on the topic of Waco but alright, sure they are government extremists as well I guess.\n \n You don't want anarchy, you just don't want any more gun laws and it doesn't go beyond that correct? I'm guessing your views are libertarian based on pieces of your posts?\n \n \nNever said I did. You applied this reasoning to me. I keep telling you its just another tool\n\n \n Sure you did. You said you were in master of your destiny.\n \n \nDidn't I already cover this? Show me where I ever said a gun was an absolute?\n\n \n You said you were master of your destiny.\n \n \nEliminating guns? OK eliminate guns.... Will you do this before or after you eliminate drugs and prostitution... oh oh what about gambling.... then I guess you better eliminate knives too... don't forget cars! \n\n \n I gave an example, I never suggested that it was a good idea to eliminate guns. I wanted to show that statistics could show whatever you want them to show on paper. But just to answer your question, I would eliminate drugs first of course. Gambling is perfectly fine with me although it has to be controlled. Knives are too easy to make to eliminate so why even try? Cars cannot be eliminated unless teleportation is developed. At that time cars can be eliminated. Which order would you eliminate them in anyways?\n \n \nThat was not ad hominen.. Actually its an observation. You said that \"people like my brother are why we need gun control\" Now while I did not respond with happy words my point was made. You want to restrict MY rights because you allow your brother to point a gun at you and refuse to diffuse a life threatening situation because you don't want to get your mommy mad.\n\n \n Hey as long as it was not ad hominem and was instead not happy words :) hehe, well I'll forgive you for it, just be a little more careful in the future.\n \n \n\"people like my brother are why we need gun control\" Either you think that I am like your brother and need to be regulated or your willing to assume I am guilty before innocent simply because I have a gun. You want to regulate my lawful activities based on your pshycopath of a brother. My feeling that you compared me to your brother is so much less of a stretch than this mis information you keep using stating that a gun is an absolute. \n\n \n Why would that mean that you are like my brother? I singled out my brother as an unusual case. How does that mean that everyone is like him including yourself? I realize you are not my brother and probably no one else in the world is, unless he has a twin!!!! (DAAAAH)\n \n I want to regulate you because I cannot trust you. I think you want too many freedoms and that will open up security risks for those who truly are good citizens. I think that you and people like you are asking for way too much to be doing it just for the good of mankind. You are out to accomplish something other than what you are stating therefore I cannot say that I trust you. So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother. You are too fanatical about your belief.\n \n \n \n***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n\n \n You have yet to clarify what you mean then. Let me help you. You are master of your destiny.\n \n Destiny - an event (or course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future.\n \n Therefore you are the master of what will happen to you in the future or what is currently happening to you. Do you realize type of mindset you would have to have in order to believe this? That is why I question your ability to understand a lot about this debate. I'm not sure whether or not you believe that you truly are master of your destiny or not. If you actually believe that you are then you are a few bricks short of a building.\n \n \nheh heh heh.. (laughing at this notion..) moving on....\n\n \n hehe, yeah I think it is pretty cool too. You stated that you wouldn't pull your gun if someone had one by your head. You are obsessed with being master of your destiny and if you knew karate you would have quick enough reflexes to have a chance at taking any gun that was put near your head. Yet interestingly you think this is a joke. lol :)\n \n \n***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n (I will be using this line everytime you bring up this wrong assumption)\n\n \n You still don't understand what you are really saying, do you? I can't say that I'm surprised as it would seem that you have lost some touch with reality IMO. I used to think you were a pretty down to Earth person when it came to the gun control debate but lately you seem to be getting crazier with your debates and now that you are claiming that a gun makes you a God because it allows you to be master of your destiny, I can see my assumptions about you in the past were inaccurate.\n \n I also don't care if you use the same line over and over again. You are stating something that is absolutely insane and I'm going to call you on it as it will pertain to this debate.\n \n \n***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n But I will say this.. Having a gun potentialy increases your odds of survival in some circumstances[/b] in which you would otherwise be killed..\n\n \n This is particularly confusing as you believe a gun potentially increases your odds of survival yet you are still master of your destiny. That is really a strange point of view to take. Wouldn't you admit this is a strange statement?\n \n \nLets just leave this as you don't get it. \n\n \n As far as I can tell I am making the logical statement here. You don't seem to know what destiny actually is and even if you do know what it is then you are crazy to believe a gun or anything else will make you master of it.\n \n \nThis is why you are sheep. You are leaving the choice of being a victim or a corpse up to your assailiant. I am moving it to myself. You assume I would not try to \"diffuse\" the situation but rather come out swinging, shooting, whatever. You are so one sided that you wouldn't even consider that I might. 1. Play victim to a point  that the scumbag thinks he is in control. 2. try to talk the guy out of it. 3. run The difference is that I am choosing what my response would be to the point that best suits my life. I do not leave it up to the criminal. \n \n He does not have my interests in heart.\n\n \n lol you are the sheep. You believe that a gun makes you master of your destiny. I'm sure someone told you this and now you follow it to the letter like a sheep. I make my own decisions as the situation changes. I don't depend on a gun making me master of my destiny. I believe I can help my cause by making decisions that make sense in a particular situation.\n \n The criminal will often has is own interests in heart which will be to get what he wants and make a clean getaway. He isn't going to want a fight or to murder anyone as it will lower his risk-reward ratio.\n \n \nAnswer these:\n \n A mugger approaches you with a knife which ones would you allow \n \n him to do?\n \n 1. take your wallet?\n \n 2. take your girlfriends wallet.\n \n 3. fondle your girlfriend\n \n 4. fondle you.\n \n 5. put you in the back of his van\n \n 6. handcuff you\n \n 7. blindfold you\n \n 8. rape your girlfriend\n \n 9. rape you\n \n 10. Kill your girlfriend\n \n 11. Kill you?\n \n Now answer the same question if this guy had a gun\n\n \n lol, well I could ask you the same questions and you would probably have the same answers. You would eventually fall back on pulling your gun which would probably get you and your girlfriend killed. I'm sure you think you become master of your own destiny just because you pull your gun but in actuality you don't. Think this way is only going to get you in trouble!\n \n \nI am not trying to trap you here. I use a questionare very similar to this at my CQB school. \n\n \n Well if I can only answer yes or no then number 3 is where it becomes no. Number 3 is where the criminal is going to be focused on something other than what his intent is and will allow me to have a chance to strike at him and with good cause. Karate is valuable in this sort of situation although you may not believe that it is. The only time that karate becomes useless is when you are in gun sites from a distance and since this case has a knife then I have the option of force with me at all times. I'd also be willing to guess that step 3 is where you would take a stand as well since it would be your best opportunity and best risk-reward. Wallets mean nothing compared to the life of you and your girl so there is no reason to risk them over such a simple thing.\n \n \nYou suspicious of me? I don't want ANYTHING from you... You however want something from me.\n \n Are you sure you are in the majority?\n\n \n I'm suspicious because I think you may actually believe that you are master of your destiny. You are a little crazy in the assumption and to have someone like you on the streets with a gun cannot be a positive thing. You are going to hurt someone or get hurt yourself so of course I'm suspicious of you. I don't know how far you have gone already but I know I wouldn't want to be there when you go further. You sound like the type of person that makes the case for gun control seem like a perfect idea.\n \n Also I hope the majority believes that no one can be master of their own destiny simply because they have a weapon.",

   "lol, if you have to ask then the point is already lost on you.\n \n\n \n This is a non answer\n \n \nWhat percent of those who resisted are now dead? That is exactly the point. You encourage resistance but won't admit that resistance has its disadvantages! Also you must be assuming that your arsenal would be an option at all if you were attacked. Reality would be that the criminal is looking to accomplish something with minimal difficulty and making as clean of a get away as possible. You would make both impossible and therefore people would of course get hurt. That is reality.\n\n \n \n You don't GET IT. You don't know me. I explained in the previous post that these women would rather DIE than be a victim again. That possibillity is a reality, Just as I said if you are staring down a barrel of a gun your chances are slim to none. However there comes a point when you must decide if you are a sheep or a goat. You put that choice of life and death in the criminal gun or no gun. \n \n We got to move back on topic... We can just leave it as you don't get it.\n \n \n\n That still doesn't make you master of your destiny. If you have no control then you are not master of your destiny. You can refuse to die on your knees but that doesn't prevent death from coming to you. Therefore the criminal would be 100% in control. You can try and convince yourself that you are in control just because you refuse to get on your knees but that doesn't mean that you are in control at all.\n \n\n \n By choosing not to die on my knees yes I died standing/fighting but I chose to say NO you will have no dominion over me! again you don't get it so lets cut all this out and stick to guns\n \n \n\n I congratulate them for their willingness to die to protect themselves. That takes a lot of guts to do but that still doesn't make them master of their destiny. I'd also encourage them to learn some karate to go along with weapons skills as it will improve their hand to hand combat which will be most beneficial in that situation.\n\n \n I suggest they apply for a ccw and take martial arts such as Brazillian jiu-jitsu as Karate does not work on bigger stronger men BJJ at least works the positions that a young women might find herself in.\n \n \n\n lol, need I remind you that you said you are master of your destiny. This would mean that you are in control. You also preach resistance and use of force. This would indicate violence will occur anyways so be pre-emptive. I just get the feeling that you are obsessed with the idea that violence will occur and you need a gun to save your life. But if you don't think that this is the case then at least I can see you have not lost complete touch with reality. Still I cannot understand your obsession with being in control of your reality based on having a gun.\n \n\n \n Again I remind you I do not carry a gun on me. I do not teach violence I teach self defense. I teach marksmanship, I teach Close Quarter Combat techniques (both armed and unarmed). I am obsessed with training the body and mind for a myriad of purposes.. Not that in the UNLIKLEY event you will be confronted with violence. I teach preparedness. You have put yourself in a very violent situation with your brother and you FAILED to act. If anyone dies from your negligence it will be as much your fault as it is your brothers.\n \n \n \n \n\n You don't want anarchy, you just don't want any more gun laws and it doesn't go beyond that correct? I'm guessing your views are libertarian based on pieces of your posts?\n\n \n Repeal of unconstitutional laws Gun laws, Drug laws, etc. You are just now figuring out I am a Libertarian? I mentioned several times in the past that I run for various offices under the Libertarian party!\n \n \n\n I gave an example, I never suggested that it was a good idea to eliminate guns. I wanted to show that statistics could show whatever you want them to show on paper. But just to answer your question, I would eliminate drugs first of course. Gambling is perfectly fine with me although it has to be controlled. Knives are too easy to make to eliminate so why even try? Cars cannot be eliminated unless teleportation is developed. At that time cars can be eliminated. Which order would you eliminate them in anyways?\n \n\n \n I would not deny ANYONE any of these things... I Libertarian, Your respons TOTALITARIAN.\n \n \n\n Why would that mean that you are like my brother? I singled out my brother as an unusual case. How does that mean that everyone is like him including yourself? I realize you are not my brother and probably no one else in the world is, unless he has a twin!!!! (DAAAAH)\n\n \n because you want to regulate me based on the actions of your (criminal) brother...\n \n \n\n I want to regulate you because I cannot trust you. I think you want too many freedoms and that will open up security risks for those who truly are good citizens. I think that you and people like you are asking for way too much to be doing it just for the good of mankind. You are out to accomplish something other than what you are stating therefore I cannot say that I trust you. So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother. You are too fanatical about your belief.\n \n\n \n Ah eliminate guns for \"the common good\". Eliminate the jews \"for the common good\", Eliminate freedom of religion \"for the common good\".\n \n \"So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother\"\n \n But you trust your government more? The government has killed many more people than I have. In fact have I EVER indicated I would be willing to shoot anyone? (invading armies aside).\n \n Please quote me where I am \"fanatical\". You civil rights violator are the one who is fanatical and the pshycology behind your views is very scary.\n \n \n \n\n You have yet to clarify what you mean then. Let me help you. You are master of your destiny.\n \n Destiny - an event (or course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future.\n \n Therefore you are the master of what will happen to you in the future or what is currently happening to you. Do you realize type of mindset you would have to have in order to believe this? That is why I question your ability to understand a lot about this debate. I'm not sure whether or not you believe that you truly are master of your destiny or not. If you actually believe that you are then you are a few bricks short of a building.\n \n\n \n \n You are trying to take a literal approach to a non literal concept. And for this thread lets move on. \n \n \n\n hehe, yeah I think it is pretty cool too. You stated that you wouldn't pull your gun if someone had one by your head. You are obsessed with being master of your destiny and if you knew karate you would have quick enough reflexes to have a chance at taking any gun that was put near your head. Yet interestingly you think this is a joke. lol :)\n \n\n \n Wrong! Karate has no chance of gun disarmament. Some Systems have better disarmament techniques than others. McDojo teaching punches and kicks in the air while bowing in a fake japanese/Korean setting is not going to teach you this. Anyways it is not the system its the practicioner+the system. \n \n \n\n You still don't understand what you are really saying, do you? I can't say that I'm surprised as it would seem that you have lost some touch with reality IMO. I used to think you were a pretty down to Earth person when it came to the gun control debate but lately you seem to be getting crazier with your debates and now that you are claiming that a gun makes you a God because it allows you to be master of your destiny, I can see my assumptions about you in the past were inaccurate.\n \n\n \n WILL YOU PLEASE STOP ATTRIBUTING THINGS TO ME WHICH ARE NOT TRUE!\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n\n I also don't care if you use the same line over and over again. You are stating something that is absolutely insane and I'm going to call you on it as it will pertain to this debate.\n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n Quote me where I say these things that give you this FALSE impression.\n \n \n\n This is particularly confusing as you believe a gun potentially increases your odds of survival yet you are still master of your destiny. That is really a strange point of view to take. Wouldn't you admit this is a strange statement?\n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n Drop the master of destiny thing as you don't get it.\n \n \n \n\n As far as I can tell I am making the logical statement here. You don't seem to know what destiny actually is and even if you do know what it is then you are crazy to believe a gun or anything else will make you master of it.\n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n A gun does not make me anything. Neither does that figure of speech you are held up on.\n \n \n \n\n lol you are the sheep. You believe that a gun makes you master of your destiny. I'm sure someone told you this and now you follow it to the letter like a sheep. I make my own decisions as the situation changes. I don't depend on a gun making me master of my destiny. I believe I can help my cause by making decisions that make sense in a particular situation.\n\n \n Ok rubber glue right I am the sheep, good argument. The only \"decision\" you make is to roll on your back and expose your tummy... If it gets even harsher you may pee yourself. Yeah some goat you are! \n \n the rest:\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n\n The criminal will often has is own interests in heart which will be to get what he wants and make a clean getaway. He isn't going to want a fight or to murder anyone as it will lower his risk-reward ratio.\n \n\n \n And your willing to bet your life on this?\n \n \n \n\n lol, well I could ask you the same questions and you would probably have the same answers. You would eventually fall back on pulling your gun which would probably get you and your girlfriend killed. I'm sure you think you become master of your own destiny just because you pull your gun but in actuality you don't. Think this way is only going to get you in trouble!\n \n\n \n \n I bet you are wrong if you were honest.\n \n and\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n \n\n Well if I can only answer yes or no then number 3 is where it becomes no. Number 3 is where the criminal is going to be focused on something other than what his intent is and will allow me to have a chance to strike at him and with good cause. Karate is valuable in this sort of situation although you may not believe that it is. The only time that karate becomes useless is when you are in gun sites from a distance and since this case has a knife then I have the option of force with me at all times. I'd also be willing to guess that step 3 is where you would take a stand as well since it would be your best opportunity and best risk-reward. Wallets mean nothing compared to the life of you and your girl so there is no reason to risk them over such a simple thing.\n \n\n \n Now answer the same question specifically if this guy has a gun and says he is going to kill you..\n \n If you respond to nothing in this post respond to this.\n \n \n \n\n I'm suspicious because I think you may actually believe that you are master of your destiny. You are a little crazy in the assumption and to have someone like you on the streets with a gun cannot be a positive thing. You are going to hurt someone or get hurt yourself so of course I'm suspicious of you. I don't know how far you have gone already but I know I wouldn't want to be there when you go further. You sound like the type of person that makes the case for gun control seem like a perfect idea.\n \n\n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.\n \n \n\n Also I hope the majority believes that no one can be master of their own destiny simply because they have a weapon.\n\n \n \n \n ***YAWN***\n \n Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.",

   "Yes absolutley. Any thirteen year old with \"flight simulator\" could do as good a job as you. How to land a plane Why are you pilots so arrogant... This explains your snobbish attitude towards those who you suppsedly agree with you.

   "First did the totally gun free zones at school work at columbine?\n \n \n No, they did not. Had they actually been enforced, they would have.\n \n \nSecond what did the totally gun free zones on the airplanes do on 9/11?\n \n \n Obviously they did what they were supposed to (as far as preventing guns from being taken on a plane), because they were enforced.\n \n \nSo now box cutters are banned. Well the next airplane to be hijacked, the terrorist will simply obey the new rules and still hijack the airplanes!\n \n \n With what, car keys? You seem to ignore the fact that on the morning of 9/11, anyone could carry a knife with up to 4\" blade on it? They did not prevent the hijackings either. So why would it be any different with guns?\n \n \nThe people that made these areas gun free need to be held accountable for the deaths of the law abiding citizens! The courts have ruled that the victims can hold them accountable! \n \n \n I have asked you on numerous times to show me the proof of these rulings. Where is it? And who do you think should be held accountable, the government? Certainly not the airlines as you have stated in the past, they do not make the laws. The government made the laws.\n \n \nThis is another thing gun haters hate, is people having a different opinion. Gun haters feel they have the right to force people to disarm then not accept the responsibility for the safety of the unarmed law abiding citizens!\n \n \n I never challenged your right to have an opinion. This is a debate forum, and opinions are what make this work. I obviously don't agree with your position, but if you backed it up with logic and factual evidence, then maybe I could at least see your side of it clearly. Instead, you attack anyone with a different opinion than yours, label them as \"gun hater\", and refuse to debate any points or answer any questions. My opinion is that guns do not belong on an airplane in the hands of citizens. I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane. Would you want it the same way if guns were allowed on board and your entire family was killed by a terrorist or psycho with a gun? Or would you then blame the government and airline for their deaths? \n \n \nOh and NRA Executive Vice President Wayne R. LaPierre, Jr.is entitled to his opinion!\n \n \n Yes, he certainly is. The question was, IS HE A \"GUN HATER\" because he proposes these limits? By your logic, he would have to be. My opinion is that he understands that some common sense gun control laws are neccesary and at the same time fights for the rights of gun owners. What is wrong with this? And what is your opinion?",

Not one gun free zone prevents a criminals from bringing a gun into it! \n They do however stop law abiding citizens from exercising their right to bear arms!\n \n 9/11 proved gun free airplanes do not work! \n \n Guns were not allowed on the airplanes on 9/11 and over 3000 law abiding Americans paid a price for that!\n \n Yes the government and airlines are responsible for the deaths of the victims on 9/11.

   "The laws were enforced the law abiding citizens were obeying them, the criminals did not!\n \n \n Again, no, they were not enforced. Putting a law on the books and putting up a sign is not enforcement. Enforcement is using screeners and technology to ensure that the guns do not get in the school. \n \n \nYou ignore the fact that the next time terrorist hijack another airplane they will simply use what is allowed on the airplane, as they did on 9/11!\n \n \n I ignore nothing...I asked you, what do they have left to take over a plane with? The magazines in the seatback? Car keys? Remember, that every citizen getting on a plane can carry anything that a terrorist can. They could on 9/11 too, but this did not prevent the hijackings. Why do you assume that allowing people to carry guns on board will make that difference? Suppose the terrorists are the only one on the plane that flight that have a gun? \n \n \nA gun hater is a member of a hate group. Hate groups want to take rights away from other people. Since you want laws that only affect the law abiding citizens right to bear arms you are a gun hater. Not one gun free zone prevents a criminals from bringing a gun into it! \n \n \n I only want laws that affect law abiding citizens? Does not ensuring that everybody getting on a plane does not have a weapon affect everyone getting on the plane? This includes law abiding citizens and criminals / terrorists. Why do you chose to ignore that fact. And the airports are perfect examples of gun free zones that prevent guns. BECAUSE THEY ENFORCE IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES. It could be the same with schools if every school had the proper enforcement. Enforcement means assuring compliance with a law. Like having the ability to screen people and assure that they do not break the law. \n \n \n9/11 proved gun free airplanes do not work!\n \n \n No, 9/11 proved that we should not allow any weapons on board an aircraft, as arming the terrorists only makes their job easier. Being that there were no guns on planes on 9/11, i would say the gun free zone worked. The problem was, we let other weapons on, ie...knives, and this worked to arm the terrorists. \n \n \nGuns were not allowed on the airplanes on 9/11 and over 3000 law abiding Americans paid a price for that!\n \n \n Again, do you know that guns would have prevented it? Do you know if anyone would have been carrying a gun on board other than the terrorists? How can you blame not having guns on board for 9/11? The 9/11 terrorists could have just shot everyone on board and still flown the plane into the buildings. Dead bodies in a plane cause just as much damage as live bodies do. \n \n \n \nYes the government and airlines are responsible for the deaths of the victims on 9/11. By disarming people they assume responsibility for their safety.\n \n \n Again, maybe the government, but deffinately not the airlines. The government makes the laws, not the airlines. What about the people themselves? If you get on a plane where you know you cannot have a gun, you are taking the risk in the first place right? AND IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE USING THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THE COURTS FINDING THAT THE AIRLINES AND TRANSIT AUTHORITY CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE, POST THE LINKS TO THE RULINGS. PERSONALLY, I HAVE LOOKED FOR THIS INFORMATION, AND HAVE NOT FOUND A THING. SHOW ME THE PROOF, OR STOP USING IT AS AN ARGUMENT. \n \n \nNow if he is demanding gun laws as other gun haters do that would disarm the law abiding citizens, and then not be responsible for the unarmed citizens yes he would be a gun hater!\n \n \n Well, I think his comment pretty much speaks for itself. So by your logic, Wayne is a \"gun hater\". Very nice. I'm sure many, many people would agree with you...sure. That is the most rediculous thing I have ever heard.",

Then the terrorist will use whatever the government or airlines allow on the airplanes to hijack them, as they did on 9/11. Basically a weapon is anything used to threaten to harm or kill a person. People not wanting to be harmed or killed will comply with the terrorist demands, as they did on 9/11. One group of people on one airplane decided they did not want to die and resisted. It appears they saved untold innocent law abiding citizens lives by doing so. I guess you are angry at these people for endangering the aircraft by resisting the terrorist! \n \n Oh hey what did the passengers that resisted use? Bare hands maybe? Yes you can also use you hands to kill people. And this is enough for some people to not want to confront terrorist.

   "Once again for the last time since gun haters seem to not want to accept the fact that gun free school zones were enforced. The law abiding citizens at any school that has a shooting obeyed the laws. The criminals did not! \n \n \n They obviously were not enforced. Did they have screeners at columbine before the shootings? Did they have completely controlled entrance to the school. Did they search people? Did they have metal detectors? This is enforcement. The laws were not enforced, result, dead people. If they had all of these things in place at Columbine, it would have never happened. \n \n \nAgain the terrorist will obey the rules to board the airplanes. Then the terrorist will use whatever the government or airlines allow on the airplanes to hijack them, as they did on 9/11. Basically a weapon is anything used to threaten to harm or kill a person.

It appears they saved untold innocent law abiding citizens lives by doing so. I guess you are angry at these people for endangering the aircraft by resisting the terrorist! \n \n \n That's one of the worst arguments I have seen by anyone on this thread. Again, what weapons do they have to use now? Yes, they can use their hands, but as we saw on 9/11, so can the passengers. And I find it would be hard to hijack a plane with a pair of hands...don't you? And I am proud of the people that fought back, they did what they should have. It has also happened since 9/11 that passengers have subdued criminals and would-be terrorists on planes. That proves that this works. Passengers can fight back with their hands and be effective. \n \n \n \nOh hey what did the passengers that resisted use? Bare hands maybe? Yes you can also use you hands to kill people. And this is enough for some people to not want to confront terrorist. Just the threat of physical force will make some people comply!\n \n \n What? Make people comply...like making the terrorists sit back down? Like 50 passengers choking him...with their bare hands? Wow, what a concept. \n \n \nGun free airplanes and schools worked, the criminals and terrorist were able to commit their crimes because no one could resist them!\n \n \n They were able to commit their crimes on the planes because:\n 1. they had weapons that they are not allowed to have now.\n 2. the passengers did not know that the terrorists were on a suicide mission. \n \n The passengers who did find out (united 93) were the ones who fought back and saved countless lives on the ground. Before 9/11, people thought of hijackings as a couple of terrorists taking over a plane and going to cuba, demanding money, or some other political end. Few people envisioned them as taking over planes to use as weapons. That is why people were always told to comply and obey terrorists. The game is different now, and we now know we must fight back. If a plane full of people can figure that out in a few minutes by making a cell phone call, perhaps the rest of us who have had time to reflect on the events of 9/11 would have a good understanding that fighting back is no longer just an option, it is neccesary.\n \n They were able to commit the crimes at Columbine because:\n 1. Nobody was waiting at the door to stop them, there were laws in place, but nobody to carry out the enforcement of the laws. PERIOD.\n \n \nA weapon is anything that can be used to threaten to harm or kill a person to force them to comply with your demands! Criminals and terrorist used these gun free zones to their fullest advantage! Gun haters should be happy the gun haters made the criminals and terrorist jobs easier!\n \n \n No, I think the fact that we allowed 19 people to board 4 planes with boxcutters made it easier. Do you think that 19 people could again take over 4 planes with their hands? Or a pencil, or a book, or a magazine, or a PDA, or a camera, or a ...\n \n \nAgain you do not know if guns would not have prevented it. Gun haters never what if anything good outcomes with guns because gun haters want to ban guns!\n \n \n You are right, they might have prevented it, they might not have. Is it possible that they may have been the only ones on board with guns...yes. But skip that part, lets lay it out.\n \n 1. 3 terrorists stand up, you are the only armed person on the plane. You shoot all three before they can shoot you or anyone else...unlikely, but lets say you do. WOW. Your a hero, you can go on Leno and get your I'm a hero with a gun medal, and everyone will think you are just great. WOW.\n \n 2. 3 terrorists stand up, you are the only armed person on the plane. You shoot 2 of the terrorists before the 3rd on kills you. I guess you are still a hero of sorts, but sorry, they will only be able to put the medal in your grave with you, and no Leno. \n \n 3. 3 terrorists stand up, nobody else on board is armed, they win.\n \n Now let me ask you, you seem to feel very strongly about who to hold responsible. Would you be willing to take personal responsibility if someone with a gun hijacked a plane and ran it into another tall building? After all, you pushed to have the guns on there. Would you fight a lawsuit naming you as responsible for the plane full of people and those killed on the ground? Would you be willing to take responsibility if you accidentally shot someone on the plane while in a shootout with a terrorist? What if someone pulls out their gun to show someone else and they accidentaly shoot the person, or themselves. Will you take responsibility. After all, you pushed to have the guns on the plane. Truth is, if you push to have the guns on the plane, then you are responsible for the safety of everyone on the plane. If a terrorist kills someone with a gun, you are just as much responsible, after all, you wanted him to be able to walk on the plane with a gun. You say, the people who have forced others to give up their rights should be held responsible for the safety of the unarmed, so by the same logic, if you push to have guns on board, you are then responsible for anyone who gets killed by one of those guns. \n \n \n\"First, we believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America's schools, period ... with the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel. \n \n \n You find this to be an ambiguous statement?\n \n \n\"We believe America's schools should be as safe as America's airports. You can't talk about, much less take, bombs and guns onto airplanes. Such behavior in our schools should be prosecuted....\" \n \n \n How about that? They are very clear, especially where he says \"this means no guns in America's schools, period.\" Somehow it does not surprise me that you don't get this.",

   "Gee the law abiding citizens at the gun free zones did not need to be searched or pass through metal detectors they were obeying the law. The criminals that killed them were not obeying the law pertaining to gun free zones!\n \n \n DUH! What is your point?\n \n \nIt appears gun hater you concept of a civilized country is all citizens are treated like criminals, passing through check points being searched randomly! Are these more common sense restrictions the gun haters want?\n \n \n In airports and schools, absolutely. And enforcing a gun free zone with security checkpoints and searches is not treating people like criminals. You have no concept of what security is.\n \n \nOnce again for the gun hater the threat of physical force is enough to force some people to comply. And yes what about the people that resisted on the one plane. Did they cause it to crash? You know your constant harping about a law abiding citizen doing the same thing with a gun. Are you going to blame them for wanting to resist?\n \n \n So if a terrorist stands up and says \"anybody moves and I'll punch you in the head...this is a hijacking\", people will cower in fear? I think I would probably laugh at him and tell him to sit down. I think you would find more than enough citizens who would subdue him if he didn't. And could you rephrase the rest? It made little sense to me, what do you mean? \n \n \nInteresting how gun haters always claim times are changing!\n \n \n \n They aren't? You seem to think this is the 1700's, and you just might get to shoot a redcoat. Times have changed. Many things are different just since 9/11. I would call this change.\n \n \nThe laws were enforced the law abiding citizens were obeying them, not one law abiding citizen had a gun in the gun free zones at the school!\n \n \n What? Is your alarm on? Laws do not need to be enforced for law abiding citizens. They need to be enforced to prevent criminals from breaking them. Do you know what the word enforcement means? Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. How can you say the laws were enforced if 2 kids carried guns into school? If the had been enforcing the laws, they would have been stopped at the door. \n \n \nOnce again nothing but bad what ifs. What if law abiding citizens with gun saved the airplanes? \n \n \n Ahh, the old what if argument. This is really stupid. And actually, I did give you your what if, #1. Sure that is the best case outcome, but I am not concerned with the best case scenario, I am concerned with the worst case scenario. You could say \"what if nobody ever hurt anybody again\". While it sounds nice in theory, this is far from logical. \n \n \nPeople defending the right to bear arms have always said a person using a gun is responsible for any things that happens when they use a gun! \n \n \n You really didn't answer the question. Would you be willing to be held responsible for deaths on a plane even if you did not shoot the gun? By your logic, if you push to have the guns on the plane, then you personally are responsible for the flying public. And you still never showed me any proof of the courts ruling that the airlines and transit authority can be held responsible for he deaths on 9/11. Is this perhaps because you can't find any proof of these? Don't worry, neither could I. \n \n \nGun haters are the ones that blame the gun for the person commiting crimes with guns! \n \n \n So by your logic, wait until someone hijacks a plane and drives it into a building, or at least kills a few people on the plane and lock him up then? Or let 2 kids walk into a school and kill 13 people? Did it ever occur to you that if these kids had not been able to walk into the school with the guns, 13 people would still be alive?",

   " DUH! What is your point? \n\n \n What is the point? Gun hater your gun free zones worked at columbine and the airports. The law abiding students at that school and the people on the airplanes on 9/11 obeyed the no guns on campus and no guns on airplane law. The two criminals that walked onto that campus did not! They killed 11 law abiding students because there was no armed law abiding citizen there to stop them. The terrorist on the airplanes used the next available weapon to hijack the airplanes and fly them into tall buildings!\n \n Oh and I will not lower myself to trying to insult you by using the word \"duh\" . Unlike gun haters like you I do not need to do this . But it appears gun hater such as you have a need to insult anybody they cannot win a debate with..\n \n \n \n In airports and schools, absolutely. And enforcing a gun free zone with security checkpoints and searches is not treating people like criminals. You have no concept of what security is.\n\n \n Yes it is gun hater You have stated you trust no one! Gun hater you stated you would not allow a law enforcement officer on your plane with a gun \"simply based on how that law enforcement officer looked at you!\". Gun hater you are paranoid! This what you tried to label people defending the right to bear arms. \n \n Gee gun hater what happen at the LAX? Did not some criminal go into a terminal up to the security check point and start shooting? So what was the solution to this from the paranoid people? Move the check points out past the terminals now. \n \n How is a society civilized if they search and suspect all of it citizens as you do? Not one of the security things you want will stop the terrorist the next time they hijack an airplane! But they will violate the rights of the law abiding citizens! \n \n \n So if a terrorist stands up and says \"anybody moves and I'll punch you in the head...this is a hijacking\", people will cower in fear? I think I would probably laugh at him and tell him to sit down. I think you would find more than enough citizens who would subdue him if he didn't. And could you rephrase the rest? It made little sense to me, what do you mean? \n\n \n \n Interesting how gun haters are all physically fit people, that can always beat up the biggest terrorist! Even the biggest person can being taken down by a group of people. Gun hater must all be like John Wayne!\n \n So gun hater you are claiming people are not forced to do things simple because of the threat of physical force. Never heard of mugging have you gun hater? Not all muggers use guns to take rob their victims!\n \n \n \n They aren't? You seem to think this is the 1700's, and you just might get to shoot a redcoat. Times have changed. Many things are different just since 9/11. I would call this change.\n\n \n Times have changed? \n It appears criminals still harm law abiding citizens as they did in the 1700's. \n It appears America still has enemies as it did in the 1700's. \n It appears gun haters like you still want to take rights away from other people as they did in the1700's! \n So just how have times changed? Other then we now have gun free zones where criminals pretty much have a free hand to harm unarmed law abiding citizens. This gun hater must be your times have changed bs. Gun haters like you have made it easier for the criminals and terrorist! Is this change for the good of society? \n \n \n What? Is your alarm on? Laws do not need to be enforced for law abiding citizens. They need to be enforced to prevent criminals from breaking them. Do you know what the word enforcement means? Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. How can you say the laws were enforced if 2 kids carried guns into school? If the had been enforcing the laws, they would have been stopped at the door. \n\n \n Yes the unarmed law abiding citizens at the gun free zones at schools and airports that were killed by criminals and terrorist were doing this \"Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. \" The criminals were not!\n \n \n \n \n Ahh, the old what if argument. This is really stupid. And actually, I did give you your what if, #1. Sure that is the best case outcome, but I am not concerned with the best case scenario, I am concerned with the worst case scenario. You could say \"what if nobody ever hurt anybody again\". While it sounds nice in theory, this is far from logical. \n\n \n \n Gun haters like you always what if the negative never the positive. Why is this? Simple gun haters like you want to limit or ban the right to bear arms!\n \n By the way gun hater you stated the what if bs! \n \n \n \n So by your logic, wait until someone hijacks a plane and drives it into a building, or at least kills a few people on the plane and lock him up then? Or let 2 kids walk into a school and kill 13 people? Did it ever occur to you that if these kids had not been able to walk into the school with the guns, 13 people would still be alive?\n\n \n Oh that is right you have the ability to tell just who is going to commit a crime! Yes I forgot you would deny a law enforcement officer on your plane with a gun simply based on how they looked at you. Gun hater you need to teach law enforcement people this ability. The police could just arrest a person before they commit a crime. \n \n I think law enforcement works like this though. A criminal breaks the law and is apprehended by the police. Evidence it taken by the police. The criminal is given a lawyer and a date is set for court. Then a court of people decides based on evidence if the criminal is guilty or not. If not guilty the person is not punished. If guilty the criminal is sentenced to a prison term. This way a DANGEROUS person is separated from society making society safe from this DANGEROUS criminal!",

   "DON'T FINANCE THE MURDER OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS \n \n \n [You may think this is a little severe, but read it over again, and think about it - Fred]\n \n ALERT FROM JEWS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FIREARMS OWNERSHIP - America's Aggressive Civil Rights Organization\n September 19, 2001 \n Why I Am Canceling My Appearance at the Freedom Summit\n By Aaron Zelman Executive Director, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership\n \n \n Would you pay to have the Bill of Rights used as toilet paper? Would you write a check to have every liberty the Bill protects flushed into the sewer? Would you pony up your credit card for permission to be mangled in the inhuman and inhumane machinery of a corporate police state?\n \n If your answer to these questions is no -- and hell no! and \n DON'T TREAD ON ME -- then you'll understand exactly why I am \n canceling my scheduled appearance at the annual Freedom Summit, the weekend of October 6 & 7, 2001. \n \n To reach the Summit in Arizona, I would have to fly from my home\n in Wisconsin. This I can no longer do -- not with the latest \n \"heightened [and useless] airport security measures\" designed to\n treat me like a criminal, a serf, or both.\n \n I will never set foot on a commercial airliner until the \n airlines, the airport authorities, the FAA, and all other \n would-be regulators of air travel respect my rights. (And I'm \n talking about inborn rights, the ones Americans have bled and \n died for, not government-granted privileges that can be \n withdrawn at the whim of some faceless bean counter.)\n \n SUBMISSION ISN'T SAFETY\n \n Tragedy and threats of war -- even the most horrible the U.S.\n has ever seen -- must not be allowed to become an excuse for \n the murder of liberty.\n \n Arbitrary searches don't halt violence. But as if they missed \n that entire point on September 11, 2001, the airlines and the \n regulators they're cozy in bed with want more of the same. Walk\n through their scanners. Humbly answer their questions, praying \n that you don't sound nervous or \"suspicious.\" Open your bags. \n Open your purses. Open your shaving kits or your lipstick tubes.\n Bend over and open whatever orifice they might wish to inspect \n once they've determined your willingness to submit.\n \n Disarming me and you doesn't make the nation's skies safe. \n But -- tragically missing that point, also -- these police-\n statist cowards now want to make sure that millions of people\n are deprived even of their razor blades, Girl Scout knives -- \n and even plastic knives from fast-food joints. \n \n What will they want to take next? Our shoes so that we can't \n kick them? Our pens so that we can't gouge them? Our teeth so \n that we can't bite them? Our fingernails so that we can't claw\n them? \n \n Because believe me, if we comply with their new demands -- if \n we docilely go along for the sake of convenience and the false \n promise of \"safety\" -- they will eventually take everything \n that makes us free human beings. Corporate airlines and their \n pals in the bureaucracy and in Congress will take our arms, our\n rights, our courage, and our fight-back spirit -- and leave us \n as cowed as good Stalinist subjects, and as defenseless as \n newborn kittens. \n \n They saw the consequences on September 11 of disarming Americans and teaching them to be passive. And their reaction? To make us even more vulnerable, so we can't protect ourselves, each other,or our nation's freedom.\n \n These Beltway Bozos will make us unsafe on the ground as well \n as in the air. Remember several years ago, when gangs of \n criminals in Florida were targeting -- and sometimes killing --\n tourists who'd just gotten off airplanes? Why? Because the \n thugs knew their victims were disarmed. Now, with the new FAA\n guidelines, airline \"security\" agents are busily \"disarming\" \n travelers of their disposable razors, manicure sets, aerosol \n deodorants, hairspray, corkscrews, garden shears, sparklers, \n nail files, pen knives, and in one case reported by the \n Sacramento Bee, even an empty ammunition box. They want to \n make sure we can't fight back against anybody with any tool.\n \"Thanks, FAA,\" say the criminals, as they lie in wait for \n debarking passengers. \"You've just made our job SO much \n easier.\"\n \n I say it halts here -- in my life. Furthermore, you and I have\n a chance to put a total stop to these abuses of our liberty \n using our economic clout.\n \n STOP COMPLYING NOW. \n \n Don't pull out your checkbook. Don't hand over your credit \n cards. Don't give the government-regulated airlines your \n business. They're already in financial trouble, and they've\n earned it. Let them go bankrupt. Let them pay the price for \n conditioning us to act like cattle and lulling us into \n submission with their phony FAA-inspired promises to keep us\n \"safe.\"\n \n The airlines are private companies, even though they and the \n federal government are in each others pockets (like so many \n other big corporations). The jets they fly are privately owned.\n Airlines have the power to tell the government to go to hell. \n And if they don't, then we should tell THEM to go to hell.\n \n Give them the Smith & Wesson treatment. Remember what happened when that gun manufacturer crawled under the sheets with Bill Clinton? S&W figured it would make politically correct guns, \n violate your privacy, compromise your safety, be paid off in \n lucrative government contracts and get federal protection from\n lawsuits. Weren't the compromisers surprised when gun owners \n (who they thought were paper tigers) and dealers (who they \n thought would put up with anything) turned around and broke \n S & W?\n \n So let the airlines go under. Help put them under. Some \n libertarian can buy up their assets for 10 cents on the dollar \n and run a new airline. Flight attendants on the future LibertyAir\n can hand out frangible ammunition instead of pretzels. That way\n nobody will poke holes in a fuselage while poking holes in a \n hijacker. And no costly, uniformed, authoritarian, fumble-\n fingered, rent-a-cop \"Sky Marshals\" will be needed.\n \n To put it bluntly, corporations, regulators, and legislators \n who don't approve of free, armed Americans flying on airplanes\n are domestic terrorists. We already saw the mass bloodshed they \n helped perpetrate on September 11, after decades of encouraging \n citizens to comply with evil and idiocy, decades of conditioning\n us to surrender our rights to anyone who makes a strident enough \n demand, decades of depriving us of both mental and physical tools\n for serious resistance. \n \n Why should real Americans be subjected to the herd-think that \n turns so much of the rest of humanity into mere subjects? Did \n our ancestors not fight to free us of such subservience?\n \n More acts of terror are inevitable. And when they strike, the \n blood of innocent people will be on the hands not only of the \n attackers and their controllers, but on the hands of airline \n presidents, faceless rule writers, \"just-following-orders\" \n airline security inspectors, and authoritarians like Charles \n Schumer, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Dianne Feinstein, Peter \n Jennings, and Dan Rather whose vision of utopia has their \n friends in charge and the rest of us cowed, tracked, stamped, \n numbered, disarmed, and helpless to resist.\n \n FIGHT BACK WITH TECHNOLOGY & PRINCIPLES\n \n The mission statement of the Freedom Summit \n \n www.freedom summit.com\n \n says: \"Socialism and other coercive centralized planning schemes\n have failed to improve, and indeed worsened, the human condition.\n ...[T]he Freedom Summit encourages individuals to promote freedom in non-coercive ways which are best suited to their individual talents.\" I completely support that mission. But it's more \n important to support it with actions than with words.\n \n By all means, attend the Freedom Summit if you can. That is, if\n you can walk there, bike there, drive there, or otherwise arrive\n without submitting to the police state. The Summit's organizers \n and speakers deserve your support. But for this and all other \n activities, rethink your priorities. Don't put yourself at the \n mercy of airlines, now or ever, until the police statists and \n human-cattle herders relent. \n \n Hold video conferences, not face-to-face meetings. Get on the \n Internet if you haven't already and use every electronic \n opportunity for communication. (You'll get more accurate, less\n \"managed\" news, too, while you're at it.)\n \n Drive, don't fly, on your vacations or your visits to family.\n \n If you're a pilot or flight attendant, quit if they won't allow\n you any meaningful self-defense. Go to work for people who don't\n want you to be a victim. True, that's easier said than done, but\n you owe it to yourself, your loved ones, and America.\n \n Everyone: Arm yourselves and don't surrender your right to be \n armed for anybody's greasy assurances that if you behave meekly\n enough they'll keep you safe.\n \n Finally -- and soon: Let the airlines crash (financially) as \n emphatically as they let four of their planes crash on \n September 11, 2001. Don't help underwrite the bloody terror\n that inevitably arises from submission and disarmament. \n \n Don't conspire in the contract-murder of the Bill of Rights.\n \n Freely,\n Aaron Zelman \n Executive Director, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms \n Ownership \n \n \n \n \n \n Exactly to the point...",

   "Comparing gun laws from differen countries them screaming about crime rates is useless. There are thousands of cultural differences between countries, which contribute to the differences you are going on about. I don't imagine you would be very happy if I were to wildly quote stats from Switzerland and Israel.\n \n \n Why don't you, many others have no problem using these countries as examples, even though our cultures and societies differ vastly. \n \n \nSomebody rushing the cockpit with a gun would no doubt arouse suspicion and be shot before he could do any damage on a well armed plane. \n \n \n You hope. Or, perhaps he could kill 2 or 3 people on his way to the cockpit, or he could shoot through the forward cabin bulkhead, hit one of the pilots, or damage instrumentation in the cockpit, or put a hole in the pressure vessel, or hit a fuel tank, or hit a fuel pump contained in a fuel tank causing the plane to explode...etc. You get it? You cannot make any accurate statement on the exact turnout of events. It is safer to assure no guns board a plane, unless carried by a marshal or credentialed law enforcement official. And one more thing...who are you to guarantee that many of the passengers on the aircraft are armed? It certainly would not be mandatory to carry a gun, so just suppose that the only armed people to climb onto the plane one particular day are the terrorists. Boy, that woud suck.\n \n \n As opposed to \"hey that guy has a box cutter, lets sit around cowering to see what he does\".\n \n \n Perhaps on the morning of 9/11...yes. Now...not a chance. It has already happened several times since 9/11 that the passengers...not law enforcement...have subdued unruley passengers. Prior to 9/11, a hijacking was seen as a couple people with a political agenda taking an airliner to an airport of their choosing, and bargaining for ransom of some sort (political, monetary, release of some prisoners...etc.) 9/11 changed the definition of hijacking. Now, people know they must fight back. Personally, I would rather face a terrorist with a boxcutter than one with a gun, but that's just me. \n \n \nDo you know why the air in commercial aircraft doesn't get stale?\n \n \n Yes, I do. But is does not seem that you do. \n \n \nIt is because of adjustable vents controlled from the cockpit.\n \n \n Not quite. It is because air...reffered to as \"bleed air\" is taken from the compressor section of a turbine engine. As air is spun into the compressor, there is a valve at the third compressor blade (P3 valve) that takes this air and bleeds it off of the engine...hence the term bleed air. This air then passes through something called an ACM (air cycle machine), where it is cooled and then allowed into the cabin. The air may be recycled through something called a VCM (vapor cycle machine), recooled, and sent back to the cabin, or it is discharged from he aircraft through outflow valves located at the rear of the pressure vessel. During a loss of cabin pressure, pilots do not play around opening or closing \"vents\". Pilots will descend the aircraft to a safe altitude (usually 10,000'). \n \n \nIf bullets were to start flying, the vents would be closed slightly to account for the difference, and the aircraft would keep flying. If you are imagining a scene from aliens when a bullet goes through the wall of a plane....haw\n \n \n The problem here junior, is that you seem to be misinformed. At normal cruise altitudes of most airliners (30 - 40 thousand feet) the pressure outside the aircraft is very low. Normally, you will have something called a differential pressure, which is the measurement of the difference of pressure between the air outside and the air inside an aircraft. This pressure is normally 5.27 PSI in a fully pressurized aircraft. When a bullet would go flying through the side of an airplane, breaking the pressure vessel, it causes something reffered to as a rapid or explosive decompression. With the differential pressure, and the sudden weakening of one part of the structure of the aircraft, a bullet hole will turn into a huge hole within milliseconds. Take for example a balloon. Blow it up just a little bit so that is just barely stretched (pressure inside not much greater than pressure outside), and poke it with a pin...what happens? The air slowly leaks out. Now, take a balloon and blow it up so that the skin is stretched tightly (pressure inside much greater than pressure outside), and poke it with a pin...what happens? BOOM. Same thing. It has happened with aircraft before...look up the example of the United flight that landed in Honolulu missing a large section if the overhead fuselage, and some passengers (seats included). The other problems are that when pieces of the aircraft go flying out, or people or seats etc...they have the potential to take out engines, strike the wing or tail...causing serious structural damage...etc. Flying a plane with structural damage with possibly one or more engine out is not my idea of a good time....haw.",

In reality, if you had a bullet sized hole in a plane, you would experience a hissing sound, maybe an annoying whisteling sound. An airplane is not a balloon. At 5.27 PSI, you would need a hole with an area of 17.174 sq ft in order to cause lexan (the weakest component of the crafts shell) to degrede due to compression. At 172 PSI, a bullet hole will cause total loss of structural integrity on a piece of lexan. when you are talking about the actual skin of the aircraft (usually aluminum) the numbers are much higher.\n \n They test different materials for suitablitly in aircraft use. Decompression tests are carried out at 8.5 psi, much higher than most real world conditions. \n \n Explosive decompresion can only be caused by the loss of a significant portion of the airframe. In every case ever reported (all 8 of them) it was the result of either a mid air colision, an explosion, or metal fatigue (that is what happened in the flight that landed in honolulu). You simply CANNOT explosivly decompress an airplane without a catastrophic event.\n \n Adjusting the cabin airflow can (and has) been used in order to adjust for minor differences in cabin pressure (such as a small leak in a hatch seal). If every airplane that ever experienced a hatch seal failure in flight burst like a baloon, the aircraft manufacturers would not be in the financial situation they are now, as there would be plenty of orders for new planes (to replace all of the ones that exploded).\n \n As far as bullets hitting fuel pumps or fuel tanks, you would get a leak, not an explosion. Check out the UEL and LEL of different grades of aviation fuel. Besides that, you need a spark or an open flame in order to initiate an explosion (just heat won't do it) and, contrary to what you saw in lethal weapon, bullets do NOT spark when you they hit a metal object because they are made of lead and sometimes brass. I suppose that a tracer round into an empty fuel tank MIGHT do it, but most likely you would need an infusion of O2 under laboratory conditions to get the mixture just right. \n \n Your knowledge of aircraft maintenance is good. Your knowledge of physics and chemistry illuminates the need for school reform. \n \n I do not think that terrorists with guns should be allowed on planes. I have no fear of law abiding citizens.",

Currently, the law is that only those with proper credentials (ie...law enforcement or certain govt. agents) may carry guns aboard an airplane.

No system is ever free from flaws. The idea is to mitigate risk wherever possible. Hey, at least they caught these people in NY and Miami. It at least shows that people are watching. It also shows that there are holes in the system that need to be fixed. Every time a flaw is discovered, it draws light to the fact that things need to be fixed. I believe the philosophy is sound, I don't believe it is currently being implemented properly. And as far as wrestling with terrorists, yes, I do want passengers to wrestle with them. They should do whatever it takes to subdue him. It has worked since 9/11 as I pointed out above.

I don't fear them carrying guns on board airplanes. I fear terrorists with guns on airplanes. Remember, on 9/11, the terrorists boarded the aircraft legally with boxcutters (which were then legal).

And what is your solution? You never really stated a solution. What is your plan to prevent another 9/11. How does your plan get implimented, how does it work? \n \n \nYou have the right to continue telling people they need to be unarmed and attack armed terrorist. \n \n \n Again, the idea is for everyone to be disarmed, not just law abiding people. Besides, as seen on 9/11, we cannot discriminate who is a terrorist and who is not. The idea is to not gived anyone the opportunity to have a weapon which makes it easier for them to take over the plane. And post 9/11 I don't think it is even neccesary to tell people that they need to attack someone who threatens the safety of a flight and subdue them. I think people somehow already understand what can happen, and will fight back regardless of what the terrorist has in his hand. \n \n \nI have the right to tell people they have a right to bear arms to defend themselves.

Are you going to assemble an army of these people to do the same and cover every single flight? If you answered no to any of these...plan fails. Try again. I think we already have people to do that, they are called air marshals. I would like to see them on every flight, I don't think they currently are.\n\n \n Air marshals are on about 20% of flights most likely. They have not been real forthcoming in regards to exactly how many air marshals there are for security reasons, but you can make a pretty decent guess by looking at their budget, then working backwards. Putting them on every flight wqould be too expensive to be feasible. \n \n I would be personally willing to gaurantee that there is an armed passenger on every flight, if you would be willing to personally gaurantee that thee will be a terrorist on every flight. YOu are making a rediculous assuption, which is that by allowing law abiding citizens to carry a gun on a plane terrorists would automatically have the same right.\n \n If you were going to allow citizens to carry guns on planes, it would no doubt be only licensed citizens. Licencing processes in about every state required background checks, american citizenship, etc... So, you are stuc with the same dilemma in the gun on plane scenario that you are with the gun ban scenario. Felons are not allowed to buy guns.....terrorists would not be allowed to take guns on planes. By definition, a law abiding citizen is neither a criminal nor are they a terrorist, so banning their posession of a gun does not, common sense dictates, effect the ability of terrorists or criminals to posess a weapon except insofar as some studies indicate that criminals are reluctant to go up against armed citizens.",

I pointed out that no matter how many security measures you enact terrorists will still be able to place guns on planes if they want to. I pointed out that your security measure to search all passengers and luggage for weapons is costly.

   "Perhaps you should go back and read the preceding 13 pages, you might have learned something. And no, unless you arre a properly credentialed law enforcement official, you will never be allowed to carry a gun on board a plane with you. You may have it in your checked luggage, but FAA regs require the bag to be located in a compartment that is not accessable by you, and the gun must be unloaded, and double locked. You retain the key.\n\n \n Like I said, extremely difficult to do legally. Only very few people are allowed to do so. With any luck, I will be one of them (Just got recommended for a position in the Australian Special Forces).\n \n \nJust one thought on the rest of your post, yes, people have and will in the future hijack / attempt to hijack airplanes. Arming the passengers on a plane creates more danger than assuring that none of them are armed.\n\n \n Actually, no it doesnt. You see, hijacking a plane is either suicidal (guaranteed death for passengers) or very stupid. A hijacked plane can only go so far on the fuel it has. It is easily tracked, easily boarded and easily re-taken. Professional and smart criminals do not do it any more because it is almost imossible to pull off effectively. When the plane lands, the ground forces will surround it, wait you out, and then take you out.\n \n Thus, the only people (excluding suicidal fundies) who hijack planes are stupid, unprofesional sorts. These people are extremely dangerous due to their lack of composure and control. When things start to go pear shaped for them, as they inevitably will, they will lose control of the situation fast and will resort to violence in an attempt to regain it. This is a very bad situation to be in.\n \n \nRemember, just because you can shoot at him, he can shoot back. Would you rather get in a shoot out or simply tie someone up with the help of the other passengers?\n\n \n Yes, but he has to watch every passenger on the plance. I just have to watch him, and perhaps five of his buddies. Either he is suicidal, and intends to use the plane 9/11 style, or he is stupid. Either way, sooner or later he will present a clean shot. \n \n Point in fact, he will be armed whether I am or not. I would rather be armed legally than unarmed.\n \n With regards to the box-cutters or knives:\n \n emoticon_confused \n \n You need to be very good to kill someone with a small knife like that. If someone on a plane I was on tried to hijack it with a box-cutter they would soon be in a world of pain. If they are good enough to kill me with it, they should be making their living by training ninjas in Japan rather than hijacking planes.",

   "Here is an news article from a paper stating that airline employees can be paid off to break the law. This was before \n \n \n Phil Brennan, NewsMax.com\n Saturday Sept. 29, 2001 \n \n Ordinary, responsible Americans need to be armed, just as Israelis are in the war against terrorism, writes author/researcher John R. Lott Jr., who says that's the only adequate response to the terrorist threat Americans now face. \n Writing in today's Wall Street Journal, Lott notes the security problems the nation faces and insists that not matter how tight restrictions are, and no matter how many air marshals ride planes, nothing beats having an armed citizenry in the fight against terrorism. \n \n Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of \"More Guns, Less Crime\" (University of Chicago Press, 2000). itemizes the flaws in most of the security measures now in effect or being considered: \n \n Screening at airports, while important, will always be inadequate, he writes, noting that terrorists can always figure find some way around the controls such as bribing airport employees. \n \n \n \n Strengthening cockpit doors, he says, is probably a good idea, \" but given current airline design it may create dangerous differences in air pressure between the cockpit and cabin. In any case, the door must be opened sometime, to allow pilots to go to the bathroom or get food.\" \n \n \n The marshals program is more promising. He cites research by Bill Landes at the University of Chicago that showed that between a third and a half of the drop in airplane hijackings during the 1970s were the probable result of having armed U.S. marshals on planes as well as law enforcement's increased ability to catch and punish hijackers. \n Putting merely one air marshal aboard every daily flight in the U.S. would require an army of at least 35,000 officers-a far greater number than total of all those who now work for the FBI, Secret Service and the U.S. Marshal Service combined (17,000). Moreover, he adds that one marshal might not be enough to foil a whole gang of hijackers, of the kind used by Osama bin Laden. Clearly, he says, it will take a long time to deploy enough marshals. \n In response to these and other problems, Lott suggests that the 600,000 active state and local law enforcement officers in the U.S. today who are currently forbidden to bring their guns on airplanes should not only be allowed to board planes but even be given discount fares if they fly with their guns. Moreover, since most pilots have also had military experience they should be armed as their union, and NewsMax.com's Chris Ruddy have demanded, exactly as Israel's El Al been doing all along. \n \n Lott dismisses fears of having guns aboard planes, explaining that the special, high-velocity handgun ammunition used on planes packs quite a wallop but is designed not to penetrate the aluminum skin of the plane. Even with regular bullets he notes, the worst-case outcome would simply be to force the plane to fly at a lower altitude, where the air pressure is higher. \n \n But using guns to stop terrorists shouldn't be limited to airplanes, he insists. \"We should encourage off-duty police, and responsible citizens, to carry guns in most public places because cops can't be everywhere. \n \n In Israel, for example, Lott explains that about 10% of Jewish adults have permits to carry concealed handguns. Just to match that rate of permit holding, Americans would have to increase the number of permits from 3.5 million to almost 21 million, he wrote. \n \n \"Thirty-three states currently have \"right-to-carry\" laws, which allow the law-abiding to obtain a permit if they are above a certain age and pay a fee. Half of these states require some training. We should encourage more states to pass such laws, and possibly even subsidize firearms training,\" Lott maintains. \n \n He concludes by noting that the states that do pass concealed handgun laws \"experience drops in violent crimes, especially in multiple victim shootings - the type of attack most associated with terrorism. \"Bill Landes and I found that deaths and injuries from multiple-victim public shootings fell by 80% after states passed right-to-carry laws.\"",

   "Oh I know that, but I dont intend to stop there. I plan on staying for six years before attempting the SAS, and from there, who knows? Perhaps CIA field agent, perhaps SF training instructor in any western nation...\n \nMy point was that I'm on my way.\n \n \n Good luck to you. It is a long road, I hope you make it. \n \n \nI agree that letting just anyone have a gun on a plane is lunacy. I have always taken a middle-ground as far as gun control goes. I dont think just anyone should be able to take a gun onto a plane, but I dont see why more people arent allowed. Certainly licence the hell out of it, make the licences very hard to get, certainly. But I dont see why it should be practically impossible.\n \n \n I think we mostly agree on this point. They advocate repeal of all gun laws, stating that it is unconstitutional to place limits on a natural right. This means that they would have any old citizen with a gun carry it on board an aircraft. I know many people who own guns, few that I would trust in close quarter combat with one. The problem would be hillbilly Jed with his .45 gets on the plane, a passenger who appears to be middle-eastern stands up to go to the bathroom, and Jed blows a hole in his head. This is what I am against. The average American gun owner is not trained enough to be trusted with a gun in the situations that may arise in a hijacking. I would agree with making a special licence, making it difficult to obtain, and making the training extensive in order to get said licence. But in a sense, we already have that. We have the air marshal program, and whether the anti-gun control croud wants to admit it or not, this program does precisely what they are advocating. I am for expansion of this program, and making a volunteer air marshal program as well. Perhaps frequent flyers who are also gun owners complete the training succesfully, and then agree to carry aboard for say a 10% discount on airfares or some other perks. The only problem with this is that background checks would need to be done, and I don't mean sitting in front of a computer and looking for previous felonies, I mean real extensive checking where they talk to your neighbors where you grew up, get your highschool transcripts, extensive psychological testing, etc. The kind of checks required of trainees at the CIA and FBI. These checks are time consuming and expensive to do, so the anti-gun control croud would never go for anything that \"waste\" taxpayer money. I think a big part of the problem (certainly not your problem) that some of the people here have is that the air marshals are a government program; the FAA, TSA, and NTSB are government agencies; and that firearms laws and regulations are governmentally imposed; and these people are more anti-government than anything. They put more faith into a 230 year old piece of paper than they do a modern government that is attempting to deal with modern problems. The constitution is a good framework for our government to run by, but it is outdated, and needs to be applied to modern day America. \n \n \nNo-one knows the exact details of the 9/11 hijackings. I think that they must have gained access to the cockpit, as the plane en-route to camp david crash-landed. It is my belief that certain passengers fought with the hijackers, but the pilot was slain and the place forced to crash. In such a situation weapons are academic.\n \n \n No doubt, their efforts were heroic. Who knows why the plane crashed, perhaps the terrorists realizing that they could not win drove it into the ground out of desperation, or perhaps an untrained passenger simply stall / spun the aircraft into the ground after getting to the controls. We really will never know the true story. The point is, that if we had controlled by means of security who was allowed to get on the plane armed, and ensured that the others were not armed, the whole day of 9/11 would have been just another September day. We allowed people to legally carry weapons on board 4 aircraft, and these weapons were used to hijack 4 aircraft. Makes me wonder what would have happened if the terrorists had used several hundred hijackers instead of 19. We could have had 20 aircraft hijacked for every hundred passengers, and judging by the success rate on 9/11, this would have been devastating. Just think what could happen if we allow ordinary citizens on board an aircraft armed with guns like some have suggested. The terrorists could just blend into the crowd again, and board with weapons at the ready to take over a few more planes.",

   "Are YOU serious? While you may be able to hit a paper plate at 100 yards (with a handgun?) the average American gun owner has never had any formal firearms training, has probably not been to a firing range in the last year, and probably could not hit the paper plate consistently at 15 yards. Sad but true. Remember, it is not a requirement to be able to shoot a gun accurately to buy a gun. There are many people who buy guns for self defense, and then put it in their nightstand or car and never fire the gun once. If the law was opened up the way JustAnotherGuy wants, these are the people that will then be allowed to carry guns on board aircraft. This scares me. Police may not be expert marksman, but they do have firearms training, and must qualify with a firearm, showing that they at least have some measure of skill. \n\n \n Shooting is a simple thing. Line up your shot. Squeeze trigger. Repeat. THe reason some people have som much trouble with it is that they are taught incorrectly. WHen you first learn to shoot a pistol , you should put a piece of black electrical tape iver the rear sight, rendering it useless. Then, put your target about 20 yrds away (start with something bigger han an index card, say a man sized target). \n \n \n There are only two things to remember when shooting.\n \n 1. line up your shot\n 2. Take the shot when you feel it is right, the longer you stand there, the less likely you are to hit\n \n I would diagree that the maority of firearms owners don't shoot regularly. While there are certainly some that do not practice, I think the majority of them make it out to shoot at least occasionally. Beyond that, I think that many/most people who buy a gun go out and shoot it at least a few times. This is all it takes in most cases for somebody to be able to handle a handgun for close quarters (inside 50 yrs). With a cop, all you know for sure is that once a year they have managed to hit a big target 6 times in 20 seconds. \n \n \n A handgun is the easiest type of gun to shoot (besides perhapse a shot gun). It feels natural in your hand. Point your arm, pull trigger. Odds are, you just hit your target. IT takes some practice to get really good with one, but I would imagine that about any 10 yr old kid could hit a man sized target at 20 yrds the first time they pick up a gun. When learnig to shoot wiht a distance weapon like a rifle, you have a much harder time, since movement of the barrel of a fraction of a degree can throw your shot off a number of inches, or even feet, at any kind of distance. A handgun is primarily for close quarters as it doesn't require careful aiming (instinctive shooting is just fine in most cases).\n \n Anti-gunners/non-shooters overestimate the amount of skill needed to properly use a handgun.\n \n \n Could you provide any links to back this up? Any data or statistics?[/QUOTE]",

And the rebuilding? And the cost of new security measures? The American consumer is the one who picks up the tab for all this. Prevention is cheaper than mopping up the mess. 9/11 has cost more and will continue to cost the American consumer more money than any other domestic disaster in history. Besides, creating jobs would do more to stimulate the economy and the cost rise would be negligable to the consumer anyway.

He said the sheriff's office has completed its investigation and the charge of involuntary manslaughter will stand.\n \"The kid didn't know any better- he thought the gun was empty,\" Gibson said.\n David Nelson said Raikes was behaving abnormally when he arrived at the Nelson home on the day of the shooting.\n \"John was in a highly agitated state prior to arriving at the house that evening,\" Nelson said. \"He wasn't combative, he wasn't wanting to fight, he was agitated about something else.\"\n Nelson said the family was not aware that Raikes had a shotgun.\n \"We don't own firearms. The issue is not to have guns or not- the issue is to be responsible,\" Nelson said.\n Jared Nelson was a ninth-grader at Moriarty High School. David Nelson said grief counselors were available at the school Tuesday.\n \n\n \n and \n \n \n\n http://www.packing.org/news/article.jsp/9421\n \n Accidental death suit goes to jurors \n \n OAKLAND - Jurors will begin their first full day today discussing whether one of the world's largest gunmakers should pay millions to the parents of a Berkeley teenager accidentally shot to death by a friend. \n \n ...Dix died after his best friend, Michael Soe, shot him in the chest with his father's Model 92 Compact L handgun. Michael, then 14, had replaced a full magazine in the gun with an empty one, but failed to check for a bullet in the chamber. \n \n ...At the heart of the case, San Francisco attorney Elliot Peters said, is that the huge Maryland-based company outfitted its gun with an inadequate chamber-loaded indicator. The indicator was supposed to show the gun's handler when a bullet was in the chamber by displaying a red mark on the right side of the piece. \n \n But it was so ill-conceived, Peters told jurors during closing arguments, that gun owner Clarence Soe never even knew it existed despite having fired the weapon 12,000 times at a shooting range. \n \n ...Lawyers for the Dix family called in experts who testified that a better chamber-loaded indicator could be built for the Beretta. They showed jurors sections from the gun's manual stating there was no need to open the slide at the top of the gun to look for a bullet in the chamber because the indicator would do the job. \n \n \"Beretta knew and recognized this risk and chose to do nothing about it,\" Peters said. \n \n Walnut Creek attorney Craig Livingston, representing Beretta, pointed out that blame for the shooting rested solely with Clarence and Michael Soe. Clarence Soe had an obligation to safely store the weapon, he said, one that he chose not to uphold when he left it in an unlocked camera bag in his bedroom. \n \n He said the father and son, who both testified during the two-week trial, suffered from a \"horrendous lack of judgment,\" which led to the death of Kenzo Dix. \n \n ...It was the second time an Alameda County jury heard the case. The Dix case first went to trial in the fall of 1998, ending in a verdict favoring Beretta after a little more than two days of deliberations. \n \n The decision was later overturned on appeal, though, after some jurors said they felt bullied by a juror who had sided with the gun distributor from nearly the beginning.... \n \n Here is the link for Accidental death suit goes \n \n\n \n You can't argue that accidents don't happen.\n \n \n \n\n So are you saying you do not think an airline passenger being flown into a building will kill you?\n\n \n I'm saying that if I think that I might get out of a situation alive, I'd rather take that than you being a hero and trying to take down 5 armed terrorists and getting everyone killed.",

   "Good :) Were there any hijackings? That seems to be the main thrust of this topic, what happened during a hijacking.\n\n \n NO, there were no hijackings when there were routinely armed citizens on airplanes. When citizens were no longer allowed to carry weapons on airplanes, that is when hijackings started. at the time, his was compared to old west train robberies. When trains were robbed it was highly unusual for the thieves to molest the passengers, since the maority of them were armed. \n \n \n \n \nDo they get input from the police? If the police at least endorse it, if not conduct a class themselves, I would trust that there would be fewer questions later as to the appropriatness.\n\n \n Generally not. The police are nowhere near the experts in law hat you seem to think (thus the pathetically low conviction rate in America). The NRA has always been considered foremost experts in firearms safety and their proper use. This was actually the reason the NRA was started. They only stepped up as a guns rights orginaisation after the anti gunners went on the offensive. In many places (including around here) the NRA teaches the cops the classes on safe firearm handling and appropriate use of force.\n \n \n \n \nAs they should be. Police are trained to know what to do in different situations (theoretically). They should be trusted to have acted appropriately. Anything citizens without that training will do could endanger more lives\n\n \n Since police are trained to this theoretically high level of awareness regarding the use of force, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? TRaditionally if a police officer is found to have use force improperly or has an accidental shooting, they face suspension or even loss of their job. A private citizen guilty of the same thing faces prison. Seems a little lopsided to me, especially when you consider that police are MORE likely than private citizens to commit such an offense (this has been attributed to the kind of folks that become cops).\n \n \n \nHow many hijackings have there been? I wasn't aware of any other buildings being crashed into.\n\n \n Dozens, maybe hundreds. MOst hiackings do not end with buildings being crashed into. During a period from the late sixties to the early eighties hijackings were a real problem. \n \n \n \n \nNo matter how much training you've had, you can miss. If that loss is unnecessary then it's especially bad\n\n \n This is true. Since civilian marksmanship programs commonly hold civilians to a higher standard than law enforcement officers, would't that mean that in all propreity we should be working to ban cops carrying guns on planes as opposed to law abiding citizens?\n \n Did you people all miss that deal a couple years ago about the guy suing the LAPD because according to their entrance tests he was too smart to be a cop? His IQ was only 123. THis is pretty average (when you discount mentally retarded people). How can you put so much faith in a bunch of folks when their departments have procedures in place to ensure that they only hire the dumbest of the mediocre?",

M. Ray Tuesday returned a verdict of accidental death in connection with the shooting at 7:20 p.m. Monday in which W. W. Wootan, 36, opened fire on his mother-in-law, Mrs. Ola Oldham, 50 of Bremond, when he thought she was a prowler in the back yard of the Wootan home at 1212 East Quitman. Mrs. Oldham died almost instantly from a bullet which struck her in the back of the neck which lodged at the base of the brain. Wootan, a fireman for the Southern Pacific, fired two shots when he heard his wife screaming from the direction of the garage, where she had gone to get out the car. \n \n Wootan told Detectives Laird and Brown that Mrs. Oldham and Mrs. Madelyn Ballard of Lafayette, La.---the latter Mrs. Wootan's sister ---had been visiting at the home for several days. \"We were all about to leave for the Trinity Baptist Church on Hogan Street.\" Wootan said \"Our 10 year-old daughter, Mae Lavelle was going with us. \"My wife generally drives the car and she left the house to go to the garage to get the car, and I was to lock up after everybody got out of the house. \"I heard my wife scream near the garage.\" \n \n \"I had my gun in my pocket as I always carry a gun when I go out at night. \"I didn't notice when my mother-in-law left the house, but I saw Mrs. Ballard and my daughter on the back porch. \"I thought I saw a shadow move near the back step and I fired my gun in that direction twice. \"I didn't know just why I was shooting, but I was afraid and shot. \"After the shooting, I rushed out from where I was standing near the back door leading to the porch and I think I stepped over a body on the ground. \n \n \"I met my wife midway between the porch and the garage. \"We went to the back steps and I saw I had shot my mother-in-law. \"I shot her accidentally. We were always on the best of terms and I never intended to injure her in any way. \"Several persons arrived and we took Mrs. Oldham into the house and put her on the bed. \"She appeared to be dead when I got to her. \"My mother-in-law was always kind to my wife and myself and I wouldn't have had this happen for anything on earth.\" \n \n Mrs. Wootan told the officers that she went to the garage with the idea of taking the car out and parking it in the driveway to save time. \"I started to open the garage door,\" Mrs. Wootan said. \"I turned around and saw the shadow of some object. \"At first I thought it was a dog and then decided it might be a man and I screamed several times. \"Then I heard two shots. \"I saw an object fall and I cried: \"Oh, you killed the baby!\" \"When I said that, others in the house started to scream and my husband ran out into the yard and I wrenched a gun out of his hand.\" \n \n \"Then I discovered that it was my mother who was shot. \"Someone picked up my mother and took her into the house and put her on the bed. \"She didn't say anything after she was shot. \"There was never any trouble between my husband and my mother. They always thought a great deal of each other. \"The only reason my husband shot was that he was afraid someone was after me.\" \n \n Carl Ross, Boulevard ambulance driver, was called to the scene but found Mrs. Oldham dead on arrival. \n \n Funeral arrangements for Mrs. Oldham will be announced by the Fogle-West Company. \n \n Mrs. Oldham is survived by her husband, J. F. Oldham of Bremond: three daughters, Mrs. W. W. Wootan of Houston, Mrs. M. C. Smith of Livingston and Mrs. M. P. Ballard of Lafayette, La.; two sons, Bryan Oldham of Houston and Neil Oldham of Bremond; parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Brantner of Bremond; five sisters, Mrs. A. E. Jones , Mrs. J. A. Pryor, Mrs. J. T. Comer and Mrs. R. M. White of Bremond and Mrs. Lena Lee of Houston; four brothers, G. W. Brantner of Friendswood, Lee, Morris and Roy Brantner of Bremond, and two grandchildren. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n This could be said of the airline passengers on 9/11 when the first three airplanes hijacked were flown into buildings.

If the NRA and the police are seeing eye to eye as to what's appropriate, then there's no problem. Do you see what I mean? Then there would be no questions later.\n\n \n As far as I know, the NRA is the largest contract agent whne it comes to acceptable use of force instruction. They actually own another company that actually carries out the classes (b/c the NRA is non-profit, and they charge rather well for these courses). I would assume they see eye to eye, since the NRA is the one telling the police what to think on this one.\n \n \n \nNo, I would think police should know what is appropriate, so they should be given more leeway in regard to what they do.

Obviously excessive use of force should be looked into, but their training should allow them some leeway as to what they are allowed to do.\n\n \n There are strict and specific laws regarding what is an acceptable use of force. The law does not allow for \"personal discretion\" as a defense. YOur use of force is either justified, or it is not. If a cop uses unjustified force, they are breaking the law. THey have become criminals, and should be treated as such. \n \n \n \nHere? In the US? Wow, I did not know that. Wait, and they all ended with the passengers being killed? Somehow I would think I would have heard about that :S\n\n \n All over the world. It was damn near an epidemic. Somebody was generally killed in every one of th hijackings. There were spectacular raids by british special forces (which ended up proving that british special forces should perhapse not try to pull off spectacular raids). This was why the Sky Marshal program was instituted it he first place. Ia m not sure how you could have missed this. Not much of a fan of history (or current events, as the case may be)?\n \n \n \n \nI can't comment on their hiring procedures, since I don't know exactly what they look for in a recruit :P I would also rather have a police officer, since I know that everything he does will have the safety of the passengers in the forefront of his mind. A private citizen just wants to be Rambo and have a shootout. No thank you!\n\n \n Ok, so you don;t know what kind of hiring procedures police departments use, therefore you have no idea where these guys that eventually end up wearing badges come from or what kind of background they might have, yet you are willing to blindly assume that they have the best interests of society at heart and you are absolutly certain that they posess the mental capacity, self control, and skills required to protect you?\n \n HAs it not occured to you that you are atributing an awful lot to a bunch of strangers about whom you apparently know very little? As far as the \"rambo\"\" comment, growing up, my father was the fire chief in he town we lived in. As such, I had occasion to know most of the ranking public officials. I was pulled over and treated badly by a police officer, and I went to the police chief to complain. HE told me (And I am paraphrasing, since I didn't have it transcribed or recorded or anything). \"Ask your dad, he has his XXXXXX to deal with, I have mine. The majority of cops become cops because they want a badge and a gun, they have wet dreams about shooting people, It is all a power trip to them.\" That part is absolutly verbatim and I will never forget it. The next is the paraphrasing part \"THe next biggest group become cops because their father was a cop, and their grandfather was a cop, and they think they are better than regular people because of it. The last group is the smallest, probably less than 10 percent. They are the guys that become cops because they actually want to help people.\" \n \n Now, this was a guy who had been a cop for over 30 years and was the chief of a large police department. I think he matces the definition of expert pretty well. While the second half was paraphrased, I have a good memory, so I know all the prime points were there.\n \n It seems to me that the group most likely to go \"rambo\" on you are the guys who take a low paying, crappy job because they want to carry a gun and tell people what to do.\n \n I have lots and lots of guns. Everything from .22 plinkers to .50 cal sniper rifles. I have assault weapons, rifles, shotguns, pistols. I have never really had the desire to shoot anybody, nor do I forsee wishing to go on a killing spree in the near future. If it comes down to me lying in a puddle of blood in the gutter or a would be attacker lying in a puddle of blood in the gutter, I most certainly intent to ensure that the other guy gets the privelage of becoming a statistic.",

We do know that when guns were allowed on planes no one acted like a hero. :\n \n Meaning- Nobody jumped up and fought with the terrorists prior to guns being banned on aircraft...but then again, we don't even know if there were armed passengers on the aircraft. Terrorists did hijack aircraft depsite the fact that it was possible there were armed citizens aboard the aircraft. If there were armed people on the aircraft, they were cowardly gun toting people who despite the fact that they could have potentially intervened in a terrorist hijacking, they chose to sit in their seat and do nothing. \n \n My response:\n \n Comparing hijackings pre 9/11 and post 9/11 is pointless. Terrorism before 9/11 and after 9/11 have 2 distinctly different meanings. In pre 9/11 hijackings, planes were taken by armed passengers who either legally or illegally took guns on board aircraft, took the aircraft, then demanded to go to a non-extridition country such as Cuba, and held the passengers as hostages in order to achieve some sort of political goal. This happened fairly often...why do you think they banned guns on aircraft in the first place? 9/11 taught us that the new face of terrorism is something much more sinister and deserving of attention. This new breed of terrorist still desires for political change, however is willing to kill thousands of innocent people and themselves in the process. Arming the citizens on board aircraft has proven in the past not only to fail, but make it vastly easier for terrorists to carry lethal weapons on board airplanes and hijack aircraft. Why would we want to make the process any easier on them? \n \n I have little time or patience for people who repeatedly will criticize others for their possible solutions to such problems, but offer none of their own. As you recall, I did ask you if you had a solution, and you stated: \"There is no way to stop it.With each increase in security measures that people like you demand, the terrorist will just change their tactics and go around them. Resulting in tragic events like on 9/11.\" Why don't you just state you real agenda and stop hiding inside you inane argument. IMHO, your philosophy stinks of the anti-government type who supports only his own rights and ignores the negative consequences that they can have on society as a whole. They hide behind the 2nd ammendment of the constitution of a government and people they could care less about, all in the name of their own personal freedoms. The kind of people who will whine and complain about not being able to carry their guns at 30000 feet for no other reason than the government told them that they cannot, and they simply do not want the government to tell them what they may and may not do.",

Before 9/11 when law-abiding Americans were allowed to carry guns on planes how many people died during these hijackings? \n \n \n Actually, I think it was up until the late 1960's that people were allowed to carry guns on aircraft, not 9/10/01. Some people were killed in pre-9/11 hijackings, but again...it was not the same kind of terrorist. And regardless, it is obvious that allowing people to carry guns on aircraft did not stem the tide of hijackings. As you even mentioned yourself, we do not even know if anyone was carrying on any of those flights. As I pointed out, if there was, they certainly did not pull them out to challenge the terrorists. But it must be obvious...even to you, that the terrorists back then knew that people could carry on the flights, and it did not seem to stop them. If it is not going to stop those terrorists, how can anyone assume that it will stop suicidal terrorists who are bent on destruction and killing innocent Americans at any cost? \n \n \nIf you were capable of comprehending the concept of punishment, you would know the answer.

Let me write that down. emoticon_wow You know very little about me to be able to make that kind of statement. You know little of my politics, nor little of my current feelings about the terrorists. I do not see how making a target more secure you are increasing \"political leverage\". What a rediculous term anyway. Terrorists seek the targets the provide the least risk of failure, and the greatest shock value to the American public. Taking a nuclear launch facility inside the US would be a highly valuable score for terrorists, and extremely hard to do. Do you honestly think the terrorists would attempt it? Not a chance. Terrorists seek soft targets where they can easily carry out their plans to kills many innocent civilians. And any \"expert\" that says we cannot prevent terrorist attacks needs to go back and study some more. We may not be able to prevent all of them, but looking back now at all the clues left leading up to 9/11, we see where we might have been able to step in. Of course, pre-9/11 terrorism was something that most Americans thought happened in the ME, Africa, and Northern Ireland.

I am not attacking anyone, I am just pointing out that if there were armed citizens on board, and again, we do not know if there were, they did not use their guns. I am also pointing out that even though the terrorists were aware of the possibility of armed passengers, they still decided to hijack aircraft. It seems as if guns do not deter terrorism. In fact, it seems as if allowing people to carry guns on board aircraft made it easier for the terrorists to hijack them, as the terrorists in many cases just walked right on board with the guns. \n \n \nWhen your treat law-abiding citizens as potential terrorist it is punishing them. You know some what how the Nazis treated all people as suspects by asking for their papers.\n \n \n How is enforcing a gun free zone (ie...aircraft) treating people like terrorists? Remember that flying is a completely voluntary act, you do not have to get on the aircraft. So in other words, if you choose to get on the aircraft, you agree to follow the regulations that govern the operation of the aircraft. If you don't like those regulations, you are free to charter a private aircraft where you may carry as many guns as you wish. You make it seem as if flying on the airlines is something that you are forced to do. People know that when they purchase an airline ticket, they are not allowed to bring any prohibited items aboard the aircraft, ie..guns, knives...etc. Also, people know that they will be subject to search, and possible criminal charges if they attempt to violate the regulations. People buy their tickets voluntarily, get into the security line voluntarily, and get on the aircraft voluntarily. It is their choice to do so, and in such, they agree to play by the rules. \n \n \nSo are you demanded nuclear security at airports? Who is going to pay the bill for this?

I think we have the right idea when it comes to security screening at the airport, although they need to be a little more attentive, and perhaps get a little better scanning and detection equipment. And yes, the airlines should pick up the tab for the increased security measures, based on the number of passengers that particular airline places in the security lines at each airport. I myself am perfectly happy to pay a $3 fee for added security measures every time I fly, since I understand the value of such security. $3 is not going to break the bank, and if this fee were applied to every passenger, it would provide vast amounts of money for the added security measures. It also allows for the funding of the security measures to come from those people who benefit from them, instead of throwing the burden onto the taxpayers. In other words, only those who fly pay for it. And just remember, flying is voluntary, so if you don't like the fee, you can always take the bus.",
