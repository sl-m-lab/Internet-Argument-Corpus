There are plenty of christians who believe in evolution. \n \n What I find interesting about the opening post is Servant O'Christ's concern. One, having seen some unexamined opinion several times is somehow significant. Moreover even if \"Evolution is incompatible with Christianity\", he asserts this somehow affects the legitimacy of the theory of evolution. The latter is compatible with the facts, biblical literalism is not. Don't blame science if it observes nature rationally and finds a conflict with the bible.

   "Evolution and Christianity are not incompatible. The evolution of man (and all other animals), the geological evolution of the earth and the evolution of modern thought are all undeniably evidenced in scientific study. While there have been some hoaxes along the way, there is still ample evidence that the recorded history of the earth as put forth in the bible is flawed.\n \n The metaphors and parables utilized in the bible were intentional tools used to convey the most basic of lessons to people that could not have understood the concept of billions of years but could easily relate to a number of days. God did not make the earth, sun and stars in six days. He did not scoop up dust and mold himself a companion. He did not rip a rib from the man and make a woman. These and other stories were MADE UP to appeal to children and adults, all incapable of understanding or believing the actual truth. However, the lesson was constant...God did it.\n \n The bible contradicts the findings of scientific study. The bible contradicts itself.\n \n One truth that is clearly exposed in the bible is that some 2000 years ago, a phenomenon (an exceptional, unusual or abnormal person, thing or occurrence) took place that shook the world and caused the reference of our calendar to be reset. That is undeniable even by a sensible evolutionist. That occurrence was centered around the one we call Jesus. The FACT that the bible misrepresents the evolution of man in its record of the history of man does not negate the truth of Jesus's coming and going. It is a lack of the ability to have faith in things that cannot be scientifically proved that keeps the extreme evos and atheists at odds with believers.

   "Just to leave my 2 cents, I do think that evolution is incompatible with theisms such as Christianity, because of the doctrinal baggage most versions of Christianity carry. God has to be omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omni this that and the other. \n \n The living world we see is one we should expect if it evolved in the absence of such a deity. Evolution and natural selection have no obvious purpose or design behind them. There is no reason at all to infer a deity of that sort, and plenty of reason to infer a malicious prankster deity if one were being objective and looking at the world as a reflection of the deity's personality.\n \n That isn't to say there aren't philosophical elements of Christianity that are appealing, there are. Its mythology, if taken literally, just doesn't happen to be compatible with reality. If taken purely as mythology, however, and I do not denigrate the heuristic value of mythology, it's ok.",

Neither Evolutionists nor Pro-Evolution Creationists can have it both ways. The bible clearly say's that God spoke all of Creation into existence, AS IT IS ACCORDING TO ITS KIND. If that be true, then there is no way that Man or animals evolved over hundreds of thousands of years, or millions of years from lower life forms, no matter how they define that process.

If all life evolved from an original microbial life form by way of \"random mutation\" then by its very definition it leaves no room for the creative intervention by an intelligent designer. The attempt to blend creationism with evolution is a self deception and I don't care if it's the Pope who is making the compromise. \n \n BTW, let me also say that I agree with every argument smallax has offered here.

   "Literalists certainly have a problem. Evolution is not at all compatible with their beliefs, and they know it. \n \n But what kind of a Christian is it who doesn't have a problem with evolution? Now, OK, it is true there are many Christians who also subscribe to evolutionary theory. What I am wondering is whether they have thought it through. Evolution doesn't need a god. Or at the least, it doesn't need a caring and involved god. In fact, if god is involved in evolution, one has to wonder what sort of inhumane monster he must be!\n \n How do Christians reconcile their benign deity with the grisly facts of evolution? It just doesn't compute. How does a god who permits the suffering and indignity of an evolutionary world come across as benign and caring< You really have to stretch it to get from evolution to CHristianity.\n\n \n Creating a people that have \"free will\" is a messy business, IMO. We don't do, the things we do to each other, because we were created to do so. We rip babies apart in the womb, for example, because we have to free will to make that choice to do so. I certainly do not blame God for the abortion mills across the USA.\n \n God hates the shedding of innocent blood. The problem is not with Him it is with us. Most of us don't even care about what evil happens to others, in fact we just voted for killing babies after they are born. \n God is long suffering and merciful, but He is also just.

They go well beyond what humans call good and evil, however we define those.\n \n How about disease, predation, parasitism? Are they the product of an omnibenevolent god? That thought gave Darwin pause. Pain and suffering through natural causes yet through no fault of one's own? How is that a product of a just god?\n \n There are aspects to real life -- some call them the problem of evil -- that are hard for Christians to explain, so many try to explain them away by creating the notion of \"the Fall\". Everything was perfect before \"the Fall\", and terrible afterwards. But that wasn't the way it was. The lion was never an herbivore. The lamb was never fearless of lions.\n \n Pain, suffering and death have always been an integral part of life, and they always will be.Such benevolence. Such justice!

The OT is the Age of the Law when God proved to us that no matter how detailed He was in clarifying what we must do to be accepted by Him as Righteous. He proved without doubt that we are incapable of living according to His holy standards in this flesh.\n \n The NT is defined as the Age of GRACE when God took flesh upon Himself and became Man so He could live a perfect life as an example for us. And then He sacrificed Himself on the Cross and took upon Himself all of the sins of humanity, so that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. \n \n So you see, Jesus already died for every sin you have committed, or will ever commit. But to receive that forgiveness, you must accept the free gift of salvation which has already been accomplished for you. It is by grace which you have been saved and not by works so that no man may boast. Receive Him and you are saved, reject Him and you must enter heaven based on your own merits and righteousness, and the bible say's that all fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one.

   "One truth that is clearly exposed in the bible is that some 2000 years ago, a phenomenon (an exceptional, unusual or abnormal person, thing or occurrence) took place that shook the world and caused the reference of our calendar to be reset. That is undeniable even by a sensible evolutionist. That occurrence was centered around the one we call Jesus. The FACT that the bible misrepresents the evolution of man in its record of the history of man does not negate the truth of Jesus's coming and going. It is a lack of the ability to have faith in things that cannot be scientifically proved that keeps the extreme evos and atheists at odds with believers. I have no problem believing in Christ and evolution.\n\n What happened 2000 years ago is that astrologers discovered that the entire cosmos shifted out of the taurus ruling and into pisces.

The mythological mithras is often depicted wrestling and defeating a bull, symbolizing the cosmic overthrow of the old ruling age. Look at how the fish plays into christian symbolization. Also, look up the relationship between the mythological mithras and the christian jesus.",

   "That is one of my favorite bits of research. :) \n Have you taken a look at the latest discoveries/ideas about what is happening with the ionosphere lately?\n \n The most interesting thing about the ionosphere is that it seems directly related to the Earth's Magnetic Field. This Field makes it possible for us to produce eletricity. This Field also protects the planet from Solar Radiation by virtue of the Ionosphere.\n \n When we think about the current rate of decay of the EMF and correlate that with a weakening in the ionosphere it makes sense that: 1) We either need a 'polarity reversal' to recharge the 'battery' ASAP or 2) perhaps we need another comsic 'zap' to recharge the EMF, ASAP, or 3) we need to recognize that the EMF seems to have a half-life of 1400 years [just as the data shows] and its continued decay has ill affects on the life of planet earth.\n \n Huge  'Stunted Science'  alert. \n \n Bottom line is: this one bit of evidence of a young earth is critical to the survival of life on this planet. It does not however fit into the Scientific PC that we are trying to propagate.\n So let us bash the guy who brings the subject up and ignore the ramifications of a deteriorating Electro-Magentic Field. Wait a minute... we need a cover story... HMMM\n \n Here is an idea: Let's tell the world that - in due time - The Magnetic Field will 'reverse' and everything will be fine again. \n \n Is it common knowledge among scientists or the general 'educated' public that the recorded half-life of the EMF is about 1400 years? Duh - gee wiz - imagine that.\n \n Guess what? The antiquity of our planet is more than debatable. It is an example of discernment between  Indoctination  and  Education  .\nImagine if all science proceeded from conclusion to investigation.",

   "The point is, where did the sin come from? Did it emerge organically from man's transition into civilization? And if such is the case, how can we be possibly reconciled back into our former state without reverting to a primative culture, like what the amish people have done? Even if we take genesis metaphorically, what are the actual events that the metaphor compares to?\n\n No, you're still missing the point with the 'forgiveness' thing. All forgiveness grants us is passage into heaven - it doesn't change our culture. Admittedly things in heaven would probably be different, but that's another issue altogether.\n \n The sin came as a consequence of free will and satanic influence. Sin is disobeying God. God grants us free will - and at the time of Adam, it comes into being and Satan encourages rule-breaking.\n \n \nChristianity cannot and will not exist without the old testament. It isn't just a prelude and backstory for the appearance of christ, it justifies why christ should exist at all. Let's say we delete the ot, we'd have a guy preaching wisdom and peace, perhaps even performing miracles, but why would anybody care about his death? Every other prophet around his time or before also preached for the nation to repent. And they all died one way or another. So a prophet named jesus comes along... big deal.\n\n I did say 'much' of the OT... chunks of Leviticus and Exodus, for example.\n \n \nNot really.

Things that happen outside us do not affect our free will if they are caused by natural phenomena or acts of God.\nI think I phrased it badly.

Free will prevents God from meddling in human affairs - if someone wants something then God cannot stop them, and equally cannot grant them what they want.\n \n It's one argument, at least.\n \n \nDid I miss something over the past few years?\n Has the data changed from showing decline in the EMF - to showing stablization, of the EMF - or even an increase in the strength of the EMF?\n\n The '100% lie' thin was referring to that specific, quoted claim in your post - that we need the earth's magnetic field in order to create electricity.\n \n Magnetic striping is evidence that the earth's magnetic field has switched in the past.

   "Are you asking if zebras and donkeys would have some similar/same genes? They share a common ancestor, so yes.\n\n \n So let me get this straight. You're saying that if we share similar genes then we must share a common ancestor? If that's the case, then you're saying that according to evolution we share a common ancestry with mice and basically every other form of life on Earth since we share genetic similarities with all of them, right. Of course that is the basic premise upon which evo is built. Yet only humans have attained higher function where as all animals below us have remained simple in their ability to reason or create. The question is why? \n \n Why haven't any other animals created higher brain functions even though many have developed opposable thumbs which scientists have attributed to one main reason for Mans great leap forward? Many tree climbing animals have similar traits yet they have never evolved the ability to expand their horizons and accomplish complex reasoning abilities. Even though evolutionists admit that they have existed much longer than bipeds/primates. More time to evolve, yet they remain simple to our complex growth. Another unexplainable inconsistency I suppose.\n The Handiest Mammal \n Besides being genetically similar to humans, mice are small and inexpensive to maintain. Their short life span and rapid reproductive rate make it possible to study disease processes in many individuals throughout their life cycle.The Mouse in Science: Why Mice?\n \n Also, if mice are our human ancestors, does it seem ethical or morally right to you that we are exploiting them in such inhumane ways? Does that seem right to you if they are truly genetic equals to us? I will close with this quote from the link below.\n Evolution provides No answers\n \n Even Francis Crick, one of the agnostic men who discovered the genetic code said near the end of his life, \"an honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going\" (Life Itself, 1981, p. 88, emphasis added). Even with all the scientists around the world working feverishly, not one has even been able to produce a single human hair, let alone a being of infinitely more complexity as a human is with over 100 trillion cells.\n \n Another problem with evolution is \"Where does the new information in the code come from to create a new organism?\" Darwinian scientists try to counter these arguments by saying things like the genetic code already had all the information contained within it and that those codes were merely activated by the various forces such as cosmic rays for example that cause new organisms to form. That is merely a trigger, but again, where or how did the information get there in the first place and who or what created this language to begin with?\n \n Darwinian evolution is still taught in schools as though it was fact, but more and more scientists are beginning to question it. Scientist and former atheist Patrick Glynn said, \"As recently as 25 years ago a reasonable person weighting the purely scientific evidence on the issue would likely have come down on the side of skepticism in regards to a creator. That is no longer the case. Today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the God Hypothesis. It is the simplest and most obvious solution...\" (God: The Evidence, 1997 pp.54-55, 53)\n \n Evolution tells us that through chance mutations and natural selection, living things evolve. Yet to evolve means to gradually change certain aspects of some living thing until it becomes another type of creature, and this can only be done by adding genetic information into the DNA itself. According to molecular biologist Michael Denton, \"Each cell with genetic information, from bacteria to man, consists of artificial languages and their decoding systems, memory banks for information storage and retrieval, elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of parts and components, error fail-safe and proof-reading devices utilized for quality control, assembly processes involving the principle of prefabrication and modular construction... [and a] capacity not equaled in any of our most advanced machines, for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours\" (Denton, p. 329).\n \n How can all of the information required to create bacteria evolve into information from another type of being when all it takes to destroy the bacteria is one of a few mistakes in the millions of letters that make up the bacteria's DNA? Evolutionary scientists are as usual very silent on the subject; they don't have even a working theory of how this could possibly be. It actually takes far more faith to believe in evolution, then it does to believe in a supreme creative power and intellect in the universe. Lee Strobel writes: \"The six feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made... No hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means\" (Strobel, p. 282).\n \n Werner Gitt, professor of information systems, said this: \"The basic flaw of all evolutionary views is the origin of the information in living beings. It has never been shown that a coding system and semantic information could originate by itself [through matter]... The information theorems predict that this will never be possible. A purely material origin of life is thus [ruled out]\" (Gitt, p. 124).\n \n Even with all the evidence covered so far about intelligent design of DNA, consider this. For DNA to be truly effective, it turns out that the perfect number of letters in the code has been calculated to be four letter, no more, no less. This is the number of letters that is mathematically calculated to be the most effective for DNA to function as it does. Turns out this is precisely what we find in the genes of all living creatures on planet Earth, four letters in their DNA code. Once again, Werner Gitt states: \"The coding system used for living beings is optimal from an engineering standpoint. This fact strengthens the argument that it was a case of purposeful design rather than a [lucky] chance\" (Gitt, p. 95).DNA: Toppling the Evolutionary 'Tree of Life'",

The human brain consists of about ten thousand million nerve cells. Each nerve cell puts out between ten thousand and one hundred thousand connecting fibers by which it makes contact with other nerve cells in the brain. Altogether the total number of connections in the human brain approaches 1015 or a thousand million million. Numbers in the order of 1015 are of course completely beyond comprehension. Imagine an area about half the size of the USA (one million square miles) covered in a forest of trees containing ten thousand trees per square mile. If each tree contained one hundred thousand leaves the total number of leaves in the forest would be 1015, equivalent to the number of connections in the human brain! Despite the enormity of the number of connections, the ramifying forest of fibers is not a chaotic random tangle but a highly organized network in which a high proportion of the fibers are unique adaptive communication channels following their own specially ordained pathway through the brain. Even if only one hundredth of the connections in the brain were specifically organized, this would still represent a system containing a much greater number of specific connections than in the entire communications network on Earth.(4)\n \n George Wald, leading evolutionist, wrote:\n \n Organic molecules, therefore form a large and formidable array, endless in variety and of the most bewildering complexity.

Structure here is as important as composition - and what a complication of structural. The most complex machine man has devised - say an electronic brain - is child's play compared with the simplest of living organisms. The especially trying thing is that complexity here involves such small dimensions.

This about 3 million years ago.\n Homo habilis had a cranial capacity of 590-650cm cubed about 2 million years ago.\n\n \n I marvel how you guys can ignore posted evidence and just plow through with your religions claims as if they make perfectly logical sense. Let me give you the opposing view of what these partial fossil finds represent in reality Ripskar. At some point in the past a smallish type primate with a cranial capacity of approximately (380-430 cm existed and for whatever reason, it went extinct. When some paleontologist found these bones they declared her the missing link and named her Lucy. \n \n At some other time, either before or after Lucy was found, another partial fossil was discoveredHomo habilis which had a cranial capacity of 590-650cm. Obviously because evolutionists must explain how man developed a larger brain over time, they assumed that Lucy was the ancestor of this other extinct Ape, Homo habilis. Now prove these extinct apes had anything more in common than having lived on the same planet at one time or another. You can't in any way prove they are related because evo has created a law which equates the genetic similarities all life forms share as evidence that we all come from a common ancestor rather than having been created by an intelligent God from the same genetic material. But there is absolutely no evidence that one of these animals evolved from the other. Nor is there any direct evidence that Man evolved from them. \n \n It's nothing more than finding fossils and arranging them together like a child would force the pieces of two puzzles to fit together as one. There are huge gaps, but if he sticks with it long enough, he can make some semblance of a picture appear even though it doesn't resemble the intended original picture at all, or in any way.\n \n \nThat is the point at which brain capacity expands.\n Evolution occurs via the stimulus of the ecosystem setting demands on the population which responds by favouring certain characteristics.\n At the time the human brain was developing Africa was drying out and becoming more arid with rainforests retreating and being replaced by savannah.\n Tree climbing animals are not particularly well suited to life without trees thus most of the arboreal species retreated with the forest, or to put it more bluntly, got eaten by grassland predators. To survive you had to adaptable, in our case it seems our ancestors had to be quick-witted and capable of learning from experience. Hence a larger brain would have been a decided asset in stressful environments.\n\n \n Answer me this regarding the bolded Ripskar, we know that the evolutionary process required to adapt from tree dwellers to flatlanders took a long time. They had to learn to walk upright, grow these larger brains, adapt respiratory systems that allowed for moving fast on land, and sweat glands in order to prevent overheating, which means they should have lost their fur at that stage of evolution.\n \n Have we found any remains of hairless apes lately Ripskar? And don't the imaginary mock ups of Lucy and Homo habilis have fur also? Even Cro-magnon man has fur even though he is an allegedly close ancestor to us, timewise. But the pertinent question I have is this; how did these early ancestors which had to adapt from tree dwellers to land dwellers survive long enough to make the evolutionary jump when for the first million years or so they had evolved NONE of the tools or characteristics needed to survive the conditions they were allegedly forced into? \n \n On a more basic level, here's how George Wald, leading evolutionist, wrote to explain your dilemma:\n \n Organic molecules, therefore form a large and formidable array, endless in variety and of the most bewildering complexity.

From Richard Carrier\n \n \n Ilya Prigogine\n \n Schroeder cites Ilya Prigogine as stating in Physics Today (in \"Thermodynamics of Evolution,\" a two-part article spanning November and December of 1972) that \"the idea of the spontaneous genesis of life in its present form is therefore improbable, even on the scale of billions of years.\" This is inherently suspicious, since Prigogine is famous for proving that order results from increasing entropy in dissipative systems, rendering spontaneous complexity more probable than ever before. So what is the context of this quote? As it happens, it appears in the introduction to that famous research article demonstrating that dissipative systems explain pre-biological evolution and in fact almost all order, even functional order, in organic systems, as a \"purely deterministic\" consequence of the laws of physics (ibid. Dec. p. 44). In other words, Schroeder is quoting a contrafactual and pretending it is a conclusion: the authors (Ilya is only the lead author of three, the others being Gregoire Nicolis and Agnes Babloyantz) first set out the challenging problem (the fact that the present theory does not account for biogenesis), which Schroeder quotes, then present the solution, which is mathematically and experimentally proven (and not only accounts for biogenesis, but also explains many other previously unexplained features of living organisms).\n \n Schroeder is thus guilty of deception, like those who quote Carl Sagan out of context (as I have discussed above). Ilya Prigogine and his colleagues actually prove, in that very article, that \"the spontaneous genesis of life in its present form\" is probable, not improbable. Indeed, their work demonstrates that given any \"fluctuations\" sufficiently far away from thermal equilibrium in a soup of polynucleotides (and perhaps also polypeptides), the development of complex reproducing systems is guaranteed, as a result of naturally-occurring \"autocatalytic cycles\" (ibid. Dec. p. 38), in just the same way that organized convection cycles arise naturally when water is heated (a state which is also very far from equilibrium). In a nutshell, the article comes to the exact opposite conclusion as Schroeder leads us to believe. So either Schroeder is trying to pull a fast one, or he did not read the article.\n ",

If there is no backup we may or may not notice a problem in the organism and the organism may actually die. [Basic science right? Or are we already in disagreement?]\n \n Anyways, Certain variations were popular as they became more peculiar in their coloration and ability. So the interbreeding of 1st cousins which looked more like cheetahs and could run fast, became a subset of the original gene pool. As generations pass, soon there is no more connection to their great grand uncle and aunts, so the are now a new sub-species with less genetic coding than the first 2 cats. \n \n The same is true of the Leopard. Narrower genetic code than the parents and 'different' genetic code than the mountain lion and the cheetah. \n \n So rather than *re-engineering* the cats - we would be *restoring* enough of what was lost to expand the gene pool, b4 mutations eventually kill them all off.",

   "Since someone else is dealing with the Francais Cricket quote, I will deal with the Ilya Prigogine quote. From Richard Carrier\n \n \n Ilya Prigogine\n \n Schroeder cites Ilya Prigogine as stating in Physics Today (in \"Thermodynamics of Evolution,\" a two-part article spanning November and December of 1972) that \"the idea of the spontaneous genesis of life in its present form is therefore improbable, even on the scale of billions of years.\" This is inherently suspicious, since Prigogine is famous for proving that order results from increasing entropy in dissipative systems, rendering spontaneous complexity more probable than ever before. So what is the context of this quote? As it happens, it appears in the introduction to that famous research article demonstrating that dissipative systems explain pre-biological evolution and in fact almost all order, even functional order, in organic systems, as a \"purely deterministic\" consequence of the laws of physics (ibid. Dec. p. 44). In other words, Schroeder is quoting a contrafactual and pretending it is a conclusion: the authors (Ilya is only the lead author of three, the others being Gregoire Nicolis and Agnes Babloyantz) first set out the challenging problem (the fact that the present theory does not account for biogenesis), which Schroeder quotes, then present the solution, which is mathematically and experimentally proven (and not only accounts for biogenesis, but also explains many other previously unexplained features of living organisms).\n \n Schroeder is thus guilty of deception, like those who quote Carl Sagan out of context (as I have discussed above). Ilya Prigogine and his colleagues actually prove, in that very article, that \"the spontaneous genesis of life in its present form\" is probable, not improbable. Indeed, their work demonstrates that given any \"fluctuations\" sufficiently far away from thermal equilibrium in a soup of polynucleotides (and perhaps also polypeptides), the development of complex reproducing systems is guaranteed, as a result of naturally-occurring \"autocatalytic cycles\" (ibid. Dec. p. 38), in just the same way that organized convection cycles arise naturally when water is heated (a state which is also very far from equilibrium). In a nutshell, the article comes to the exact opposite conclusion as Schroeder leads us to believe. So either Schroeder is trying to pull a fast one, or he did not read the article.\n \n\n \n Got a link for this post? Or is this another TO or secular apologist site like internet infidels which is designed to rebut all opposing critiques which claim to explain Prigogine without actually quoting him?",

   "Answer me this regarding the bolded Ripskar, we know that the evolutionary process required to adapt from tree dwellers to flatlanders took a long time. They had to learn to walk upright, grow these larger brains, adapt respiratory systems that allowed for moving fast on land, and sweat glands in order to prevent overheating, which means they should have lost their fur at that stage of evolution.\n \n Have we found any remains of hairless apes lately Ripskar? And don't the imaginary mock ups of Lucy and Homo habilis have fur also? Even Cro-magnon man has fur even though he is an allegedly close ancestor to us, timewise. But the pertinent question I have is this; how did these early ancestors which had to adapt from tree dwellers to land dwellers survive long enough to make the evolutionary jump when for the first million years or so they had evolved NONE of the tools or characteristics needed to survive the conditions they were allegedly forced into? \n \n And how about responding to my query regarding the odds of evolution happening by legitimate scientists rather than going around it?\n\n Hair being a soft material doesn't preserve well thus you can't point to many fossils that show any evidence of being hairy.\n Cro-Magnon man isn't \"Closely related to us\" CM is us; Homo sapiens Of course you would have to actually read the species name to spot that and you obviously haven't read that far.\n \n The odds against there being a deity are infinity to one against, so any number you pull out of your rear end regarding established theories isn't worth the time to read.\n \n As for rest of your \"question\" The principle tool is the tooth which remained hard well into our species development.

   "I swear, I'm going to start hunting people down and tatooing this on their foreheads in reverse so they can read it in the mirror:\n \"Evolution does not address origins\"\n \n It doesn't matter how life began-panspermia, god, the FSM, unicorn #### sprinkled with pixie dust, evolution deals with changes after life began.\n\n \n \nT.Q. Adresses this as well, but I feel I need to say it just to be extra clear.\n \n Evolution has NOTHING to do with origins.\n \n The fact you equate the primordial soup and new species through mutations shows that dawkins has indeed a great many things to teach oyou.\n\n \n But isn't this narrow view really playing a game of semantics, in reality? I mean, ever since the so called very first single celled organism allegedly spontaneously appeared from that primordial ooze, The process of evolution started, according to every evolutionist out there. So although evolutionists technically don't deal with the origin of life itself, they deal with what allegedly occurred from the very moment they assume life started. Beside that, they have another process called abiogenesis, which they support, defend and endorse as the process by which life started. \n \n So evolutionists have departmentalized these processes with different scientific terms, but everyone knows that one process is just an extension of the other in fact. So when the opposition overlap these processes in the course of a debate, it seems both disingenuous and somewhat anal to then jump on them as you sanctimoniously accuse them of not knowing that evolution isn't dealing with origins. We know that very well; but we also know that evo and abiogenesis are linked processes according to evolution theory, so it is natural to combine them when discussing early evolutionary theory.\n \n Here is how one source describes the difference between the two processes.\n Evolution and Abiogenesis\n v2.0 \u00a92006 Laurence A. Moran\n \n When we use the term \"biological evolution\" we have to have a consensus opinion on what this actually means. Is it some warm fuzzy notion about how change affects anything that has to do with life? If this is what we mean by biological evolution then it will probably include all of those changes that took place before free-living organisms arose. On the other hand, if we stick to a more scientific definition of evolution some biological changes won't be included. The question is whether the origin of life, or abiogenesis, is part of evolution or something separate.\n \n I think there's a scientific definition of biological evolution that has proved to be very useful in biology. It requires (by definition) populations of living organisms. Anything that preceded the formation of such populations is obviously relevant but it ain't biological evolution. Now, we could change the definition of biological evolution to include the formation of the first molecules that gave rise to living things but this would create more problems that it solves. We would still need a term for the evolution of populations by changes in the frequencies of their alleles.\n There's also a political consideration. Many people don't believe in biological evolution. I'd like to convince them that evolution, the process, is a fact. It's also a solid scientific fact that modern organisms evolved from a common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. These facts encompasses what I believe to be the core concepts of biological evolution. We have a chance to educate the public on this point. If people want to believe that the first living organism was created by God then I can live with that for the time being. First things first. Let's work on the evidence for biological evolution and not burden ourselves by linking it, incorrectly in my opinion, with the creation of life. That strategy is doomed from the beginning.\n \n I would say there's a form of \"evolution\" called chemical evolution. This contributed to the formation of the first living cells. There might well have been a form of selection among replicating molecules and there might well have been chance events that led accidentally to the enrichment of some other molecules. These two processes resemble natural selection and drift in the same way that those processes are echoed in genetic algorithms. However, it is useful to have a better working definition of natural selection (and drift) that applies to modern species. This definition requires populations of living organisms in order to have any usefulness. It isn't helpful to extend the definition of \"natural selection\" to the level of replicating molecules. If we do that we'll need a new term to represent the kind of mechanism that explains the evolution of the peppered moth and Galapagos finches. That new term will exclude selection of replicating molecules. The real question is whether the selection of replicating molecules and biological natural selection are the same phenomena. I don't think they are - this doesn't deny that there are similarities ... of course there are similarities.\n I would say that abiogenesis is not the same as biological evolution and it certainly isn't the same as \"Darwinian evolution\". I would argue that the origin of life was a spontaneous process that did not require anything out of the ordinary and certainly didn't require a supernatural being. However, I would also argue that biological evolution only began with the formation of the first population of living cells.\n Some scientists have argued that it's silly to exclude the origin of life from our definition of evolution. One of them suggested an analogy between the study of geology and the origin of the Earth. He claimed that the origin of the Earth is part of what geologists study. Therefore, according to him it would be silly to separate out geology and the origin of the Earth. I agree.\n The origin of life is part of biology. However, it isn't necessarily part of biological evolution. A better analogy might be plate tectonics and Earth's origin. Lots of geologists study plate tectonics. The movement of plates helps us understand much of Earth's history. It's obvious that the geological activity of our planet originated when it formed 4.5 billion years ago. However, the actual condensation of Earth from stellar gasses is not plate tectonics. The geological processes of rift formation, subduction, plate movement, hot spots, etc. didn't begin until the Earth had cooled sufficiently to present a solid surface. I see biological evolution as similar to plate tectonics in geology. There's a connection with origins but they aren't the same thing.Evolution and Abiogenesis\n \n So, according to this pro-evolution source, one reason for separating the two processes is to avoid debating conflicts. And even within the evolution community there are scientists who don't make the distinction between abiogenesis and evolution. I say this not to insist that they are 2 parts of the same process, because both are false in my opinion; I point this out just to show that even within the pro-evolution community there isn't really a universal consensus regarding the separation of the two processes.",

Altogether the total number of connections in the human brain approaches 1015 or a thousand million million. Numbers in the order of 1015 are of course completely beyond comprehension. Imagine an area about half the size of the USA (one million square miles) covered in a forest of trees containing ten thousand trees per square mile. If each tree contained one hundred thousand leaves the total number of leaves in the forest would be 1015, equivalent to the number of connections in the human brain! Despite the enormity of the number of connections, the ramifying forest of fibers is not a chaotic random tangle but a highly organized network in which a high proportion of the fibers are unique adaptive communication channels following their own specially ordained pathway through the brain. Even if only one hundredth of the connections in the brain were specifically organized, this would still represent a system containing a much greater number of specific connections than in the entire communications network on Earth.",

Also four fours in a row, fancy that.\n \n Would you like to address the real issue now?\n \n EDIT: Archie posted again.\n \n I don't mean to be rude (well, maybe a little), but this is massively ignorant.\n The chance of getting a 6 once in a row is 1 in 6\n The chance of getting a 6 twice in a row is 1 in 6^2 = 36\n The chance of getting a 6 five time in a row is 1 in 6^5 = a mere 7776\n The chance of getting any number five times in a row is 1 in 7776/6 = 1296.\n \n If I roll five dice 500 times, the chance of me getting any number 5 times in a row is 1 - ((1 - 1/1296)^500) = roughly 1/3\n \n I think this nicely illustrates the high possibility of something happening which Archie considers 'astronomical, if not an absolute impossibility'. If I did it the was abiogenesis did it - which (analogously) would be to save any two dice that were sixes in a row and only roll the rest - then it would have taken me even less time.\n\n \n Don't play your cheap games with me iangb. Take one dice and roll it 5 time and tell me how many time a 6 comes up. Now, figure the odds of throwing one dice and coming up with five sixes in a row. You said this: I just rolled a 6 five times in a row. Is this evidence of God's work in my life? The only way to interpret that is that you did it with one dice. So now you bring 16 dice into it? Try, just try to be honest here iangb, because based on this new scenario, who needs God's help? So once again, your point is moot.",

Answer - around 1 chance in 1.126 x 10^15 (if attempted only once). You might describe this as astronomically small.

What would be the chance that heads came up 50 times in a row for at least one of those people?\n \n Or what are the chances that heads came up 50 times in a row two, or even three times?\n \n This example is similar to your old argument about the probablility of a protein forming. Yes, the likelyhood of it happening is very very very small if only one attempt is made, but very very unlikely not to happen if given many billions of opportunities to happen.\n \n So, let go of your old feeble arguments about mathematical probabilities and learn something for once.\n \n Smiley",

Now, in D&D, typically a 20 is the best roll you can get (called a natural 20, when you get it you can roll again to get a \"critical hit\"), and a 1 is the lowest and is an automatic failure of whatever action you attempted to perform.\n \n With that explanation, I once was fighting with another dude in a strength contest (dealing nonlethal damage, not trying to kill each other but to knock each otehr out).

   "the blatant lie he told in order to mock God.\n\n Firstly, it was not a blatant lie. I really had just rolled five sixes - just not on the same dice, but on five dice simultaniously. The fact that you misunderstood what I had said is indeed partly my fault, but you are just as to blame by refusing to back down once I made my explanation.\n \n Secondly, the purpose was not 'to mock God'. The purpose was to inform you about the mathematics of probability; an exercise which woefully failed because you refused to look at the actual content of the post and instead insisted on looking for holes that you could infer from the wording. If anything Godly was being mocked, it was your assumption that God controls events that He has no need to - they are perfectly capable of controlling themselves.\n \n Thirdly, what you say I 'claimed' is not at all what I did claim, even if you look with a persnickety eye. I only said 'I rolled five sixes in a row' - that doesn't imply that I rolled one dice five times and then another five times if the first 'set' was not what I wanted. If I roll 14566666231, then that is still five sixes in a row - and I only need roll a dice 500 times in order to get a 1/3 chance of this happening.\n \n Fourthly, another example to add to my several from above and shadowpikachu's. Winning the lottery is hugely unlikely - but people do it almost every week. Does God choose the numbers for them?\n \n Fifthly, you have yet to admit your massive error regarding probability - either of my claim as I worded it, or as you implied it in your recent posts.\n \n Finally, you also have yet to 'drop it and move on'.

I got one in a short tube (you can get from any gaming store) which has one of each of those dice you just listed, not multiple.

As a so called believer, if you knew God and believed His word, you would have no doubts at all regarding the existence of your soul which clearly is our essence once we shed this flesh as is clarified in Psa 16:10 For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption. My question is, how can a true christian who possesses the Holy Spirit of God within him, not be aware of this aspect of their person? The answer is, they can't be unaware of it. \n \n \nYes, but just look at the way Archie always describes me: I'm a mere \"pseudo-Christian\" or \"alleged Christian.\" He can claim that evolution is atheism in part because, as he understands it, no one who accepts evolution is really a Christian. I think that's an entirely incorrect view of the matter, of course. But the self-serving psychology of it all is quite transparent.\n\n \n You are a cultural christian, but you have no first hand relationship with the living God through Christ which the bible requires as the source of being one with Him. Being personally aware of His presence in your life, is evidence of knowing Him. Knowing beyond human or physical evidence that He is real, true and that He is God in you. You have no such first hand knowledge of these realities or else you wouldn't have written this post to say what it say's. \n \n You would be proclaiming that God is alive and well and resides within your very soul even though you can't prove it in physical terms. That is what this post would say if you were truly saved, or born again as Jesus said we must surely be in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. He never said we must be perfect as He is, just believe and live according to His perfect example. \n \n If you truly exemplified that belief, you would be defending Him rather than saying Whether we actually have souls in the first place-- in any meaningfully different sense from, say, minds or consciousness -- is an open question. No Matthew, you would know it because your God told you it is so. And you would feel that connection to Him on a soul level. But you can't get past your human intellect because that is all that guides you. \n \n Lev 17:11 For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it [is] the blood [that] makes atonement for the soul.'\n \n Deu 4:29 But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find [Him] if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.\n \n Deu 6:5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.\n \n Psa 16:10 For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.\n \n Psa 19:7 The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple;\n \n Psa 23:3 He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake.\n \n Pro 6:32 Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; He [who] does so destroys his own soul.\n \n Pro 8:36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; All those who hate me love death.\"\n Here are all of the references to our soul in the bible if your interested in reading some more of them.\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Search Results for NKJV",

   "An open question you say?

My question is, how can a true christian who possesses the Holy Spirit of God within him, not be aware of this aspect of their person? The answer is, they can't be unaware of it. \n\n \n Tester has it right. I didn't mean that it's an \"open question\" in the sense that I don't believe in the soul. I meant that it's an open question in the sense that I don't believe it's demonstrable through logical argument or external evidence. To the contrary, it's a matter of personal experience.\n \n And it's not an experience that one can communicate to others. It's not like the color of a flower or the flight speed of a bird. You can't just confer with others or settle disagreements about its nature by pointing and looking. Which is why, ultimately, I think that it's a matter of faith. If someone doesn't believe he has a soul, there's precious little I could do to convince him otherwise. You take the leap, or you don't.\n \n Please note that I also included the qualification of a meaningful difference between soul and mind or between soul and consciousness. If one does not take the leap of faith, one may yet be able to provide naturalistic explanations for mind and consciousness. The burden is then on those of us who use the term \"soul\" to describe the term adequately and to differentiate it from the naturalistic ideas it resembles. Honestly, I'm not sure we live up to that burden very well.\n \n (I should add that it is very much an open question whether souls (or minds or consciousness, for that matter) are things at all. They might be better understood as relations between things or properties of things, rather than as entities that can exist independently in their own right. Perhaps the mind is just a relationship between certain parts or aspects of the body, but the soul itself is simply the mind considered in its relation to God. Interesting ideas, I think.\n \n Incidentally, the same issue (what is a \"thing?\") sometimes crops up in theological discussions of God: It is not at all clear that God should be understood as an entity. But I digress.)\n \n So summing up, my point was twofold: (1)Belief in the soul is a matter of faith, and its existence cannot be proved. And (2) what the soul is, is very much debatable, even among people who believe they have one. It does not follow from either of these points that I do not believe I have a soul.\n \n So I think you have completely misunderstood me.\n \n \nYou are a cultural christian, but you have no first hand relationship with the living God through Christ....\n\n \n How do you know? Seriously?\n \n I won't claim to know diddly-squat about your relationship with our Lord and Savior. By what right do you claim to know anything about mine?\n \n I mean, for pity's sake: You misunderstood what I was getting at -- and on the basis of that error you have the audacity to make declarations such as this? And then you wonder why other posters characterize you as rude, arrogant, self-righteous?\n \n The other day, you complained with much indignation that another poster had no idea what was going on in your head. Given what you have said about me above, do you not see how you could be construed as even just a little bit hypocritical?\n \n Bottom line: You don't know anything at all about my relationship with my God. I would very much appreciate it if you would either acknowledge this limitation, or explain how you've transcended it.\n \n \nBeing personally aware of His presence in your life, is evidence of knowing Him. Knowing beyond human or physical evidence that He is real, true and that He is God in you. You have no such first hand knowledge of these realities or else you wouldn't have written this post to say what it say's.\n\n \n As I showed above, you didn't understand what I had written in that post.\n \n Moreover, just because I believe that God is present in my life, based on deeply personal experience, this does not mean that I consider this experience to be communicable with others. Nor does it mean that I consider that experience to be knowledge, because I think that all knowledge is communicable.\n \n \nYou would be proclaiming that God is alive and well and resides within your very soul even though you can't prove it in physical terms.\n\n \n The second half (\"even though...\") is part of what I was getting at in my post. If that was unclear, I apologize. But I also think that when confronted with unclarity, you should not jump to conclusions about what I meant. All you had to do was ask!\n \n \nThat is what this post would say if you were truly saved, or born again ....\n\n \n No, that is what the post would have said if you had written it. But as it happens, the post was written by me.\n \n I have my own experience of the presence of God, and I have my own understanding of that experience. Perhaps in some ways, it's similar to yours, perhaps in other ways it's different. But what I will not do is narcissistically presume that, if you understand the experience of God's presence differently than I do, you don't really have such an experience at all. Nor will I narcissistically declare that you have no relationship with God or Christ unless you describe it the way I would describe mine.\n \n Because God transcends my experience and understanding of Him.\n \n \nIf you truly exemplified that belief, you would be defending Him ...\n\n \n If you truly exemplified an understanding of my post, you would have realized that I wasn't attacking him.\n \n But I should add that I also doubt that God really needs \"defending,\" from me, from anyone. (Truth be known, I always find it a bit odd when people act as if, without their intercession, God's intentions will be frustrated.)\n \n \n...you would feel that connection to Him on a soul level.\n\n \n And I'm sorry to have to keep pointing this out to you, Archie, but you simply don't know what I feel! Not about anything, and especially not about my connection to God.\n \n \nBut you can't get past your human intellect because that is all that guides you.\n\n \n It's true. I am only human. My intellect is limited, as is my ability to understand my experience of the presence of God in my life.\n \n And like it or not, the same applies to you. Your experience of God is not privileged, and you don't have any access whatsoever to the experiences of others.\n \n If you choose to reply to this post, I would like you not to dodge this issue again, as you have several times before. Indeed, I would like you to focus on it first and foremost. Namely: By what right do you claim to know anything about anyone else's relationship to God?",

You need to stop reading things into me that I do not say.\n \n In the second and more important place, I \"would\" not \"insist on or defend its existence.\" I think believing in the soul requires a leap of faith. If someone else doubts its existence, then there's not much that I can do. There is no evidence save that of incommunicable personal experience, and no logical argument can be a substitute. Only the leap will get him there.\n \n But I can't force him to make it. Nor will I berate him for not making it. Nor will will I require him to behave as if has made it. All of these strike me as unreasonable responses to a lack of personal experience.\n \n \nWhy do you see my clearly pointing out the inconsistency in Matthews very contradictory post as a personal attack?\n\n \n As I said, nothing inconsistent or contradictory about the post. But had you pointed out inconsistency or contradiction, that would not be a personal attack. And I would not have taken it as one.\n \n The personal attack comes in the \"you've got no relationship with God\" stuff.

Which is to say, you go after me, not just my message.\n \n I realize that this sort of ad hominem tactic has become increasingly prevalent in public discourse in recent years. For all that prevalence, it is still illegitimate.\n \n \nNo true christian denies the soul because we know we are reflections of God who created us in His image. And just as God is a triune being being 3 parts that make up the one God, Spirit (Holy Spirit) Soul (God the Father) and flesh (Jesus Christ) So are we a trinity within ourselves. A body, soul and spirit.\n\n \n Archie, I don't deny that this is a Christian understanding of psychology and being made in God's image. It is an ancient and well-respected one (with pre-Christian and non-Jewish roots in Plato, incidentally). But it is far from the only one. There are many forms of Christian psychology, some of which do not make a distinction between soul and spirit. And there are also many ways that Christians have understood the notion of \"created in His image,\" some of which emphasize our freedom of will, for example.\n \n To declare that one of these theories is correct is one thing. To declare that all others aren't even Christian is simply preposterous.\n \n \nSo by denying the soul...\n\n \n Which I didn't, at all.\n \n \n...or questioning it's existence...\n\n \n Which I didn't, although I left it unprovable.\n \n I did question what the soul is. I'm not at all convinced that we know, despite our frequent use of the term.\n \n \n...he is once again ignoring a most basic concept of our creation in Gods image. No true believer who actually has a personal relationship with the living God is so shallow as to take that position, simply because we know better.\n\n \n Two possible modes of interpreting my post, and a recommendation.\n \n I. If one says x, one can't be a Christian. But Matthew has said x. Alas, Matthew is no true believer.\n \n II. If one says x, one can't be a Christian. But Matthew is a Christian. Thus, despite what I initially thought, Matthew can't really have said x.\n \n The next time you find me saying x, where x is some idea that strikes you as an affront to God, try strategy II. If you had used it in this case, it might have spared you from a misinterpretation.\n \n \nObviously Matthew doesn't know better because he is relying on his human intellect and not the Holy Spirit which guides believers in spiritual understanding.\n\n \n The only thing that's \"obvious\" to me is that you didn't understand my post.\n \n \nI hope this clarifies ... my motivation for pointing out Matthews spiritual problem.\n\n \n But here's the thing. Motivation aside, I don't think you have any basis for thinking I have any such problem. Because at the end of the day, you can't see into my soul.\n \n You have no idea what my experience of God is like. You have no idea what my walk with Christ means to me. You have no idea how the Holy Spirit touches me. But you declare, on the basis of external signs -- more accurately, on the basis of external signs that you misinterpret -- that I have no such experience, no such walk, no such gift.\n \n God knows my soul. You don't. End of story.\n \n So if you don't like my ideas about the soul, attack those all you like. Just quit attacking me.",

   "You know, I always understood the trinity to be an explanation of God!\n I never knew that it could be used to describe us!!\n\n \n Actually, it's about God.\n \n Different Christian thinkers make different claims about the relation between body and soul when it comes to human beings. Aquinas, for example, thought the soul is unitary, but that it fulfills distinct vital, desiring, and rational functions. But he didn't make a distinction between soul and spirit, at least not in terms of human psychology. (So obviously, he was a pseudo-Christian, per Archangel's view of what true Christians think.) And that's just one example.\n \n The doctrine of the Trinity refers specifically to the idea of One God in Three Persons. The idea here is that God has a unitary nature, no matter how he is manifest: as Father, as Son, or as Holy Spirit. The problematic issues arise mainly from the status of Jesus. How, for example, can God be eternal, while Jesus clearly lived in time? Are we not thereby ascribing contradictory attributes to him? Prompted by such difficulties, some declared Jesus a perfect creation, rather than God himself. Controversy resulted in the Nicene Council of AD 325 making things official: Jesus was wholly divine, the same substance as the Father. The Doctrine of the Trinity, which had become largely accepted in an informal sense already, emerged from the council, with the Holy Spirit also officially acknowledged as the same as God. Controversies remained, however, insofar as Jesus is incarnate: God become human.\n \n \nI have read some previous threads but I do not really understand the concept.\n\n \n No one has ever thought that the doctrine makes much sense in rational terms. Theologians generally declare it one of the mysteries of faith, a revealed rather than rational truth. For a rationalist like me, that's something of a problem. (But of course, I'm a very bad Christian.) It's hard to look at the history of the dispute and not see a human power struggle rather than a divinely granted insight.\n \n If you want it to make sense, don't look at me!\n \n Cheers",

It is an act commonly associated with religious belief as many religions consider faith to be an essential element of piety.\n\n \n Leap of faith - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nSo I refer back to my prior explanation and stand by it as believers in Christ have no doubt about the existence of the soul as one third of the person we all are. It takes no leap of faith at all on my part to accept this invisible aspect of who I am.\n\n \n Incorrect. No one can ever truly know anything. There is always doubt as nothing can ever conclusively be proven. Is there irrefutable evidence that we exist and are not nothing more then another's being imagination or dreams? No. Whether you like it or not, we know nothing and believe much which includes your beliefs on your God. \n \n \nAnd in every debate I have had with Matthew he has shown equal shallowness in understanding spiritual issues which is why he brought my name into a discussion he was having with another poster even though I wasn't participating in this debate at that point. If he wants to question my thinking, I will answer him.\n\n \n That's only because he disagrees with your exceedingly narrow view of the world and your contemptuous attitude that you and only you are capable of judging what Christians believe and what they don't and thus who qualifies.",

   "Actually, it's about God.\n \n Different Christian thinkers make different claims about the relation between body and soul when it comes to human beings. Aquinas, for example, thought the soul is unitary, but that it fulfills distinct vital, desiring, and rational functions. But he didn't make a distinction between soul and spirit, at least not in terms of human psychology. (So obviously, he was a pseudo-Christian, per Archangel's view of what true Christians think.) And that's just one example.\n \n The doctrine of the Trinity refers specifically to the idea of One God in Three Persons. The idea here is that God has a unitary nature, no matter how he is manifest: as Father, as Son, or as Holy Spirit. The problematic issues arise mainly from the status of Jesus. How, for example, can God be eternal, while Jesus clearly lived in time? Are we not thereby ascribing contradictory attributes to him? Prompted by such difficulties, some declared Jesus a perfect creation, rather than God himself. Controversy resulted in the Nicene Council of AD 325 making things official: Jesus was wholly divine, the same substance as the Father. The Doctrine of the Trinity, which had become largely accepted in an informal sense already, emerged from the council, with the Holy Spirit also officially acknowledged as the same as God. Controversies remained, however, insofar as Jesus is incarnate: God become human.\n \n \n \n No one has ever thought that the doctrine makes much sense in rational terms. Theologians generally declare it one of the mysteries of faith, a revealed rather than rational truth. For a rationalist like me, that's something of a problem. (But of course, I'm a very bad Christian.) It's hard to look at the history of the dispute and not see a human power struggle rather than a divinely granted insight.\n \n If you want it to make sense, don't look at me!\n \n Cheers\n\n \n \n Thank you very much for that!\n So the doctrine of the trinity is rather like the notion of how many angels can dance on a pinhead! Not mentioned in the Bible and only relevant enough to Christian faith so as to cause discord and create heretics!",

   "You know, I always understood the trinity to be an explanation of God!\n I never knew that it could be used to describe us!!\n I have read some previous threads but I do not really understand the concept.\n I could google it up but as there is a wealth of knowledge on the subject on this forum, I would be grateful if someone could explain this to me and endure the inevitable silly questions that I my ask.\n\n \n Look at it this way gansao, since we are made in Gods image, every aspect of our being is a reflection of who God is. Only God reflects the holy, righteous and perfect application of all of the emotional, physical and spiritual character traits which are found in Man. \n \n Consider every emotion you have ever personally experienced. Love, hate, anger, joy, ecstasy, fear, bitterness, compassion, empathy, sympathy and jealousy just to mention some of the wide range of human emotions and feelings we have. Now look at the difference between men and women to see how those same emotions are applied to real life experiences in such different ways. \n \n You get a taste of how marvelous and multi-dimensional God is for creating us so similarly, yet so different at the same time. He gave women certain strengths which will humble any honest man, and he gave men a completely different set of strengths from women. When placed together in love and commitment a man and women truly can become one flesh just as God created us for in Genesis. \n \n So in addition to our triune natures, and our free will natures which only God possesses in all of Creation, we are perfect reflections of Him in all area's of our make up. The reason we need Jesus is because we were corrupted with a sinful nature by our fall from grace. So these character traits have been tainted by a sinful and rebellious nature which separates us from a holy God. \n \n But Gods love is so great towards us, and He is so committed to repairing that relationship which WE destroyed by disobeying Him, that GOD took life and the flesh of man upon Himself in order to live as a perfect example for us, which Jesus represented, and then because there was no other worthy sacrifice in all of creation who could reunite us with Him, He gave His own life so that we might be saved if we will only accept and receive what He did for us on the Cross. That is the simple gospel.\n \n The bible say's that \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one.\" It also say's that \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so that whoever should believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\" It also say's that \"It is by grace that we are saved by faith and not of works, so that no man may boast.\" \n \n So you see, there is nothing we can do to earn Heaven on our own merits because the sinful nature within us keeps us from ever meeting Gods standard of holiness. And it is solely by Gods work and sacrifice that we can be rejoined to Him through Christ our Lord. It is a free gift of God. \n \n In short, the doctrine of the trinity makes perfect sense, and every legitimate theologian accepts it as valid and the only proper interpretation of who God is. Matthew will quote men like Aquinas and other long dead catholics as his source for what he believes, but I haven't seen him quote the actual word of God once since coming to this forum in order to defend what he believes. That's my problem with him as he has nothing more than secular humanists explanations for his beliefs. Nothing he say's is actually founded in Gods word which is the only reliable source for what we believe in life.\n \n Go here gansao 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel and read a scripturally based teaching on what separates a true teacher of the bible from a false teacher of the bible and see where we fit according to true theological principles from the bible itself and not from men who have corrupted Gods truth as the RCC has through out its history. And then you decide what you believe the truth is. Here's just an excerpt of the corruption which Matthew represents as he attempts to tell you his truth. I am attempting to tell you Gods truth according to His word because I understand that any truth which is based on my knowledge is useless. There is much more so please read this link as it will perfectly explain the differences in our world views.\n A. A true prophet leads people to the Bible and to Jesus. \n If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. ~ 1 Corinthians 14:37\n Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. ~ Acts 26:19-20\n According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire. ~ 1 Corinthians 3:10-15\n \n \n A false prophet speaks lies, leading people away from the Bible and Jesus.\n But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of Truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make mechandise of you, whose judgement now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. ~ 2 Peter 2:1-3\n And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. ~ Acts 13:6, 8\n For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. ~ 2 Timothy 4:3-4 \n One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. ~ Titus 10-14",

Yet Jesus took on human flesh and dwelt among us. So although God exists apart from time, he also exists within it. Although the word trinity is never used in the bible. The concept is used and is placed at the forefront of our spiritual lives by Jesus Himself regarding the process of baptism which is our public proclamation of ones personal salvation. Here's the verse.\n Mat 28:19 Go therefore* and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n Now, just as the 3 in 1 is the way to express the fulness of God. So is accepting the body, soul and spirit the way to accurately express the fulness of who we are as His human creation. Here's an aid to help clarify what the trinity is.\n \n Here's a biblical promise, so the answer is in Gods word.\n 2 Timothy 3:16\n All Scripture is God&#8800;breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,\n \n 1 Peter 1:2 describes the part each member of the Trinity plays in uniting us to Himself through the work of personal salvation. It say's:\n 1 Peter 1:2 (New International Version)\n \n 2who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: \n Grace and peace be yours in abundance.\n \n Ephesians 4:4-6 describes the relationship we have through the body and spirit of God which saves us, and that God the Father is over all, through all and in all. It say's:\n Ephesians 4:4-6 (New International Version)\n \n 4There is one body and one Spirit-just as you were called to one hope when you were called- 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\n \n You see, the doctrine of the trinity is integral in every aspect of our relationship with our heavenly Father through Christ's work on the Cross and by way of His Holy Spirit which draws us to Him. Here are 3 more passages which you can look at to explain our relationship with God via the trinity.\n \n BibleGateway.com - PassageLookup: 1COR\n \n BibleGateway.com - PassageLookup: 2COR\n \n BibleGateway.com - PassageLookup: GAL\n \n This verse is very special because it plainly explains how God sent His Holy Spirit to dwell within all believers which gives us our spiritual insight and completes the process of truly being born again according to the requirements of the Gospel of Christ.\n \n If you are having a difficult time wrapping your brain around the concept of the Trinity, don't beat yourself up or feel dumb, or anything. Because this is a difficult relationship to digest from our finite perspective. For me, relating it to the 3 parts that make us human is the best way to envision how even though we know that we are each one person, it's the three integral parts of us which make up that one person. And lacking any single aspect of ourselves would mean we are no longer alive in this form. I hope this helps. But after reading it, if you have any \"specific\" questions, maybe I can answer them.",

What we see from the writers who were not writing from their own knowledge, but were writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Himself is that the trinity is an integral part of who God is and His method for fellowship with us, His creation in this Age of Grace. The verses I post make that very clear. \n \n That's why the bible as the inspired word of God is so valuable beyond what any other writer or commentator may offer us. This is why we are told in the bible to compare everything someone tells us with Gods word and if what that person say's conflicts with Gods word then reject their council in favor of trusting Gods word. \n \n \nIf I say that the doctrine of the trinity is a way to express God and not to arbitarily slice God into three bits and that the holy spiriit could be seen as the conduit between god and mankind. would I be miles off the mark?\n\n \n You would be right on the mark. That is exactly the Holy Spirits ministry, to personally convey God's will and character upon all believers who have accepted what and who Jesus is. The Holy Spirit convicts me when I sin and blesses me when I please Him. I am never alone because He is always present.\n \n And this is another study altogether, but Jesus can be likened to our defense attorney in Heaven who stands against the accuser who is attempting to condemn us before the Father. I can just see satan pointing out a sin I've committed and saying, this guy has known you for 33 years now and is still stumbling in a way that he did as a heathen, when are you going to wash your hands of him?\n \n And Jesus Christ my Lord interjects, but Father, the Holy Spirit dwells with Ali, and he is covered by my blood which I shed for him on Calvary's Cross. All of his sins have been thrown into the depths of the Sea according to your Holy Word. That is a promise which protects him from these accusations the accuser brings to your throne.\n \n God my Father then responds to the accuser that Ali is mine under a promise and a covenant which I made with Him on August 16th 1975. He is covered by the blood of the perfect lamb of God which was shed for ALL OF HIS SINS, and I promised him I would never leave or forsake him, so depart from me you wicked thing and make your accusations somewhere else. \n \n That is the security which lies within all believers in our loving Father through the sacrifice Jesus made for us by the power of His Holy Spirit which He sent to indwell all who receive that FREE GIFT which we could never earn by our own merit. \n \n Micah 7:19 He will again have compassion on us;\n he will tread our iniquities underfoot.

   "My only point in this brief passage is to demonstrate that none of the passages Archangel cites -- not one -- speaks to the doctrine of the Trinity. This doctrine states that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three Persons of a unitary God. Let's look at the passages.\n \n Mat 28:19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\n \n I do not deny that this is an important commandment. Not in the slightest.\n \n I also do not deny that it refers to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirt. But I deny outright that it provides evidence that these three are one, i.e., that it supports the doctrine of the Trinity.\n \n 1 Peter 1:2 who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood\n \n Again, the passage does refer to the three, but it does not refer to them as one. Hence, this passage also does not provide support for the doctrine of the Trinity.\n \n Ephesians 4:4-6 There is one body and one Spirit-just as you were called to one hope when you were called- 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\n \n And again... You get the picture. None of the passages here invoked show the three to be one.\n \n Mentioning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in a single passage is simply not sufficient for the Trinity. I hasten to add that this doesn't make the doctrine false.\n \n This is part of why I don't bother addressing your quotes from scripture, Archie. It is invariably a leap to get from the passage you quote to whatever you use the passage to defend. Just as invariably, you don't fill in the gap being leaped with explanation. And you certainly didn't in the passages above.\n \n (Does pointing this out make me spiritually dead?)",

Let's look at the passage, as you've rendered it:\n  Ephesians 4:4-6 There is one body and one Spirit-just as you were called to one hope when you were called- 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\n You have bolded certain portions that you seem to think make your case. But they don't, for several reasons. The first couple are semantic points, while the last is historical.\n \n 1. The fact that the text uses \"one\" before each of the terms \"Spirit,\" \"Lord,\" and \"God\" implies the oneness of each of those things. But it need not indicate that the three together are to be understood as one thing. Indeed, you have boldfaced very selectively. What are we to understand about all the other terms the passage precedes by \"one,\" and that are interspersed with the three spots you've boldfaced? I'm afraid I don't think the repeated use of \"one\" in this passage can do the interpretive work you need it to do.\n \n 2. It is a major leap to consider \"Lord\" to mean the Person of the Son. The term \"Lord\" is certainly used with reference to Jesus. But \"Lord\" is also commonly used in reference to the Father. Why, then, should we presume it refers to the Son rather than the Father in this case? I don't think that's a justifiable move. So the upshot is, I'm not sure we should interpret this passage as even referring to all three Persons of the Trinity in the first place.\n \n 3. The context in which Paul was writing has nothing to do with establishing the Trinity, as a theological, Christological, or metaphysical doctrine. The goal of Ephesians is much more mundane than that, though in some ways it might be (or might have been) much more important. The entire letter is a plea for unity in the Church, particularly given some raging controversies about whether Gentiles should be allowed to convert without first accepting Jewish law. (A lot of non-Jewish, adult males were less than enthusiastic about the circumcision requirement, for example.) Paul was always on the side of greater inclusion as an earthly realization of the universality of God's presence. Seen in the light of his unifying goals, the rhetorical emphasis on oneness is quite understandable. But it's not a oneness-of-three that is at issue.\n \n \nHow much better could the thought be portrayed without actually using the word trinity?\n\n \n Much better, I'd say. Paul could have written of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit being one, yet three. But he didn't.\n \n \nIs that passage saying that God is 3 persons?\n\n \n To put it bluntly: NO.\n \n You are focusing on three phrases from the passage. You are interpreting one of these phrases in a way that the passage itself does not justify. You are connecting the three phrases in a way that the passage itself does not connect them. You are lifting the entire passage out of the context of the rest of the letter. And you are ignoring the historical circumstances under which the letter was written.\n \n For these reasons, I don't think the passage means what you say it means.\n \n \nIf not, then why are you incapable of discerning the clear message in that verse?\n\n \n As you can see, I don't think the message you declare \"clear\" is clear at all.

And each brick is, unquestionably, made of the stuff of which a 'house' is made.\n \n In short, who are we to complain about what constitutes 'one' God?\n\n \n Good question! And good points all. But the problem comes from the notion of God as not being composed of any parts in the first place: He is a single and simple thing outside of time, incapable of coming into or passing out of existence as are things that have parts (e.g. your house). What screws things up are the life of Jesus and the action of the Holy Spirit within time. It's not clear how these two can be said to be God without either denying God's own nature (as one, etc.) or ascribing contradictory attributes to him (eternal and temporal, etc.).\n \n Personally, I'm not at all sure that calling a truth \"revealed\" makes the problem inherent in this contradiction disappear. I'm not wild about the notion of a contradiction right at the heart of an ostensbly perfectly rational deity, who has reasons for everything He does.

   "Here's a question... If you are going to be religious, why is it so bad to believe in more than one deity after all? Why is a belief in one god so superior to believing in multiple gods? Would the view of God, the father; Jesus; and the Holy Spirit as three separate entities lessen the religion in any way?\n \n I suspect that this aversion to multiple deities comes from comparisons to earlier pagan cultures that worshiped multiple deities where their lifestyles were viewed as corrupt and immoral. Also, many of the gods in polytheistic religions argued with each other, had intrigues, envies, etc. that disrupted human lives. However, I haven't heard too many arguements against polytheistic societies where the deities worked very well with each other (as, theoretically, one might say God the father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit do).\n \n Anyway, yes, this is a bit of an off-the-wall question but it seems relevant to this discussion.",

We are discussing the idea of the Trinity: God is three Persons, yet one God. You brought up the Ephesians passage as something that would clarify what that idea means. I challenged that view.\n\n \n Yes, but had you taken all 7 verses together, you might get a consistent train of thought doctrinally speaking. And asking you to clarify who you see God to be isn't changing the subject at all because I'm trying to find out where, specifically we disagree on who He is regarding how you see the trinity. Is God 3 separate persons to you? Or is He one person with 3 parts as we, His creation is? That was my simple question.\n \n \nAs to my \"understanding of who God is,\" I will sincerely say that I don't know what you mean. You had asked for a definition. I don't think God can be \"defined.\" I think he transcends our experience, and our ability to talk about that experience in cognitively meaningful ways.\n \n I suppose I could discuss the metaphysical God of the philosopher-theologians. But it's never been clear to me that God as first principle and the God of the Bible, let alone Jesus, have much to do with one another.\n \n\n \n My question was referring to how you see Him regarding His relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit, the other two members of the Holy Trinity. But regarding your claim that He can't be defined? That is totally wrong since His word is chock full of examples of His power, patience, long suffering, unconditional love for us, His wisdom, commitment to us, frustration with us, animosity to sin and rebellion against Him, not to mention His personal self sacrifice in order to redeem us, and many other evidences of His eternal and Holy Nature which reveal His character as a reliable and trustworthy God whom we can turn to and depend on. \n \n Now, did I get all metaphysical and obscure with you in defining our Gods character and personality? Or is He easily described if one knows what He actually stands for and represent? This is why I have said that you don't personally know Him, because you don't know who He is. You don't understand His motivations or His character traits or that question wouldn't have been hard at all.\n \n And don't misunderstand me here; I'm not trying to insult you. I'm saying that there is understanding God in the flesh, and there is understanding Him in the spirit. To me it's obvious that your understanding of who God is, is not based in a personal relationship with Him. \n Jhn 10:14 \"I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me,\n \n Jhn 10:27 \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;\n \nNow you bring up \"who.\" And perhaps that's a much better way of looking at God than is any sort of metaphysical view, from the deistic to the supernatural!\n \n I will say that I see the face of God in the eyes of the starving child, the war widow, the frightened and lost stranger with nowhere to go. And I see it also in the eyes of the happy child, the loving couple, the explorer who peers at nature in awe. God is with us, after all. But whether these expressions mean anything to anyone but me, or whether they mean the same thing to others as they do to me, I have no idea. I really don't know how else to describe the experience, however.\n \n And in any event, I fail to see how any of this helps us get clearer on the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\n \n Your descriptions of seeing God in His creation explains the human condition better than it defines who God is, which I clarified above. And the fact that you referred to Him as an it means you can't see Him as a personality who created us in His image rather than an energy source, for lack of a better term. God is a Person whom we are reflections of in every character aspect which He created within us. You should see Him as a person, not a thing. \n \n And remember, my reason for asking the question was to get you to explain Him in terms of His relationship with the other two members of the Godhead.\n \n \nPerhaps if you would explain why that passage means what you think it means, and why my view is wrong, that might be a way to address the larger issue!\n\n \n No one verse will give us a clear picture of Gods nature, person or character. And I can't make you interpret it as I do. But to me that verse is self evident taken with all that I know about what God reveals of Himself throughout the bible. So, the fact that you can't see that means that maybe you need to widen your study and seek a deeper understanding of who God is in reality.\n \n \nCalling it \"self-evident\" doesn't explain anything! If it were self-evident -- evident in and of itself -- then we would not be having a disagreement about it.\n\n \n As I said, it is self evident to me based on everything His word say's about His character and His very clear statement that He created us in His image. So all I need do is look at the make up of Humans and I see the same trinity which He represents in Himself. You have completely ignored that aspect of my explanation so far.\n \n \nI'm not asking you to repeat yourself. I'm asking you to look at the passage and explain it. I'm asking you to look at my comments, and explain where they went wrong.\n\n \n I have explained above why I disagree with your interpretation. Hopefully that point is clear to you now.\n \n \nDid you read my comments? Look at #2 again: I have no reason to think that \"Jesus\" has even been mentioned in the passage!\n\n \n That claim just boggles my mind. What other Lord do you propose was being referred to there? How many Lords are referred to in Gods word? For you not to clearly see that as referring to Jesus Christ, our Lord throws up too many red flags regarding your ability to discern the bible, to mention. It tells me you are seeing Gods word on a totally fleshly level and not through spiritual eyes at all. Here's my point Matthew, if this verse applied to your personal life:\n Galatians 4:4-6 (New International Version)\n \n 4But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, 5 to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. 6 Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \"Abba,[a] Father.\"\n If that spiritual promise had been fulfilled within you as one who has accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, there is no way you wouldn't recognize Jesus as the Lord being referred to in that verse. Especially since it really doesn't even make sense with any other interpretation.\n \n \nNeither. It's a call for unity among Christians. (Kind of ironic that we're debating this....) So I think you've created a false dilemma here.\n\n \n Actually, that's not what it's about at all. It's about the unity of the believer within the body of Christ. A spiritual body in which the Holy Spirit is the glue who guides us in the ways of Gods truths, the Lord is the object of our faith, and God who is the object of our worship who is over all and through all and in all. \n Ephesians 4:4-6 There is one body and one Spirit&#8212;just as you were called to one hope when you were called&#8212; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\n \nI would like to see your detailed comments on where my previous comments went wrong. Why does \"Lord\" refer to Jesus, for example \n\n \n I answered that question, and more above. I hope you'll take it in the spirit in which it's intended. Galations 4:4 exposes the unfinished work that remains regarding your relationship with God. It isn't a head knowledge which gives us access to God through His word, but a living breathing relationship which comes only by receiving His Holy Spirit within us in a born again experience. That is what makes us one with the Father, and it only comes through the Son whose Holy Spirit is then given to us as our eternal guide to help us defeat the enemy which wants to destroy us. Our battle is a spiritual one, not against flesh and blood, but against powers, principalities and spiritual forces as this verse clarifies.\n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].\n As our battle is a spiritual one, so must it be fought on a spiritual level. It can't even be comprehended on a physical or fleshly level by the natural mind. That is why we are on different plains of understanding here, and is why I doubt you can even comprehend my perspective.",

And not only do I still doubt you can relate to my spiritual perspective, but now, you also realize you don't have the insight that comes with possessing the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. \n \n And please don't think I'm saying this to put you down or degrade you in any way. Because I was once exactly where you're at so I can relate. I'm saying this so you'll be aware of what's available to you and that our Lord loves you exceedingly and beyond what words can describe. I'm telling you to go deep within yourself and cry out into the spiritual darkness and ask God Himself to reveal Himself to you so you can believe and accept Him if He's there in a personal way. And I promise that if you ask sincerely, God will find you. You don't have to find Him at all as He understand our position.\n \n Salvation isn't a state of mind, it's a state of being. And I would like nothing more than to discuss spiritual truths with you and not have to debate the simplest concepts. The fact is this though, until you possess Gods Holy Spirit as your guide, the word of God will never come to life for you. And Gods word is alive; as alive as the Lord Jesus is. That is why spiritually dead people can't comprehend it. I'm telling you the truth in love and I'm saying it not to oppose or hurt you, but to lead to salvation which only comes through Christ. \n \n That's why I'm not even asking you to believe me, but to go directly to God within yourself. Because God meets each one of us individually. So men don't save souls, church's don't save souls, only God can save us through faith in Christ and by the power of His Holy Spirit who prepares the searching heart for Gods truth. If you'll sincerely seek that truth, it will surely set you free. I look forward to the day when we can discuss Gods word on equal footing and as brothers in Christ, rather than as opponents. \n \n Be at peace... emoticon_xangel\n \n Ali",

At least we can agree on that.\n \n Let me leave you with 2 passages to end this discussion. The first is a warning to all unbelievers.

I promise you that when you find absolute truth, you will know it and you will become a new creature instantly. There will be no doubt in your mind that you have changed. I'm praying that you'll feel the presence of the Holy Spirit within you.\n Rom 8:6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,\n \n Rom 8:9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.\n \n Rom 8:10 If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.\n \n Rom 8:11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\n \n Rom 8:13 for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\n \n Rom 8:14 For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\n \n Rom 8:15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, \"Abba! Father!\"\n \n Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,",
