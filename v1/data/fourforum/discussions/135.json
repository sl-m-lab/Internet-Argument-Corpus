   "Much of the problem in some of these discussions seems to result from a misunderstanding of the nature of science; what science is and how it works. As a result, some ask for \"proof\" of scientific theories, unaware that no theory of science ever reaches the point of logical proof. \n \n Perhaps it would be beneficial to consider how scientists view science, and particularly how evolutionary biologists look on the theories of evolution. In that light, consider the following:\n \n First, a scientist assumes that the world can be understood. He/she assumes that there are patterns that can be analyzed and studied to result in broad principles that can be applied everywhere, at all times. This is the assumption that the universe is a single system where the basic rules apply everywhere. The theories of gravity that explain how the planets move around the sun also apply to planets moving around other stars.\n \n Second, a scientist assumes that all ideas are subject to change. If science held fast to unchangeable dogma, then scientific advance would stop. Scientific knowledge is a set of inferences based on observed data and tests of those inferences. As additional or more refined observations are made, the explanations must be tested and expanded, altered, or in a few cases, rejected, in order to account for the new observations.\n \n Third, scientific knowledge lasts. While admitting a certain amount of uncertainty because of the logical construct of scientific knowledge, there is still the assumption that well tested ideas will continue to hold and can be used as the basis for advance. Thus, Newton's laws of gravity, based on previous work by Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo, were themselves adjusted by Einstein. In effect, Newton's work became a subset of limited application within the more general theory of gravity.\n \n Finally, science can't know everything. There are matters that are outside the scope of science. Some things, by their very nature, cannot be examined by science. Thus miracles, fortune-telling, astrology, and superstitions cannot be scientifically examined unless they produce empirical, repeatable observations. In fact, such topics claim to be exceptions to natural universe. They claim to be supernatural and are thus, by definition beyond examination by science. They can be neither \"proved\" (nor supported, for that matter), or disproved by science.\n \n So how does science work? First there is an observation or several observations. Then, based on knowledge of previous science, imagination, and invention, a scientist proposes a plausible explanation that accounts for all of the observations, and fits into or adjusts current scientific knowledge. This is called the hypothesis.\n \n From this hypothesis, a prediction is made as to an additional observation can must be true as a logical consequence of the hypothesis. Stated another way, if the predicted observation is made it offers evidence that the hypothesis is true. However, if the prediction turns out to be false, then the hypothesis must be false. It must be rejected or possibly restated to account for the failure of the predicted observation. This is known as the principle of falsifiability. A scientific hypothesis (or theory) must have this property. It must be possible to prove that it is wrong. If no possible conditions exist under which the hypothesis can be shown to be wrong, it is not falsifiable and is probably not science.\n \n If supported, then the hypothesis is tentatively accepted. A severely tested hypothesis is known as a theory. This is not the \"theory\" that is commonly meant in general use. Objections to the teaching of valid science in our schools because it is, after all, \"only a theory\" try to represent science as a wild guess based on no evidence. Strangely, it seems that only certain scientific ideas are objected to on that basis. You don't see objections to the teaching of the sun as the center of the solar system on the basis of it being \"only a theory.\" No one claims that the atomic nature of matter taught as the basis of chemistry and nuclear physics is \"only a theory.\" And no one ever supports the teaching of the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air) seeking their predetermined level as an alternative to the \"theory\" of gravity.\n \n For those who follow to this point, I can present an examples of science working in exactly the way I have outlined above. I can even offer examples of evolutionary biology working in exactly this way. But first, should we clarify any of the above?",

   "The sun is known as the center of our solar system because it is a FACT. Evolution is not. Evolution is a theory.\n\n \n No dear. It is called the heliocentric theory. It was first stated by Copernicus in Commentariolus written some time between 1507 and 1515 but went unpublished. That work was a discussion of the order of the planets. Copernicus solved the problems in determining the distance of the spheres of the various planets from an unmoving earth by declaring that the sun was stationary and the earth moved. The complete theory was published in De revolutionibus in 1543. The theory was, of course, anti-biblical since it contradicted the Biblical fact that the earth does not move. Galileo ran into this Biblical \"truth\" too.\n \n But nevertheless, observations about the motion of the planets are best explained by the theory that the sun is at the center of their orbits rather than the earth. This is not an observation, i.e., a fact, of itself. The time and distances involved are to great to observe. It is the mathematical analysis of observations of the positions of the planets that point to that conclusion. It is a theory. It also predicts the future position of the planets.\n \n Your definition of a theory is taken from a dictionary that defines the common use of the word outside of a scientific context. Actually, scientific facts are the observations that theories explain. Never does any scientific theory grow up to be a fact. While in a non-scientific context you may mean a wild guess when you say theory, that is not the case in science. Theories are never proven as fact. They can be tested and revised and supported, but they can't be \"proven.\" It is a consequence of logic.\n \n Do you believe that germs cause disease? That is the germ theory of disease. Nuclear theory explains why we can produce power from uranium in nuclear reactors. Tectonic theory explains mountain building, earth quakes and volcanos. The theory predicted that the continents were moving and that has been verified by actual measurements. Theories are not facts and they don't become facts. In science, \"theory\" is as good as it gets.\n \n The American Association for the Advancement of Science has been concerned for some time about the lack of scientific literacy that is evident in our country. They have been actively involved in trying to improve the effectiveness of science teaching by offering resources to schools and teachers. This has been an ongoing project but there appears to be a long way to go. There are too many scientific illiterates who believe that scientific theories are proven and become facts. What scientists mean when they talk about science is determined by the scientists themselves, not by how the man/woman on the street uses the words. In fact, the definition that Calli has given us is closer to what a scientist calls an hypothesis, the second step of the scientific method.\n \n The AAAS has published a book called Science for All Americans that is available on line. Perhaps a careful reading will help some to understand what science is and how it works.\n \n Isn't it entertaining that as an example of \"proving\" the scientific accuracy of the Bible, Calli selects a story that is pure invention. I know a planetary physicist (NASA & JPL) who always gets a good laugh at that story. Even if the Bible were true, there is no way to determine that there is missing time.

And yet, such a farfetched story that could have easily been checked using the internet is believed in a heart beat because it helps the Creation side. And yet any science that opposes Creation needs to be checked and scrutinized until something can be found wrong with it, in order to cast doubt on it. I'm not saying both sides don't do it, I just think it is interesting, No Creationist every believes what an evolutionist says, and they would go to the ends of the Earth to disprove it, and Evolutionists never believe what Creationists say and they would go to the ends of the Earth to disprove it. And yet both sides will take information that proves their own theory and not only believe it but use it as an argument without checking the source or the truth of it.

I simply told someone not to use the \"it says in the Bible that grasshoppers only have 4 legs\" contradiction because that is not what the verse says. (I've already been over this with Sarah.)",

   "Where do the words \"the earth doesn't move\" appear in the verse?\n\n \n Where it says that it's immobile.

   "What part of \"unmoving/motionless/unchanging\" is it that you don't understand?\n \n \nThe verse does not say that the earth does not move, it says that it cannot be moved by any force other than God himself if He decides to one day.\n\n \n So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.\n \n Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.\n \n You \"interpret\" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.",

   "Quoted from Fallingupward:\n \nwhere in luke does it say one day?\n\n \n In Luke 24. Here is a abridged version of it.\n \n  1On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.\n \n Skipping a bit here...\n \n  13Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 15As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 16but they were kept from recognizing him. \n \n Skipping some more...\n \n  28As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. 29But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. \n \n Skipping yet again...\n \n  50When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 51While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. \n \n I got this from GatewayBible If you want to check it out. \n \n In Acts, it says...\n \n  1In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.\n \n BTW, I think I know how Calligirl is going to claim that this is not a contradiction. ;)",

   "you skipped 20 verses. those versus were an account of when He visited his disciples. you made it seem like verse 50 said that He led the two men going to Emmaus go out to Bethany. you skipped all of these verses. when reading the entire chapter, you realize that he spent time with the disciples before He ascended into heaven. luke does not tell us how long He spent with his disciples. but after this period of time, he led his disciples out to the viscinity of Bethany where He there ascended into heaven. it would have been impossible for Him to have done all of this in one day. it was already evening when He was with the two men going to emmaus. it does not say that He saw the disciples that same day or evening. and it does not say how long He spent with His disciples after He did see them. not to mention that bethany was approximately 20 miles away from emmaus.\n \n it was a nice try though:)",
