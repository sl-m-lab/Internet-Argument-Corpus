   "Since no one had replied to this thread in four months, I find it unlikely you disrupted its flow.\n \n \nNietzsche (and to a lesser extent, his predecessor and compatriot Schopenhauer) dealt once and for all with the folly of moral dogma a century ago - it is a \"herd\" control function period, and thus highly subjective / selective.\n\n \n It has been a while since I studied Nietschze. Nietzsche wrote about slave morality, and believed this particular variety of morality, stemming from Judeo/Christian principles, was a problem. It esteemed weakness, the \"maggot-men\".\n \n He did not view this as a \"herd control\" function, he viewed it as a system through which the herd dominated, and suppressed the ubermensch, the elite few which had in the past, ruled. This system was to break down with the death of god, a period absent morality, nihilism, which Nietzsche viewed as painful but neccessary, and that this moral void would leave open the path for an authentic morality to be developed, by the \"philosophers of the future\". It is a common misconception that Nietzsche was a nihilist.\n \n \n Utlimately the marginalised man has no need for morality, because this morailty is what keeps him on his knees in subjugation.\n\n \n The marginalised often have no morality, drug addicts, career criminals, the homeless. Some, having no morality, abuse others. More, having no morality accept the abuse of themselves. This, as far as I can tell, does not free them, and neither would further abuse of others or allowed abuse of themselves.\n \n Or are the \"marginalised\" in our society paragons of virtue, who through their goodness of heart and adherence to morality suffer the injustices of the wealthy? What world are you living in?",

Would I be off the mark if I were to say that \"morality\" when used collectively (by a tribe, etc.) is simply another \"means to power\" that can appear at time as a \"good\" or a \"bad\"? A means of controlling others -- and those that can wield the apparatuses of control are the ones who ascend to power.\n \n Jackamarra  said morality \"is nothing more than a fabrication of mankind.\" I would add that it is fabricated for a purpose and that purpose is to give the individual, through the tribe, an illusion of security and control over that which is not in their control.\n \n Symbiote then fascinated me with this unfathomable statement:\n \n When you speak of a \"particular morality\", say \"eary 21st century conservative Christian morality\", you are speaking of people's moral beliefs, not morality itself.\n \n By my definition, morality is a doctrine or system of moral conduct and/or beliefs, or conformity to ideals of right human conduct. So in general, moralities are manmade concepts.\n \n When dealing with \"morality\" we cannot view it solely through the lens of philosophy, we must also take into account human motives and drives since \"morality' is, as Jackamarra said, \"a fabrication of mankind.\"",

What you mean by \"complete with independent verification\" is unclear to me, the nature of a logical proof is that it can be checked and re-checked, not that it gets some \"independently verified\" stamp of approval and is from then on unquestionable.\n \n I assume a standard abortion related proof would look something like\n \n 1) Individuals have a right of ownership (control) over their own bodies\n 2) Forcing someone to give birth involves seizing control over someone elses body.\n 3) Forcing someone to carry a child is therefore wrong.\n \n Remembering we have already defined a wrong as the violation of a right, and that the right of self-ownership is considered axiomatic, in the sense that it is a basic truth that cannot be consistently denied (see Kinsella or Hoppe's work on argumentation ethics with regard to this).\n \n \n \nSo does that mean a new born baby straight from the womb is having his rights denied by a mother picking the baby up? She should just leave it where it lays?\n\n \n I don't believe that follows from the principle of self-ownership, no. To begin with there is the issue of when such ownership begins, what entitles it. Argumentation ethicists argue that moral rights stem from the presuppositions of any dialogue, and the case may be with them that a being comes into possession of rights when it comes into possession of language of some kind, whether spoken, written or perhaps even entirely mental. \n \n Alternatively, if we do view newborns as in possession of equal moral rights, relying on some other justification, we could perhaps conclude that such a picking up is technically wrongful. This does not mean a mother should leave a child where it lays, wrong does not imply \"ought not\".\n \n Regardless, I think the whole issue is beside the point. If I am incorrect about self-ownership, and we can't rule out the possibility, I am certainly not infallible, that in no way demonstrates that there are in general no objective moral rules. There are plenty of advocates of an objective morality who completely disagree with me about the right of self ownership, even amongst those who agree it can be logically resolved (it just has not been yet).",

I don't believe there is any \"morality\" in the sense of telling people what they ought to do. Ought is simply a matter of choosing means appropriate to ends sought - if Ted Bundy's killings achieved his aims, they were suitable and appropriate for him. That doesn't however make them right.

Once a baby understands language, then how is that a mother has a moral right to pick up the baby, force it to eat/drink particular foods, change its diaper?\n\n \n It doesn't have a right to - once a being is in possession of moral rights there can not be a right to force it to do something. The point at where these rights come into place is certainly a matter for debate. In any case developmental psychology isn't my specialty, but from what I've read of for example Piaget, he puts the development of an internal \"representational schema\" at about 2 years. For anyone relying on \"argument\" as the generator of rights, language is a critical part of that, but may not neccessarily be the only or last part.\n \n \nMore critically, how is it a mother moral right to propagandize the baby?\n\n \n Self ownership implies you can do what you want with your own body, including your vocal organs. To the extent free speech facilitates propaganda, I suppose you could say there is a right to it.\n \n \nI don't understand. What does \"care for\" mean? You mean it isn't morally wrong to push someone out from in front of moving bus? That seems to be interfering with the autonomy of the person. Perhaps you need to quantify when one can be morally right to interfere with the autonomy of another.\n\n \n To give someone food or drink does not interfere with someone's autonomy - caring for someone, so long as they do not object to your care, does not violate their rights. I do not believe it is ever morally right to violate someone's rights.\n \n \nAgain, I'm really interested to hear when it is morally acceptable to foist one's opinion on another.\n\n \n I believe a person can say whatever they want, but no one else has to listen. So I don't believe you can \"foist\" your opinions on another.\n \n \nWas Hitler morally right to demonize the jews?\n\n \n I wouldn't say it was right, but it wasn't wrong either. I believe demonising Jews is within your rights, it doesn't have a moral content.\n \n \nWas he morally right to order jews to be killed (for the sake of argument, let's say that he did)? After all, everybody could have just failed to obey the orders, and no jews would have been killed.\n\n \n Again, I don't believe it was a morally right thing to do, morally right typically referring to the fulfilment of an acquired obligation - for example if you take somthing from a store, the right thing to do is to pay for it.\n \n As far as ordering goes, that's a tricky one. Suppose I tell you to go kill some Jews - I don't believe that's wrong. Suppose I \"order\" you to go kill some Jews, by which I mean I threaten to have you killed unless you do so, that's a grey area I'm haven't yet seen a decent argument for.\n \n I think though this is all beside the point, the particular beliefs I have about morality may well be flawed, and through conversations like this we can reveal such flaws in them, through inconsistencies and the like. The fact my beliefs are not always going to be correct is simply a reflection of that favourite phrase of yours, \"people are stupid\". We are not gods, we do not have a perfect understanding, and we often make mistakes.\n \n \nYou're crashing again...\"Beliefs about morality change\" Are you suggesting morailty is a religous construct requiring faith? And there exists an ultimate [terrestial] morality to be believed in?\n\n \n No I am not saying morality requires faith, I have explained several times that I believe it can be derived by a logical process.\n \n Yes I believe there exists an \"ultimate\" morality to be believed in, that is I believe there are correct moral beliefs and there are incorrect ones.\n \n \nMorality is a learned construct - there is no universal moral schema encompassing all nations, all tribes. (if you dispute this, then please demonstrate the contrary).\n\n \n I believe the same things are moral for all tribes. Slavery is wrong where it still exists in Africa, just as it is wrong here.\n \n \nAlthough all cultures / groups are characterised with owning a moral code to regulate conduct, this does not imply the existence of an objective morality. Au contraire! the reality of multiple moralities evidences the inverse, which is morality is a subjective and culturally-specific pseudo-science.\n\n \n Empirical fact, the plurality of beliefs about morality, demonstrates nothing about the existence or otherwise of an objective morality, just as the plurality of beliefs about economics demonstrates nothing about the objective truth or otherwise of economic propositions.

We are all human and therefore all affected and limited by our humanity.\n\n \n Man also conceives of mathematics, physics - and yet these are considered topics about which there exist objective truths. If you wish to define the category of subjectivism so broadly that it encompasses all topics throughout all time, I will concede morality belongs in the realm of subjectivity under such a definition.\n \n I put it to you however that this definition is essentially an absurd one, for something to be objective it need not be \"perceived without distortion\", indeed for something to be objective it need not be perceived at all. The existence of Pluto was objectively true for billions of years before it was perceived, and it exists objectively today even though our perceptions of it, like everything, are inherently dependent on our senses. Likewise, regardless of whether we perceive morality with distortion or not has no bearing on the objectivity or otherwise of its existence.\n \n I think it's painfully obvious by now to anyone reading this thread who hasn't \"read Hoppe with a well honed analytical eye\", as you so daintily put it, so if you could please get over trying to tell me what he said and actually put forward an argument for morality's subjectiveness that would be greatly appreciated.",

   " Yes, maybe he ought to have. I don't believe there is any \"morality\" in the sense of telling people what they ought to do. Ought is simply a matter of choosing means appropriate to ends sought - if Ted Bundy's killings achieved his aims, they were suitable and appropriate for him. That doesn't however make them right. I don't believe I have ever spoken of \"ought\" when it came to morality. \n\n You said: 'This does not mean a mother should leave a child where it lays, wrong does not imply \"ought not\".' If your use of \"ought\" is consistent, then Bundy should have killed (assuming for the sake of argument that it achieved his aims). You have the word \"ought\" and \"should\" linked up with expediency. So, now it's true that Bundy \"should\" have killed those women, right? You also have that (under the assumption that a newborn has full moral rights) a mother is morally wrong to pick up a newborn. \n In the Bundy case, I'm a little unsure what you think the role of morality might be. If Bundy \"should\" kill those women, then the fact that it is morally wrong (given your definition; whether it is a fact is still a matter for debate) means what exactly? If one should not be moral, what significance does morality have to humanity? \n \n \n I don't think the teaching of any particular variety of matronly propaganda is wrongful, I don't think questions of morality come into play. \n\n So, then an Aztec high-priest that trains its son to be a high-priest that engages in human sacrifices is not morally responsible for the sacrifices made by the son. If the high-priest had made a robot and programmed it to perform sacrifices, presumably the high-priest would be morally responsible for those robot-made sacrifices. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) Whether or not the programmed flesh and blood son or the robot conducts the sacrifices seems immaterial. In both cases, there is the expectation that either the son or the robot will in fact conduct sacrifices. Explain why presumably the high-priest is morally in the clear in one case, but not in the other.\n \n \n It doesn't have a right to - once a being is in possession of moral rights there can not be a right to force it to do something. The point at where these rights come into place is certainly a matter for debate. In any case developmental psychology isn't my specialty, but from what I've read of for example Piaget, he puts the development of an internal \"representational schema\" at about 2 years. For anyone relying on \"argument\" as the generator of rights, language is a critical part of that, but may not neccessarily be the only or last part. \n\n So then a parent is morally wrong to forcibly remove a sleeping 2-year-old from a burning house? Likewise a parent is morally wrong to restrain a 2-year-old from ingesting poison, setting the house on fire, playing with power tools, etc.?\n Presumably it is then morally acceptable to leave a sleeping 2-year-old in a burning house, etc. Is it morally acceptable for the parent to set the fire himself, or leave poison, incendiary devices, power tools lying about? \n \n \n Self ownership implies you can do what you want with your own body, including your vocal organs. To the extent free speech facilitates propaganda, I suppose you could say there is a right to it. \n\n So is paying a hit man to murder somebody covered under free speech? Once again, as with the Aztecan robot, the hit man is a tool, and once set into motion can reasonably be expected to kill the person of interest. Explain why using a human tool is presumably morally acceptable, while using a non-human tool is not.\n \n \n \n I believe a person can say whatever they want, but no one else has to listen. So I don't believe you can \"foist\" your opinions on another. \n\n So, yelling fire in a crowded theatre is morally acceptable? Theatre attendees don't have to listen.\n \n \n I wouldn't say it was right, but it wasn't wrong either. I believe demonising Jews is within your rights, it doesn't have a moral content. \n\n Fomenting genocide is morally acceptable. Interesting. I think the trick in your moral system is just to make sure you're not the man on point. Politicians can conscript armies and send them off to fight for any old silly thing, and they have no moral account. The poor dupe on the front not only gets to do the dying, but is also stuck with the moral account. \n \n \n \n Again, I don't believe it was a morally right thing to do, morally right typically referring to the fulfilment of an acquired obligation - for example if you take somthing from a store, the right thing to do is to pay for it. \n\n By morally \"right\" I meant not morally wrong. I'll use morally \"acceptable\", instead. \n \n \n As far as ordering goes, that's a tricky one. Suppose I tell you to go kill some Jews - I don't believe that's wrong. Suppose I \"order\" you to go kill some Jews, by which I mean I threaten to have you killed unless you do so, that's a grey area I'm haven't yet seen a decent argument for. \n\n Okay. Well, any grey area draws into question the objectiveness. \n \n \n I think though this is all beside the point, the particular beliefs I have about morality may well be flawed, and through conversations like this we can reveal such flaws in them, through inconsistencies and the like. The fact my beliefs are not always going to be correct is simply a reflection of that favourite phrase of yours, \"people are stupid\". We are not gods, we do not have a perfect understanding, and we often make mistakes. \n\n Yes, but the mistake being made may not be that you've guessed at the wrong objective morality, but that there is no objective morality. Do you have some reason to believe that there is an objective morality, other than you'd like it to be that way? People tend to believe that which is appealing. Are you quite sure that you haven't fallen prey an appealing idea?",

You've already tied it to expediency.\n \n Try again:\n You said: 'This does not mean a mother should leave a child where it lays, wrong does not imply \"ought not\".'

Likewise I believe urinating on the floor of a restaurant is perfectly fine, so long as you can find a restaurant that allows such activities. \n\n Is morality linked to what is allowed by the theatre owner?

Objective morality needs to be one specific way. If all ways are questionable, then objective morality itself is questionable.

   "If no moral proof can end demonstrating what someone \"should\" or \"should not\" do, what significance does morality have to humanity?\n\n \n And as I replied, supposing a moral proof did end demonstrating what someone \"should\" or \"should not\" do, what significance does morality have to humanity? I end my proof showing Ted Bundy should not kill people - he kills them anyway, since he acts in accordance with his own preferences, not with my is/ought barrier violating moral deduction. What significance is gained by this difference?\n \n You need to explain to me why the presence of \"oughts\" or \"shoulds\" would make morality relevant where it otherwise would not be, because I do not for the life of me see how introducing \"shoulds\" would increase the relevance of morality at all.\n \n People when acting will always choose means they believe appropriate to ends sought, it is the height of futility to try to circumvent this by presenting them with morally derived 'shoulds' and expecting them to be transformed into angels instead of men. Such a morality would indeed be irrelevant.\n \n \nBut we've already concluded that people \"should not\" be moral, as in the case of the mother picking up her baby. If people \"should not\" be moral, please explain the relevance of a moral framework to humanity.\n\n \n I believe I concluded that people should not neccessarily be moral. You apparently disagree, believing any morality relevant to humanity must incorporate oughts and shoulds.\n \n I believe I already said to you that the relevance of morality is in outlining the boundaries of social vs non-social human interaction. Kinsella believes that it can thus be used to essentially formulate an unobjectable system of justice.\n \n It may also be that at least the majority of people possess an internal mechanism for the recognition of morality, some might call it a conscience, I would expect there to be a more technical explanation, probably related to the nature of our minds in seeking consistency - a knowledge of morality may lead to a tendency to follow it for reasons of psychic utility alone. Many people struggle with the question of what they did was right or wrong, for them, knowledge of right and wrong is an end in itself.\n \n \n But a thing's existence is not determined by its usefulness, and it is possible we may have no more use for knowledge right or wrong than men in ancient times would have for the existence of Pluto, regardless of whether its uses are few, many or none has no bearing on its reality. And it is often only after we discover the existence of something we find uses for it, we do not spend much time looking for uses of things we are not sure exist.\n \n \n \n\n Is morality linked to what is allowed by the theatre owner?\n\n \n Morality is linked to allowing a theatre owner to do what he wants with his own property. I do not believe this means morality is subjective, but perhaps you would like to pursue the trend of \"argument by absurd definition\" which tends to crop up in these threads.\n \n \nI'm sorry: Isn't programming like a hypno-drone covered under free speech? \n\n \n Programming yes, using it as a tool to kill someone no, it is not the programming which is the issue, it is the killing.\n \n \nPlease distinguish where hypno-drone stops and man begins.\n\n \n A man acts in accordance with his preferences, in other words he chooses means he believes suitable to ends he seeks. A robot (well at least so far) does not act, it follows a program automatically, it no more chooses its path than a rock or a tree.\n \n \nIn both cases, the person of interest can reasonably expected to get killed. What's the difference?\n\n \n The difference is a hitman is responsible for his own actions. A robot is not, it is directed by whoever controls it.\n \n \nAnd what are those good reasons to believe in objective morality?\n\n \n Well if morality can be logically deduced, and I believe there is good work being done in the area of doing just that, it is shown to be no more a matter of personal taste or opinion than the sciences of maths or economics are.\n \n I am by no means convinced this is a final proof of the existence of an objective morality which cannot possibly be refuted, but given the complete absence of compelling arguments for morality being subjective, \"It's obvious\", \"It's an oxymoron\", \"Moral beliefs serve class interests to exploit the workers\", \"Maybe people believe morality is objective because they would like it to be\", I'll take what I can get.",
