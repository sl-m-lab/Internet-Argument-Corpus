   "The color coded alert system is hopelessly ineffective and in need of replacement with a better system for alerting people of the level of danger they're in. This is my proposal for the system.\n \n At Ease: Intelligence shows nothing on the horizon regarding terrorist activity, not even in the movies. Step back, take a breath and relax.\n \n Terrocon 1: Latest intelligence suggests that known terrorist groups might be trying to mobilize and coordinate an attack against the United States sometime in the future, but at this time there are no specifics. The people are advised to be aware but not alert or panic.\n \n Terrocon 2: The threat of a terrorist attack being committed against the United States appears tangible but there's no estimated time for when the attack may be carried out. Caution is highly advised.\n \n Terrocon 3: Latest intelligence has detected that terrorist groups have coordinated and prepared for an attack against the United States and are ready to initiate once word is received. The people are advised to avoid areas that would qualify as likely targets of attack and wait for further information.\n \n It Got Worse: The terrorist groups have launched an all out attack against the United States and have invaded American soil in the process, launching an offensive from the inside and the outside. A shoot on sight order has been issued to the American people should terrorists be spotted in their immediate area.",
