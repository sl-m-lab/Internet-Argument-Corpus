   "[QUOTE=rapture]Is that which is \"not considered viable\" legally covered by abortion laws? A fetus progressed, say, one or two years of age, left to its' own, is hardly viable? -[QUOTE=rapture]\n \n Viability in pregnancy is basically the gestational age when a fetus can survive outside the womb, as in cases of impending premature births, and it is determined by a doctor, usually with a diagnostic ultrasound. I don't think that it applies to babies who have already been born, especially at one or two years old, because it is something that is determined during the pregnancy itself; a pregnancy can not be considered viable or non-viable if the pregnancy has ended, and there would be no way at conception to determine viability or non-viabilty.\n When a pregnancy has been found to be non-viable, it means that there is no chance for the fetus to survive, outside the womb and/or in some cases, inside the womb as well. If a pregnancy has been determined to be non-viable, most of the time, termination of the pregnancy is recommended by the doctor (depending on the doctor/s and the reasons why it was found to be non-viable). If the development of the pregnancy is in the 1st trimester (first 12 weeks) it is generally recommended, but it also depends on why the pregnancy is non-viable, and from what I have learned anything later (2nd or even 3rd trimester) again depends on the doctor/s and/or the complications that made it non-viable in the first place. It is still a matter of choice, because the doctor can only recommend what they think should be done. Trust me, that word (this whole issue basically) has been pretty much shoved down my throat by my doctors for the past month, and I know a large percentage of doctors do recommend terminating the pregnancy if it is non-viable, but again, it is ultimately up to the woman in question . Also, it is legally covered in abortion laws; if it weren't, doctors wouldn't recommend it to their patients. \n I hope this clears it up for you..(?) Your question was a little confusing, and honestly I don't see how anyone could respond to your poll; it doesn't apply and we can't ourselves determine viability- that is something that medical professionals have to determine, and the 'true' definition of fetal viability is also better defined by the medical professional. \n \n [QUOTE=rapture]Toddler Homicide?( already legal)[QUOTE=rapture]\n \n What?

I find it eerie and disturbion.....\n\n \n \n Well, an abortion can't technically be called 'fetal homicide' because it isn't illegal... homicide is. If a woman kills her toddler, that is homicide, and it isn't legal, and I don't see how it ever could/would be... all murder is illegal, but to call an abortion murder is really only your personal opinion on the issue, because as of now it is a legal procedure. Some people consider it to be murder, and some don't.. it isn't an open and shut thing either way; if it were, there wouldn't be so much debate over it, and if it were considered to be murder all around, no questions, then it would not be legal. Maybe the laws will change someday, who knows.. but right now it's not illegal for a woman to have an abortion. You can call it a double standard, but again that is mainly just opinion.\n \n But I also have had friends who have had abortions because they didn't want to 'get fat'.. I know of one girl who had 7 by the time she was 22... that is pretty disturbing, and I don't think that it's really right to do it for reasons like that... like I said to her, if she were so afraid of getting pregnant, or getting 'fat', she should have either not had sex or she should have used protection... there are ways to prevent pregnancy, and birth control costs a hell of a lot less than an abortion (especially 7 times).. but at the same time I also had a friend who got pregnant, and got scared, and made an appointment to a clinic, and once she got there she didn't think she could go through with it, and now she has a healthy, adorable 5 year old and she is very thankful that she didn't have the abortion after all... but in the cases of my friends, all I could do was offer an opinion if they asked, but I didn't feel I had the right to tell them what to do either way.

The death penalty is a punishment set by governing laws based on religious belief. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and all that. If i steal 20 dollars from you, I am require to give you 20 dollars in return, not 150. If I take your life, then i'm required to give mine in return. Most of the time, the death penalty isn't near enough. They have killed sometimes dozens of lives and they only have one to return. It is also supposed to be a deterrent, but even that doesn't work, becuase ignorant people claim that it's racist or economically motivated. There is no reason a poor person or a person of color should have to kill someone. Murder is a solitary crime that isn't require to do for survival, or to feed yourself or your family. \n Second, the number of death row inmates innocently convicted is a tiny percentage. It does happen, but it is rare. There are always mistakes in a system run by men. We are a fallible people.

   " First of all, abortion has absolutely nothing to do with the death penalty.\n\n I agree. Abortion is a sad thing that some people have to do which fanatics try to make illegal, the death penalty is a legal things which states do which is morally reprehensible. However, when people say that they are against abortion because they believe the \"right to life\" is sacred, but support the death penalty, then they are morally inconsistent.\n \n \nIt is also supposed to be a deterrent, but even that doesn't work, becuase ignorant people claim that it's racist or economically motivated. \n\n The death penalty does not work as a deterrent, not because of people's analysis of it, but because it simply does not work. It may in fact increase the rate of violent crime.\n \n FBI Report Reveals Murder Rate Rise in the South\n According to the FBI's Preliminary Uniform Crime Report for 2002, the murder rate in the South increased by 2.1% while the murder rate in the Northeast decreased by almost 5%. The South accounts for 82% of all executions since 1976; the Northeast accounts for less than 1%. Read the report. (FBI Preliminary Uniform Crime Report 2002, June 16, 2003).\n \n Four new studies on deterrence throw further doubt that there is any deterrent effect from sentencing people to death or executing people for homicide. The studies did find support for a brutalization effect. (RECAP Newsletter, National Death Penalty Developments, 12/99)\n \n Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).\n \n Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma's Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998)).\n \n Effects of an Execution on Homicides in California. Author Ernie Thompson examined criminal homicides in Los Angeles before and after California's execution of Robert Harris in 1992, the state's first execution after a 25-year moratorium. Thompson found slight increases in homicides during the eight months following the execution. (3 Homicide Studies 129-150 (1999)).\n \n The Geography of Execution: The Capital Punishment Quagmire in America. Keith Harries and Derral Cheatwood studied differences in homicides and violent crime in 293 pairs of counties. Counties were matched in pairs based on geographic location, regional context, historical development, demographic and economic variables. The pairs shared a contiguous border, but differed on use of capital punishment. The authors found no support for a deterrent effect of capital punishment at the county level comparing matched counties inside and outside states with capital punishment, with and without a death row population, and with and without executions. The authors did find higher violent crime rates in death penalty counties. (Rowman and Littlefiled Publishers, Lanham, MD (1997))\n \n South Has Highest Murder Rate in 2001\n According to data released on October 28 as part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2001, the South again has the highest murder rate of the four regions in the United States. The South was also the only region above the national average. In 2001, almost 80% of executions in the country occurred in the South. The report noted that the Texas crime rate rose 4% in 2001, nearly five times the national average, and the state posted a 7.6% increase in homicides. At the same time, the total number of executions in Texas is more than three times that of any other state in the nation. The Northeast, the region with the lowest murder rate, had no executions in 2001. (See DPIC's Execution Statistics, Crime in the United States, 2001, New York Times and Houston Chronicle, October 29, 2002) \n REGION MURDER RATE PER 100,000 PEOPLE\n Northeast 4.2\n Midwest 5.3\n West 5.5\n South 6.7\n National 5.6\n - Crime in the United States, 2001\n \n Homicide Rates Fall in Canada After Abolition of Death Penalty\n The abolition of the death penalty in Canada in 1976 has not led to increased homicide rates. Statistics Canada reports that the number of homicides in Canada in 2001 (554) was 23% lower than the number of homicides in 1975 (721), the year before the death penalty was abolished. In addition, homicide rates in Canada are generally three times lower than homicide rates in the U.S., which uses the death penalty. For example, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the homicide rate in the U.S. in 1999 was 5.7 per 100,000 population and the rate in Canada was only 1.8. Canada currently sentences those convicted of murder to life sentences with parole eligibility. (Issues Direct.com, 8/4/02).\n \n \n Second, the number of death row inmates innocently convicted is a tiny percentage.\n\n Right, a few dead people is nothing to worry about?\n \n Especially if they're a few dead Black people....\n \n Amnesty Report Finds Racial Injustice in Death Penalty - According to a new report issued by Amnesty International, race continues to play a strong role in U.S. death penalty cases. In \"U.S.: Death by Discrimination - The Continuing Role of Race in Capital Cases,\" Amnesty states that:\n \n * Even though blacks and whites are murder victims in nearly equal numbers of crimes, 80% of people executed since the death penalty was reinstated have been executed for murders involving white victims.\n * More than 20% of black defendants who have been executed were convicted by all-white juries.\n \n The Federal Death Penalty System: A Statistical Survey (1988-2000) A review of the federal death penalty by the Justice Department, released on September 12, 2000, found numerous racial and geographic disparities. The report revealed that 80% of the cases submitted by federal prosecutors for death penalty review in the past five years have involved racial minorities as defendants. In more than half of those cases, the defendant was African-American. Attorney General Janet Reno said she was \"sorely troubled\" by the results of the report and has ordered United States attorneys to help explain the racial and ethnic disparities.\n The report also found that 40% of the 682 cases sent to the Justice Department for approval to seek the death penalty were filed by only five jurisdictions.\n \"I can't help but be both personally and professionally disturbed by the numbers that we discuss today,\" said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. \"[N]o one reading this report can help but be disturbed, troubled, by this disparity.\" Reno is expected to announce more studies of the administration of the federal death penalty. (New York Times, 9/12-13/00) \n \n In \"Why Do White Americans Support the Death Penalty?,\" American University researchers Joe Soss, Laura Langbein, and Alan Metelko examined whether racial attitudes play a role in white support for the death penalty. The researchers found that white support for the death penalty in the United States has strong ties to anti-black prejudice, and in some geographic areas racial prejudice emerges as the strongest predictor of white death penalty support. Soss, Joe, et al.: \"Why Do White Americans Support the Death Penalty? \"; 65 The Journal of Politics 397 (2003)\n \n \nThey have killed sometimes dozens of lives and they only have one to return.\n\n There is no evidence that people who get the death penalty depending on the number of people they killed. In fact it is sometimes the opposite, like in the case of Bush's Texas, where the only person granted clemency during his governance was the person who had committed by far the most heinous and numerous murders. This when there was a person who was a minor at the time of the alleged incident who was convicted on the basis of the testimony of a witness who supposedly identified him from thirty ft away at night from her car while in motion, or the man who was clearly \"mentally retarded\" and unable to understand not only his actions but the entire trial and even his death (when asked by guards if he wanted to finish his \"last supper\", he said he'd just finish it when he got back- from being executed), or the granny who killed her abusive husband in self-defense. No, they were all executed, but the man who serially raped and murdered several children was fully pardoned. There's \"an eye for an eye\" for you, in practice.",

   "It has always highlighted for me how much bunk the whole \"save the life\" line is when anti-abortionists are pro-death penalty. In particular, given how this process plays out in practice- that is, it is extremely racially and economically unbalanced, not to mention often disproportionate to the nature of the crime. In practice, people who die from d.p. have bad lawyers because they have less money, and could have not even been in the room when the murder occurred. \n \n\n \n I didn't catch that statement. That's usually not the case. Most strong pro-lifers, as myself, am also against the death penalty. The only reason why people associate pro-lifers with being pro-death penalty is because of the fact that most republicans are pro-life, and most republicans are also pro-death penalty. But that doesn't mean that most pro-lifers are pro-death penalty, espcially because most republicans are only partially against abortion. \n \n I mean, I could say it's the same with pro-choicers- they believe abortion is OK, but they beleive the death penalty is wrong.

If another person kills someone while both people are involved in a crime, both people can be charged equally guilty, even if one person wasn't in the room or the building at the time. If they have different lawyers, one person can get a far more serious charge despite having nothing to do with the murder itself.

Well, sex is not a crime, and pregnancy should not be a punishment.\n \n I don't think \"women shouldn't bear the burden because MEN can't\". I don't think they should bear the burden of a child unless they WANT a child.

However, I think you missed my point with the slaughtered cows concept. I can know perfectly well where my burger came from without graphic pictures of the slaughtering process. Under your logic, to really *know* where it came from, I should not only see pictures, but perhaps I should be required to go to the farm and stand close enough to get brains splattered on me as they blow it's brain out. Then I'll truly *know* where my burger comes from, eh? \n \n The truth is, information is out there about the development of a fetus into a born baby, and if they want to know from their doctor, you're right that they should get it. Everything should be available, especially if they don't know what they want to do. But what if they don't want to see what is inside them? If this is a medically necessary procedure, or if a women feels she cannot or does not want to raise a child, should they be *forced* to see bloody pictures that will just make the decision harder to face, no matter how necessary? I feel that it's cruel to do that.\n \n \n \nSo, your happiness is more important than a child's life?

It's still the woman's decision whether or not to have surgery, or at least it should be.

And unfortunately, the child pays for your irresponsible behavior.

Take a fetus at the same stage, and a woman who wants it has a child and the woman who doesn't has a blob of cells?

Maybe not the greatest analogy, but Good Lord, when tough decisions are made, you need to have ALL the information avaliable to make it wisely. It's much too easy for a woman to convince herself, based on all the propaganda out there, that it's not a child, so to see evidence to the contrary would mean she would feel guilt for going through with it, OR would actually have to sacrifice (YIKES, what a concept) and raise the child. And really now, if it's not a child, why would it BE such a tough decison anyway?\n \n \nHeh, probably better I don't know what you were going to say there. \n \n \n Yeah, probably LOL\n \n \nSo what if the man has financial responsibilties? \n \n \n Hey, that's one of the considerations your side sites frequently-MONEY.

Why limit ppl based on roles?\n \n \nOh, please, it's an easy way out\n\n That's a matter of opinion. It is definitely a consequence.

   "You DO have a tendency to dissect every word, well taught by your boy Clinton no doubt. \n\n This is hilarious! What makes you think I like Clinton? Is your political analysis really that simplistic?\n \n \nObviously I meant that women are behaving (is that a better word, I'm not a dictionary or a lawyer, sorry) like men. If I put on a dress and glide across a room, I'd be acting/behaving like a woman.\n\n Again, this part was clear. What makes no sense is the contradiction inherent in your position. If you believe that there is something essential (hence the term essentialist) about having particular genitalia which makes us behave in certain ways (\"like a woman\" or \"like a man\"), then how can a man/woman possibly act any other way? If the way we act is a part of our fundamental makeup, than we can't possibly act any other way. Therefore, if you, as a man, put on a dress and glide across the room, then you're acting like a man. There's no other possible way for you to act, is there?\n \n What you are talking about is men's and women's roles.\n \n \nWell, it sure has worked for thousands of years. What makes you think that you \"enlightened ones\" have the truth now? IF things were so wrong for those thousands of years, how do you explain the progress of society, not to mention the relative law and order that has accompanied it (yes I know, there were things done that were barbaric by our standards)\n\n First of all, your description of familial roles is inaccurate. You're talking about the nuclear family structure, which is largely a post WW2 invention. Most ppl prior to the baby boomers were farmers. Their work was largely near and around the home, and children were active participants in the household economy. Women were required to do heavy labor all the time, and men had to interact with and rear the children as well. Certainly some duties were gendered, but your idea of man at work and woman at home was not the general reality. \n \n Furthermore, women outside the upper class in urban centres have always had jobs. In my family, it is traditional for the mother to be working. To me, it would be going against tradition for me to have the privilege of not having to work at least one job while raising young children.\n \n Not to mention that you are arguing a logical fallacy; ad antiqarum. Just beacuse an idea is old, doesn't mean it's good. Just because it has worked in the past, doesn't make it necessary. Ppl have also been spinning their own clothing out of flax for thousands of years, and we managed to progress very well, why should we have changed that either? \n \n \nOkay now, thank you for proving my point. Women want to be promiscuous, but don't want the stigma.\n\n How is that a point? Why should \"promiscuity\" be stigmatized? \n \n \nWell, I will admit it's just my opinion and I have no actual numbers to back it up. However, don't you agree that a woman can go to an abortionist and say she was raped instead of admitting that she was just whoring around?\n\n Why say anything at all? She doesn't have to explain herself. What I'm saying is that many married men accompany their wives to get abortions. If they were all trying to conceal an affair-related pregnancy, that wouldn't make sense.\n \n \nYou seem to always attribute my belief to some sort of insecurity-another liberal way of attacking\n\n You set yourself up for it by what you say. Evidently I'm not the only one who sees it...\n \n \nIt's funny when you hear women say that thyey don't want to be called a slut-what IS a slut then?\n\n Slut is a pejorative. Ppl generally take offense when you call them things which have moral condemnations attached to them. \n \n Personally, however, I just think it's a pathetic attempt to police behavior.",

And their belief in God has nothing to do with it, it just IS-get over it. If dependency equates to something being a part of your body, then what do you call a 1 year old?\n\n \n You didn't read carefully enough. I didn't say dependency = part of your body, I said part of your body = dependency. A 1 year old has been born, so is not really a part of this discussion. A born baby you can put up for adoption if you have no desire to care for a child. What do you do with a month old fetus?\n \n You didn't answer the question. Who \"tasked\" women? Was there a meeting I missed? Who is it that said that all women must have children, that they have no choice in the matter?\n \n \n\n Well, in my opinion they are ****** and they need to grow up too. Like I said to jitobear, please read what I'm saying with an open mind and don't be bitter or angry. I have consistently stated that men who do not live up to their responsibilities are pieces of XXXX. Maybe what women need to do, since they ARE the ones who get pregnant, is learn how to judge character a little better so they aren't put in a position of having to raise a child on their own.\n\n \n Do even *you* know what you are talking about? When is this a discussion about if men leave women? Women in commited relationships *do* have abortions, you know, and don't have to have commited adultery. You're continual shifting to this point really makes it seem you have issues in your past you need to work out. If it isn't a medical issue (which I hope you don't disagree could *require* an abortion), then they don't want children. Yes they love their husbands. Yes their husbands love them. Yes they had sex, yes she got pregnant. Neither wants kids. She gets an abortion. Happens all the time.\n \n lol, you say don't be bitter or angry when you're the only one who comes across bitter and angry. Assuming men who are pro-choice are ****** is very bigoted of you. This next bit is retorical, so you don't have to reply, but you're view is very republican. You don't believe anyone can be altruistic, they always are looking out for themselves. Anyone who pretends otherwise is just trying to lower your guard, eh? Heaven forbid that I actually care about what happens to people, what their rights are. Bet you report your neighbors for 'suspicious activity' like Bush wants you to do\n \n \n \n\n God forbid you have responsibility for someone and it causes you to make a change in your life. Sounds pretty selfish to me. So, if your parents become a burden to you? What about all the useless blobs of flesh we see living off the government...AHHHHHHHHH but we should have pity for them right, despite them being a burden\n\n \n You know what? I agree with you. It is to a certain extent selfish, if it's done just because the woman doesn't want kids. I'm sorry to tell you, the world is full of selfish people. You should understand, you're one of them. If a woman is selfish, and doesn't want to share her life with little babies at this time in her life, do you really think that forcing her to have them will make everything better?\n \n And yes, people put their parents in homes when they don't want to deal with them. Yes, it's selfish. Would I do it? If I couldn't support them, it'd be my only option if they couldn't support themselves. That's life, I'm sorry.\n \n Alright, I think that's it for me. Maybe I'll read your reply, it's sure to give me a laugh.",

   "@syklopps61\n \n could you address this? i posted it in the other thread, but no-one seems to be able to get a handle on it.\n \n Through pregnancy the fetus USES the mothers internal organs to live. It is dependent on the mother to feed itself, it is dependent on the mother for immunity, it is dependent on the mother for excretion, breathing etc. This puts extra strain on the mothers body.\n \n To say that is the requirement of the mother to provide the use of her organs so that another person can live does not co-incide with modern day organ transplant choices. My son or daughter might be dependent on me to donate a kidney for his or her survival, but it does not make it a requirement for me to do so. Similiarly, although the fetus may wish for the mother to offer the use of her organs so that its condition might perpetuate until it becomes healthy and no longer requires them, it cannot make that a requirement.\n \n In otherwords, the argument that the fetus IS a human being than leads to the argument that no human being can require another human being to physically support them through involuntary use of their organs.",

   "Probably my last post in reply to you, since this has pretty much ceased to be a debate. \n \n \n OH DARN!! LOL\n \n \nI never said it wasn't a life. It is alive, it is human. Whether it is a person deserving full rights and privilages as a born person is what the question is, as well as when the bestowing should happen.\n\n \n And you have such faith in mankind that we can determine that, let alone that we even have the power to do that? \n \n \nStop putting words in my mouth.\n\n \n Well, you've done a pretty good job of doing it to me\n \n \nEh? For my gender? Does that mean if I'm not intellectually honest you look like a 2 year old? I have not seen them say negative things about men in general. I *have* seen them say negative things about you in particular, but not men in general. Yet I see you continually assuming (with no basis or reference) that all women who have abortions are sluts, and all men that are pro-choice are ******. Yeah, I think we can safely say that you have issues, while no-one else has been as negative.\n\n \n Anything for the \"team\", huh? Jitobear flat out admitted she has issues with men, making negative comments toward me, and yet you turn your head. Guess you have to sacrifice your integrity to go along with your sister in the fight\n \n \nWhat do you do with a month old fetus?\n\n \n uh, let it live?\n \n \nYou didn't answer the question. Who \"tasked\" women? Was there a meeting I missed? Who is it that said that all women must have children, that they have no choice in the matter?\n\n \n Oh, c'mon already, it was obvious I was stating that women have the biological ability to bear children and men don't, that is the \"cross\" you have to bear. Women of course, DO have the choice whether to have children or not, they don't HAVE to get pregnant-talk about putting words in someone's mouth\n \n \nDo even *you* know what you are talking about? When is this a discussion about if men leave women? Women in commited relationships *do* have abortions, you know, and don't have to have commited adultery. You're continual shifting to this point really makes it seem you have issues in your past you need to work out.

Yes they had sex, yes she got pregnant. Neither wants kids. She gets an abortion. Happens all the time.\n\n \n I'm fully aware that married couples do have abortions, I just don't think that it is as common as you would want us to believe. I believe that is the \"official\" story so that your cause seems more noble. You must admit, going on national tv saying that married couples want abortions sounds alot better than \"we want abortions so we can do what we want and because we are selfish\". It's for public consumption and to bring more supporters on board.\n \n \nyou say don't be bitter or angry when you're the only one who comes across bitter and angry\n\n \n It's clear that anyone disagreeing with your so called \"right\" would be perceived by you as being angry\n \n \nAssuming men who are pro-choice are ****** is very bigoted of you. \n \n \n I'll go even further, \"men\" who are liberals are ****** too! I won't retract either statement. The very nature of a liberal goes against the natural tendencies of a man-working hard, making his own way in the world, providing for and protecting. Men want some and these types think they have to go against their nature in order to get some. \n \n \nYou don't believe anyone can be altruistic, they always are looking out for themselves. Heaven forbid that I actually care about what happens to people, what their rights are.\n\n \n You ARE kidding, right? You are speaking about being altruistic in the same breath as admitting that a living thing inside of you should be destroyed because it is a nuisance. Truly amazing\n \n \nYou know what? I agree with you. It is to a certain extent selfish, if it's done just because the woman doesn't want kids. I'm sorry to tell you, the world is full of selfish people. \n \n \n I appreciate you admitting that, thank you. But just so I have a handle on this, could you put a percentage on that \"certain extent\" part? You have admitted that abortions ARE performed simply because the woman doesn't want kids (and throw out the miniscule amount that are performed for health reasons)\n \n \nYou should understand, you're one of them. If a woman is selfish, and doesn't want to share her life with little babies at this time in her life, do you really think that forcing her to have them will make everything better?\n\n \n That first sentence referencing selfishness. I'd love to know how you can determine how selfish I am in all these posts. As far as the rest of your response, is it possible for you to look beyond and see that your crusade could possibly have negative effects on society? I bet if we find an amoeba on Mars, you people would be running around screaming there is life on Mars, yet we have it everywhere around us here and you people could care less. And yes I know, it IS life, so don't try to make it appear that I'm inconsistent.\n \n \nAnd yes, people put their parents in homes when they don't want to deal with them. Yes, it's selfish. Would I do it? If I couldn't support them, it'd be my only option if they couldn't support themselves. That's life, I'm sorry.\n\n \n Why not just kill them though, afterall, they ARE a burden and produce nothing. It would make life SO much easier, wouldn't it?",

   "Thank you for making my point better than I could ever do!! It's all about you, right honey? I am woman hear me roar right? LMAO\n \n No, Read what I wrote again. I am capable of making my own choices. I have made millions of them in my life. In my life I chose to have a child and raise him alone. I chose to get a degree and a good job. I chose to buy a house. I chose to be a mom. This morning I chose a yogurt smoothie for breakfast.\n \n What is wrong with making my own damned decisions? I bet you do it - every single day. Shall I mock you for it? Explain to me how this is a character flaw. Please.\n \n And yes - I am a strong woman. With the choices I have made I have to be. What is wrong with that?\n \n I do have issues with men. Especially mysogonistic XXXXXX on BnB boards thinking they know anything about me. \n \n ROTFLMAO, I don't even have to say a word, you are doing quite well yourself!!\n \n This was plain and simple me insulting you, personally. Clearly you didn't get it, Einstein. (That \"Einstein\" but was sarcams by the way.)\n \n Say what you want. But I will tell you when you are talking out of your rear. Which is has been most of the time in this argument. \n \n THAT was a good response, when I make a point, dismiss it and move on\n \n If I think your point is bunk, you can bet your hands I will dismiss it.\n \n You are right. That fact that it is her body gives her the right. \n \n And YOU are wrong! You, by nature, have been tasked with giving birth, so that child within you is NOT YOUR body, no matter how you slice it, it isn't. Lie to yourself all you want so you can sleep well, but it's not\n \n I, by nature, have been given the ability to give birth. Whether or not I will choose do so is a whole other matter. You see, that child can't live without my body. Use of my body requires my consent.\n \n You are so consumed with jealousy that you just can't see the truth!! LOL  \n \n No I am not and I will ask you to refrain from telling me how I feel.\n \n AGAIN, my point is made, abortion to you IS to do what you want without consequences.  \n \n No abortion is the end of a life. A sad sad circumstance. I hate that people are irresponsible with it. But that does not mean I get to make choices for them.\n \n SOMEbody has to be responsible when a woman gets pregnant, and if the woman was stupid enough to get pregnant with a guy she barely knows, or has a poor judge of character, and she has the child inside of her (again, not part of your body, sorry), then naturally the responsibility falls on the woman.  \n \n This I save for later.\n \n If you could get past your resentment of men, I am criticizing men equally-they shouldn't be such wusses to abandon the woman, but the woman also has blame too.  \n \n But if they do, so be it. You don't mock them or what to legalize their behavior. They can make bad choices if they want. Since nature endowed them with a dick, they get to behave like one, eh?\n \n Because you don't feel that it needs to be shared by men. \n \n I'm sorry, despite whatever fancy words you want to use, you have to be missing a chromosome or something. I have never said that men shouldn't share in the responsibility. Short of chopping up what I say, I want to see a quote, or anything even close to what you accuse me of saying\n \n Here I quote YOU:\n \n \"SOMEbody has to be responsible when a woman gets pregnant, and if the woman was stupid enough to get pregnant with a guy she barely knows, or has a poor judge of character, and she has the child inside of her (again, not part of your body, sorry), then naturally the responsibility falls on the woman\"\n \n And if the child is unwanted, don't do the act! Remember biology, it DOES only take one time!!  \n \n Good suggestion! I think all women who want to make their own choices should stop having sex altogether and just leave you boys to each other.\n \n But see, that gets back to it \"just isn't fair, men can do it, why can't we, waaaa\". Now, dry your snot and run along and play\n \n Hey big strong man, think you can find the balls to talk to me like an adult?\n \n And let me state for the record, I have never had an abortion, nor would I unless it were rape or a serious health matter. But I made that choice all by myself. \n \n BLAH BLAH BLAH, that's what every woman says who supports \"pro-choice\". Give me a break, I wonder who has had the millions of abortions then\n \n You know, I don't really think you are a responsible man who takes care of his responsibilities.

You NEVER suggest putting a strangle-hold on the choices of men, nor would you.\n \n Hey big strong man, think you can find the ***** to talk to me like an adult? \n \n Well little lady, when you act like one I'll be glad to treat you like one LOL\n \n aaaaah - so the answer is no\n \n You know, I don't really think you are a responsible man who takes care of his responsibilities. I bet you just screw around and never pay child support \n \n Of course you don't, because you think all men are the same like that scum that left you. Funny how, here I am, a man who is NOT running and behaving like a pig, and yet I am loathed by you. You really do need to sort out some issues.\n \n WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!!!! (see below)\n \n And why is it that men always assume that we women were abandonded? I threw his butt out - and had good reason. And I do not need his money. He has, however, shirked his responsibilities to his son.\n \n And enough of the delusions arleady - I don't loathe you. I don't like you, but loathing requires more energy than I am willing to focus on a mere stranger. And you are behaving like a pig. I am truly glad you care for and support your children - many men don't. But your attitude towards women is terrible - condescending and mocking. Women are not children. I hope you don't have daughters.\n \n Oh, and when you lie, I will call you a liar, you betcha\n \n What did I lie about?\n \n I told you that I have never had an abortion and I told you the circumstances in which I would have one - and you pretty much called me a liar. So I said that you did not really care for your kids to give you a taste of your own medicine. I actually believe you that you do what you say. \n \n Mister do the right thing - are false accusations \"the right thing\"?",

   "From you.\n\n \n I have to admit, good come back LOL\n \n \nI have what's called responsibility, and you are advocating lack of same.  \n \n No I am not. \n \n \n Do you feel that people who commit crimes should accept the punishment they receive?\n \n \nI am saying others don't get to make them for me.\n \n \n Well, we are bombarded everyday with choices that are made for us, I don't feel helpless because of that. There are even some laws that I don't particularly care for, but the government has decided FOR me that they are not to be tolerated. Part of life\n \n \nGoody for you. Say what you want. Maybe I even agree with you that this is what she should do. However, when you start legalizing things like birth control or abortion she is longer able to do a damned thing because strangers have made that impossible.\n\n \n Okay now, that \"ggody for you\" was OOZING with sarcasm, wasn't it? LOL I'm glad you agree that the woman SHOULD do the responsible thing. MEDICALLY necessary abortions are generally accepted by people from my side, it's the OTHERS that are the center of the argument (as far as I'M concerned). There are much better, more reliable methods of contraception now available for women to prevent pregnancy\n \n \nYou could have fooled me with your snotty \"I am woman hear me roar\" remark. Seems to me that you don't think should be strong and that you find it it amusing when they are.\n\n \n C'mon, that was a good one!! :-D My wife happens to be spunky as hell and I like it believe it or not. I don't believe in treating women like second class citizens. It may be hard for you to believe, but I have more respect for women than you could even fathom. I've never felt they should bow down to anybody. The problem I have with this issue is that many women have turned it into a WE vs.THEM kinda thing, and it's just not necessary. JUST because a man doesn't believe in abortion, doesn't mean he is advocating the slavery of women, bu the leaders of your movement strongly believe that, and sadly, many of you do too.\n \n \nI can quite comfortably say that I don't like you much.\n\n \n AWWWWWWWW DARN, I was SO hoping I could get you to like me LMAO Anyway, that sure was an awfully strong thing to say, don't you think?\n \n \nDisagreeing with you does not equate mental illness. How delusional! (which is a symptom of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders....)\n\n \n Are you saying what I THINK you're saying? LOL\n \n \nNot true. There are ways of determining when a woman is ovulating. There are also ways of stopping pregnancy.\n\n \n Ovulation only gives you a better CHANCE of becoming pregnant, doesn't predict that you WILL be. \n \n \nI note you don't respond to second part of my statement\n.\n \n Well, it's kinda tough to respond to every word, but if you'd like to restate I'll certainly give it every consideration\n \n \nNo. Because it is relevant. If men and women are both promiscuous you insult both but only really only hold one accountable. You NEVER suggest putting a strangle-hold on the choices of men, nor would you.\n\n \n Once again, not reading close enough. Because a woman sleeps with a guy she doesn't know and gets pregnant, there is but ONE person that CAN be responsible. Now, if womoen were a bit more selective and got to know a man first, who he is, what his character is, then he TOO wouold be responsible for the child, Even if no marriage occurred, you would know who he is and force, through the courts if necessary, him to have some responsibility. \n \n \naaaaah - so the answer is no\n\n \n until you behave like one :-D\n \n \nWhat did I lie about? I told you that I have never had an abortion and I told you the circumstances in which I would have one - and you pretty much called me a liar. So I said that you did not really care for your kids to give you a taste of your own medicine. I actually believe you that you do what you say. \n \n \n Okay, you have a point. I reread my post. Actually, I didn't really mean it specifically about YOU, but that IS the thing that women say, and I was just noting that if all/most women say that, then who is having all those abortions? So, I do apologize if it appeared as if I was calling you a liar",

   "Please don't try to appear to be openminded-that you would actually listen to anyone that disagrees with you? Sorry, not buying it.\n \n\n \n Merely reading anything you have said up to this point requires an open mind. Your \"I'm right, you must be wrong\" attitude indicates you are the closed-minded one.\n \n \nYou sure do have a high opinion of yourself, huh? First of all, I work and had no time to address your post, I can only address one ignoramus at a time. \n\n \n I work as well. It merely appears that in your rush to flame people, you forgot to address a coherent point. How is my post any less high-minded than any of yours? BTW, congratulations on using the word \"ignoramus\".\n \n \nPerhaps no one has addressed your theory because it's absurd, to say a woman is FORCED to share her organs when pregnant? Organs do what they are put there to do, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n \n How is it absurd? Some evidence? Does she have a CHOICE to share her organs? If there is no CHOICE, their is no DECISION, therefore she is FORCED.\n \n \nIs that all you do all day is think up this stuff?\n\n \n No. I work as well and spend only a small portion of time on forums such as these.\n \n \nIf I'm not mistaken, the only thing actually attached to the fetus is the placenta. Surely the fetus extracts oxygen and nutients from the mothers blood, but no organs are attached.\n\n \n So you are suggesting that if we take away all the mothers organs except the placenta and her blood, the fetus will live? Now that is absurd.\n \n How do the nutrients and oxygen get into the mothers blood? Why do fetii die after an abortion? They die because they require the mothers organs to live. Reason? Their organs are not fully formed yet.\n \n \nDo you have a problem with organ donation, blood transfusions, other medical procedures that are \"forced\" on you and I to save our lives?\n\n \n I would if the donor were REQUIRED to donate their organs for my use. Notice that all organ donation and blood donation are VOLUNTARY, which means that you are not REQUIRED to donate.\n \n You can either accept that a fetus is a human being, in which case it does not have the right to require the use of her organs, OR you can accept that a fetus is not a human being, in which case it is not murder to remove it.\n \n \nThere are things that just ARE, can't fight or change them. \n\n \n Obviously, your opinion is one of them.\n \n \nIs this an attempt to make it appear as if I'M inconsistent? If that be the case, then join the club because you should be against abortions then, using this logic, so don't use it to impugn me\n\n \n I am merely pointing out the inconsistency of your assertion, whether you interpret that as inconsistency in your position is up to you. \n \n Why do you assume I am left wing? How does this logic force me into an anti-abortion position? Please read with an open-mind.\n \n Bring on the flames, any substance would appreciated however.\n \n WT",

   "Worldtraveler,\n I'll take this opportunity to apologize for my sarcasm. I guess I was kinda fired up dealing with others. I WILL say however, that if we take the time, we can over analyze everything. That's why I said your assertion was absurd-that's the way pregnancy works. If there are any better suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I would ask you, when a child is in the mother, does it not require her organs to survive up until the second it is born? If that be the case, then we get into the age old argument (for those on the left) of when does a child become a child? When it is actually born? If so, abortions for everyone whenever you like! I had a Liberal friend who looked at it from an environment point of view (somewhat similar to what you are saying), in that outside of the mothers womb (the fetus' environment) the fetus cannot survive, therefore it is not a living thing. Other than the obvious that if something cannot survive, it must be alive to begin with, this is totally absurd because WE can't live outside of OUR environment without assistance, so are WE not alive? We depend on nutrition from other living things to survive, are we not alive? It's just the way it works. My kids ask why do we have to eat (and on and on but why, but why....)-it IS just the way it is. \n \n In summary, if I understand your point, you are saying that the fetus is not alive until birth. I'm not a Biology expert, but I DO recall there is no such thing as spontaneous life-it doesn't just appear out of nowhere. So, please tell me, where does life begin then?",

   "I also apologize for my sarcasm.\n \n The central point of my argument is against the idea that it is murder. For it to be murder, the fetus has to be considered a \"person\". My belief is that it is \"life\" from conception (Life being defined in human form as a cluster of diploid cells), but it is not a \"person\" until it can support itself free from its mother (which it cannot until late stages of the pregnancy, aborting a pregnancy in late stages without taking every necessary precaution to preserve BOTH lives should be illegal)\n \n IF you consider it a person before then, my point about forced use of organs becomes valid, if you do not, it isn't murder.\n \n This is not a legal issue, it is a moral issue, which is why I presented that argument, as proof that if you oppose it on a legal standpoint, your opposition falls down. Abortion is entirely legal under our current laws, and it would require a significant change in those laws to make it illegal. These changes would also reflect on organ transplants. So when asking about the legality of it, you must also consider whether you would be willing to write allow that allows the government to force you to donate a kidney or a lung or even blood. I believe that all those choices should be voluntary.\n \n So let us focus more on the moral issue. If we agree the life begins at conception, than should the morning after pill be labelled morally corrupt? Is it child abuse to drink and smoke while pregnant? What if you don't know you are pregnant at the time? Do we refer to miscarraiges as accidental manslaughter? Is it murder when artificially fertilized eggs are implanted into the uterine lining (the success rate is not 100% which means that you have virtually guaranteed the \"death\" of a \"living being\")? Maybe the question should not be when does \"life\" begin, but when does \"viable life\" begin. What is defined as \"viable life\"? For me, viable life is when you are not physically required to use the body systems of another living organism to survive; refer back to my original argument for why abortion under these definitions is not morally corrupt.\n \n No matter what happens, some people will view the choice to abort pregnancy as morally corrupt, however in a democracy it is the will of the majority that governs what is or is not socially acceptable. I think it would be interesting to see what would happen if the issue of abortion was put to a national referendum. \n \n It is my hope that technology will provide an alternative to abortion which allows fetii to survive outside the womb or a more effective form of contraception outside of abstinence, so the argument can be dropped.",

   "Skylopp - \n \n I don't want to keep arguing with you, mostly because I think we agree more than don't agree.\n \n We both see abortion as a sad thing and the end of a life. I think we both agree that there may even be situations where it is acceptable (rape, incest, health of mother). I think we both find irresponsibility abhorrant - whether that be in the form of promiscuity, using abortion as birth control or abandoning children.\n \n Where we disagree is whether or not law/government should be involved. You say 'yes' - and I can understand why. I say 'no'. \n \n Not having control over ones body is the most horrible feeling in the world. Historically women have had to fight hard to be able to rule themselves. We had to fight to vote, to get equal wages, to be able to own property, to not be sold into marriage by our parents.\n \n My grandmother was married to an abuser who would not work, and in that time she could not just divorce him. He quite likely molested his older daughters. They lived in a one room shack. Babies that they could not afford kept on coming. She tried to get birth control and was not allowed without his permission. Here is a woman, dirt poor, raising 11 children, with an abuser and a molester that she could not say 'no' to (no such thing as spousal rape back then), she could not leave (no domestic violence support back then either) and he had the control of her very life and body. And that control was legally protected.\n \n My mother decided that three children were enough. Her last pregnancy came with complications and my little brother nearly did not make it. She wanted her tubes tied. They would not perform the surgery without my father's permission, which was only gained by my mother's doctor lieing to my father that she could not have more successful pregnancies. My father eventually left us all and stayed absent from the lives of his children for more than ten years, and this man had control over my mother's body - and that was legally protected.\n \n I myself have been raped and abused, and although neither of these things are legal now, I do know what it is like to not have control of my own body.\n \n No matter how I feel about abortion, I will not budge one inch backwards on this. My body, my life, my choice. Even if it's a bad choice. I hope you understand what pro-choice means to me, now.\n \n \n I also don't think that making it illegal will do any good. It will just mean more unwanted babies, unhealthy babies due to unhealthy pregnancies, and back-alley abortions that butcher mother and child. The best way to stop abortion is to instill responsibility, educate educate EDUCATE, and effective, available birth control. Forcing pregnancy will not fix the problem.\n \n \n To your \"where does life begin?\" question. Here is strictly biological thought. Look at the other end of life. The body can still be functioning, but if there is brain death the individual is considered dead. Maybe life begins with a brain, and self-awareness. I honestly can't answer your question and I do not know that man kind ever will. But this was a thought.",

   "Jitobear,\n I think you're right, we do agree more than disagree. I have to admit I was bothered by your post. Although I am basically an old-fashioned type of guy, I find the behavior your described to be disgusting, both that which was perpetrated on your grandmother and your mother and/or her sisters by your grandfather. And I am sorry to hear that you were the victim of a rape. I can't imagine what you went through, but it is certainly a testament to your strength that you have apparently survived it rather well-I applaud you. I could not agree with you more that women throughout history have not been treated well (to put it mildly). I do have two daughters and have, and will continue to, instill in them that no man should ever lay a hand on them, he has no right. I was lucky enough to have a father that also loves and respects his wife and he taught me well. MY wife has even said that she has given me reason to hit her and wondered why I never have-there is NEVER a reason for a man to hit a woman, OR to force himself on her. \n \n Anyway, I'm glad you sent this most recent post so that I am able to understand your views better. I hope that you can see that my position is not one that embraces keeping a woman enslaved to a man's whim. Despite being a very conservative person (saying this because conservatives tend to be labeled a certain way), I find joy in all life (human and animal) and find the unnecessary taking of life to be repugnant (I even teach my kids not to go out of their way to kill even a bug-go figure LOL).\n \n SO....TRUCE?

   "I must admit that I didn't get your point\n\n \n To clarify, murder is the unprovoked killing of another human being. If the fetus is not considered a human being than it is not murder.
