   "I was hoping it would be France or Germany someone like that. I agree with you 100% (I find myself agreeing with you alot) I think we should go in and find terrorist and I also think we should strike first. What good comes from letting them hit and kill Americans before we hit them. The way I see it and I know a tounge lashing is probably going to come from this, if we have to take every life in Iraq to save one innocent American then I think it is a good trade.\n \n GOD BLESS AMERICA!",
