   "Maybe you all didn't actually read the case. It wasn't so much a doctor killing someone else but it was doctor prescribing a drug that is listed on the CSA list of drugs. The drugs were presecribed as an overdose and thus would kill the patient that wanted to die. \n \n The ruling was surely inconsisent with previous rulings of the court (not that has ever mattered to SCOTUS) and it had some other complicated issues.\n While assisted suicide is a state issue (as said in previous court cases --see Auer case) it seems that the CSA can regulate certain drugs and the purposes for them....the attnory general is allowed to decide a purpose as well. The CSA is the will of the people just as much as a Oregon law is. Some of you claim that the SCOTUS didn't make law in this case but they did...they reinvented the CSA in order to give Oregon their law. \n \n Read the case first before you decide anything about it...it is long but atleast you might understand it.\n \n http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/17jan20061050/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/04-623.pdf",

   "I had a different take on the ruling. Without legal boilerplate, SCOTUS upheld the 9th district ruling that the practice of medicine is a states right not to be confused with or subjected to federal statue and regulatory procedures regarding controlled drugs and the purpose of those statutes and regulation. \n \n This issue began when Ashcroft transferred his senatorial drive against assisted suicide to the AG platform. His record in Missouri and personal beliefs speak for themselves. \n \n Medical marijuana in CA fell under that infamous catchall of interstate commerce and will be revisited.",
