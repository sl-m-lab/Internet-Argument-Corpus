   "I don't want to go off-topic, so if you want we can start a new thread... but didn't the Catholic Church 'develop new dogma' with the Immaculate Conception?\n\n I don't want to go off topic either so I will give a short reply. You can start a new thread if you like or revive an old one. I believe we've discussed this previously.\n \n Modern Catholics did not invent the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, nor did the Pope. \n \n St. Augustine wrote this in the 4th century, \"When it is a matter of sin we must except the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I will have no question raised, owing to the honor due to Our Lord.\" \n \n St. Ephrem (4th Century) also taught the Immaculate Conception.\n \n When the dogma was defined in 1854, a new truth was not added to the Revelation but it was defined that this teaching was always a part of the original revelation. Often a dogma is believed for years before it is defined and often it is only officially defined due to circumstances/challenges surrounding the belief.\n \n God made Adam and Eve \"perfect and holy.\" Consider the fact that Mary is the new Eve. Why? Because God said in Genesis 3 that Eve's offspring and the serpent's would live with enmity between them. Eve's seed would bruise the head of the serpent (as you also mentioned in your letter when writing on Purgatory). Mary's seed is Christ, who crushed the head of the serpent because he destroyed death with his gift of grace. He destroyed Satan's work. Mary was created perfect and holy like Eve. Eve welcomed death into the world at the tree in Eden. Mary welcomed eternal life through her son at the tree (crucifix) on Golgotha. Eve rejected God and welcomed sin into the world. Mary rejected sin and welcomed God into the world. Mary chose not to sin by cooperating with the grace of God when she said, \"I am the handmaid of the Lord. Be it done to me according to your will.\" Again the Old Testament imperfectly foreshadows the New Testament perfection. Mary was \"full of grace.\"Only Jesus is spoken of in this manner. (Look into the use of the word kecharitomene in Luke 1:28).\n \n Have you come up with any ideas on what Paul meant by referring to \"the Day\" in the cntext of 1 Corinthians 2:11-15  that I quoted earlier?\n \n What happens if one commits a sin that is not necessarily mortal and then dies without repenting? Is his soul forfeit or does he have a chance at salvation?\n \n What do you think of Matthew 5:26  in reference to Purgatory?",

   "Originally posted by BigOrn:\n Is it possible for you to give us the passage(s) of scripture that leads you to believe in purgatory?\n\n \n \nOriginally posted by jitobear:\n I have often wondered where in the world purgutory comes from!!!! Never read a thing in the Bible to support it.\n\n \n BigOrn, \n I will give it a shot in ProBush's absence.\n \n Jito,\n Hopefully this will help you find purgatory in scripture.\n \n (Although--to both of you--finding everything in scripture is not necessary--one must also consider Holy Tradition and the teaching authority of the Church--Peace.)\n \n Here's my take on Purgatory from another debate I had with someone:\n \n If you can understand that we can take action to cooperate or to deny God then it is easier to understand Purgatory. We can also take action to intercede for others. Realize that Purgatory has little to do with salvation. All of the souls of Purgatory will get to heaven. They are all saved (1 John 5:17, not all sin is mortal that will cause the person to go to hell, yet they can't go to heaven with lesser sins due to the necessity of perfection and purity before entering heaven). In Purgatory, although souls are already saved, they must be purified because Jesus says in Mark 9:49  that \"everyone will be salted with fire.\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 3 is a good illustration of purgatory. Paul wrote, \"...I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.\" Then he speaks of the fact that \"any man's\" work will be put to the test. But there are numerous other indications in scripture of an intermediate state prior to heaven (1 Peter 3:19  shows that an intermediate state (though not Purgatory in this passage) is not only a possibility but also a reality). The doctrine of Purgatory rests on the fact that nothing unclean can enter heaven. But, wait a minute, is God asking of us something that we cannot give him? The catholic would say, no.\"The Book of Revelation in Chapter 21 states that God does not want the filth of sin in heaven for it says, \"But nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood...\" So can one enter heaven unclean in a cloak of righteousness? It seems that the uncleanness is still there but it is covered up and hidden. God does not hide things. He brings them to the light. God's goodness is pure and undefiled through and through. So too, if we are to go to heaven we must be pure and undefiled. We will be pure and good if we reach heaven as we see in Revelation. Hebrews 12:14  also speaks of this, \"Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\" Hebrews 12:23  tells us that the \"just men will be made perfect.\" The Gospels tell us to be perfect, as our Father is perfect.\n \n Many say that there is one mediator between God and man and that is Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5). However, if you look at the first line of chapter 2 of 1 Timothy-a few lines above the mediator quote, you read, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men...This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour...\" Why does Paul ask that we pray and make supplication for others if Jesus' work is finished? Jesus' work is once and for all but also perpetual and on going since the time of the crucifixion. It is outside of the boundary of time and is eternal. But what good will our prayers do if Jesus' mediation excludes our intercession and action? Jesus is the primary mediator but others can intercede (Colossians 1:24, 1 Corinthians 3:9). This is the basis for Catholics praying for the intercession of Mary and the Saints. This is the basis for Catholics praying for the souls in purgatory. We pray for others to intercede and pray for us through Jesus. And it is readily evident that the prayers of the saints and of righteous men have power (Romans 15:30, Ephesians 6:18-19, James 5:16, Revelation 5:8, Revelation 8:3-4) Pay close attention to the quotes from Revelation 5 and 8 if you think praying to saints is lacking understanding of the mediator!\n \n Consider also that Paul prays for his dead friend Onesiphorus in 2 Timothy 1:16-18. Why does Paul pray for a dead man if he is already in heaven? No prayers can help him if he is in hell because it is eternal. The Old Testament scripture that foreshadows the New Testament Purgatory is evident. It has been deleted from your protestant Bibles by Martin Luther because it did not gel with his theories though. If you can view a Catholic bible there should be one on-line somewhere (possibly at www.newadvent.org) then look up 2 Maccabees 12: 44-46  to see that the sins of the dead can be atoned. Jesus himself alludes to this in Matthew 12:32 when he speaks of forgiveness in this age or the next. And he again alludes to this in Matthew 5:26  and 12:36.\n \n Do not get caught up in the fact that the word Purgatory is not in scripture. This is just a name given to the intermediate state by the Church. When you consider this, remember also that the word Trinity and Incarnation cannot be found in scripture. Yet many Christians have no trouble in believing in either of these doctrines.",

I believe we've discussed this previously.\n \n Modern Catholics did not invent the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, nor did the Pope. \n \n St. Augustine wrote this in the 4th century, \"When it is a matter of sin we must except the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I will have no question raised, owing to the honor due to Our Lord.\" \n \n St. Ephrem (4th Century) also taught the Immaculate Conception.\n \n\n \n Do you have a reference for St. Epheraim the Syrian?\n \n Also, there is nothing in what you state about St.Augustine's quote that implies 'Immaculate Conception' at all.\n \n I simply says that she is without sin, which is what we Orthodox belive - that she was made 'sinless' through Jesus Christ.\n \n Though it doesn't support our stance either, I state our stance to show that you can have many different ideas that aren't contradicted or supported by that quote from Blessed Augustine.",

We submit to the Word. \n \n You make the erroneous assumption that because one believes in hell then his faith can be reduced to the simplicity of fear. This is not so. A Christian fears God the way he fears the discipline of a loving father because God is our loving Father. (Psalm 111:10  \"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.\") \n \n But because we have fear in the Lord, all of our other fears are powerless (Isaiah 43:1 \"But now, this is what the LORD says- he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: \"Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine\"). \n \n Do you think that there is no justice in the concept of hell? What if someone, of his own free will, murders a human being...a human being created in the image of God...a unique being the likes of which has never and will never live again throughout eternity? What if he snuffs out their one chance at earthly life? What if someone serially murders unique individuals, denying the will of God? What about murdering helpless children, etc.? I can never say who will go to hell. I can never say that even the most wretched sinner does not have a chance at heaven. But I can say that there are instances when people deny the will of God and might be deserving of hell. We live in a world of good and evil, not simply good.",

Did Jesus allow people to figure out his dogma or did he state it unequivocally? Truth is outside of one person's \"filter.\"\n \n \nThey are talking about prophecy here. Where have I disclaimed any prophecy?\n\n Prophecy yes and it applies to scripture as well. If we have everyone interpreting for themselves then we end up with over 30,000 Christian denominations as we have today. But Christ said that there would be one flock (John 10:16). Paul echoes this (Ephesians 4:3-6, Phillipians 2:2).\n \n What church on earth demonstrates to you most clearly the unity, universality, and consistency that is to be expected of the Church started by Jesus? (Matthew 16:18)\n \n \nBut just what is the THE church? I don't even think all Bibles use the word church here. There are thousands of churches. Not all of them agree on everything.

The critical belief is that we know what Christ's blood purchased, and that believing that is paramount. We are never gonna stop quibbling on the details. And I am sure I am wrong about a lot of stuff, as are you.\n\n THE Church is the one started by Jesus (Matthew 16:18). The Church is marked by its unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. \n \n \nWe are imperfect after all. :)\n\n We are but the Church started by Jesus is not. Jesus told us that it would be guided into all the truth (John 16:13) and that the powers of hell would never prevail against it (Matthew 16:18). The Church started by Jesus speaks with his voice (Luke 10:16) and legislates with his power (Matthew 28:18-20).\n \n \nI think it is what it should be, and is in some pockets. But there is far too much self-righteous finger pointing in every church. So much worrying about the splinter in your brother's eye. All these people who love Christ hating each other. I would think it would make him cry.\n\n In this you may be right. There is a saying that Catholic apologists use, \"Don't leave Peter because of Judas.\" It means that one should not leave the faithful Peter (don't leave the Church) because of sinners like Judas. One should not only judge a church by its sinners but by the good, holy people present as well. We can't let the behavior of others lead us astray.\n \n \nI do not wish to worship alone - but every church I have been in makes me mad and sad.\n\n I am sorry for that. I hope you find a church that will help you to grow spiritually and offer you good fellowship. I hope that you will continue your journey.\n \n \nIt is a collection of Jewish and Christian writings. What is in the Bible Canon was determined by the early Catholic church. I know that. I also know that the Catholic church is the oldest and has the historical ties to the earliest Christian congregations.\n\n So you accept the Bible put together by the Catholic Church (Protestant Bibles have the same New Testament)? You accept the Church's ability and authority to determine which books would be kept and which would be excluded. Yet you won't accept their authority to interpret the book it put together? You won't accept the authority of the Church Christ started to convey the teachings of Christ?\n \n \nRegarding John 10 in your next post.\n \n I think it goes along with his saying things like \"if you do this to the littlest of these, you also do it to me\". It is an attachment, a loyalty, like parent to child. If one were to hurt my son, they awould hurt me. But we are distinct - as I believe are God and Christ.\n\n \nQuestion for you? Why would he pray to himself?\n\n Because God is three persons in one essence. The Son prays to the Father. The Trinity is a Christian mystery and no one is able to fully explain it but it can be found in scripture. Many things that are not mentioned specifically by name can be found in scripture and in Christian teaching in general. The Christians closest to the time of Christ believed in the Trinity.",

The Trinity is like 1 x 1 x 1, they are one.\n \n That is why they are continually referred to, together...\n \n Jesus said John 10\n 38\n But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\"\n \n They are of one accord...\n John 5\n 21\n For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.\n \n Jesus is equal to God\n Colossians 1\n 19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n Jesus has the power and wisdom of God\n 1 Cor 1\n 24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Jesus Himself commanded\n Matthew 28\n 19\n \n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \n \"In this passage, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are said to share one name (notice that the term \"name\" is singular, not plural), and that name is almost certainly Yahweh, the personal name of God in the Bible. We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. \n \n Peter tells us, \"David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is \"the Lord\" who speaks to \"my Lord,\" Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, \"Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. \n \n In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: \"[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\" This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: \"I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? \" Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will \"confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh.\" The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). \n \n Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh (\"I AM,\" in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\" His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. \"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple\" (John 8:59). \n \n With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. \n \n The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).\"\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp\n \n Which is why the Apostles addressed letter by reference to the three...\n 2 Corinthians 13\n 14\n May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n \n The early Christians understood this... just look at what was written BEFORE the Bible was codified...\n Thus the Didache* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...\n 7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.\n 7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise {in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit} in living (running) water.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n Ignatius...\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n by mentioning them together.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith\n and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n God and Jesus, Jesus and God. He says Jesus is the only Son of God, no mention that Satan is a co-creation equal to Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God, He is also God.\n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n That is, unity of the community, of the church, of Christ with God.\n \n But also 'three' comes up so many times,\n Further in his Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 19\n 19:1 And hidden from the prince of this world were the virginity of Mary and her child-bearing and likewise also the death of the Lord -- three mysteries to be cried aloud -- the which were wrought in the silence of God.\n Ibid\n \"The episkopoi's immediate subordinates were the `presbyteroi' and the `diakonoi' who together with him constituted the higher Kleroi, a trinity if you will: the Father (episkopos), Son (diakonos) and spirit-filled apostolic council (presbyteroi)\"\n http://www.thecosmiccontext.de/chri.../Ignatius1.html\n As stated earlier, the organisation of the Church reflected the triune nature of God. One Church, three offices of clergy.\n \n This reflects the passages in Scripture that say that Jesus was with the fullness of God, that is, they are united, and they are equal.\n 1 Cor 1\n 24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n sus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held.\n \n Jesus and God are united\n Recall my quote....\n Ignatius' Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n \nMy apologies.\n\n \n \nWhat is that supposed to mean? I love being a broad. \n\n \n My apologies were for assuming you were a bloke.\n \n \nWhy not? Why do you believe then that you should measure yourself against Jewish teaching? \n\n \n \nI don't measure myself against it. Have you actually been reading my posts? I compare Christian beliefs that don't have to do with Christ being the Messiah (as clearly they will part there) against them. Same God, same death, same promises, same history, etc. If the Jews don't believe something that is still relevant we should ask why.\n Or are you one of those who denies the Jewishness of Christianity? \n\n \n I acknowledge the Christianity of Christianity.\n \n \nSo which Jewish teachings do you follow, or try to follow? And why those? \n\n \n \nLet me state this again and I will use simple one syllable words so as to be clear.\n \n I AM NOT A JEW.\n\n \n Yet you seem to suggest that only Jewish things are acceptable.\n Post 46\n \nI tend to smell test my beliefs against Jewish beliefs. Judaism is the foundation of Christian faith and Christ was a Jew. The difference that exists between us is believing that Christ is the messiah. The Jews did not have a triune god or hell. That speaks volumes - and for me has more validity than the Pope.\n\n \n \nI simply consider their beliefs as part of my study as a Christian. The relevance is obvious to me.\n\n \n \nWe are followers of Christ's teachings. \n\n \n \nAnd point out to me where he blew of (sic) Hebrew scripture and beliefs? Every time he said \"it is written\" what do you suppose he was talking about? It certainly wasn't the writing that came after his death (not that I negate those - I am just trying to point out the obvious here - 3/4 of the Bible is Jewish). \n\n \n Jesus came to fullfill the law. This is why we call the books of Jesus' teachings \"The New Testament\", thus we come to believe in the Messiah has come.\n \n \nWhere in the Bible does it tell you to discard Paul because he is arrogant? \n\n \n \nWhere did I say I disregard him? You can stop putting words and intentions into my mouth. I can speak for myself.\n\n \n Well, St.Paul doesn't allow for personal interpreation and faith. You do. Obviously you are going against what he says, when he calls people to unity of faith, and unity of belief, and unity of worship etc.\n \n \nWhat Biblical passages do you base this on? Where does, for instance St. Paul tell any of the Christian communities, that, now they've found God, they can go an worship Him in their own way - or do you not find the opposite, that he continually calls Christian communities to be united, and to worship in the same way?\n \n Do you partake of the Eucharist as Christ commands?\n\n \n \nTo worship in the same way - yes. But have to agree on every blasted thing? To negate you own thinking abilities and cow tow and bow to some old fart in Rome or some governing body in New York? To be lead by the nose by some heirarchy that does not even know the individual communities they \"command\".\n\n \n I don't have the wisdom of the Holy Fathers, and would consider it arrogant for someone to believe that they know more, simply by reading the Bible out of context. The first step to wisdom is to realise just how little we do know. Thus I go to the experts. I would no sooner trust my burst appendix to my own faculties than to ignore spirtitual advice from the wisdom of the Holy Fathers.\n \n And St.Paul does condemn people who start their own beliefs too, so he's all for unity of dogma.\n \n [Quote=jitobear]You have no idea how badly I ache to find a a church to worship in. But everywhere I go there is you. Self-righteous, I am right and you are wrong anf going to hell for thinking differently than me and God loves me best jerks who break my heart and make me gag.\n \n I believe that it's also un-biblical not to worship with your fellow Christians.\n \n \nLook in the mirror, you are the reason I am driven from church.\n\n \n I bet you've never been to an Orthodox Church\n \n \nEucharist - yes I do. But not as often or as recently as I would like.\n \n I also want to be baptized - but not into a church. They have no business sticking themselves in between me and Christ.\n\n \n How is it that you partake of the Eucharist, but have not been baptised? Most Christians go at this the other way around; baptism first, then Eucharist.\n \n \no o OH - and those bishops who think can grant or deny the Eucharist, like they own the body and blood of Christ.\n\n \n The Body and Blood of Christ was purchased for His church; this includes we the people.",

   "Jito,\n You make many good points and ask questions that I have asked myself at times.\n\n \n I am always asking questions. \n \n \nAnd what would be a just reward/punishment for unrepentant murder in your opinion?\n\n \n My opinion about what happens to the unrepentent. Yikes. My understanding is that the reward for belief/obediance is life, those that don't have it - get to be dead.\n \n \nIs there or was there ever a time when your personal filter was wrong?\n\n \n Almost certainly.\n \n \nDid Jesus allow people to figure out his dogma or did he state it unequivocally? Truth is outside of one person's \"filter.\"\n\n \n But you see, I don't have the fellow here to, like, have a conversation with. I have a book. And how am I supposed read or hear a thing in the world without it going through me? I pray before I read, and then I do what I can. I certainly won't be relying on strangers (the Pope) before my own head.\n \n \nProphecy yes and it applies to scripture as well. If we have everyone interpreting for themselves then we end up with over 30,000 Christian denominations as we have today. But Christ said that there would be one flock (John 10:16). Paul echoes this (Ephesians 4:3-6, Phillipians 2:2).\n\n \n Maybe all 30,000 are the flock, maybe none of them are - who are we to say who he chooses?\n \n \nWhat church on earth demonstrates to you most clearly the unity, universality, and consistency that is to be expected of the Church started by Jesus? (Matthew 16:18)\n\n \n **Shrugs** Funny how many times and in how many churches I have heard this argument in\n \n \nTHE Church is the one started by Jesus (Matthew 16:18). The Church is marked by its unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.\n\n \n Jesus did not start a church. He did his minitry in the world and taught in Jewish temples. The earliest congregations mostly operated out people's homes, and then things grew. \n \n \nWe are but the Church started by Jesus is not. Jesus told us that it would be guided into all the truth (John 16:13) and that the powers of hell would never prevail against it (Matthew 16:18). The Church started by Jesus speaks with his voice (Luke 10:16) and legislates with his power (Matthew 28:18-20).\n\n \n I do not under any circumstances believe any one demonination can lay claim to being Jesus' church or congregation.\n \n The Bible says one would know his followers by their actions. I believe his congregation is made up folk, not institutions.\n \n \nIn this you may be right. There is a saying that Catholic apologists use, \"Don't leave Peter because of Judas.\" It means that one should not leave the faithful Peter (don't leave the Church) because of sinners like Judas. One should not only judge a church by its sinners but by the good, holy people present as well. We can't let the behavior of others lead us astray.\n\n \n I won't give up doing my very own thinking - and that is an issue for most churches, not God, but men.\n \n \nI am sorry for that. I hope you find a church that will help you to grow spiritually and offer you good fellowship. I hope that you will continue your journey.\n\n \n Some people who know me seem to think I would like the Quakers. Maybe I should find out.\n \n \nSo you accept the Bible put together by the Catholic Church (Protestant Bibles have the same New Testament)? You accept the Church's ability and authority to determine which books would be kept and which would be excluded. Yet you won't accept their authority to interpret the book it put together? You won't accept the authority of the Church Christ started to convey the teachings of Christ?\n\n \n I accept that it is a collection of scriptures. No I do not accept that they know what to leave in or out, which is why I want to read more than the Bible - other Hebrew and Greek texts. And the rumor that the Vatican holds some religious writings hostage troubles me to no end. \n \n I totally accept the authority of anyone to convery whatever they wish. I also accpt my ability to respectfully disagree.\n \n \nBecause God is three persons in one essence. The Son prays to the Father. The Trinity is a Christian mystery and no one is able to fully explain it but it can be found in scripture. Many things that are not mentioned specifically by name can be found in scripture and in Christian teaching in general. The Christians closest to the time of Christ believed in the Trinity.\n\n \n Way too vague and complicated this trinity thing. Plus the idea that triune Gods are actually a pagan idea, when we are supposed to have ONE God. It doesn't rest on me well.",

Ever since Christ died there has been nothing but us mere mortals reading and figuring out God's word.\n\n \n It's odd that you should follow the Bible if you believe that it was written just by a man! We Orthodox believe it was written by men, inspired by the Holy Spirit. If you believe it is just the words of men, what reason do you have to follow it over the words of other religions?\n \n St.Paul received the Holy Spirit, and he was able to check his beliefs against those of the Apostles.\n \n That there have been people interpreting the Bible for themselves is part of the problem.\n \n Jesus established His Church by teaching His selected Apostles. Starting with St.Peter's statement of faith (Mat 16:13-19) Jesus says \"On this rock (of faith) I will build my Church\".\n \n There are numerous examples of 'Church' in the Bible, Eph 5:23. Cp; 1:18, Col 1:24, 1Cor 12:27. This last one is the Church is the Body of Christ and we are its members.\n \n Jesus commissioned His Apostles (John 20:21-23) to be teachers of His lessons \"...teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always (even) to the end of the age.\" Mat 28:20\n 1 Thessalonians 4\n 2 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.\n \n Titus 1\n 7 Since a bishop is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless?not overbearing, not quicktempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.\n \n The Book of Acts shows the church being organised with a Council of Bishops in Jerusalem deciding to extend the message of God to the Gentiles. Bishops were created, and then Deacons (Acts 2:3-4)\n \n The Church was one.\n \n Acts 2\n 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.\n 43 Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.\n 44 All the believers were together and had everything in common.\n 45 Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.\n 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, \n 47 praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\n \n Note, the 'signs and wonders' are done by the Apostles, not the mass of believers. Further, see the story about the Ethiopian below...\n \n \nPardon me if I choose to use that mass in between my ears.\n\n \n You need to know when you need to rely on the wisdom of others. I believe it is a folly to ignore the past. It is also ignoring the examples of the Bible;\n The Ethiopian\n \n Acts 8\n \n 30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. \n \n 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. \n \n \n \n In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word. That he was baptised as an adult is important to note. As is the fact that once a person was baptised, they still required an Apostle to lay hands to confer the gift of the Holy Spirit. See Acts 8\n \n 14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.\n \n 15 When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,\n \n 16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into[3] the name of the Lord Jesus.\n \n 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.\n \n \n \n That is, their own persona conversion was only the first step.\n \n \n \n \nI don't have the wisdom of the Holy Fathers, and would consider it arrogant for someone to believe that they know more, simply by reading the Bible out of context. The first step to wisdom is to realise just how little we do know. Thus I go to the experts. I would no sooner trust my burst appendix to my own faculties than to ignore spiritual advice from the wisdom of the Holy Fathers. \n\n \n \n \nTake your assumptions and go to that hell you believe in. I have read most parts of the Bible and have been reading it cover to cover for the last two years. I just started Luke.\n\n \n I note that you confine yourself to only those teachings that are contained in the Bible. You will be bound to get an incomplete idea of Christ's teachings, because\n they didn't write everything down\n John 21\n 25 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\n \n And, some teachings were kept orally\n 2 Thessalonians 2:15\n So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings[ 2:15 Or traditions] we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.\n \n A study of this is done at \"Sola Scriptura: An Orthodox Examination of the Protestant Teaching\"\n http://www.holytrinity.ok.goarch.org/Interesting%20Stuff/sola_scriptura_john_whiteford.htm\n \n \n Further, I suspect you've not read any of the other writings of the early church, viz. The Didache, The Epistle of St. Clement of Rome, or the Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch etc.\n \n Where does the Bible say that the Bible shall be the ultimate source for individual interpretation?\n \n \n And St.Paul does condemn people who start their own beliefs too, so he's all for unity of dogma. \n\n \n \nThank you for proving my point on why I stay out of church. I have not started anything. I have been studying with lots of folks and learning what I can, and travelling this journey for years.\n\n \n I also note that you refer to my beliefs as 'assumptions' when yours are sparse with regards to Biblical sources.\n \n As for 'unity' of believers, there's so many references I'm amazed you can ignore them...\n \n Romans 15\n 5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,\n \n Ephesians 4\n Unity in the Body of Christ \n 1 As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.\n 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. \n 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n 4 There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called-- \n 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; \n 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. \n 7 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. \n 8 This is why it[1] says: \n \"When he ascended on high, \n he led captives in his train \n and gave gifts to men.\"[2] \n 9 (What does \"he ascended\" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions[3] ?\n 10 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) \n 11 It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, \n 12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up \n 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. \n 14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. \n 15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. \n 16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.\n \n Colossians 3:14\n And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.\n \n etc.\n \n \nI bet you've never been to an Orthodox Church \n\n \n \nI used to live in both New Mexico and Spain and have been to mass several times. \n More assumptions about me.\n\n \n What has New Mexico and Spain got to do with the Orthodox Church? I think you've made a mistake here.\n \n \nHow is it that you partake of the Eucharist, but have not been baptised? Most Christians go at this the other way around; baptism first, then Eucharist. \n\n \n \nI was baptized as an infant and have even been through confirmation classes in different churches (Lutheran and Congregational). I want to do a full immersion baptism as an adult. I believe baptism is a promise that should be made as an adult.\n\n \n The Early Church made a statement of belief \"We believe in one baptism for the forgiveness of sins\" (see Nicene Creed).

By what churches? \n \n In hearing several churches make that argument which one fits the bill?\n Which one has Peter as its head as established by Jesus? (Matthew 16:18) Which one conveys the teachings of Christ most closely?Which Church has remained constant and unwavering in its teachings since the time of Christ? Which one remains united in practice and doctrine? Which one remains universal, found throughout the world in all races, regions, and cultures?\n \n \nJesus did not start a church. He did his minitry in the world and taught in Jewish temples. The earliest congregations mostly operated out people's homes, and then things grew. \n \n Jesus did start a church and this is recorded in Matthew 16:18.

I believe his congregation is made up folk, not institutions.\n\n Where do you find indications of Christ in the actions of others? Can it be found in the Catholic Church where men and women give up everything, give up their whole self including physical and material gain to follow Christ and serve others?...people who give up their lives paralleling the gift of life by Christ to his Church?

But one's thinking must have right boundaries and guides. Sometimes one must humbly submit his self as did Christ.\n \n \nI accept that it is a collection of scriptures. No I do not accept that they know what to leave in or out, which is why I want to read more than the Bible - other Hebrew and Greek texts. And the rumor that the Vatican holds some religious writings hostage troubles me to no end. \n \n Where did you hear that rumor?

   "Jito,\n \nWell, you could learn to read.\n\n Yes, one could learn to read. But many do not. Farmers, peasants, manual workers from modern times and definitely in the past never learned to read. But this does not exclude them from salvation. That's why there is a Church and why Jesus established one. Jesus commanded his apostles to go out and preach the word. Reliance on the Bible alone does not work because there was a time before the printing press was invented when there weren't many Bibles. There was a time when many more were illiterate than there are today. The Word was preached, the sacraments were lived, and men and women faithfully believed. Men gained the gift of grace then, just as now, when the Bible is so widely available.\n \n \nI am not saying you can't learn from others, I have learned plenty from lots of people.

As I said earlier, there were no printing presses and Bibles were extremely expensive to make. They were done on parchment or vellum and hand written. They were worth about three years wages. If one person took the Bible for himself then he denied it to others. \n \n The other reason the Church was so stringent in monitoring the Bible is that erroneous translations began to spring up everywhere. But the Church was attempting to preserve and protect the truthful Revelation of Christ.\n \n \nNo. My allegiance is owed to God and Christ alone. For no man can come to God BUT through Christ.\n\n Your words are true, no man can come to God but through Christ. I don't think following a Church started by Christ is attempting to get to God any other way than by Christ. \n \n \nI already told you.

The Church did start in people's homes. It was a domestic Church. Paul speaks of this when he talks about meeting to \"break bread.\" But what was done in the home is what is what is now done at Mass. The Church grew as a community of believers. Modern churches are the same thing that the domestic churches were--communities of believers. \n \n \nNone. It's not about churches - it's about people.\n\n Yeah, people make up churches. Often the church is where people go to get spiritual guidance, to praise God, to have fellowship with other Christians, and to be strengthened by the sacraments in the Catholic faith. This can also be done in everyday life and individually. But this individual, everyday praise and worship and right living must be joined to the community of believers--the Body of Christ.\n \n \nGood and bad works, just like the Catholic church.\n \n Protestants took with them parts of the truth but they left the fullness of truth behind. Almost all Christian churches possess elements of the truth and the Holy Spirit works in them. But only one Church possess the fullness of truth. \n \n \nNone. And just what do you mean by extremes? Just what is too much charity work or too much Bible reading or too much education, and who gets to decide that, and why do they get to decide it?\n \n I made my list to show you that the Catholic church (and no church) is the absolute example of anything. \n \n \n \nBut to answer your question:\n Nobody studies the Bible like Witnesses - you rarely meet one who has not read it cover to cover (several times)\n Nobody finds joy in their faith like a Baptist\n Nobody fears God like a Pentacostal\n Nobody opens their heart and minds and church doors to sinners like Protestants\n Nobody does world wide relief and educational efforts like the Catholics\n Nobody defies the law of man and politics in the name of what is right like the Quakers\n Nobody seperates themselves from the evils of this world like the Amish\n\n \n On extremes:\n The Witnesses study very hard. But the Witnesses study a misinterpreted, false Bible put together by people who were not even Biblical scholars very hard--New World Translation I believe. Their love of scripture has led to the perversion of making scripture fit their beliefs instead of forming their beliefs from true scripture.\n \n The Baptists joy in faith dampens their joy for life. That leads them to condemn any type of alcohol consumption even though Jesus drank wine. That leads them to condemn dancing even though David danced for the joy of his faith. That leads them to condemn gambling even though it can be a source of leisure and entertainment. (Their joy in their faith comes out in some great hymns though!)\n \n Nobody fears God like a Pentecostal (I have often complimented their devotion to their faith). But the Pentecostal often fears the Holy Spirit more than Jesus or the Father. So you see too much emphasis on speaking in tongues, dancing in church, the emotional baptism of the Holy Spirit denying the power of the sacrament of water baptism. Outward physical expressions are magnified while the inner contemplation of spiritual life is ignored.\n \n Protestants open their doors to sinners but often time ignore sin. That's why you see such liberalism in Protestantism--sanction of contraception, divorce, homosexuality, abortion, etc.\n \n The Quakers. I don't know much about them except that I believe they probably err as do the Amish and Pentecostals in an extreme puritanism.\n \n Nobody separates themselves from the evils of the world like the Amish. But the Amish go so far as to believe that technology is evil instead of discerning moral acts with and without technology. They isolate themselves from the world instead of entering the fray to practice the Great Commission. (And now you will see diluting of their practices. The Mennonites in Missouri--similar to the Amish but descended from the Anabaptists (I think) used to not allow rubber on their wheels for some reason. So one would see kids riding bikes without tubes and tractors with iron wheels. Now some have regular tires. Where does the prohibition on technology start and stop if one is simply prohibiting technology? One must discern morality.)\n \n The Catholic Church balances all things. \n \n \nAge does not make right.\n\n No, it doesn't. And I acknowledged that in my last post. I said that being right makes the Church old though. One does not become old without being right. Being right has allowed the Church to last for approximately 2,000 years while every fad, philosophy, and heresy around it has faded and died out. Yet the Church, as old as it is, is always being made new by its resurgences of faith.\n \n \nHe is not a member. He is the reason. First of all - not all Bibles use the word 'church' here, they use 'congregation' instead. I should find out what the original greek word was. Anyway! - He is saying that the basis of belief for his followers/congregation/church is that HE is the son of God.\n\n I didn't say he was a member. I said he was the originator. What you say is true. The basis for belief for his followers is that He is the Son of God. But he also appointed a leader for the followers. One to shepherd the flock when the chief shepherd moved to a higher place.\n \n \nHow does the great commision make men free from error????? He told believers to spread the work, he started with his disciples. That continues to this day. \n \n If you read the whole commission then you will see that Jesus ends with \"lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\" Jesus' presence with the Church is perpetual and his presence by the guidance of the Holy Spirit protects the Church he started from error in teaching on faith and morals. \n \n \nWord for hell here is haides, replacement for the Hebrew sheol - which meant death. So he is saying that the belief that he is the son of God will save believers from death. This gets said a lot in the Bible - as you know.\n\n Maybe. But the powers of hell or death will not prevail against His Church, that's what he said. It is protected from corruption. It will lead people to eternal life.\n \n \nHoly Spirit guides to truth - yeah, so....\n\n The Holy Spirit guides into all truth. The Holy Spirit guided the apostles into all the truth and they passed on their teachings to successors so that the true teachings of Jesus would be present throughout all the ages. The Catholic Church is the place that evidences this line back to the apostles. \n \n \nAnd? I am not rejecting any of the teaching. We simply disagree on WHAT was being taught.\n\n I thought you rejected many teachings of the Catholic Church. Jesus sent the apostles, the apostles were part of the Catholic Church. You reject the apostles. \n \n \nI don't question that there needs to be a structure to a congregation, or that it was laid out in the Bible. I believe there are lots of people and congregations - I DON'T believe that the Roman Catholic or ANY church gets to lay claim to being Christ's flock. The words in the Bible are for us all. \n \n If you believe that a structure was laid out in the Bible and that the Catholic Church was the first church from which all splintered then where does that leave us? Where did the congregations come from and if they splintered from the original Church of the Bible should they remain separated? The words in the Bible are for us all, everyone on the planet, but not all interpret them, understand them, or teach them correctly.\n \n \nThey were real, bloody, ugly events done by your church. The Catholic church is not alone in doing ugly things, nor is it exempt from doing them. And I am sorry one single torture of one single Jew during the Inquisition is all that is needed to point out that your church is not always right.\n\n There were abuses and evils committed in the inquisitions and the Crusades. But this shows that the Church is right not wrong. It is right because it denounces sin and the evils that men do. Men of the Church sin. But the teaching of the Church on faith and morals has no error. Christ guaranteed this.\n \n But these events are exaggerated. For example the number of people killed in the inquisitions have been inflated. Many more were killed by Protestants witch burning. But even one is bad, as you say.\n \n The Crusades were a response to Muslim aggression. Muslims had attacked Christians 400-600 years before any Crusade was started. If it weren't for the Crusades then we would likely be living in a Muslim world today. And the oppression of Islam is much worse than the liberty of Christianity.\n \n As for indulgences, there is a lot of rumor about those too. See a previous post on that by me at this link:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=19366&highlight=indulgences#post19366 \n \n \nI already said it was the first. Started by the earliest Christians. Whoop de doo da day.\n\n It's a bit more important than whoop de doo da day.\n \n \nBalls\n\n You're usually so much more eloquent and engaging than balls and whoop de doo da day. I suppose that \"balls\" means you don't believe these verses convey the Real Presence of Jesus' body, blood, soul, and divinity in the properly consecrated Eucharist. Did you read the verses? John 6, 1 Corinthians 10:16, and 1 Corinthians 11:23-29  \n \n The Eucharist was foreshadowed in the Old Testament by the manna, bread from heaven. But every New Testament fulfillment of Old Testament foreshadowing is greater than the Old Testament manifestation. If the Eucharist is a symbol then it would be lesser than its Old Testament foreshadowing. \n \n Why do you think Jesus said that he was true food and drink in John 6. Why did some followers leave saying that this was a hard teaching? Why is it a hard teaching if it is only a symbol? Why did Jesus let them leave without calling them back and saying \"No, I meant the Eucharist will be a symbol of my death and gift of life to you all.\" Why didn't he explain this as a parable as he explained all the other parables when his disciples couldn't understand them?\n \n Why do the apostles recognize Jesus in the breaking of the bread in Luke 24:30-31?\n \n What do you think Paul means when he says that anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself in 1 Corinthians 11:29? How does one discern the body in a simple symbol? How does one drink judgment on oneself by a symbol?\n \n \nI would hope a priest would try and guide you to, and tell you what and why - and then bugger off as your brain belongs to you.\n\n I would hope that he would continually plant seeds and hope that God would provide growth. For though my brain belongs to me, my soul doesn't entirely.\n \n \nI actually like discussing this with you. You don't treat me like an idiot because I disagree, nor do you put words or intentions into my mouth. I appreciate that.\n\n Likewise.\n \n \nOf course! The apostles are dead. Long time ago. \n \n But the Church is a living, organic link between modern day and the apostles. The apostles had the authority of Christ as the scripture so clearly illustrates. The apostles appointed legitimate successors and fought illegitimate heretical ones. The authority of Christ resides in the Catholic Church.\n \n \nHe clearly was not alone. I don't think he was talking to himself. What about his angels? There are things older than earth.\n\n But the scripture says that man was made in the image of God, not in the image of God and the angels. So the \"our\" and \"us\" refers to God. \n \n \nI don't think the Holy Spirit is a personality. Even if it is - it's SEPERATE.\n \n Read the verses I supplied earlier that describe the Spirit as a person. Remember the verse that Jesus and the Father are one.",

   "\n Yes, one could learn to read. But many do not. Farmers, peasants, manual workers from modern times and definitely in the past never learned to read. But this does not exclude them from salvation. That's why there is a Church and why Jesus established one. Jesus commanded his apostles to go out and preach the word. Reliance on the Bible alone does not work because there was a time before the printing press was invented when there weren't many Bibles. There was a time when many more were illiterate than there are today. The Word was preached, the sacraments were lived, and men and women faithfully believed. Men gained the gift of grace then, just as now, when the Bible is so widely available.\n\n \n I do not disagree with any of this. However, one can and should read it whenever possible - not just take anyone else's word for it. God, himself, has invited each and every one of us to study the scriptures for themselves.\n \n Scripture IS enough. It's just a matter of whether you can read them.\n \n \nThe pope has no authority as a mere individual. His authority rests in the authority granted by Christ to Peter. The Pope is the Vicar of Christ succeeding Peter.\n\n \n His authority is granted by men. For example, he has no authority in my life as I do not grant him any.\n \n \nIf you mean the time when the Church chained the Bible down, then yes, I am aware of it. As I said earlier, there were no printing presses and Bibles were extremely expensive to make. They were done on parchment or vellum and hand written. They were worth about three years wages. If one person took the Bible for himself then he denied it to others.\n \n \n hmmmm - true enough. Still burning was wrong. Did they block Joe Schmoe from coming into church and reading it there?\n \n \nThe other reason the Church was so stringent in monitoring the Bible is that erroneous translations began to spring up everywhere. But the Church was attempting to preserve and protect the truthful Revelation of Christ.\n \n \n Thanks for the summary of reasons that keep me out of churches. If Christ is to be revealed to me, do you really think that mere men in your church can grant or prohibit that? Just who do they think they are?\n \n \nYour words are true, no man can come to God but through Christ. I don't think following a Church started by Christ is attempting to get to God any other way than by Christ. \n \n \n I disagree. Maybe there is no reason that a church can't lead you to Christ, but it does not HAVE TO. I found this via rock and roll. What do you say to that?\n \n \nSome of what you say is true. The Church did start in people's homes. It was a domestic Church. Paul speaks of this when he talks about meeting to \"break bread.\" But what was done in the home is what is what is now done at Mass. The Church grew as a community of believers. Modern churches are the same thing that the domestic churches were--communities of believers.\n\n \n Yep. And it's not exclusive to the Catholic church. \n \n \nYeah, people make up churches. Often the church is where people go to get spiritual guidance, to praise God, to have fellowship with other Christians, and to be strengthened by the sacraments in the Catholic faith. This can also be done in everyday life and individually. But this individual, everyday praise and worship and right living must be joined to the community of believers--the Body of Christ.\n\n \n I would love to, but I will not participate in any exclusivity. And I make up my own mind. My peace has to be with God and what is my heart. Nobody else. That's why me and churches don't get along. All these men get in the way, thinking I owe them something. I don't.\n \n \nProtestants took with them parts of the truth but they left the fullness of truth behind. Almost all Christian churches possess elements of the truth and the Holy Spirit works in them. But only one Church possess the fullness of truth.\n\n \n And they left behind some lies. The sale of indulgences, the political and material largess and the worshipping of Mary and the saints. \n \n \nOn extremes:\n The Witnesses study very hard. But the Witnesses study a misinterpreted, false Bible put together by people who were not even Biblical scholars very hard--New World Translation I believe. Their love of scripture has led to the perversion of making scripture fit their beliefs instead of forming their beliefs from true scripture.\n\n \n It is a terrible translation. (I have read much of it - I use the NIV now.) They don't change scripture - they over read into it. (No part of the world means no voting, no good bdays in the Bible means no celebrating bdays...etc.) \n \n \nThe Baptists joy in faith dampens their joy for life. That leads them to condemn any type of alcohol consumption even though Jesus drank wine. That leads them to condemn dancing even though David danced for the joy of his faith. That leads them to condemn gambling even though it can be a source of leisure and entertainment. (Their joy in their faith comes out in some great hymns though!)\n \n Nobody fears God like a Pentecostal (I have often complimented their devotion to their faith).

Where does the prohibition on technology start and stop if one is simply prohibiting technology?

It's one thing, as a church, to get along with world's to be condemned governments - but they do more than that. What they are pulling here in the US has me so so so super angry. Catholic politicians have a job to do, and people they represent - not the Catholic church.\n \n Call it what you like but you worship Mary and the saints and in my reading of the Bible the one way to REALLY tick off God is to worship somebody but him. \n \n The idea that any human is infallible - what part of somebody's rear end did that idea get pulled from? \n \n Catholic church's view on marital sexuality.....on sex period.\n \n Nuns shaming my little ten year old neice for not making anough candy sales for her Catholic school.\n \n Name one cheerful Catholic (or Lutheran) hym? When do they ever say YAH! Never when I have been to mass.\n \n Dreary weepy pilgrimages at Easter time. Seen them myself in Santa Fe at Santauario de Chimayo. What the......? Did the world come crashing down? Christ's death deserves our respect, gratitude, and humility - but weeping like something went wrong?\n \n \nNo, it doesn't. And I acknowledged that in my last post. I said that being right makes the Church old though. One does not become old without being right. Being right has allowed the Church to last for approximately 2,000 years while every fad, philosophy, and heresy around it has faded and died out. Yet the Church, as old as it is, is always being made new by its resurgences of faith.\n\n \n Your church calls anything it don't like heresy. Like the \"heretic\" Gospel of St. Thomas. I have read it, it's fine.\n \n And your church's age means nothing. My dad gets older every day. He ain't been right yet.\n \n \nI didn't say he was a member. I said he was the originator. What you say is true. The basis for belief for his followers is that He is the Son of God. But he also appointed a leader for the followers. One to shepherd the flock when the chief shepherd moved to a higher place.\n\n \n Yep. He leads his flock. You (your church), however, don't get to name his flock.\n \n \nIf you read the whole commission then you will see that Jesus ends with \"lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\" Jesus' presence with the Church is perpetual and his presence by the guidance of the Holy Spirit protects the Church he started from error in teaching on faith and morals. \n\n \n NO! How are we possibly going to be without error? If we seek him, if we spread our faith, he is with us. No way are any of us ever gonna get this all right. Don't believe that for one second.\n \n \nMaybe. But the powers of hell or death will not prevail against His Church, that's what he said. It is protected from corruption. It will lead people to eternal life.\n\n \n NO! The faith in him is what hell/death will prevail against - not some organization.\n \n \nThe Holy Spirit guides into all truth. The Holy Spirit guided the apostles into all the truth and they passed on their teachings to successors so that the true teachings of Jesus would be present throughout all the ages. The Catholic Church is the place that evidences this line back to the apostles. \n\n \n If all he needed was apostles - why bother with scripture at all? Who says that only the apostles are gonna feel the holy spirit? Why not me?\n \n \nI thought you rejected many teachings of the Catholic Church. Jesus sent the apostles, the apostles were part of the Catholic Church. You reject the apostles. \n\n \n And we know the apostles teachings by reading the Bible. That's even how the Catholics know them. I can read the Bible. I don't agree with everything your church says the apostles said or actually meant.\n \n \nIf you believe that a structure was laid out in the Bible and that the Catholic Church was the first church from which all splintered then where does that leave us? Where did the congregations come from and if they splintered from the original Church of the Bible should they remain separated? The words in the Bible are for us all, everyone on the planet, but not all interpret them, understand them, or teach them correctly.\n\n \n It was laid out in the Bible as a guide on how to set up congregations. That's it. Most churches use this structure. Once again - not just Catholics.\n \n \nThere were abuses and evils committed in the inquisitions and the Crusades. But this shows that the Church is right not wrong. It is right because it denounces sin and the evils that men do. Men of the Church sin. But the teaching of the Church on faith and morals has no error. Christ guaranteed this.\n\n \n Then explain the sale of indulgences. Show how the church can back it up with the Bible. Even if it was exagerated - it happened - now justify it's teaching.\n \n \nBut these events are exaggerated. For example the number of people killed in the inquisitions have been inflated. Many more were killed by Protestants witch burning. But even one is bad, as you say.\n\n \n I don't ever agree with killing in the 'name of God'. You can quit trying to justify the churches actions. The modern Catholic church is not liable anyway. They were examples of bad things. They were. Especially the inquisition. Just trying to get you to see that your church has not ALWAYS been right.\n \n \nThe Crusades were a response to Muslim aggression. Muslims had attacked Christians 400-600 years before any Crusade was started. If it weren't for the Crusades then we would likely be living in a Muslim world today. And the oppression of Islam is much worse than the liberty of Christianity.\n\n \n You are right. And what the Spaniards did in the New World is an example of Christian aggresion. Do you think the Indians were better off for the butcher?\n \n \nAs for indulgences, there is a lot of rumor about those too. See a previous post on that by me at this link:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=19366&highlight=indulgences#post19366 \n\n \n OK. I will read the link, but unless it says it never happened - it were not OK.\n \n \nIt's a bit more important than whoop de doo da day.\n\n \n Nah.\n \n \nYou're usually so much more eloquent and engaging than balls and whoop de doo da day.

Only God knows why He does some things - they are a mystery to me, but I accept Him out of trust - based on what I do know.\n \n \nOr are you saying that we can dispense with baptism, etc... which the thief didn't participate in? \n Note too that the thief makes no declaration of the faith of Jesus being the Son of God, but only that Jesus is innocent of the charges he's been accused of... so, by your logic we can get rid of any declaration of Christian faith too! \n\n \n \nWell, if you ask me how i know that wasn't a one-off event, then i can ask you something too: how do you know that the thief wasn't baptised and not a Christian (i.e. a follower of Jesus' teachings at that time)?\n\n \n If he were a Christian then the persecution unto death of Stephen would not be said to be the first time a Christian was martyred. \n http://www.tldm.org/news6/Stephen.htm\n \n and\n http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/STEPMART.htm\n (as well as in Acts of the Apostles.)\n \n \n Luke reports what he supposedly said during the fructification, he does not make a complete record of all the things that he has not said/done before.\n \n Also note that in Luke 23:41 (or 42) that thief asked the other thief if he didn't fear God, so he certainly was a somewhat religious man - either as a Jew or as a follower of Jesus.\n \n We have four possible scenarios here:\n 1. The thief wasn't a follower of Jesus, but a \"normal\" Jew\n 1.1 He got an exception\n 1.2 Jews regularly go straight to heaven if they repent their sins\n \n 2. The thief was a follower of Jesus\n 2.1 He got an exception\n 2.2 No purgatory/very short purgatory\n\n \n Yes, it's all interesting stuff you've made up here, but let's look at what we do actually know\n \n a) Stephen was the first Christian martyr\n \n b) the thief made no confession of belief in Christ as His Saviour\n The actual verses are:\n Luke 23\n 39 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!\" \n 40 But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence?\n \n 41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\" \n 42 Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" \n 43 Jesus answered him, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.\"\n \n One thief mocks Jesus. The other, rather than acknowledge Him as Christ, simply recognises Him as being an innocent man. That is all that is comment on. Why? Because he's not a Christian, as we know Stephen to be the first Christian martyr. Therefore the thief going to heaven is an exceptional instance. If he weren't we'd be able to do away with baptism, even the Bible - because this man hadn't been privy to the Bible. Most shocking of all, we'd be able to dispense with the statement of faith of Christ as our Saviour.\n \n \nGenerally i don't believe that an exception might have been granted, because this would mean that God is unfair and that's hardly viable with God being the ultimate moral authority at the same time. \n jwu\n\n \n What God chooses is what God chooses. It is then, by the fact that He is the ultimate source of Love, intrinsically fair.",

Only God knows why He does some things - they are a mystery to me, but I accept Him out of trust - based on what I do know.\nThese \"exceptions\" are not comparable at all. Most of them were required for something (Moses meeting God), and we do not know if God eventually didn't get ****** because of the others.\n However, i see absolutely no reason why that thief should have gotten an exception which allows him to skip purgatory if there was such a thing, espeically not if he wasn't a follower of Jesus as you say.\n \n \nIf he were a Christian then the persecution unto death of Stephen would not be said to be the first time a Christian was martyred.\nMartyrdom requires being killed because of the own belief - that guy got killed because he was a thief.\n So there is no logical problem there with someone else being the first martyr, later.\n \n \nOne thief mocks Jesus.

Just for himself he did not assume to go there. \n If there would have been e.g. sarcasm involved, then Jesus certainly hadn't reacted as he did.\n \n Yes, no \"Jesus, save my soul\" is recorded from that thief, but he definitely knew who Jesus was and what he did (otherwise he couldn't have known that Jesus was innocent), and he believed that Jesus would return to his own kingdom.\n \n jwu",

   "Maybe it's a misplaced comma.\n \n \"I tell you the truth today, you will be with me in paradise.\"\n\n This is one of those times I will have to disagree with this part only, jitobear. Jesus was still alive in the flesh at this point; His time was at hand, but not yet. He really meant what he said, and I believe it did happen: The penitent thief was with Him in paradise. Now, what do we believe that paradise is? The soul will not remain with the body &#8211; whether it&#8217;s in the grave, at the bottom of the sea, frozen atop Mt Everest, or burnt to ashes. The soul goes to a place where it awaits judgment. Some say the natural body will be raised to take this on, but how can a body burned to ashes arise? It can&#8217;t. This body goes back to dust after awhile anyway, except in cases of mummification or similar acts of preservation.\n So the soul does leave the body at that time and spend the rest of time as we know it in a waiting room &#8211; call it paradise or limbo or whatever. But, purgatory is just a made-up place, created by man &#8211; maybe men took it from Daniel 11:35 where it talks about purging until the fallen ones be made &#8220;white&#8221;. But, it is a misunderstanding to say the least. What we do here is what we&#8217;re judged by, not after we die.\n \nOnce judged you will either live or be destroyed in the Lake of Fire.\n\n That&#8217;s important to remember. Jesus said that every tree that does not bear fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Mathew 7:19 ) &#8230;.into the furnace of fire. (Mathew 13:50). What happens when something is cast into a furnace? It is totally consumed, destroyed, devoured by the heat. It is no more.",

   "Jito,\n \nScripture IS enough. It's just a matter of whether you can read them.\n\n Whether one can read and understand them.\n \n \nThanks for the summary of reasons that keep me out of churches. If Christ is to be revealed to me, do you really think that mere men in your church can grant or prohibit that? Just who do they think they are?\n\n Sound translation of the Bible is what keeps you out of churches? Odd. \n \n \nI disagree. Maybe there is no reason that a church can't lead you to Christ, but it does not HAVE TO. I found this via rock and roll. What do you say to that?\n\n No, a church does not have to lead you to Christ. But the Catholic Church is the earthly fulfillment of one's journey with Christ.\n \n \nYep. And it's not exclusive to the Catholic church. \n \n Did the early domestic Church give rise to Lutheran domestic churches, or Baptist domestic churches, or Methodist domestic churches? The Catholic Church is the progression and result of the early domestic churches. These domestic churches were not without hierarchy and organization.\n \n \nAnd they left behind some lies. The sale of indulgences, the political and material largess and the worshipping of Mary and the saints. \n \n Catholics do not and never have worshipped Mary. You are listening to exaggerations again. Read this previous post (Scroll down to post #7 at the bottom and read the part titled \"Veneration of Mary\"). If you want to follow scripture then honor Mary:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=39497&highlight=nallyo#post39497 \n \n \nIt is a terrible translation. (I have read much of it - I use the NIV now.) They don't change scripture - they over read into it. (No part of the world means no voting, no good bdays in the Bible means no celebrating bdays...etc.) \n \n They over read into it and they do in fact change it. They have written into their text for the Gospel of John that Jesus was \"a god\" instead of Jesus was God.\n \n \nDoes not. First of all - I think it's too political. It's one thing, as a church, to get along with world's to be condemned governments - but they do more than that. What they are pulling here in the US has me so so so super angry. Catholic politicians have a job to do, and people they represent - not the Catholic church.\n\n Does too. ;) \n \n A Catholic politician should present himself as a Catholic. He should do that when he is elected and then if he is elected he will be representing people that support the same ideas and beliefs. But to call yourself Catholic and support abortion is to display a contradiction in terms.\n \n Why wouldn't a Church want to be political? Do you think Jesus wasn't political? Do you think he does not want his teaching proclaimed in all areas of the world? Why would politics be immune from the message of Christianity?\n \n \nCall it what you like but you worship Mary and the saints and in my reading of the Bible the one way to REALLY tick off God is to worship somebody but him. \n \n Please read your Bible and you will find that Catholics have faithful admiration of her. See my post above.\n \n \nThe idea that any human is infallible - what part of somebody's rear end did that idea get pulled from? \n \n Do you understand what the Church's idea of infallibility is?\n \n \nCatholic church's view on marital sexuality.....on sex period.\n\n I very clearly stated the Church's teaching on marital sexuality and on sex period in the abortion thread. You exited that debate.\n \n \nNuns shaming my little ten year old neice for not making anough candy sales for her Catholic school.\n\n It sounds like the nun has a personal problem. That has little to do with the teaching of the Church.\n \n \nName one cheerful Catholic (or Lutheran) hym? When do they ever say YAH! Never when I have been to mass.\n\n How about The Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:\n \n Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace! \n That where there is hatred, I may bring love.\n That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness.\n That where there is discord, I may bring harmony.\n That where there is error, I may bring truth.\n That where there is doubt, I may bring faith.\n That where there is despair, I may bring hope.\n That where there are shadows, I may bring light.\n That where there is sadness, I may bring joy.\n Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.\n To understand, than to be understood.\n To love, than to be loved.\n For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.\n It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.\n \n It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life. \n \n -Saint Francis of Assisi- \n \n When do we say \"YAH?\" Never that I know of. I am not familiar with that word.\n \nDreary weepy pilgrimages at Easter time. Seen them myself in Santa Fe at Santauario de Chimayo. What the......? Did the world come crashing down? Christ's death deserves our respect, gratitude, and humility - but weeping like something went wrong?\n\n Have you ever wept for the loss of someone you loved? Have you ever empathized with someone's suffering so intimately that it brought about an emotional response? Have you ever wronged someone and become emotional about the pain and suffering you caused them?\n \n \nYour church calls anything it don't like heresy. Like the \"heretic\" Gospel of St. Thomas. I have read it, it's fine.\n\n You have read The Gospel of St. Thomas and it is fine????????????????\n \n Have you read the last line of it?\n \n \"Simon Peter said to them: 'Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life.' Jesus said, \"I myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven\" (v. 114)\n \n How does this fit with your feminist notions? Do you see why the Church excludes some writings?\n \n \nAnd your church's age means nothing. My dad gets older every day. He ain't been right yet.\n\n I think I have adequately addressed this in my two previous explanations. Read them and you may realize that the Church's age is a sign, a proof, of its integrity and vitality throughout the ages. It has lasted for ~2,000 years for some reason.\n \n \nAnd we know the apostles teachings by reading the Bible. That's even how the Catholics know them. I can read the Bible. I don't agree with everything your church says the apostles said or actually meant.\n \n My Church? The Apostles' Church. Everybody's Church. The one truly universal Church.\n \n \nIt was laid out in the Bible as a guide on how to set up congregations. That's it. Most churches use this structure. Once again - not just Catholics.\n\n The congregations followed the apostles. They were commanded by the apostles.\n \n \nThen explain the sale of indulgences. Show how the church can back it up with the Bible. Even if it was exagerated - it happened - now justify it's teaching.\n\n Please read the link. There was never any Church teaching on saling indulgences.\n \n \nI don't ever agree with killing in the 'name of God'. You can quit trying to justify the churches actions. The modern Catholic church is not liable anyway. They were examples of bad things. They were. Especially the inquisition. Just trying to get you to see that your church has not ALWAYS been right.\n\n The Church has always been right in its teaching on faith and morals. It has been constant for almost 2,000 years.\n \n \nYou are right. And what the Spaniards did in the New World is an example of Christian aggresion. Do you think the Indians were better off for the butcher?\n\n Were the Indians better than the Spaniards? Didn't they make war on other peoples? Didn't they have human sacrifices? The Spaniards may have been wrong but they weren't dealing with sinless humanitarians.\n \n \nI am sorry. I was not intending to demean the Eucharist - just the idea that the Catholic church holds some ownership of it.\n \n The Catholic and Orthodox are the only churches that hold ownership of the true teaching of it.\n \n \nBut it's not the priest's AT ALL.\n \n And why must your priests be celebate by the way? So not in the Bible. Now THERE'S an extreme!\n\n The priest is a guide--a spiritual father.\n \n Celibacy is not in the Bible? Was Jesus celibate? Was Paul celibate? What do you think of 1 Corinthians 7:32-35?\n \n \nAnd they even argued amongst themselves - as we are now. The apostles started the preaching of Christ's story and salvation, they also wrote about it. That gave us tools we use today. I don't need a link to them. \n \n No woman is an island.",

Do you think Jesus wasn't political? Do you think he does not want his teaching proclaimed in all areas of the world? Why would politics be immune from the message of Christianity?\n\n \n 1 - these governments are doomed.\n 2 - I think Matthew 15 indicates a seperation of faith from government. Imposing obedience to your belief through government is innapropriate in a secular country - nor is it gonna win you brownie points in heaven.

   "That sounds condescending. Do mean understand them or understand them as I understand them?\n\n It is not condescension. Notice what the Ethiopian says in Acts 8:31, to paraphrase, \"How can I understand the scriptures unless someone guides me?\" Then look to 2 Peter 3:16  concerning Paul's epistles \"There are some things in them to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other scriptures.\"\n \n There is no condescending intent to my words.

Or is the Catholic Church the one that can trace its origin there?\n \n \nHail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee\n Blessed art thou amongst women\n Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus\n Holy Mary, Mother of God\n Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our deaths\n Amen\n\n \n \nI actually know that by heart. It is prayer. Prayer is worship. I don't care how you sweet talk about it. I am not treading there. That we are to worship none but him is clear - and that is where my prayers will go and nowhere else.\n\n If you know the Hail Mary by heart then you might also know that it actually is a group of quotations taken from scripture as the link I provided explained. Read the Gospel of Luke and you will find the Hail Mary. What problem do you have with reciting scripture?\n \n We ask Mary to intercede for us with her prayers. We ask her to pray to Jesus for us just as you ask someone here on earth to pray for you. Have you ever asked someone to pray for you?\n \n Mary's ability to intercede is fact and can be seen in her intercession at the wedding of Cana. Jesus told her it was not his time but he ended up performing the miracle of turning water to wine at her request. \n \n This is concrete in scripture if you read 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" What did Paul mean by asking men to make prayers, intercessions, and supplications? \n \n Another concrete example of the acceptance of prayer for intercession can be found in Revelation 8:3 where it describes the prayers of saints being presented before God. So we ask the saints to pray for us. \n \n \nActually I have seen arguments from linguists on both sides of this one....so I balance it against what I think the rest of the bible is saying - and you already know I think he was seperate.\n\n So you believe in three Gods, not one God?\n \n \nNo a politician should represent the people - and we all are not Catholic. And who are you to say that one can not be pro-choice and Catholic? You do know that being pro-choice does not necesarily mean that you approve of or will have an abortion, don't you?\n\n Yes, the politician represents the people who elect him. Are you saying that people cannot choose to elect a Catholic politician who holds Catholic views?\n \n If one doesn't approve of abortion, I'm not sure why he would be pro-choice.\n \n \n1 - these governments are doomed.\n 2 - I think Matthew 15 indicates a seperation of faith from government. Imposing obedience to your belief through government is innapropriate in a secular country - nor is it gonna win you brownie points in heaven. A person has to believe with their hearts - actions alone are not enough - the Bible even says so.\n\n I don't see how one can interpret Matthew 15 in that way.\n \n I said nothing about imposing obedience to Catholic belief via government. \n \n Probably not - but if it even means less likely to be wrong I reject it.\n \n \nAnd I still think it is wrong.\n\n I don't think your arguments for sex outside of marriage and the denial of the sacredness of sex between married men and women hold up within the context of Christianity. The Catholic teaching on this is scriptural and sound.\n \n \nBy the way - I also find it creepy to say somebody else's prayer - or to have others pray for me.\n\n Why?\n \n \nYah, yeah, hurrah.... you know joyful noise. Gospel music so has the dreary hymns of Catholic and Lutheran churches just beat - hands down. \n \n I will admit we are a bit tradition and reserved. But this cannot be said of all Catholic Churces. There is beauty in some of that traditional music and song. There is no problem with joyful noise. I listen to a lot of contemporary Christian music--upbeat, fast, loud, guitar, etc. There may be a place for it all.\n \n \nWe did not lose Jesus.\n\n We lost him (perhaps temporarily) in his human presence. Just like we haven't lost any of our loved ones who have gone before us. Yet we weep for them. But you are right, we have not lost Jesus. \n \n \nAnd OK - but I really think it is mostly meladramatic postering.\n\n There is some of that but we cannot know for sure what is in people's hearts. I think much of it is authenic spirituality. Would you judge those people when judgment is one of the things that deters you from churches?\n \n \nThat's right - I remember finding that line disturbing. I pondered if it wasn't symbolic in some way. The whole thing is so incomplete...phrases more than an actual gospel. \n \n Yes, and some of the phrases don't add up. That's why the Church excluded it.\n \n \nNo - I don't see why they do. The more info - the more you know. I want to devour all I can find out - scripture, history, science - for when they meet is when you find truth - for both the Word and the Creation are from God.\n\n But one must distinguish between sound, truthful info. and false info. We need to know the true Revelation of Christ. Reading the erroneous info. may be a learning experience but one must realize that it is, in fact, erroneous and not put it on the same level as true writings. The Word and Creation are from God but false writings are from men.\n \n \nOK - we have beat this to death. You hold the Catholic church in higher esteem than I.\n\n Yes, I think you have a lot of unfounded and uneducated biases against the Church.\n \n \nOK. I just read the gospels looking for that. I don't see it. In Luke Jesus said to do this in remembrance of him. I don't see him handing ownership of his grace or sacrifice over to anyone.\n\n You read John 6 and the passages from Corinthians? What do you think Paul could have meant when he said that one eats and drinks judgment upon himself if he does not discern the body?\n \n This may give you a short but more complete explanation:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Christ_in_the_Eucharist.asp \n \n You can't find the Real Presence in scripture but the earliest Christians did:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp \n \n \nHe's a guy.\n\n Yeah. You're right. He's human like the rest of us. But he's also different from the rest of us--he's given up everything earthly to devote his life to Christ.\n \n \nI did not say there was anything wrong with celibacy. And yes - there are those in the Bible who were celebate. However - there is no reason to REQUIRE it of priests. THAT is what is not Biblical - the requirement.\n\n Who forces these men to be priests?",

It has been constant for almost 2,000 years.\n\n \nMotherhood was a distinct liability for those who came into the Inquisitions' hands. (One Inquisitor) recommended that children, if \"craftily handled,\" could be depended on to inform against their mothers. Children were highly susceptable to torture; so a rule was made that children could be tortured at once, without any waiting period.\n\n \n \n(Methods) included the rack, thumbscrew, bootscrew, branding irons, pincers for tearing of gobbets of flesh, ropes to wind the extremeties until blood spurted from under the nails.\n \n \n So, do you believe that the practice of these tortures was right in morals? \n \n \nWere the Indians better than the Spaniards?

Besides, although neither interests me, I'd say that having voluntary sacrifice is less harmful and violent than mass murder...\n \n Er, and wasn't your Jesus Christ a human sacrifice? \n \n \nThe Spaniards may have been wrong but they weren't dealing with sinless humanitarians.\n\n That's what they said; it's okay because these people have no souls, they're either animals or sinners- either way, anything goes.\n \n This is just one example of Spanish behavior towards the Taino people- a peaceful and egalitarian culture:\n \n(The Spaniards) made bets as to who would slit a man in two, or cut off his head at one blow; or they opened up his bowels. They tore the babes from their mother's breast by their feet and dashed their heads against the rocks... They spitted the bodies of other babes, together with their mothers and all who were before them, on their swords.\n from Las Casas\n \n Of Cortes' assault on the Aztec Nation-\n \nNumerous reports, from numerous reporters, tell of Indians being led ot the mines in columns, chained together at the neck, and decapitated if they faltered. Of children trapped and buried alive in their houses., or stabbed to death because they walked too slowly. (...) Of babies taken from their mother's breasts, killed, and left as roadside markers. Of \"stray\" Indians dismembered and sent back to their villages with their chopped off hands and noses strung around their necks. Of \"pregnant and confined women, children, old men, as many as they could capture,\" thrown into pits in which stakes had been embedded and \"left stuck on the stakes, until the pits were filled.\" And much, much more.\n \n \n It's all well and good to say from a distance that \"no culture is perfect\" or something absurd like that, but the fact is that we are talking about completely psychotically cruel behaviour on a mass scale. Nothing the Aztecs could have done would have justified this, and neither can your God.\n \n \nCelibacy is not in the Bible? Was Jesus celibate? Was Paul celibate? What do you think of 1 Corinthians 7:32-35?\n\n Supposedly. It's possible that Paul was a Eunuch, also. Actually, the Church very much historically favoured celibacy over marriage. In fact, it kept the subject at such arm's length that \"marriage ceremonies\" were not Christianized until the 16th century. It wasn't until 1763 that British marriages required the presence of clergy.",

   "Why don't you go live in a Muslim country as a woman and tell me.\n\n I know plenty of Muslim women who have lived in Muslim countries. You're mixing up religious fundamentalism + sexism with Islam. \n \n \nWere the torturers civil authorities or Church authorities?\n\n The power of the Inquisition was established and enlarged by the Papacy through numerous Papal bulls. Don't forget that there was no \"separation of Church and State\".\n \n \nCould they travel to other continents?\n\n Yes.\n \n \nDo you know of the Lakota? Have you ever heard of them warring with other tribes and taking bounty?\n\n I've never heard of them doing to anyone what the Europeans did to them. Don't try to limit this to \"warring\" with other Nations (\"tribes\" is a misnomer, BTW), or \"taking bounty\". There is simply no comparison in Native cultures to the wholesale slaughter which came with colonisation.\n \n \nSo you're saying that they were mostly voluntary sacrifices?\n\n I'm saying it is debated whether \"Aztec human sacrifices\" actually occurred. The evidence is unclear. Regardless, yes, generally cultures which exalt human sacrifice use willing participants. I mean, you tell me- wasn't Jesus a \"voluntary sacrifice\"?\n \n \nMy point was simply to illustrate that the Natives are often idealized into a majestic, totally pure people of victimhood attempting to dramatically contrast the sides.\n\n It doesn't matter what Native people were. There is absolutely no excuse for the behavior of the colonial Church/government in the Americas. \n \n That said, it's clear that Native ppl at least had going for them that they weren't as bad as the Europeans. And on the whole, Native Nations were much more democratic, egalitarian and non-violent than their European counterparts. \n \n So, in conclusion, you opinion is that these actions and encouragements by the Catholic Church were morally correct?\n \n \nPlease elaborate on your point.\n\n \nThe word marriage came from Latin maritare, union under the auspices of the Goddess Aphrodite-Man. Because the Goddess's patronage was constantly invoked in every aspect of marriage, Christian fathers were opposed to the institution. Origen declared, \"Matrimony is impure and unholy, a means of sexual passion.\" St. Jerome said the primary purpose of a man of God was to \"cut down with an ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage.\"' St. Ambrose said marriage was a crime against God, because it changed the state of virginity that God gave every man and woman at birth.2 Marriage was prostitution of the members of Christ, and \"married people ought to blush at the state in which they are living.\" Tertullian said marriage was a moral crime, \"more dreadful than any punishment or any death.\" It was spurcitiae, \"obscenity,\" or \"filth.\"\n St. Augustine flatly stated that marriage is a sin. Tatian said marriage is corruption, \"a polluted and foul way of life.\" Influenced by him, Syrian churches ruled that no person could become Christian except celibate men, and no man who had ever been married could be baptized. Saturninus said God made only two kinds of people, good men and evil women. Marriage perpetuated the deviltry of women, who dominated men through the magic of sex.4 Centuries later, St. Bernard still proclaimed that it was easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his soul.5\n St. Paul damned marriage with faint praise, remarking that to marry was only better than to burn (1 Corinthians 7:9); but later followers of Pauline Christianity damned marriage altogether, according to the word of Jesus: \"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple\" (Luke 14:26). Jesus renounced his family, declaring that he had no relatives except the faithful (Mark 3:31-35). Jerome interpreted this as a mandate to destroy marriage and the family. He was disgusted by motherhood: \"the tumefaction of the uterus, the care of yelling infants, all those fond feelings which death at last cuts short.\"6 He said every man who loves his wife passionately was guilty of adultery.7 Augustine also expressed disgust at feminine sexual and maternal functions. He coined the saying that birth is demonstrably accursed because every child emerges \"between feces and urine.\"8\n An example of anti-family virtue was made of one of the artificial saints built on a title of the pro-family Goddess, Perpetua, \"the Eternal One.\" In her new Christian disguise as St. Perpetua, she was so devoted to single blessedness that she not only faced martyrdom with equanimity but also renounced her parents, her husband, and her suckling infant in order to become Christian. Her pagan relatives tried to soften her heart by putting the infant to her breast, but she threw it aside and said to them, \"Begone from me, enemies of God, for I know you not!\"9\n This was the early Christian notion of a \"good\" woman: one who placed faith before family. Church customs reflected this view. There was no Christian sacrament of marriage until the 16th century.'\u00b0 Catholic scholars say the wedding ceremony was \"imposed on\" a reluctant church, and \"nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved.\" It is perhaps not remarkable to find that these liturgical forms were not evolved by the church at all, but borrowed from pagans' common law.1'\n\n \n About Paul being a Eunuch, these were not uncommon in the Early Church, and certainly Paul alludes to this as \"marks of the Lord Jesus\" and a \"light affliction\" that would bring him eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17). He also hints that he is one of the \"new creatures\" in Christ, neither circumcised nor uncircumcised- which is hard to pull off, unless he had no penis at all.",

   "If it weren't for the Crusades then we would likely be living in a Muslim world today. \n\n \nAnd that would be different from a Christian world... how?\n\n \n For one thing you'd be unlikely to have a career - since you're a woman. You'd also be unlikely to either have your native American quasi-god religion or be able to debate on a forum like this with regard to religion.\n \n \"Slay the idolaters wherever you find them. ... lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy, allow them to go their way ...\" (Surah 9:5)\n \n \"Make war on them until idolatry shall cease and God?s religion shall reign supreme\" (8:39)\n \n \"Prophet, rouse the faithful to arms. If there are twenty steadfast men among you, they shall vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for they are devoid of understanding.\" (8:65)\n \"Fight against such of those to whom the Scriptures were given ... and do not embrace the true Faith, until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued.\" (9:29)\n \n You'd be worse off. But it's easier for you to kick Christians... even those that are fighting so you have a right to worship whatever it is you worship.\n \n \nWhy don't you go live in a Muslim country as a woman and tell me. \n\n \nI know plenty of Muslim women who have lived in Muslim countries. You're mixing up religious fundamentalism + sexism with Islam. \n\n \n This is one of the lamest arguments about. I know a few good Muslims too. Ipso facto there's nothing wrong with the religion. That being so, Mizmaxx, I know some good Christians, therefore there's nothing wrong with Christianity then you need not return to these posts again to criticise it. I expect I won't be hearing you criticise Christianity again (wishful thinking that you will apply such a rule universally).\n \n In fact, I know of a very good man who happened to be a Nazi, a member of the Party, no-less. By Mizmaxx's rationale, we can no longer judge the Nazi party - sure their ideology invoked evil, but not everyone was actually involved with carrying out atrocities! Not possible? Who is this great Nazi? Oscar Schindler! German, member of the party, industrialist, user of Jewish slave-labour.\n \n This is why I believe that Mizmaxx is very anti-Christian. For her to tacitly defend the tenets of Islam that condemn women to being sex-slaves, and below men, is quite amazing. Must be those Kreb cycles!\n \n Sex-slave:\n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n Further a woman must give herself to her husband's desires, no matter when 'even if she be at the stove'.\n \n As to equality... not even in death...\n For Islam, any pretence of equality ceases in the after-life.\n \n \n \n For righteous men... virgins (houris) for your pleasure\n Surah Ad-Dukhan: 44:54 \n So (it will be), and We shall marry them to Houris (female fair ones) with wide, lovely eyes. \n \n \n \n Surah At-Tur: 52:20 \n They will recline (with ease) on thrones arranged in ranks. And We shall marry them to Houris (female, fair ones) with wide lovely eyes. \n \n Surah Ar-Rahman: 55:72 \n Houris (beautiful, fair females) restrained in pavilions; \n \n Surah Al-Waqi'ah: 56:22 \n And (there will be) Houris (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes (as wives for the pious),\n \n Men get to use women even in the Muslim after-life. For righteous women .... you get to stay with your husband.\n \n \n And as to St.Paul, he alludes to the fact he's got marks. I'm not sure if you genuinely read into this what you do, or you just say these things because it's another barb against commonly held Christian beliefs. He also mentions he's got failing eye-sight etc.",

   "It is not condescension. Notice what the Ethiopian says in Acts 8:31, to paraphrase, \"How can I understand the scriptures unless someone guides me?\" Then look to 2 Peter 3:16  concerning Paul's epistles \"There are some things in them to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other scriptures.\"\n \n There is no condescending intent to my words. I am thinking of the common man who has common sense but who may not be a biblical scholar. He deserves the Word of God too. Jesus Christ established a way for the common man to commune with him as well as the intellectual--through the Church and the sacraments. But if you say to each his own then you end up with a splintered cacophany of 33,000 denominations of Christianity. This splinters the truth.\n\n \n The common also deserves the right to think about a thing and make up his/her own mind.\n \n \nOne must search for the truth and find the one that is right.\n\n \n Truth is not an institution.\n \n \nI, on the other hand, think there are many that understand the Word better than me because they may have learned Greek, Hebrew, biblical history, archaeology, theology, etc.\n\n \n The difference there is education. Go learn about these things yourself. There is no reason to anyone's word for it - whether they be a scientist or priest. I don't. \n \n \nYou have a lot of issues with churches it seems.\n\n \n Yep - and I think I have explained them. \n \n \nWe ask Mary to intercede for us with her prayers. We ask her to pray to Jesus for us just as you ask someone here on earth to pray for you. Have you ever asked someone to pray for you?\n\n \n I don't know - I don't think so. But Mary is dead. I certainly won't ask the dead.\n \n The whole praying to anyone but God makes me highly unfortable from what I have read in the Bible. I am not gonna do it.\n \n \nSo you believe in three Gods, not one God?\n\n \n No. I don't believe Jesus and the Holy Spirit are God. They are seperate and inferior.\n \n \nYes, the politician represents the people who elect him. Are you saying that people cannot choose to elect a Catholic politician who holds Catholic views?\n\n \n They can. However, Kerry is running on the Democratic ticket and has made his stance with the issues on that. For the church to try and get him to change his stance is unfair to his constituency - and innapropriate. To Kerry's credit, the church has been unsuccessful.\n \n \nIf one doesn't approve of abortion, I'm not sure why he would be pro-choice.\n\n \n Because they believe that private medical decisions don't belong with government. Because they can't possibly know every story and be equipped to make decisions for strangers. Because they don't believe in enforcing their morality on total strangers.\n \n \nI don't think your arguments for sex outside of marriage and the denial of the sacredness of sex between married men and women hold up within the context of Christianity. The Catholic teaching on this is scriptural and sound.\n\n \n I never argued for sex outside of marriage. I know the Bible stands against that. I argued against the Pope sticking his nose is married people's sex lives and I disagree with the church's stand on birth control.\n \n \nI will admit we are a bit tradition and reserved. But this cannot be said of all Catholic Churces. There is beauty in some of that traditional music and song. There is no problem with joyful noise. I listen to a lot of contemporary Christian music--upbeat, fast, loud, guitar, etc. There may be a place for it all.\n\n \n To step away from religion a moment - as a contemporary (rock) music fan and musician - contemporary Christian (rock) music is TERRIBLE. Horrible copy-cats - nothing original about it. You want to hear rock I can name dozens of bands and artists that are original and much, much MUCH better.\n \n \nThere is some of that but we cannot know for sure what is in people's hearts. I think much of it is authenic spirituality. Would you judge those people when judgment is one of the things that deters you from churches?\n\n \n You have a point about judgment - but we were talking about extremes - you said none exist in Catholicism. I would say this is an extreme.\n \n \nBut one must distinguish between sound, truthful info. and false info. We need to know the true Revelation of Christ. Reading the erroneous info. may be a learning experience but one must realize that it is, in fact, erroneous and not put it on the same level as true writings. The Word and Creation are from God but false writings are from men.\n\n \n Studying the creation is not erroneous - and the creation is so much cooler than a book, anyway. Science keeps me faithful. I see God's hand everywhere.\n \n AND when faith and science cross and agree is when you have it.\n \n A few examples:\n \n When Christ died the Bible says the moon turned to blood. Any scientist will tell you that non-living matter does not bleed.\n \n So - was it magic?\n \n Historians know the date of Christ's death, and astronomers know that there was a lunar eclipse that day. The moon frequently will turn red during a lunar eclipse.\n \n David and Goliath. A youth kills a giant with a stone. How can that be? Must be magic.\n \n Here is what science can tell us about that battle.\n \n Goliath was a giant. The only one thing that can cause the kind of size described in the Bible for Goliath is a disease called Giganticism - it is a growth hormone disorder (my mom has friend who has it). First it would have rendered Goliath slower due to his size, the disease also has other complications due to glands enlarging and putting pressure on the brain - causing things like vision problems. On top of this Goliath wore armor. Archeologists have examples of the type of armor worn by the (forgot what his nation was) - anyway it weighed 120 pounds. In comes David and his sling. Weapons and ballistics experts have tested these weapons - stones could have been hurtled at tremendous speeds, and the weapon is quite deadly. On top of this David was unincumbered by armor or a medical condition that slowed him down. I would say the fight was in his favor.\n \n I am not trying to take God of these events - I am trying to point out he is in everything. He doesn't use or need to use \"magic\" - he generally works within the confines of his creation - and that is what science studies. I think all too often we dismiss the ordinary and dismiss science as being able to have have anything to do with God. As being not sacred enough. I disagree. I think it's all relevent. But you won't know that if you don't look and see. And I think all too often churches want you to put the blinders on and only see what they think you should.\n \n If I had not turned to other sources all David would have been to me was boy God liked. I would have missed how God operated that day. How much do we miss today?\n \n \nWho forces these men to be priests?\n\n \n Nobody - but you have not addressed my question as to why celibacy is required for priests by your church.",

If you want, cut and paste it into your own post, or use it as a reference for your own post - heck, you probably are aware of all these things anyway.\n \n \n \n Post #58....\n It's odd that you should follow the Bible if you believe that it was written just by a man! We Orthodox believe it was written by men, inspired by the Holy Spirit. If you believe it is just the words of men, what reason do you have to follow it over the words of other religions?\n \n St.Paul received the Holy Spirit, and he was able to check his beliefs against those of the Apostles.\n \n That there have been people interpreting the Bible for themselves is part of the problem.\n \n Jesus established His Church by teaching His selected Apostles. Starting with St.Peter's statement of faith (Mat 16:13-19) Jesus says \"On this rock (of faith) I will build my Church\".\n \n There are numerous examples of 'Church' in the Bible, Eph 5:23. Cp; 1:18, Col 1:24, 1Cor 12:27. This last one is the Church is the Body of Christ and we are its members.\n \n Jesus commissioned His Apostles (John 20:21-23) to be teachers of His lessons \"...teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always (even) to the end of the age.\" Mat 28:20\n 1 Thessalonians 4\n 2 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.\n \n Titus 1\n 7 Since a bishop is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless?not overbearing, not quicktempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.\n \n The Book of Acts shows the church being organised with a Council of Bishops in Jerusalem deciding to extend the message of God to the Gentiles. Bishops were created, and then Deacons (Acts 2:3-4)\n \n The Church was one.\n \n Acts 2\n 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.\n 43 Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.\n 44 All the believers were together and had everything in common.\n 45 Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.\n 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, \n 47 praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\n \n Note, the 'signs and wonders' are done by the Apostles, not the mass of believers. Further, see the story about the Ethiopian below...\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Jtobear\n Pardon me if I choose to use that mass in between my ears. \n \n You need to know when you need to rely on the wisdom of others. I believe it is a folly to ignore the past. It is also ignoring the examples of the Bible;\n The Ethiopian\n \n Acts 8\n \n 30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. \n \n 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. \n \n \n \n In other words, he called upon a minister (deacon) to guide him in his readings of the word. That he was baptised as an adult is important to note. As is the fact that once a person was baptised, they still required an Apostle to lay hands to confer the gift of the Holy Spirit. See Acts 8\n \n 14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.\n \n 15 When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,\n \n 16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into[3] the name of the Lord Jesus.\n \n 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.\n \n That is, their own persona conversion was only the first step.\n \n I note that you confine yourself to only those teachings that are contained in the Bible. You will be bound to get an incomplete idea of Christ's teachings, because\n they didn't write everything down\n John 21\n 25 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\n \n And, some teachings were kept orally\n 2 Thessalonians 2:15\n So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings[ 2:15 Or traditions] we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.\n \n A study of this is done at \"Sola Scriptura: An Orthodox Examination of the Protestant Teaching\"\n http://www.holytrinity.ok.goarch.or...n_whiteford.htm\n \n \n Further, I suspect you've not read any of the other writings of the early church, viz. The Didache, The Epistle of St. Clement of Rome, or the Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch etc.\n \n Where does the Bible say that the Bible shall be the ultimate source for individual interpretation?\n \n As for 'unity' of believers, there's so many references I'm amazed you can ignore them...\n \n Romans 15\n 5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,\n \n Ephesians 4\n Unity in the Body of Christ \n 1 As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.\n 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. \n 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n 4 There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called-- \n 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; \n 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. \n 7 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. \n 8 This is why it[1] says: \n \"When he ascended on high, \n he led captives in his train \n and gave gifts to men.\"[2] \n 9 (What does \"he ascended\" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions[3] ?\n 10 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) \n 11 It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, \n 12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up \n 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. \n 14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. \n 15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. \n 16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.\n \n Colossians 3:14\n And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.\n \n etc.\n \n 2 Peter 2\n 10 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority.\n \n Romans 13\n 1 Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.\n 2 Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.\n \n Hebrews 13\n 17 Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you.",

   "For one thing you'd be unlikely to have a career - since you're a woman. \n\n \nThere is no reason to believe that any and all Muslim countries would be sexist.\n\n For the first time I realise your intent on this forum is to entertain. Especially with attempts at humour such as that. There is every reason to believe that Muslim countries are sexist because those that follow Muslim law state that a woman's testimony in a court is worth half that of a man's. That woman who is raped, needs four male witnesses in order to attain a conviction.\n \n Effectively though, Mizmaxx, your whole argument is based on supposition owing to the fact you know a few good Muslims.\n \n \nRead the Bible, look at history, the same presumption could be made about Christianity.\n\n \n You do make that presumption about Christianity. And there's the rub you are prepared to judge Christianity as being sexist but no other religion gets this treatment, because you are intensely anti-Christian. You have continually judged the religion. You continually judge Christians.\n \nThere are different kinds of Muslims, as there are different kinds of Christians. Not all of either are sexist.\n\n \n Sure, and as I exampled, there were different types of Nazis, so, by your logic Nazism itself is not bad.\n \n Who says I am judging Muslims? I am judging Islam. Islam teaches that hell is over-populated by women...\n \"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammad was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammad responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammad answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n If a woman gets to heaven, she gets to be with her husband.... serving him.\n IF you can find Biblical passages that promote sex with children, women as sex slaves, women having half the value of a man in court, requiring four male Muslim witnesses for a rape conviction, then, bring them on.\n \n \nYou'd also be unlikely to either have your native American quasi-god religion \n\n \nlol... Was that supposed to make me cry or something?\n\n No, not at all. I am simply stating your views of your own 'religion' which you continually say doesn't really have 'gods' and other explanations etc are too simplistic.

But it's easier for you to kick Christians... even those that are fighting so you have a right to worship whatever it is you worship. \n\n \nNo reason to believe that. \n\n I gave you reasons.

What do you do?\n \nThe same quotes you gave could be found in the Bible if one were to pick and choose.\n\n Supposition.\n \n \nThat being so, Mizmaxx, I know some good Christians, therefore there's nothing wrong with Christianity then you need not return to these posts again to criticise it. I expect I won't be hearing you criticise Christianity again (wishful thinking that you will apply such a rule universally). \n\n \nWhen did I say there was something \"wrong\" with Christianity as a whole?\n\n \n Post 50 of \"What do you know about Wicca?\"\n \nYou said Orthodox. You mentioned the \"Holy Fathers\". I thought you meant Orthodox Catholic. You just corrected me the once.\n But then all those wishy-washy religions seem the same to me. \n\n \n Unless 'wishy-washy' is a good thing. :) How about 'totalitarian'?\n \n Post #40 \"School Prayer\"\n \nForcing people to pray or not allowing them to wear a Hijab are both wrong. Montalban, totalitarianism is not a function of Islam more than it is any other conversion religion (*cough* Christianity *cough*).\n\n \n How about as a sanctifier of slavery?\n Post #268 Am I Going To Hell?\n \nYou wouldn't be so bold, montalban, as to argue that slavery and misogyny were never sanctified in Christian texts? Even, perhaps, in Orthodox ones?\n\n I know some Christians who spoke out against slavery, ipso facto you can't make statements like this one.\n \nI think there's something wrong with many people's way of practicing it, but I have no problem with Christianity. Of course, like Islam, Judaism, and Golden Dawn Occultism, I don't believe in them. I see no reason why this should stop me from critiquing any of them. \n\n You should stop critiquing them, by your very own argument. You say, when I argue against Islam, that I shouldn't because you know some few good Muslims. Well, lack of insight may be lifted from your mind - because you can't criticise Christianity, as you now agree that you know some good Christians. You criticise Catholicism and by logical extension, if you know some good Catholics, you cant' criticise it.\n \n You continually pay-out on Christianity. You mention how it is sexist, brutal - based on the actions of Crusaders, genocide, sexism etc. And, you feel justified in doing so, despite the fact you will recognise not all Christians are sexist, or genocidal. In short, only you have a right to criticise other faiths.\n \n And to top it all off - it's based on, according to you, a fictional character... therefore undermining it's very right to exist as a real religion - instead suggesting that all Christians are delusional.\n \n \nIn fact, I know of a very good man who happened to be a Nazi, a member of the Party, no-less. \n\n \nSchindler was obviously not a believer, thus not a Nazi. \n\n \n And there are Muslims who don't condemn their women to servitude based on the tenets of Islam. I however am not attacking these people, I am attacking Islam itself, the ideology that encourages war, killing, slavery etc, and the people who follow these teachings.\n \n \nFor her to tacitly defend the tenets of Islam that condemn women to being sex-slaves, and below men, is quite amazing. Must be those Kreb cycles!\n \n \nAgain, I don't \"defend the tenets of Islam that condemn women to being sex-slaves\". I support the Muslim women who condemn the use of these passages to support sexist behavior.\n\n \n Then we have something in common (almost), because I am condemning the tenets of Islam that are horrendous, but every time I do you make sweeping statements about Christianity that are generalised, appealing to a 'two wrongs' argument, etc. SO in fact, it seems, only you have a right to criticise religions!\n \n \nAs for your other quotes, again, similar passages could be found in the Old Testament.\n\n \n Where? In what context? I don't know... you're so intent on criticising Christianity that you have no time to rely on facts.\n \nI hope you wouldn't support the stoning to death of adulterous women, and few Christians I know of would. The same goes for Muslims. \n\n \n Bad choice of example, Mizmaxx. Christ said to those who were to stone the adulteress to stop. \n John 8\n 1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. \n 7 But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. \n 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \n 11\"No one, sir,\" she said. \n \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\"\n \n The same can't be said for Muslims. Those who don't stone adulterers are doing so in spite of the Koran.\n \nI don't understand why this book is sacred to them, as I don't get big deal about the Bible, because it's not my faith. However, the practice of being Muslim is not anti-social or harmful, and in fact has for many people been truly life-changing in very positive ways.\n\n Anti-social is not synonymous with a state of being harmful or not.\n \n \nYou can quote passages out of context as much as you like, it just makes you a hypocrite. \n\n Hyperbole, lack of insight as you suggest to defend Islam, by quoting Biblical passages out of context. They are not out of context, the Islamic texts, when we see that there are several states that practice Shar'ia Law.\n \n Statement of faith: \n Many nations practicing Sharia, strict Islamic law, retain the death penalty for adultery.\n http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Adultery\n \n In context....\n \"An Islamic court in Nigeria has dismissed the appeal of a woman who had been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. \n Amina Lawal, a divorcee, was convicted by a court in Katsina state for bearing a child outside marriage. \n Under the Islamic (Sharia) law introduced in the majority Muslim states of northern Nigeria, execution by stoning is the prescribed punishment.\"\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/debates/african/2203988.stm\n \n Statement of faith...\n Kill in the name of your faith...\n \n In context....\n \"Question:\n Are Suicide attacks haram (lawful)? In our country some Alims says that suicide attack leads you to jahhannam (Hell fre).\n Answer:\n Asalaam 'alaikum\n If (the operation) is done for (the sake of) suicide just so that the person can die and run from his difficulties then it is haram (unlawful) of course.\n But if it is done as a tactic of war because there is no other strong mean to resist the enemies then it is of course one of the highest and noblest form of shahadah (martyrdom).\n Wasalaam 'alaikum\n http://www.shareeah.org/eqna/article.php?id=125\n This is a site that supports a return to Sharia law.\n \n \n And as to St.Paul, he alludes to the fact he's got marks. I'm not sure if you genuinely read into this what you do, or you just say these things because it's another barb against commonly held Christian beliefs. He also mentions he's got failing eye-sight etc. \n\n \nSo how can he be both circumcised and uncircumcised at once?\n\n \n In this case circumcision is not just literal, it is that of belonging to God.\n Romans 2\n 27 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. \n 28 A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 29 No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.\n \n Thus you can be 'inwardly' circumcised, that is, in your heart, be committed to God. You can be physically signed to God, but not emotionally.\n \n He repeats this analogy throughout Romans, and in\n 1 Corinthians 7\n 18 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.",

You know that equivalent quotes could be found in the Bible, and even more so in your Holy Tradition. You also know that a book does not define a religion, practice is what defines a religion. I'll bet you would be the first to argue this for Christianity. It's clear who has a bone to pick here- it's you, you have some problem with Muslims.\n \n Nonetheless, because you asked (knowing that I'm going to be accused of being \"anti-Christian\" for responding to your request....)\n \n Here's a good comparison between Biblical God/Yahweh/Jehovah and Koran Allah, pre-compiled-\n \n 1. Whose god has promised the cruelest fate for people of different religions?\n \n Correct Answer: (Both are equally vicious. Both gods have utter disdain for all other religions and condemn the followers of those faiths to eternal damnation.) \"Surely those who disbelieve . . . Allah has set a seal upon their hearts . . . and there is a great punishment for them\" (Koran 2:6-7). \"Surely those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, these it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and men all\" (Koran 2:161). [W]hen the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance of them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord . . . (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). \"[H]e that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him\"(John 3:36).\n \n \n 2. Whose god orders the most violent plight for nonbelievers while on Earth?\n \n Correct Answer: The Christian god because he ordered his followers to kill all those of a different religion, including family members, friends and even their cattle, whereas the Moslem god simply required the enslaving of nonbelievers. \"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods . . . thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people . . . If thou shalt hear . . . Certain men . . . have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods . . . Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants ofthat city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword\" (Deuteronomy13:6-15). \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection\" (Koran 9:29).\n \n \n 3. Whose god orders the cruelest warfare?\n \n Correct Answer: The Christian god because he ordered his followers to kill all the men inthe towns they invaded, enslaving only the women and children (who sometimes were to be slaughtered as well, along with every other living thing insight.)\"So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates\" (Koran 47:4). \"And when the Lord thy God hath delivered [a city] into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones . . . shalt thou take unto thyself . . . But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth\"(Deuteronomy 20:13-16).\n \n \n 4. Whose god has the least pity and most contempt for the enemies of his followers?\n \n Correct Answer: \"And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: Slay utterly old and young, both males, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men who were before the house. And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city\" (Ezekiel 9:5-7). \"Allah does not forbid you respecting those who have not made war against you on account of (your) religion, and have not driven you forth from your homes, that you show them kindness and deal with them justly; surely Allah loves the doers of justice\" (Koran 60:8). \"And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and trust in Allah; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing\" (Koran 8:61).\n \n \n 5. Whose god has more contempt for homosexuals?\n \n Correct Answer: \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them\"(Leviticus 20:13). \"And if two (men) of you commit it, then hurt them both; but if they turn again and amend, leave them alone, verily, God is easily turned, compassionate\" (Koran 4:21). \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God\"(1 Corinthians 6:9-10). \"And there shall wait on them young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls\" (Koran 52:24). \"They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who will seem like scattered pearls to the beholders\" (Koran 76:19).\n \n \n 6. Whose god has prescribed the more vicious physical punishment of sinners?\n \n Correct Answer: The Moslem god because he ordered his followers to apply more lashes to sinners than the Christian god did. \"(As for) the fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them, (giving) a hundred stripes, and let not pity for them detain you in the matter of obedience to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the last day, and let a party of believers witness their chastisement\" (Koran 24:2). \"And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face . . . Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed\"(Deuteronomy 25:2-3).\n \n \n 7. Whose god should you fear most?\n \n Correct Answer: The Christian god because while Allah may be worthy of fear, God not only kills those who rub Him the wrong way but sends them to Hell as well. \"What! will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Apostle, and they attacked you first; do you fear them? But Allah is most deserving that you should fear Him, if you are believers\" (Koran 9:13). \"But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him\" (Luke 12:5). \"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell\" (Matthew 10:28).\n \n \n 8. Whose god places the least value on the lives of women?\n \n Correct Answer: This is basically a wash. Both gods view women as less worthwhile than men. \"Allah enjoins you concerning your children: The male shall have the equal of the portion of two females; then if they are more than two females, shall have two-thirds of what the deceased has left, and if there is one, she shall they have the half\" (Koran 4:11). \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and sayunto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female, ten shekels\" (Leviticus27:1-7).\n \n \n 9. Whose god puts women in their place with the harshest of restrictions on their speech?\n \n Correct Answer: \"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence\" ; (1 Timothy 2:11-12). \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church\" (1Corinthians 14:34-35). \"Allah has heard and accepted the statement of the woman who pleads with you (the Prophet) concerning her husband and carries her complaint to Allah, and Allah hears the arguments between both of you for Allah hears and sees all things\"(Koran 58:1).\n \n \n 10. Whose god is the champion of deceit?\n \n Correct Answer: \"Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors\" (Koran2:26). \"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness\" (2Thessalonians 2:11-12).\n \n Then specifically about sexism- \n \n 1. What is a woman's role in the church?\n \n Correct answer: A woman is never to open her mouth in church. She has nothing valuable to say and should limit her participation to asking her husband to explain things to her. \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church\" (1 Corinthians 14:34-35).\n \n \n 2. What is a woman's role in the educational process?\n \n Correct answer: Women should never be teachers because they are easily deceived. \"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression\" (1 Timothy 2:11-14).\n \n \n 3. Is a wife permitted to follow her own conscience?\n \n Correct answer: A woman must obey her husband in all matters at all times. \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their husbands in every thing\" (Ephesians 5:22-24). \"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God\" (1 Corinthians 11:3). \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord\" (Colossians 3:18).\n \n \n 4. In God's eyes, who is worth more between women and men?\n \n Correct answer: God expressly says men are worth more, and actually provides dollar amounts proving this) \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female, ten shekels\" (Leviticus 27:1-7)\n \n \n 5. What is the role of a widow?\n \n Correct answer: She should be depressed and pray day and night. \"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth\" (1 Timothy 5:5-6).\n \n \n 6. How long is a woman unclean after the messy act of childbirth?\n \n Correct answer: The woman is unclean for seven days if the child is a boy, but she is unclean for twice as long if the child is a girl. \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days . . . But if she bare a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks\" (Leviticus 12:1-5).\n \n \n 7. What are the requirements for a woman's physical appearance?\n \n Correct answer: A woman must dress modestly and refrain from wearing expensive jewelry and a woman should wear her hair long. \"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array\" (1 Timothy 2:9). \"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering\" (1 Corinthians 11:15).\n \n \n 8. Can you trust a woman's promises or guarantees?\n \n Correct answer: No, because women are deceitful and manipulative and because a woman's promise is null and void if her husband disapproves of it. \"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her\" (Ecclesiastes 7:26). \"But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her\" (Numbers 30:12).\n \n \n 9. Under what circumstances are we to spare the life of a married or engaged woman who has been raped?\n \n Correct Answer: When the woman is raped in the country as opposed to the city or when the woman is a slave girl. \"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out onto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city . . . But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die . . . For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her\" (Deuteronomy 22:23-27). And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free\" (Leviticus 19:20).\n \n \n 10. In times of war, what is God's plight for women in the captured areas?\n \n Correct Answer: While the men are to be killed, the women are to be taken as slaves. Pretty women are to become the wives of conquering men who find them attractive. Women in places the Lord gives His chosen people as an inheritance are to be killed along with every other living thing. \"And when the Lord thy God hath delivered [a city] into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones . . . shalt thou take unto thyself . . . But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth\" (Deuteronomy 20:13-16). \"When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies . . . And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house . . . thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife\" (Deuteronomy 21:10-13). \n \n \nBut then all those wishy-washy religions seem the same to me.\n\n \nUnless 'wishy-washy' is a good thing. :)\n\n Bad form, montalban. You know very well that I was responding to you calling wiccanism/witchcraft \"shallow\" in post #15 of the same thread. \n \n \nHow about 'totalitarian'?\n\n As I say in the quote, totalitarianism is not a function of a religion just because some people practice that religion that way. ie, Islam, Christianity, etc.\n \n \nHow about as a sanctifier of slavery?(...) I know some Christians who spoke out against slavery, ipso facto you can't make statements like this one.\n\n I said that there existed Christian texts which sactified slavery, which is a fact, read the Bible. I did not suggest that all Christianity supported slavery, and I would not. \n \n \nYou should stop critiquing them, by your very own argument. You say, when I argue against Islam, that I shouldn't because you know some few good Muslims. \n\n Er, I don't \"argue against\" Christianity the way you \"argue against Islam\", montalban. You equate religious texts with all practitioners- you define the entire spectrum of the religion by selected texts. I am careful not to do that.\n \nYou criticise Catholicism and by logical extension, if you know some good Catholics, you cant' criticise it.\n\n The only good Catholics I know critique Catholicism, in particular historically, and I support them and agree.\n \n \nAnd to top it all off - it's based on, according to you, a fictional character... therefore undermining it's very right to exist as a real religion - instead suggesting that all Christians are delusional.\n\n As I said (repeatedly), \n \n - the fact that no evidence exists of something does not make it true\n - faith is not based on evidence, so my arguments on the mythological Christ are for the non-Christian person who formerly believed in a historical, not divine, Jesus Christ\n \n Besides, it makes total sense that I don't believe in a Christ, just as I don't believe in Allah, or Yahweh, or Moloch. That's not my faith, and I'm entitled to debate it. I don't make sweeping generalisations about Christianity, I only refer to historical events. You seem to feel that even mentioning any of the terrible things which have been done in the name of Christianity makes me \"anti-Christian\". On the contrary, I am a historian and student of religious studies. I am fascinated by all mythologies, and I see Christianity as basically similar to Judaism and Islam, no more or less \"bad\". \n \n Your vendetta against me seems to be based not on behavior on my part, but on the very fact that I dare to disagree with you. I wonder why you bother with a debate forum if you are so touchy about healthy debate....\n \n \nI am attacking Islam itself, the ideology that encourages war, killing, slavery etc, and the people who follow these teachings.\n\n You see, that is exactly the difference between your attacks on Islam, and my critiques of Christianity. Yours are attacks, mine are critiques.\n \n \nBad choice of example, Mizmaxx. Christ said to those who were to stone the adulteress to stop. \n\n In one case, but not all Christians believe that this makes the former rules unapplicable. Or else perhaps we should chuck the OT?\n \n \nAnti-social is not synonymous with a state of being harmful or not.\n\n I wasn't writing them as synonyms.\n \n \nIn this case circumcision is not just literal, it is that of belonging to God.\n\n That is the interpretation you believe....",

   "The only way what you say could make any sense at all is if you define praying as the act of saying certain specific words in order, regardless of context or intent. The rest of us would recognize that the angel was greeting Mary, and that that greeting was then incorporated into a standard prayer.\n\n \n You associate prayer as a form of worship in a rather odd way. Prayer is a form of spiritual communication.\n \n I can pray for you, without worshipping you. I can ask you as a friend to pray for me, without worshipping you. Thus I can pray to Mary asking her to intercede on my behalf, and that's like asking you to pray for me. And how better to pray to her, to ask her in the very words the Angel addressed her with?\n \n We use the very words (which are in fact what my signature says; albeit in Gaelic) Hail Mary Full of Grace, because May is to be hailed, as the Angel of the Lord did, and she is full of grace - as the Angel of the Lord said.\n \n Further to that, we can see that it's a request on our behalf because it concludes \" Holy mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen\"\n \n We pray to her to pray for us.\n \n Mary said herself, in the Gospel of Luke that she would be blessed throughout the ages...\n In fact she says \"Mary's Song \n Luke 1:46 And Mary said: \n \"My soul glorifies the Lord \n 47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, \n 48for he has been mindful \n of the humble state of his servant. \n From now on all generations will call me blessed, \n 49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- \n holy is his name. \n 50His mercy extends to those who fear him, \n from generation to generation. \n 51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; \n he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.\"\n 52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones \n but has lifted up the humble. \n 53 He has filled the hungry with good things \n but has sent the rich away empty. \n 54 He has helped his servant Israel, \n remembering to be merciful \n 55 to Abraham and his descendants forever, \n even as he said to our fathers.\" \n So, does this mean, by your logic, she is worshipping herself?",

   "Part 1 now, part 2 later on\n \nThere is every reason to believe that Muslim countries are sexist because those that follow Muslim law state that a woman's testimony in a court is worth half that of a man's. That woman who is raped, needs four male witnesses in order to attain a conviction. \n\n \nAgain, the same could be said for following Hebrew law, or Christian law. Most Muslims I know do not interpret these passages literally, as most Christians and Jews do with their archaic holy laws. As I've said a few times before.\n\n Yes, you've said it a number of times, without actual recourse to facts (though you do introduce some below). Where in Christ's message do you find him stating that a woman needs 4 witnesses to get a conviction in a rape trial? This is something you don't touch upon with any references at all.\n Why do you ignore it when a Muslim nation, following Islamic teachings condemns a rape-victim to be stoned to death on a charge of adultery?\n \nYou do make that presumption about Christianity. \n\n \nWhere have you got me quoted saying \"all Christians are sexist\"? \n\n Nice bait switch - from Christianity to Christians. You continually judge Christianity as sexist, and that women have struggled against it, and have somewhat succeeded. Don't play coy now. (I'd rather use that word, than dishonest)\n \nAnd there's the rub you are prepared to judge Christianity as being sexist but no other religion gets this treatment, because you are intensely anti-Christian. \n\n \n Again, where's your evidence for these broad accusations? How do you know I don't critique sexism in \"other religions\"?\n\n At best you argue that all are sexist (despite your previous comment to the contrary), and make relativist arguments to this effect; that we can't for example criticise Islam, because Christianity is guilty of the same faults. You state this in your very first comment on this post - that you can find the same problems in Hebrew law, Christian law etc. You have become unravelled within the space of three paragraphs.\n \nYou have continually judged the religion. You continually judge Christians. \n\n \n Given that I am gifted with such sound judgement, I figure I may as well not waste it.\n\n Ah, Americans, so modest\n \n Seriously, where does the idea come from that \"judgement\" itself is a bad thing? Without judgement, we are mindless automatons. Of course I \"judge\" Christians. I \"judge\" everything. You have yet to demonstrate that I judge Christians unfairly, or falsely.\n\n I have demonstrated this. You continually make relativist arguments based on sweeping statements. I know you possess such sound judgment (see your previous statement) that you don't need to do something as common as present evidence.\n It is quite vile the lengths you go to in order to attack Christianity, by argument of association; like 'sure Islam might be bad, but so are all religions (except my own)'.\n \nSure, and as I exampled, there were different types of Nazis, so, by your logic Nazism itself is not bad. \n\n \nAnd as I replied, the only \"good\" Nazi you could come up with was not a \"Nazi\" at all. An equivalent example would be someone who called themselves Christian only in order to escape being burned as a heretic, but who did everything in their power to go against the church. You would call them a Christian? \n\n Let's look at this closely.\n Your argument is that Islam can't be criticised because there are some good Muslims.\n However,\n Nazism can be criticised because any good Nazis weren't really Nazis.\n You don't seem to have a problem that there people who you call Muslims who don't practice Islamic tenets with regards to killing, who don't belittle women etc. They are in fact like Oscar Schindler was to the Nazi Party - they are good despite the tenets of their ideology.\n You are in fact applying therefore applying the same measure to give totally different results. In one case the exceptions prove the rule, and in the other, they don't.\n \n Who says I am judging Muslims? I am judging Islam. \n\n \nThen you should not object to all Christianity being judged by the words of the Bible.\n\n It is interesting that I can address this now, before we view your so-called evidence.\n a) The Orthodox Church is not a sola scriptura church. We don't base all our beliefs on the Bible, and do in fact believe that the Bible is best interpreted in the context of our church (you need to know this before you start telling me what I believe in)\n b) some of the laws of the Bible are recognised as for a particular time. And here again your argument fails. You know full well that Christians such as myself don't follow the laws of Moses because we know these laws were for a specific time - for the Jews, until Jesus came to fulfil the law - however, this won't stop you quoting them.\n And this is the important point. Islam makes no such distinction. They believe that the teachings of the Koran are for all time. That is Islamic teaching itself. If you know some people who don't live out these Islamic tenets then they are being like Oscar Schindler; following their conscience in spite of the teachings of their ideology.\n Why do we believe in the whole church's teaching? Because people by themselves say incorrect things. We acknowledge all people are human and even people such as St. Augustine of Hippo, and even St. Peter, and St. Paul made mistakes.\n \nNo, not at all. I am simply stating your views of your own 'religion' which you continually say doesn't really have 'gods' and other explanations etc are too simplistic.(...) Befuddled, I remain. \n\n \n*shrug* Your lack of understanding is not my problem. I answered your questions. Ask more if you want. I can't help that our beliefs are so different.\n\n I don't know if you know what you believe in. Do you have a catechism I can read? I ask you what you believe, then you say something then reverse this and say it's too simple an explanation - one you gave. Which Native American group do you belong? I am Antiochian Orthodox (in Australia it's a very small Orthodox branch). I'd be interest to know if men and women play the same roles in your tribe's spirituality.\n \n I gave you reasons. I went to the trouble of getting quotes. What do you do?(...) Supposition. \n\n \nLol, Montalban. You know that equivalent quotes could be found in the Bible, and even more so in your Holy Tradition. You also know that a book does not define a religion, practice is what defines a religion. I'll bet you would be the first to argue this for Christianity. It's clear who has a bone to pick here- it's you, you have some problem with Muslims.\n\n More supposition\n \n Finally, here's your attempt at proof...which I preface by stating the distinct hypocrisy you now embark upon. You accused me of taking Islamic texts out of context (which I did not do - see my last post where I gave a teaching, and then a context). However, what are you going to do - take them out of context yourself. And, worse still, you're going to suggest how my church interprets them.\n \n Nonetheless, because you asked (knowing that I'm going to be accused of being \"anti-Christian\" for responding to your request....)\n Here's a good comparison between Biblical God/Yahweh/Jehovah and Koran Allah, pre-compiled-\n 1. Whose god has promised the cruellest fate for people of different religions?\n Correct Answer: (Both are equally vicious. Both gods have utter disdain for all other religions and condemn the followers of those faiths to eternal damnation.)\n\n That's your interpretation...My church does not teach that God is cruel. We teach God is love. And we teach that this love is extended to all. Muslims teach that if any love comes from their god, it's too some believers of Islam.\n \n That is why there are laws in Islamic nations against preaching any other religion, but Islam.\n Why also, there are laws against converting from Islam.\n \n ?Surely those who disbelieve . . . Allah has set a seal upon their hearts . . . and there is a great punishment for them? (Koran 2:6-7). ?Surely those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, these it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and men all? (Koran 2:161). [W]hen the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance of them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord . . . (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). ?[H]e that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him?(John 3:36).\n\n And where is God? See Romans 2:15 since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them. Those who do not follow their good conscious do not know God.\n As to John 3: 36, you know full well, as I've stated this before that Orthodoxy does not condemn non-Christians. We don't practice this verse as you would want us to.\n You then post a number of things from the Old Testament...before getting back to the New... (as I said, you're not interested in context; something you have the hide to accuse me of).\n \n 7. Whose god should you fear most?\n Correct Answer: The Christian god because while Allah may be worthy of fear, God not only kills those who rub Him the wrong way but sends them to Hell as well. ?What! will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Apostle, and they attacked you first; do you fear them? But Allah is most deserving that you should fear Him, if you are believers? (Koran 9:13). ?But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him? (Luke 12:5). ?And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell? (Matthew 10:28).\n\n So?\n \n8. Whose god places the least value on the lives of women?\n Correct Answer: This is basically a wash. Both gods view women as less worthwhile than men. ?Allah enjoins you concerning your children: The male shall have the equal of the portion of two females; then if they are more than two females, shall have two-thirds of what the deceased has left, and if there is one, she shall they have the half? (Koran 4:11). \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female, ten shekels\" (Leviticus 27:1-7).\n\n Back to quoting Mosaic law. Do Orthodox follow the selling of women? No. Do we teach this passage as something we should do? No. Therefore irrelevant. Do Muslims teach that Muhammad was the best example of a man who ever lived - someone today's generations should emulate? Yes.\n Native Americans had slavery. Does this mean that you think slavery is okay? Should I make your weird argument against you? Maybe I will, later :)\n \n9. Whose god puts women in their place with the harshest of restrictions on their speech?\n Correct Answer: ?Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence\" ; (1 Timothy 2:11-12). \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church\" (1 Corinthians 14:34-35). \"Allah has heard and accepted the statement of the woman who pleads with you (the Prophet) concerning her husband and carries her complaint to Allah, and Allah hears the arguments between both of you for Allah hears and sees all things?(Koran 58:1).\n\n So, firstly you've got a hide comparing apples to chalk here. You know full well that St. Paul suggesting what he believes about what a woman should do in a church is nothing compared to Muhammad sleeping with a child. St. Paul is not 'the most ideal man', and in fact we can disagree with him.\n Secondly, this is proofed by the fact that my former church's choir leader is a woman. I already gave you texts where-by the church itself is equated to a woman. That the most highly revered wholly human person (i.e. - not God), is Mary.\n Let's now turn the tables on Native Americans...\n \"Indeed, the roles of men and women were so different that the two sexes were almost like different species. Consistent with this basic assumption, men and women kept themselves separate from each other to a very great extent. They seem, in fact, to have preferred to carry out their day-to-day activities apart from each other. During the day the women worked with each other around their households, while the men resorted to their town house or square ground. Separation was most important in activities which in their view epitomized sexual identity. We have already seen, for example, that warriors kept themselves apart from women for three days before going on a raid. And women kept themselves apart from men when they menstruated and gave birth. This ideological separation of the sexes was further reflected in their value on sexual abstinence.\" (Hudson, 260)\"\n \"WHEN CHEROKEES WERE CHEROKEE\"\n http://www.angelfire.com/ok4/oukah7/\n \n10. Whose god is the champion of deceit?\n\n You are the champion of deceit.\n \n Correct Answer: ?Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors? (Koran 2:26). ?And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness? (2 Thessalonians 2:11-12).\n\n Do Christians teach that God is a deceiver? No.\n \nThen specifically about sexism- \n\n Even if what you are about to suggest were true, then you exhibit a distinct lack of proportion. The worst offences you are accusing Christians of are\n i) that women should be quiet in church\n ii) and have their heads covered, whilst in church.\n iii) women should not teach\n compare this to the teachings of Islam...\n a) sex with under-aged girls\n b) sex slaves\n c) polygamy\n d) instant divorce\n e) beating of women.\n With regards to a) Christianity urged an end to the pagan practice of child prostitution\n However, let's look at your posts...\n \n1. What is a woman's role in the church? Correct answer: A woman is never to open her mouth in church. She has nothing valuable to say and should limit her participation to asking her husband to explain things to her. \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church\" (1 Corinthians 14:34-35).\n\n And do Christians believe that a woman should be silent in Church? No. As mentioned, we have choristers in Church that sing, and pray.\n \"Not only were Christian women prominent in the churches membership and were recognized to be so by Christians and pagans: In Rome c200 we have a precious insight into their social status and balance in the community.\" Fox, R L (1986) \"Pagans and Christians\", p308\n Note the early year referred to.\n \n2. What is a woman's role in the educational process?\n Correct answer: Women should never be teachers because they are easily deceived. \"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression\" (1 Timothy 2:11-14).\n\n The question itself is inappropriate to the answer. The question is \"What is St. Paul's idea of the role in the education of women?\" And why...?\n \"If Paul mentioned 40 names in his letters -- of individuals (and if we must assume that these individuals are fellow workers) -- and talked about the big missionary enterprise of which there are dozens of people or participants, well, of those 40 people, 16 are women. That's a considerable proportion of women involved in the Pauline missionary effort. \n There was no problem. I don't think Paul had any problem with women. But the society had a problem with women in leadership, and the problem with women in leadership in the society became aggravated in the following generation, because there was one way in which women could buy in the religious communities their freedom and independence and leadership, and that was by giving up their roles as wives and mothers, and that is clear in the second century controversy with Gnosticism.\"\n http://www.bibletexts.com/terms/women01.htm\n And what do Christians actually practice? Compare for context the educational opportunities of women in a Christian nation compared to that in a nation practicing Islamic law. What is the context of this? That's right, you offer no context - you're quite happy to do what you accuse me of!\n \n3. Is a wife permitted to follow her own conscience?\n Correct answer: A woman must obey her husband in all matters at all times. \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their husbands in every thing\" (Ephesians 5:22-24). \n\n This is the key passage that debunks your argument, not that you'd know from the editing out of the important bits...\n Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savoir. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30 for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[3] 32 This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\n \"Christian women also exercised far more choice in whom they wed...\"Carroll, V & Shiflett, D (2002), \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against Anti-Religious Bigotry\", p4\n It's mutual obligation. \"In fact what distinguished Paul from his non-Christian contemporaries was not the patriarchal views he sometimes expressed...but rather his repeated emphasis on the obligations of husbands to wives.\" Ibid, p5\n \n\"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God\" (1 Corinthians 11:3). \n\n No, it doesn't say 'at all times'. It says 'as the church is subject unto Christ'. So, hypothetically, if the husband said to his wife \"Kill my enemy\" that would not be like the Church relates to Christ, and therefore is not covered by your interpretation.\n Look at little further into Corinthians\n 1 Corinthians 11:11\n In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.\n Again, let's look at Native Americans\n \"In the past, in all tribes women were valued for their skills. They brought forth the future nation and contributed as much as 80% of the labor needed to produce the family food supply.\"\n http://www.ldb.org/indheal.htm\n 50% of the population doing 80% of the work, sounds fair!\n \n\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord\" (Colossians 3:18).\n\n Another one you judiciously quote\n 18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. \n 19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. \n 20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.\n Islam says you may beat your wives.\n \n You missed a good example (I suppose because it doesn't help your case)...\n 1 Peter 3:7\n Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.\n \n4. In God's eyes, who is worth more between women and men?\n Correct answer: God expressly says men are worth more, and actually provides dollar amounts proving this) \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female, ten shekels\" (Leviticus 27:1-7)\n\n Harking back to the Old Testament. Irrelevant passage with regard to practice in my church.\n Let's ignore the context and just go straight in for the low blow...\n \"Native women performed so many tasks that to the settlers, they appeared to be slaves. For example, the title on this 1880s stereocard is ?Women?s rights? followed by the elaboration: ?An Indian?s idea of the same. Showing two squaws sitting beside their Teepe [sic], resting after carrying the wood seen beside them . . . while their leige [sic] lords and masters, (the noble red men,) are smoking.?\n http://photoswest.org/exhib/gallery4/daily.htm\n It's just as valid me using this kind of argument as you do with quoting Old Testament stuff to me.\n \n 5. What is the role of a widow?\n Correct answer: She should be depressed and pray day and night. \"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth\" (1 Timothy 5:5-6).\n\n Again a mockery that your source says \"correct answer\"\n One needs to look at more of the whole chapter than the little you give...\n 1 Timothy 5\n Advice About Widows, Elders and Slaves \n 1 Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, 2 older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. \n (Note straight away... treat all older women as your mother, with honour! But now let's look how Christians are urged first to take care of their own family, and if widows have no family, to be looked after by the Christian community...)\n 3 Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. 4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. 5 The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. 6 But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 7 Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame. 8 If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. \n 9 No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, 10 and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. \n 11 As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. 12 Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. 13 Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. 14 So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. 15 Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. \n 16 If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need. \n \n6. How long is a woman unclean after the messy act of childbirth?\n Correct answer: The woman is unclean for seven days if the child is a boy, but she is unclean for twice as long if the child is a girl. \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days . . . But if she bare a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks\" (Leviticus 12:1-5).\n\n I am unaware of Orthodox teaching on this, but just to juxtapose it...\n this interesting little conversation...\n \"It's your period!\" I chuckle, pretentiously. \"You're taboo! Indians isolate menstruating women. They regard them as unclean, with dangerous powers.\" \n \"You're stupid!\" she scoffs. \"Indians will welcome me; they're my people.\" \n I yank some old textbooks off my shelf, to bolster my point. \n \"Menstrual fluid pollutes the world,\" I laugh, paraphrasing page 371 of Harold Driver's Indians of North America.\n \"Tribes will cover you with a blanket!\" I cackle, perusing James Frazer's, The Golden Bough, page 599. \n \"You're forbidden to pound acorns, enter sweat lodges, attend ceremonies, or mingle with hunters or shamans,\" I chortle, narrating the Smithsonian's Handbook of North American Indians, and Oglala Women by Marla Powers.\n http://www.gettingit.com/article/677\n \"Many Native American societies publicly celebrated a girl's first menstruation. For instance, the parents of girls among the Luise\u00f1o Indians of Southern California proudly announced to the community that their daughters were becoming women. The girls were partly buried in heated sand. They were not permitted to scratch themselves or eat salt, and they were given instructions by older women about the physiological changes that were occurring and how to behave as a woman and wife. For most North American girls today, public announcements that they had begun menstruating would be considered humiliating. However, it was a matter of personal and family pride in many Native American cultures.\"\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/social/soc_4.htm\n \"Starting with a girl's first menses in Native tradition, a woman's bleeding time was honored as inherently sacred, a spiritual calling her body made visible. \"Ancient mythology/spirituality envisions the fragile, vulnerable and utterly perishable body as indistinct from soul.\" (3) During her moon time, so called because it occurred during the darkness of the new moon, she was relieved of her daily responsibilities by family and relatives to spend these 4-5 days resting, praying, being cared for in the moon lodge tipi with other women.\"\n http://www.ofspirit.com/florencegaia1.htm\n \"...women on their Moon Time do not participate in Lakota ceremony...\"\n http://www.buffalodreaming.com/lakota.html (anyone can judiciously edit).\n I confess this was in fact the hardest subject to research as the terms I used kept throwing up porn sites in the search results; even with the words \"Native American\" added\n \n7. What are the requirements for a woman's physical appearance?\n Correct answer: A woman must dress modestly and refrain from wearing expensive jewellery and a woman should wear her hair long. \"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array\" (1 Timothy 2:9). \"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering\" (1 Corinthians 11:15).\n\n Yes, a woman must dress modestly. I don't see why you have a problem with that.\n Did Native American women wear modest clothing? Or did they go around nude?\n \n8. Can you trust a woman's promises or guarantees?\n Correct answer: No, because women are deceitful and manipulative and because a woman's promise is null and void if her husband disapproves of it. \"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her\" (Ecclesiastes 7:26). \"But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her\" (Numbers 30:12).\n\n Social context, please...\n \n9. Under what circumstances are we to spare the life of a married or engaged woman who has been raped?\n Correct Answer: When the woman is raped in the country as opposed to the city or when the woman is a slave girl. \"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out onto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city . . . But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die . . . For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her\" (Deuteronomy 22:23-27). And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free\" (Leviticus 19:20).\n\n Again with the Old Testament (see above)\n However...\n \"The Native American family is an extended one that includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, as well as adopted relatives. The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family. Native American families are very close. If domestic violence occurs, the family is expected to take care of the problem. If a Native American woman goes outside the family for help, she is ostracized by her family and the batterer's family.\"\n http://www.msnusers.com/WomenandAbuse/nativeamericanwomen.msnw\n also\n \"Native American spirituality can be a source of profound support, comfort, and healing for many battered women. According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition, it can also serve to keep them in abusive relationships. The idea of connectedness to the earth and to each other is frequently used by the batterer and other family members as a reason for the woman to remain in a violent relationship.\"(Ibid.)\n Probably why\n \"Native American women experience the highest rate of violence of any group in the United States\"\n http://www.libertadlatina.org/native%20american%20women%20and%20violence.htm\n Ouch!\n \n10. In times of war, what is God's plight for women in the captured areas?\n Correct Answer: While the men are to be killed, the women are to be taken as slaves. Pretty women are to become the wives of conquering men who find them attractive. Women in places the Lord gives His chosen people as an inheritance are to be killed along with every other living thing. \"And when the Lord thy God hath delivered [a city] into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones . . . shalt thou take unto thyself . . . But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth\" (Deuteronomy 20:13-16). \"When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies . . . And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house . . . thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife\" (Deuteronomy 21:10-13). \n\n Where did you get this information from? I think passing off someone else's tripe as your own is dishonest.\n To be continued",

   "There are a lot of misperceptions about Orthodox and RC views toward Mary. While it is possible for individuals to effectively 'worship' Mary, such worship is not found in the teachings of either church.\n \n The idea is similar to asking someone else to pray for you. If you believe, as the Catholic church teaches, that individuals go to heaven, then it is reasonable to believe that these individuals are 'closer' to God than we are while we are on earth. According to the Catholic church, Mary has a unique relationship with God as the mother of Jesus. It is reasonable to believe that no one could be more united with Jesus than his own mother.\n \n Therefore, from this perspective, it makes sense to ask Mary to pray for us. Just as it makes sense to ask the saints to pray for us. The words used to communicate this to Mary and the saints may be called 'prayers.' But they do not indicate a worship of the intended receiver of the communication.\n \n Make any sense?",

   "Part 2 as promised\n In effect Mizmaxx, you are doing what you accuse me of with regards to Islam. Taking things out of context. I have given you Islamic texts -and shown you contexts of how these words are put in place, now. Most notably, how a woman, the victim of a rape was treated, based on readings of Islamic texts. You then quote stuff from the Mosaic laws and try and suggest that I follow them. I don't. The Orthodox Church doesn't. And it is really dishonest of you to pretend that we do.\n I have given you Islamic teachings, with these teachings being put into practice. You have acted very hypocritical - you (falsely) accuse me of doing something, then do it yourself!\n And the really good thing is when someone asks you about your own religion (as I have) you give double-speak - love is your god, no, that's too simplistic. Then you state that there are many different Native American spiritualities, but despite this, non-Natives should keep away from sweats (you speak for all!) You state that science is catching up with your spirituality - which is a neat trick, considering that you believe there are many different Native American Spiritualities; science is backing them all up, I suppose.\n \"Aztec human sacrifice\"\n http://nv.essortment.com/aztecsacrifice_raif.htm\n As a native American Indian you must argue now that the descendants of the Aztec believe in human sacrifice.\n You haven't also heard of Native American women having a 'menstrual lodge', separation of women during this phase.\n What about scarification of minors? Do you practice that?\n \nBut then all those wishy-washy religions seem the same to me. \n\n \nBad form, Montalban. You know very well that I was responding to you calling wiccanism/witchcraft \"shallow\" in post #15 of the same thread. \n\n So what? I meant what I said about wiccanism, I don't like it. I make no bones about it. Are you now saying you didn't mean what you said? How is that bad form? I quote you attacking Christianity as wishy-washy. You say you're not anti-Christian, perhaps you're just against all other religions. However, when you list all these 'faults' with Christianity, then say you're not anti-Christian, I find the two acts hard to reconcile.\n \nHow about as a sanctifier of slavery?(...) I know some Christians who spoke out against slavery, ipso facto you can't make statements like this one. \n\n \nI said that there existed Christian texts which sanctified slavery, which is a fact, read the Bible. I did not suggest that all Christianity supported slavery, and I would not. \n\n In the context of your attacks on Christianity, I find this attempt to put a spin on your argument with a qualifying statement rather odd.\n This is like me showing that Native Americans undertook human sacrifice to prove that you believe in it.\n Let's look closely how I do argue...\n As to Muhammad. I showed evidence the he slept with an under-age girl; evidence from Islamic sources. I have shown evidence that Muhammad is viewed by Muslims to be the ideal man; evidence also from Muslim sites. I have stated that a religious spiritual leader of our own era, the Ayatollah Khommeni married, when he was 20 and she was 10. You have therefore; source, example, continued practice.\n But you don't see that. You just see me as anti-Islamic, taking things out of context, and to prove this... what do you do? You take things out of context.\n \nYou should stop critiquing them, by your very own argument. You say, when I argue against Islam, that I shouldn't because you know some few good Muslims. \n \n \nEr, I don't \"argue against\" Christianity the way you \"argue against Islam\", Montalban. You equate religious texts with all practitioners- you define the entire spectrum of the religion by selected texts. I am careful not to do that.\n\n Yes, you do argue out of context. You take passages out of context; and then you tell me how we interpret them; further to that I have pointed out that Orthodoxy doesn't hold the Bible up as the only source of truth. In fact, when we started debating you didn't even know what Orthodox meant... mistaking me for a Catholic.\n I give Islamic passages and context of them being lived out in the now. You try to even tell me how to interpret biblical passages - both above with reference to the Old Testament, and below, with the Pauline ideas of ''circumscion'.\n \nAnd to top it all off - it's based on, according to you, a fictional character... therefore undermining it's very right to exist as a real religion - instead suggesting that all Christians are delusional.\n\n \nAs I said (repeatedly), \n - the fact that no evidence exists of something does not make it true\n - faith is not based on evidence, so my arguments on the mythological Christ are for the non-Christian person who formerly believed in a historical, not divine, Jesus Christ\n Besides, it makes total sense that I don't believe in a Christ, just as I don't believe in Allah, or Yahweh, or Moloch. That's not my faith, and I'm entitled to debate it. I don't make sweeping generalisations about Christianity, I only refer to historical events. You seem to feel that even mentioning any of the terrible things which have been done in the name of Christianity makes me \"anti-Christian\". On the contrary, I am a historian and student of religious studies. I am fascinated by all mythologies, and I see Christianity as basically similar to Judaism and Islam, no more or less \"bad\". \n\n Oh come off it. You're trying to suggest that Christians don't need to know that Christ really existed. That's lamentable logic. Sometimes when you write these things I'm not sure if you're serious. If you're unconcerned about the historicalness of Jesus, then why even bother introducing arguments against it? For you, it's a dead issue. For Christians, it's important. Therefore the only reason you should do so is to attempt to upset Christians by suggesting that their notions are all false... (to at least bring them down to pure mythology).\n \nYour vendetta against me seems to be based not on behaviour on my part, but on the very fact that I dare to disagree with you. I wonder why you bother with a debate forum if you are so touchy about healthy debate....\n\n You don't believe in 'healthy' debate. At best your idea of debate is to say virtually nothing about your own beliefs, and then criticise everyone else's based on you own smugness that Native American culture was balanced and all inclusive etc. until it got ripped apart from you by Christians. You have a massive axe to grind... you said once you're an ex-Catholic, and that you're familiar with Catholicism\n Post 6 \"Religious Tolerance\" thread\n \nMy tradition has survived Catholicism's violence and stupidity, and will continue despite any ***-hole pope's pathetic babbling. In the end, your body will be helped by maggots and worms back to the earth of it's creation, even you can't escape that truth.\n\n (this is one of the posts where you mistake me for being a Catholic) \n This is what is called 'probable cause'; your hate of Christianity.\n Post 8\n \"Religious Tolerance\" thread\n \nI think respecting someone's belief that I am evil would be a little insane.\n I respect other people's rights, and their beliefs, so long as their beliefs aren't harmful to others. I believe that Orthodox Catholicism is harmful as it encourages hate. I also believe that racism and other hateful \"beliefs\" do not deserve my respect.\n Further, I have the knowledge of someone who comes from a Catholic family so I also know way too much about it. It also means I'm allowed to hate Catholicism.\n So, I respectfully disagree with you.\n (emphasis mine)\n This is what's called 'the smoking gun'. :)\n I think you're rather bitter about it. You have an 'essentialist' notion about Native American culture which seems to be based on the film \"Dances with Wolves\"\n \nI am attacking Islam itself, the ideology that encourages war, killing, slavery etc, and the people who follow these teachings. \n\n \nYou see, that is exactly the difference between your attacks on Islam, and my critiques of Christianity. Yours are attacks, mine are critiques.\n\n I think you are being pedantic. When I say the word attack, I am not urging violence etc.\n \n Bad choice of example, Mizmaxx. Christ said to those who were to stone the adulteress to stop. \n\n \nIn one case, but not all Christians believe that this makes the former rules unapplicable. Or else perhaps we should chuck the OT?\n\n You're kidding, again. Christ directs people not to stone the adulteress, setting an example, but because He only did it once Christians don't need to follow Him? Surely the Last Supper - He did that only once. He got baptised only once. These then need never be continued again?\n Are you suggesting that if He says it twice, we should believe it? Or thrice? What? Orthodox Christians, as the ones who compiled the Bible have a right to interpret it. You argue that you don't want non-Natives stuffing around with your spirituality, but you seem quite happy to tell me how I should interpret mine.\n What do you mean 'we' chuck out the OT, you don't even believe it. As I have said (repeatedly) the laws of the OT were for a particular time... if they weren't then the Mosaic laws would have been in Genesis 1 - when Adam was created. Instead, generations passed before God gave the Jews 'the law'. Why? Because the clamoured for it. They wanted structure. Then, they got bogged down in it, endlessly arguing over whether rescuing an ox down a well on a Sabbath was considered 'work'. Jesus came to fulfil the law, and to free them of it.\n As I said...\n \nIn Orthodox Church we don't read from the Old Testament.\n\n \nIn this case circumcision is not just literal, it is that of belonging to God. \n\n \nThat is the interpretation you believe....\n\n You mean you as in you (plural) because the Orthodox Church teaches it. You want to interpret it differently, that's up to you, but it's rather hypocritical that you should suggest that you, an outsider, are better able to interpret my beliefs.\n SO in the end Mizmaxx, you have this massive axe to grind against Christianity. Although you say you respect other people's beliefs, you're quite happy to post rubbish that our beliefs are based on false assumptions. You accuse me of taking Islamic texts out of context - and to prove it, you make the same type of argument. You feel I am unjust to criticise Islam, based on the fact you know a few good Muslims. Yet, as we know there are a few Nazis who didn't kill Jews, in fact one prominent one who saved them, you argue that the reverse, that they are the exceptions. And why? Because you hate Catholics.",

   "There are a lot of misperceptions about Orthodox and RC views toward Mary. While it is possible for individuals to effectively 'worship' Mary, such worship is not found in the teachings of either church.\n \n The idea is similar to asking someone else to pray for you. If you believe, as the Catholic church teaches, that individuals go to heaven, then it is reasonable to believe that these individuals are 'closer' to God than we are while we are on earth. According to the Catholic church, Mary has a unique relationship with God as the mother of Jesus. It is reasonable to believe that no one could be more united with Jesus than his own mother.\n \n Therefore, from this perspective, it makes sense to ask Mary to pray for us. Just as it makes sense to ask the saints to pray for us. The words used to communicate this to Mary and the saints may be called 'prayers.' But they do not indicate a worship of the intended receiver of the communication.\n \n Make any sense?\n\n \n I agree. Mary understood this when she predicted that generations would call her blessed (Luke 1:48). No other person can know Jesus like she did. I have in fact read odd (by our standards) cravings of Irish nuns who wish that they had been able to breast-feed the Lord... to have that connection that a mother knows towards her child.",

   "Context...\n Post 81\n \nHail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee\n Blessed art thou amongst women\n Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus\n Holy Mary, Mother of God\n Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our deaths\n Amen\n \n I actually know that by heart. It is prayer. Prayer is worship. I don't care how you sweet talk about it. I am not treading there. That we are to worship none but him is clear - and that is where my prayers will go and nowhere else\n\n \n Post 91\n \nThe first words of this are from the Bible, spoken by an angel to Mary. By your reasoning then, an angel sent by God, is worshipping Mary.\n\n \n The accusation by jitobear is that by praying to Mary, we are worshipping her. I suggested that Gabriel, when saying \"Hail Mary...\" was not worshipping her.\n \n Post 92 you respond to my response to jitobear\n \nThe only way what you say could make any sense at all is if you define praying as the act of saying certain specific words in order, regardless of context or intent. The rest of us would recognize that the angel was greeting Mary, and that that greeting was then incorporated into a standard prayer.\n\n \n You entered the debate, true you only address me, but you started by answering for Jitobear... you do so by using my post 91 in your response in post 92. This is the key to the whole issue. You directly quoted my response to her. If you were starting a new stream of thought, you'd not have associated yourself with the argument she and I were having.\n \n I pointed out this in Post 97, but would have thought you'd realise it, having arleady associated my response (post 91) with your address (post 92).\n I said\n \nYour interjection needs be put in context of what I and the Protestant person were saying.\n\n \n Post 98\n You deny you entered into the conversation I was having with her...\n \nSo you take what I say, and you take what someone else says, and you glom it together and attribute it all to me? Interesting.\n\n \n I stated this in post 102\n \n I don't attribute it all to you, but when you continue someone else's critique - by jumping in where they left off - then you are bound to be swept up in the rebuttal. As predicted, you are here because you think you're on a winner. Run with it. The person you responded for was suggesting we worship Mary. He is wrong. You are wrong for replying to my reply to them. You ought have asked your own question, or read what they'd been saying.\n\n \n However my mistake is, as you have just pointed out... I said \"the person you responded to\"... \"instead of the person you responded for.\"\n \n Your mistake is directly entering an argument I'm having with someone else, clearly associating yourself with it, by quoting my response and then suggesting you're on a totally different set of ideas... when in fact you are actually arguing the idea I put forward makes no sense.\n \n And all of this, as I said, is because you think you're on a winner - hence this is the only time you've directly responded to any of my posts for about 3 weeks. I am just as small minded with you and will continue to debate you on this until my holidays are up. :)\n \n So, getting back to the topic. Jitobear says praying to Mary is worshipping her. Gabriel prayed to her, but he was not worshipping her - you think this doesn't make sense. We are using the same words in the form of a prayer, and we are not worshipping her; just as when the angel used these words, he was not worshipping her.",

   "Why do you ignore it when a Muslim nation, following Islamic teachings condemns a rape-victim to be stoned to death on a charge of adultery?\n\n Because despite being written in the Quran, it is not followed as a universal \"Islamic teaching\".\n \n \nYou continually judge Christianity as sexist, and that women have struggled against it, and have somewhat succeeded.\n\n Find where I say that Christianity, as a whole, is sexist. I don't. I do say that many Christian groups have been very sexist and remain so. I do say that the history of the major Christian churches are rife with horrendous displays of violent sexism. Because that's the truth. Pardon me for referring to facts.... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAt best you argue that all are sexist (despite your previous comment to the contrary), and make relativist arguments to this effect; that we can't for example criticise Islam, because Christianity is guilty of the same faults.\n\n I never said it was wrong to criticise the actions of any individuals behaving in sexist or otherwise harmful ways. However, your self-described \"attack on Islam\" is unfair and absurdly hypocritical.\n \n \nAh, Americans, so modest\n\n I'm not American.\n \n \nYou don't seem to have a problem that there people who you call Muslims who don't practice Islamic tenets with regards to killing, who don't belittle women etc. They are in fact like Oscar Schindler was to the Nazi Party - they are good despite the tenets of their ideology.\n\n Don't play dumb. You know that's an absurd comparison. Muslims believe in their faith, and practice it according to their interpretation of it. You describe Islam as though new members are given stones to throw at rape victims- there is much more to Islam than the snippets you quote.\n \n \nYou know full well that Christians such as myself don't follow the laws of Moses because we know these laws were for a specific time - for the Jews, until Jesus came to fulfil the law\n\n And some Christians would argue that yours is an incorrect interpretation of scripture. One could just as easily describe you as an \"Oscar Schindler\" of Christianity- you are good despite scripture, because of a loophole.\n \n \nAnd this is the important point. Islam makes no such distinction. They believe that the teachings of the Koran are for all time.\n\n Not everyone. You would say that these people are not following Islam, but then you are attempting to define other people's faith for them. \n \n \n The dominant, patriarchal interpretations of Islam have fostered the myth of women's inferiority in several ways. They have used sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (including disputed sayings) to undermine the intent and teachings of the Qur'an, which Muslims regard as the Word of God. They have taken Qur'anic verses out of context and read them literally, ignoring the fact that the Qur'an often uses symbolic language to portray deep truths. And they have failed to account for the overriding ethical values of the Qur'an, which stresses that human beings -- women as well as men -- have been designated to be God's \"khalifah\" (vicegerent) on earth and to establish a social order characterized by justice and compassion.\n\n \n \nI don't know if you know what you believe in. Do you have a catechism I can read?\n\n Lol, because if you don't get it, than I must be confused. Sorry, no \"catechism\", no laundry list of rules, or beliefs I have to say I agree with. Our practices tend to be passed on orally, and by demonstration. The Universal basic \"laws\" are more like \"laws of nature\"- descriptions of how the world works and how to keep the balance, etc. Nonetheless, they are virtually identical to the basic laws of other earth-centred practices; honor the earth, honor yourselves, honor all your relations (all living creatures). More specific traditions are community-based, therefore they vary, but they are simply ways of living with the basic laws.\n \n \n I'd be interest to know if men and women play the same roles in your tribe's spirituality.\n\n I am not part of a \"tribe\". I am a member of two nations. And everyone plays different roles in our traditions. Usually tasks are divided by gender, but equal respect is given to different tasks. Also, we are flexible about people who fit better in another gender than the one it they were assumed to be.\n \n \nHowever, what are you going to do - take them out of context yourself. And, worse still, you're going to suggest how my church interprets them.\n\n Er, exactly. I told you the same thing could be done with the Bible as you did with the Quran. Besides, I didn't write the list, it's from the Landover Baptist website (and you say I hate Christians)....\n \n \nDo Orthodox follow the selling of women? No. Do we teach this passage as something we should do? No. Therefore irrelevant. Do Muslims teach that Muhammad was the best example of a man who ever lived - someone today's generations should emulate? Yes.\n\n Do Muslims teach that raping children is a good idea? No. Therefore irrelevant.\n \n \nYou are the champion of deceit.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nEven if what you are about to suggest were true, then you exhibit a distinct lack of proportion. The worst offences you are accusing Christians of are\n\n Oh, so you want more? Fine.\n \n \nLot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two \"virgin daughters\" instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to \"do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your eyes.\" This is the same man that is called \"just\" and \"righteous\" in 2 Pet.2:7-8. Genesis 19:8\n \n \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, ... nor his ***, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\" In the Bible, women are the property of men; they are his possessions -- like an ox or an ***. Exodus 20:17\n \n God explains how to go about selling your daughter -- and what to do if she fails to please her new master. Exodus 21:7\n \n God's instructions for taking a second wife. Exodus 21:10\n \n If you \"entice\" an \"unmarried maid\" to \"lie\" with you, then you must marry her, unless the father refuses to give her to you, in which case you must pay him the going price for virgins. Exodus 22:16\n \n \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this verse. Exodus 22:18\n \n If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If her father can't produce the \"tokens of her virginity\" (bloody sheets), then the woman is to be stoned to death at her father's doorstep. Deuteronomy 22:13-21\n \n If a betrothed virgin is raped in the city and doesn't cry out loud enough, then \"the men of the city shall stone her to death.\" Deuteronomy 22:23-24\n \n If a man rapes an unbetrothed virgin, he must pay her father 50 shekels of silver and then marry her. Deuteronomy 22:28-29\n\n \n And so on... but you say that the entire OT is irrelevant- though if so, I don't understand why it is still included in the Bible.\n \n \nAbandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward. Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30, Luke 18:29-30\n \n Paul explains that \"the natural use\" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men. Romans 1:27\n \n Paul orders wives to submit themselves to their husbands \"in every thing\" as though they were gods. \"For the husband is the head of the wife.\" Ephesians 5:22-24\n \n Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\" (See Ex.21:15, Lev.20:9, Dt.21:18-21) So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It sure sounds like it. Matthew 15:4-7, Mark 7:9-10\n \n Wives are to use \"chaste conversation, coupled with fear.\" They are not to braid their hair, wear gold, or put on any \"apparel.\" They are to do these things in imitation of the \"holy\" women of the Old testament who were \"in subjection to their own husbands(...) 1 Peter 3:2-6\n \n Lot, who in Gen.19:8 offers his two virgin daughters to a crowd of angel rapers and later(19:30-38) impregnates them, was a \"righteous man.\" 2 Peter 2:8\n\n \n The last two examples also suggest that the OT is not so \"irrelevant\" to Paul...\n \n \nThis is the key passage that debunks your argument, not that you'd know from the editing out of the important bits...\n\n You'll find the same contradictions in the Quran. As I said, I was only doing with the Bible what you were doing with the Quran- taking small written passages from a Holy Book and interpreting them as sexist.\n \n \n50% of the population doing 80% of the work, sounds fair!\n\n Lol, montalban, it says 80% of the food supply not 80% of the work. There are other things in life aside from food....\n \n \nIslam says you may beat your wives.\n\n \nThe concept of gender equality in Islam is stressed by the non-superiority of either sex over the other. It came at a time when it was necessary to elevate the demeaned status of women and grant them rights equal to those of men. The equality of women in Islam is evident by the unprecedented legal rights given to them under a monotheistic religion as defined in the Quoran. As one of many examples, consider the rights of women in marriage and divorce. Both men and women have equal rights to contract a marriage as well as to dissolve it. The precondition of marriage is merely the mutual agreement by both parties. And unlike Christianity, a woman in Islam can divorce her husband at any time if she feels that she has been dealt with unjustly or even if she is just unhappy with her spouse since marriage is based upon mutual responsibilities toward each other. Islam has also ensured the woman's right to remarry pending a three month refrainment period.\n \n As for social rights, Islam has always recognized the prominent role that women play in society. They are given the freedom to pursue any profession including political positions. Both in the past and present day, women in Islamic societies have reached political heights unparalleled in the most \"advanced\" western nations. Even in the earliest day of Islam, Aysha, the wife of the prophet, lead an army of 30,000 soldiers.\n\n \n[ 30:21] Among His proofs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves, in order to have tranquility and contentment with each other, and He placed in your hearts love and care towards your spouses. In this, there are sufficient proofs for people who think.\n \n [3:195 ]\"Their Lord responded to them: \"I never fail to reward any worker among you for any work you do, be you MALE OR FEMALE, YOU ARE EQUAL TO ONE ANOTHER.........\"\n \n [4:19] O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit what the women leave behind, against their will. You shall not force them to give up anything you had given them, unless they commit a proven adultery. You shall treat them nicely. If you dislike them, you may dislike something wherein GOD has placed a lot of good.\n \n [2:229] Divorce may be retracted twice. The divorced woman shall be allowed to live in the same home amicably, or leave it amicably. It is not lawful for the husband to take back anything he had given her. \n\n \n \nI chuckle, pretentiously. \"You're taboo! Indians isolate menstruating women. They regard them as unclean, with dangerous powers.\"\n\n Any website you have consulted which claims to describe all \"Indians\" is incorrect. Each nation has their own traditions.\n \n \nDid Native American women wear modest clothing? Or did they go around nude?\n\n Sometimes, if we feel like it. We dress according to our comfort, not some archaic notion of self-mortification.\n \n \nAccording to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition\n\n Lol, you don't even read what you yourself quote...\n \n \nI think passing off someone else's tripe as your own is dishonest.\n\n Actually, I said I found it pre-compiled. Don't bother changing your method by, say, reading my posts, though. Just keep being insulting because you can't understand me, or disagree with me... It makes me look all the better...\n \n \nAs a native American Indian you must argue now that the descendants of the Aztec believe in human sacrifice.\n\n So do you. Isn't that the \"crux\" of your whole Jesus story?\n \n \nYou haven't also heard of Native American women having a 'menstrual lodge', separation of women during this phase.\n\n Yep. Sometimes we like to hang out alone and bleed. So what? It's just your interpretation that this has negative connotations.\n \n \nI meant what I said about wiccanism, I don't like it.\n\n You obviously don't like any religion but your own specific cult. You also feel it's okay to insult other people, based on their religions. I, however, would only say something like that as a joke.\n \n \nIf you're unconcerned about the historicalness of Jesus, then why even bother introducing arguments against it? For you, it's a dead issue.\n\n Unfortunately, secular sources often presume the historicity of Jesus without ever researching the evidence. So it isn't a \"dead arguement\" for me. I'm a historian. I get miffed when pre-Industrial Revolution characters in movies use the word \"sabotage\". Historical accuracy is very important to me. \n \n \nThis is what is called 'probable cause'; your hate of Christianity.\n\n Catholicism is not all Christianity.\n \n \nAs I have said (repeatedly) the laws of the OT were for a particular time...\n\n Several NT passages contradict this. See above.\n \n \nYou want to interpret it differently, that's up to you, but it's rather hypocritical that you should suggest that you, an outsider, are better able to interpret my beliefs.\n\n Lol, you have no problem doing this with Islam...\n \n As I said, Catholicism has been historically violently sexist, racist, and generally ungood. However, you claim that I \"hate Christians\" because I understand the history of Catholicism- knowing full well that I never claimed this represented all Christianity. \n \n Go ahead and continue trying to effect your insults to my spirituality (which you admit you can't even begin to understand), and I will continue with my valid critiques of injustices in all spheres. You can't even discuss these issues without insulting everyone around. It's obvious who has an \"axe to grind\".\n \n \nYou trully do seem to have problems understanding what others say. One day, perhaps, you'll realize this, and then maybe something can be done about it.\n\n *hoping so*",

   " Why do you ignore it when a Muslim nation, following Islamic teachings condemns a rape-victim to be stoned to death on a charge of adultery? \n\n \n Because despite being written in the Quran, it is not followed as a universal \"Islamic teaching\".\n\n Ha! Every post you say something funnier. You're beginning to sound desperate by trying to pass this off. The Koran and the Haddiths are central to Islamic belief, in that order... The Koran, for Muslims is the un-dilluted word of their god. I know ignorance is bliss, but you need to know about it's central position to Muslims.\n There are two main texts consulted by Muslims: \n the Qur'an (Recitation) are the words of God. Muslims believe that it was revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Jibril (Gabriel). This was originally in oral and written form; they were later assembled together into a single book, the Qur'an. Its name is often spelled \"Koran\" in English. This is not recommended, as some Muslims find it offensive. \n The Hadith, which are collections of the sayings of Muhammad (pbuh). They are regarded as the Sunnah (lived example) of Muhammad. The Quran gives legitimacy to the Hadith. It states: \"Nor does he say aught of his own desire. It is no less than inspiration sent down to him\" (53:3-4). However, the writings are not regarded as having the same status as the Holy Qur'an; the latter is considered to be God's word. The great Islamic scholar Yahya bin Sharaf Ul-Deen An-Nawawi compiled a collection of 43 sayings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is is now known as \"Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths\"\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/isl_intr.htm\n This was in fact one of the many contextual arguments you simply ignored. The Koran is for Muslims a book for all time - everything in it (except for abrogated texts). I gave proof about regard for women in the Islamic legal system - her account being worth less that of a man, and then gave an example of current practice from Nigeria - where they follow Islamic law - where-by a woman was going to be stoned for adultery, even though she'd been raped... because she was the only witness to the rape - the rapist got off. However, she fell pregnant - a very obvious sign she'd had sex and as she was unmarried - she was guilty of adultery.\n \nYou continually judge Christianity as sexist, and that women have struggled against it, and have somewhat succeeded. \n\n \nFind where I say that Christianity, as a whole, is sexist. I don't. I do say that many Christian groups have been very sexist and remain so. I do say that the history of the major Christian churches are rife with horrendous displays of violent sexism. Because that's the truth. Pardon me for referring to facts.... \n\n So you now slip into being pedantic. You say that not 'all' of Christianity is sexist, just the over-whelming majority (based on the teachings of the Bible - which is sexist). Pardon me for mistaking this.\n \nAt best you argue that all are sexist (despite your previous comment to the contrary), and make relativist arguments to this effect; that we can't for example criticise Islam, because Christianity is guilty of the same faults. \n\n \n I never said it was wrong to criticise the actions of any individuals behaving in sexist or otherwise harmful ways. However, your self-described \"attack on Islam\" is unfair and absurdly hypocritical.\n\n My attacks on Islam are based on\n a)\n i) Islamic texts\n ii) and the nature of these texts as being for all time\n b) examples past\n c) examples present.\n Your criticism of Christianity is\n a) texts from the Old Testament which were not meant for all time\n b) an attempt to get out of St.Paul's Epistles something remotely like women can be beaten (which is in Islamic, but not Christian texts)\n \n You don't seem to have a problem that there people who you call Muslims who don't practice Islamic tenets with regards to killing, who don't belittle women etc. They are in fact like Oscar Schindler was to the Nazi Party - they are good despite the tenets of their ideology. \n\n \nDon't play dumb. You know that's an absurd comparison. Muslims believe in their faith, and practice it according to their interpretation of it. You describe Islam as though new members are given stones to throw at rape victims- there is much more to Islam than the snippets you quote.\n\n I make no such claim. I have acknowledged there are good Muslims. I am saying that their goodness is in spite of Islam. Further to that, my citations about how Muslims take their faith are from Muslim cites. Your ideas on how Christians take their faith are from your own interpretations of the Bible.\n \n You know full well that Christians such as myself don't follow the laws of Moses because we know these laws were for a specific time - for the Jews, until Jesus came to fulfil the law \n\n \nAnd some Christians would argue that yours is an incorrect interpretation of scripture. One could just as easily describe you as an \"Oscar Schindler\" of Christianity- you are good despite scripture, because of a loophole.\n\n This is a spurious claim. The two largest, and oldest Christian groups prove your statement so. Again you are trying the exception makes the rule argument contort to fit your hatred of Christianity - by suggesting that there are some Christians now who believe this. If you know Christian doctrinal development at all, the very sola scriptura approach you make - taking only Christianity as the teachings contained in the Bible, was invented 1,500 years after the fact.\n The majority of Christians don't believe as you would have them\n \nAnd this is the important point. Islam makes no such distinction. They believe that the teachings of the Koran are for all time. \n\n \nNot everyone. You would say that these people are not following Islam, but then you are attempting to define other people's faith for them. \n\n Again, you play the exception instead of the rule to contort things to suit your argument.\n The majority of Muslims don't believe as you would have them.\n \nThe dominant, patriarchal interpretations of Islam have fostered the myth of women's inferiority in several ways. They have used sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (including disputed sayings) to undermine the intent and teachings of the Qur'an, which Muslims regard as the Word of God. They have taken Qur'anic verses out of context and read them literally, ignoring the fact that the Qur'an often uses symbolic language to portray deep truths. And they have failed to account for the overriding ethical values of the Qur'an, which stresses that human beings -- women as well as men -- have been designated to be God's \"khalifah\" (vicegerent) on earth and to establish a social order characterized by justice and compassion. \n\n Sourced from where?\n \"The Holy Qur'an :The most sacred book and the primary source of legislation. \n Hadith : The second source of legislation.\"\n http://www.al-islam.com/\n \"Question : What is the Qur?aan? \n Answer : Praise be to Allaah. \n {b}The Qur?aan is the word of the Lord of the Worlds, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to bring mankind forth from darkness into light: [/b]\n ?It is He Who sends down manifest Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to His slave (Muhammad) that He may bring you out from darkness into light\n [al-Hadeed 57:9 ? interpretation of the meaning] \n ...\n ?And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur?aan) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allaah as Muslims)?\n ...\n The Qur?aan is the Book of Allaah for all of mankind: \n ...\n After the Qur?aan was revealed, it became the Book for all of mankind until the Hour begins.

You're also very good at passing out citations without the chance to reference them. \n \n I don't know if you know what you believe in. Do you have a catechism I can read? \n\n \nLol, because if you don't get it, than I must be confused. Sorry, no \"catechism\", no laundry list of rules, or beliefs I have to say I agree with. Our practices tend to be passed on orally, and by demonstration.\n\n Then you should have no problem with Orthodoxy believing in Holy Tradition above the Bible\n \n I'd be interest to know if men and women play the same roles in your tribe's spirituality. \n\n \nI am not part of a \"tribe\". I am a member of two nations. And everyone plays different roles in our traditions. Usually tasks are divided by gender, but equal respect is given to different tasks. Also, we are flexible about people who fit better in another gender than the one it they were assumed to be.\n\n Then you should have no problem with Paul saying to husbands and wives to have mutual obligations towards each other.\n \nHowever, what are you going to do - take them out of context yourself. And, worse still, you're going to suggest how my church interprets them. \n\n \nEr, exactly. I told you the same thing could be done with the Bible as you did with the Quran. Besides, I didn't write the list, it's from the Landover Baptist website (and you say I hate Christians)....\n\n Then you don't understand the difference between how Christians view the Bible, and how Muslims view the Koran. (see above).\n What you judge Baptists to be, then judge them as Baptists. Don't use them as an example for all Christianity. We differ on the Bible, and its place. You need to know that before making blanket declarations about the way all Christians worship -oddly enough you'd get miffed if I make generalisations about Native American practices.\n And also, you seem to take minority Islamic views as the rule too, so I guess there you're rather consistent with being illogical.\n \"7. Do Muslims have many sects?\n Muslims have no sects. In Islam, there are two major schools of thought, the Shia and the Sunni. Both have many things in common. They follow the same book - Quran. They follow the same prophet Muhammad (P). Both offer their prayers five time a day. Both fast in the month of Ramadan. They both go for hajj, pilgrimage to Mecca. Those who follow Prophet Muhammad (P), in accordance with his sayings and actions, are called Sunni and those who in addition follow the sayings and views of Ali (Muhammad's son-in- law), as the rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad (P), are called Shia. Shia means a partisan (party of Ali) and it started more as a political party to help Ali in his conflict with his political adversaries. Most Shias live in Iran and Iraq while the rest of the Muslim world is mostly Sunni. Shias comprise about 16-percent of the Muslim population.\"\n http://islam-usa.com/25ques.html\n Catholics, Copts, and Orthodox, the clear majority of Christians do not just follow the Bible. We follow Holy Tradition, which includes the Bible, but goes beyond it, and is the context we interpret the Bible. Something you continually fail to realise. In Islam there is not the same differences, as there's uniform adherence to the Koran, and uniformly the idea that Muhammad was the most ideal man - the best example for all believers to follow. This needs concern you as it totally undermines the approach you've been taking.\n \nDo Orthodox follow the selling of women? No. Do we teach this passage as something we should do? No. Therefore irrelevant. Do Muslims teach that Muhammad was the best example of a man who ever lived - someone today's generations should emulate? Yes. \n\n \n Do Muslims teach that raping children is a good idea? No. Therefore irrelevant.\n\n Define 'rape'. (see http://www.exmuslim.com/com/psycological.htm before answering) Do Muslim men marry and have sex with girls as young as nine? Yes. Do they do this now? Yes. I'd have laughed, but it's a truly shameful thing for you, as a woman, to ignore. Islam states that as soon as she has her first menstruation, then she's of marriageable age.\n I recognise (and have done so in the past) that there are other cultures that practice this. However, in Islam we have the example of the 'ideal man' doing this, and thus Muslim's continue to do this.\n \n Even if what you are about to suggest were true, then you exhibit a distinct lack of proportion.\n \n \nOh, so you want more? Fine.\n\n Sure. You think that a woman covering her head (only whilst she's in church) is = to a man marrying an underage girl. I know this because you equate both Christianity and Islam of the same crime -without qualification.\n \nLot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two \"virgin daughters\" instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to \"do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your eyes.\" This is the same man that is called \"just\" and \"righteous\" in 2 Pet.2:7-8. Genesis 19:8\n\n Firstly, do the angels rape the girls? No. Would they have willingly slept with angels? Who knows - you simply suggest that they were totally virtuous girls and that this would have been a shock to them - the same daughters that later got Lot drunk and slept with him.\n Lot made many mistakes... he realised this, and so he fled Sodom - which is where the word sodomy comes from... and so a few verses later he fled with his family. Peter refers to this fleeing from Sodom (in the verse you quote) it says his soul was tormented... which is why he fled.\n Again, tell me do Christians practice this - giving their daughters over to rapists, as you accuse Lot?\n There are instances of bad behaviour in the Bible.. David ordered a man to his death, so he could sleep with the widow. Is this part of the Bible used to glorify David? No.\n \nAnd so on... but you say that the entire OT is irrelevant- though if so, I don't understand why it is still included in the Bible.\n\n Strawman again. I never said the entire OT was irrelevant. It is relevant because it states what was; it states what lead up to Jesus coming to save us. It shows us how the world was created. etc.\n \n Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward. Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30, Luke 18:29-30\n\n Look to the passages before...\n Matthew 19\n Divorce \n 1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. 2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. \n 3 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?\" \n 4 \"Haven't you read,\" he replied, \"that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'[1] 5 and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'[2] ? 6 So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" \n 7 \"Why then,\" they asked, \"did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\" \n 8 Jesus replied, \"Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.\"\n It just doesn't mean what you want it to say. Jesus is saying quite rightly that we should love God above all else. Don't native Americans leave the tribe behind and go on quests? I know Aboriginal Australians have a 'walkabout'. The idea of abandonment for Jesus is not even like this, for even in the last time I posted I showed citations of obligations between husbands and wives, and to widows. Etc.\n \nPaul explains that \"the natural use\" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men. Romans 1:27\n\n I'm surprised you read that out of that passage. It is true that Christians believe that sex is only natural when between a man and a woman, in marriage. This passage in fact says\n Romans 1: 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\n It's talking about how men were. Men committed indecent acts with other men. It's not suggesting that this is the way to go, either.\n \nPaul orders wives to submit themselves to their husbands \"in every thing\" as though they were gods. \"For the husband is the head of the wife.\" Ephesians 5:22-24\n\n Yes, and it goes on to say that men should love their wives as Christ loves the church, as he gave himself up (died) for the church, so men should love their wives. That's powerful stuff. I thought we'd already gone over this... obviously you don't read all of the posts.\n \n Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\" (See Ex.21:15, Lev.20:9, Dt.21:18-21) So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It sure sounds like it. Matthew 15:4-7, Mark 7:9-10\n\n Your critiques are getting more obtuse.\n The only references to child(ren) in that chapter of Matthew is \"26 He replied, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" and another about the number being fed.\n Mark has a similar passage 27 \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\"\n So He's stated nothing about killing children. What can you possibly mean? If you read the chapter you will see that the enemies of Jesus are condemning Him for not following another custom, so He points out the law 'honour thy father and mother' and how they do not obey it. He is pointing out that they are being hypocritical, for accusing Him of not following one law, whilst they don't follow another.\n \nWives are to use \"chaste conversation, coupled with fear.\" They are not to braid their hair, wear gold, or put on any \"apparel.\" They are to do these things in imitation of the \"holy\" women of the Old testament who were \"in subjection to their own husbands(...) 1 Peter 3:2-6\n\n \"1 Peter 3\n Wives and Husbands \n 1 Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behaviour of their wives, 2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewellery and fine clothes. 4 Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.\"\n In other words, wives be a model of virtue (not 'chaste' as Mizmaxx suggests which has purely sexual connotations), so that should their husbands lose faith, the woman's strength of faith will win them back. Quite empowering, to suggest that women can be the anchor of a Christian family.\n \nYou'll find the same contradictions in the Quran. As I said, I was only doing with the Bible what you were doing with the Quran- taking small written passages from a Holy Book and interpreting them as sexist.\n\n Firstly, that's not exactly true. You've been accusing Christianity of sexism, repression etc well before I entered the debate about Islam. Secondly, I don't just take passages out of Islamic context. You keep accusing me of this, and it's quite commendable; persistence. However, it's wildly inaccurate as my many citations from past and present attest.\n \n50% of the population doing 80% of the work, sounds fair! \n\n \nLol, Montalba, it says 80% of the food supply not 80% of the work. There are other things in life aside from food....\n\n No it suggests most of the work; clothes making, child-rearing, food preparation, food gathering.\n \n Islam says you may beat your wives. \n\n \n The concept of gender equality in Islam is stressed by the non-superiority of either sex over the other. It came at a time when it was necessary to elevate the demeaned status of women and grant them rights equal to those of men. The equality of women in Islam is evident by the unprecedented legal rights given to them under a monotheistic religion as defined in the Quoran. As one of many examples, consider the rights of women in marriage and divorce. Both men and women have equal rights to contract a marriage as well as to dissolve it. The precondition of marriage is merely the mutual agreement by both parties. And unlike Christianity, a woman in Islam can divorce her husband at any time if she feels that she has been dealt with unjustly or even if she is just unhappy with her spouse since marriage is based upon mutual responsibilities toward each other. Islam has also ensured the woman's right to remarry pending a three month refrainment period.\n\n Another of your phantom quotes. And where are they getting their sources from? I suggest from the Koran (the same book you say Muslims don't hold dear - instantly undermining your previous criticism of me using it as a source) (recall you claimed laughably that the Koran is not accepted as universal teaching; you're quite happy to cite a source that relies on it now).\n I already addressed this when I began a tract...\"\n Are women equal in Islam? \"Men have fear of your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From that soul He created its mate and through them He bestrewed the earth with countless men and women\" (Sura 4:1). This clearly suggests that men and women were created from the same substance. Muslims will point to this as 'proof' that men and women are considered equal in Islam. However, Sura 2:228 states \"Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above women.\" However this difference in status runs much deeper. In legal testimony, \"Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses\" (Sura 2:282), in other words a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's.\n \n Can Muslim women be beaten? \"Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them\" (Sura 4:34) (though some Islamic scholars claim that this is a symbolic 'beating' only where-by the husband just 'taps' his wife on the arm. Although the wording does not say it should be but a symbolic tap, it should be noted anyway that it still points to male domination over women. (and it is an interpretation that is in the minority)\"\n \n I recognise the limitations on women's rights in Islam. You don't. I would hazard to guess to that you know nothing about abrogated verses.\n \n \nAs for social rights, Islam has always recognized the prominent role that women play in society. They are given the freedom to pursue any profession including political positions. Both in the past and present day, women in Islamic societies have reached political heights unparalleled in the most \"advanced\" western nations. Even in the earliest day of Islam, Aysha, the wife of the prophet, lead an army of 30,000 soldiers.\n\n That's the victim of child-rape! The source for this wouldn't even be Koranic, it's from a Haddith, one book down in the food chain. I suggest you go read up on abrogated verses and then get back to me.\n \nI chuckle, pretentiously. \"You're taboo! Indians isolate menstruating women. They regard them as unclean, with dangerous powers.\" \n\n \nAny website you have consulted which claims to describe all \"Indians\" is incorrect. Each nation has their own traditions.\n\n So what? Let's then just condemn those that separate women then. I'll concede that! :lol: How many native American tribes exclude women during her menstrual time?\n \n According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition\n Lol, you don't even read what you yourself quote...\n\n Strawman. I never said it was peculiar to Lakota. The site says however that Lakota traditions can add to the misery. It's they who studied it who suggest this.\n \n I think passing off someone else's tripe as your own is dishonest. \n\n \n Actually, I said I found it pre-compiled. Don't bother changing your method by, say, reading my posts, though. Just keep being insulting because you can't understand me, or disagree with me... It makes me look all the better...\n\n Why don't you give a citation then?\n \n As a native American Indian you must argue now that the descendants of the Aztec believe in human sacrifice. \n\n \n So do you. Isn't that the \"crux\" of your whole Jesus story?\n\n LOL! In the context of Christianity I have no problem with the Jesus sacrifice story. Instead you duck the issue with regards to native American human sacrifices.\n \n You haven't also heard of Native American women having a 'menstrual lodge', separation of women during this phase. \n\n \n Yep. Sometimes we like to hang out alone and bleed. So what? It's just your interpretation that this has negative connotations.\n\n As is yours from the Old Testament. That's the whole reason you used it, as with all your citations... to make a 'at best' argument to suggest that Islam and Christianity are as bad as each other.\n \nI meant what I said about wiccanism, I don't like it.\n\n \nYou obviously don't like any religion but your own specific cult. You also feel it's okay to insult other people, based on their religions. I, however, would only say something like that as a joke.\n\n Oh, haaa haaa haaa. I get it. You didn't contextualise it.\n Actually don't presume to re-word what I state. I don't hate Buddhism, Judaism, Catholicism, Anglicanism, Baptists etc. (non inclusion in this list does not denote hatred).\n \nThis is what is called 'probable cause'; your hate of Christianity. \n\n \nCatholicism is not all Christianity.\n\n Yes, you are correct, and being pedantic, especially as they make up the majority, and you don't like Orthodoxy, which is the next biggest group, so that's just the majority of Christians. When you hate Christians, you show this not only by stating hate for particular groups, but by telling Christians how we should interpret the Bible, and how sexist it is, and how repressive Christianity is etc.\n \nAs I have said (repeatedly) the laws of the OT were for a particular time... \n\n \nSeveral NT passages contradict this. See above.\n\n Supposition. You have not proved your case. You are attempting to tell me how to interpret my scripture.\n \n You want to interpret it differently, that's up to you, but it's rather hypocritical that you should suggest that you, an outsider, are better able to interpret my beliefs. \n\n \nLol, you have no problem doing this with Islam...\n\n You see it as a problem because of your fundamental misunderstanding about how Muslims view their own beliefs. And you certainly are quite happy to apply out of context Biblical passages.\n As I said I cite Islamic texts, and I cite Islamic notions on Islamic texts. You are exceptionally dishonest to ignore this.\n I repeat I gave a quote on Muhammad's relationship with Aisha. I gave several citations where-by Muslims hold his ideal up as the standard, and I gave examples of Muslims living by that standard today.\n \n As I said, Catholicism has been historically violently sexist, racist, and generally ungood. However, you claim that I \"hate Christians\" because I understand the history of Catholicism- knowing full well that I never claimed this represented all Christianity. \n\n So you think it's okay to hate Catholics?\n \n Go ahead and continue trying to effect your insults to my spirituality (which you admit you can't even begin to understand), and I will continue with my valid critiques of injustices in all spheres. You can't even discuss these issues without insulting everyone around. It's obvious who has an \"axe to grind\".\n\n Ah-ha, the lack of insight. You say you're not insulting Christianity, by taking verses out of context. But you think I'm insulting you for arguing about your faith in the same way. I keep telling you you insult Christianity. You said - and I quoted your words, you hate it - or at lest in this case the single largest Christian group - which has the same notions on Holy Tradition as the second biggest group - the Orthodox.\n You accuse me of taking Muslim passages out of context, and yet you do exactly that with Biblical texts! LOL indeed.\n \n hy\u00b7poc\u00b7ri\u00b7sy P Pronunciation Key (h-pkr-s)\n n. pl. hy\u00b7poc\u00b7ri\u00b7sies \n The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness.\n An act or instance of such falseness.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=hypocrisy",

   "This is getting to be a series of mammoth posts from both sides. I will endeavour to make this brief.\n \n My summary:\n In essence I argue against Islam on several fronts; Islamic texts - taken in their actual context (Moslem's regard for the Koran as being a book FOR ALL TIME etc), the teachings of Muslims based on those texts, and how they actually act according to those texts in countries where they are freer to act*\n \n Mizmaxx believes that all belief systems (except her own, it seems) are dominated by male orientation anyway, and therefore all contain texts which we might regard as distasteful. She argues strictly from her interpretation of the texts alone... usually ones that have been abrogated by our Lord Jesus Christ (for Mosaic laws weren't for all time, we can see this plainly by the fact that they came into being well after creation, and Jesus' own teachings in regards to this also shed light).\n \n To combat Mizmaxx's argument, I applied her rule to her culture; showing instances in Native American belief that are very similar to what she is criticising; e.g. separation of women during their menstrual time; going on spiritual quests (which she calls 'abandoning one's family'). This is to demonstrate two things; one, social context, two, many of the things she thinks to be bad, are in fact practiced by Native Americans. This seems to have upset her. This is regrettable, but it is an attempt to show her style of argument [i]can]/i] indeed be applied to any religious-cultural group - and that is it's failing. It is taking things out of context, for I don't hold Native Americans to be bad. She has stated she hates Catholics and also she mistakes my religion for Catholic... I can only assume then she hates Orthodoxy too.\n \n The sexual assault by Muhammad on a child (Aisha) is a prime example of my argument\n I showed Muslim attitudes to Muhammad - that he is their prime example of humanity, a model for all men for all time. (I cited old and current comment on this)\n I showed examples from Haddith (second only to the Koran, amongst all Muslims) where it shows clearly Muhammad had sex with Aisha when she was nine\n I showed examples how this is harmful to children\n Further, I showed examples of Muslim men - following Muhammad's example - continue to marry (what we consider) under-age girls.\n Not all Muslim men follow this example, true - and it is in spite of the example, not because of. Therein lies the fundamental difference.\n \n When Jesus urges people to turn the other cheek and yet people go out and kill in His name, it is in spite of His example, not because of it.\n \n When Muslims go an have relations with under-age girls, it is BECAUSE of Muhammad's example, not in spite of it.\n \n Her counter to this was that Christianity is sexist and gave me examples of how, according to St.Paul women have to wear a scarves in church. Which, incidentally, takes things all out of proportion.\n \n \n *By this I mean in nations where Islamic law is paramount. For instance, my nation, Australia will not allow the range of ages for marriage that an Islamic nation will.",

   "The Koran and the Haddiths are central to Islamic belief, in that order... The Koran, for Muslims is the un-dilluted word of their god. I know ignorance is bliss, but you need to know about it's central position to Muslims.\n\n That doesn't mean that they are not open to interpretation. \n \n Most of my quotes about the Quran come from this site- http://www.religiousconsultation.org/hassan.htm\n The author says-\n \n I am a Muslim, a theologian, and a women's rights activist, and while I am critical in a number of ways of the life that most Muslim societies offer to women, twenty years of theological study, as well as my own deepest faith, convince me that in real Islam, the Islam of the Qur'an, women and men are equals. Liberating ideas lie at the heart of most enduring faiths, and Islam shares in these. Two themes in particular strike me as being of the highest importance. The first is the fundamental equality of humans before God. The other is religion's revolutionary aim of human liberation. From religion should come freedom to seek understanding of the will of God and life's purpose, and freedom to honor God's creation through self-development and striving toward God's ends\n\n \n She also says-\n \nIt is clear to me that, according to the perspective of the Qur'an, women and men are equal, and that women are entitled to an equal opportunity along with men for the actualization of their human potentialities. In fact, because of its protective attitude toward all downtrodden and oppressed classes, the Qur'an is particularly concerned about safeguarding the rights of women, and much Qur'anic legislation is designed to ensure that women are treated with justice in the home and in society.\n\n \n \nYou say that not 'all' of Christianity is sexist, just the over-whelming majority\n\n Yes, I believe that a lot of people are sexist. So what? \n \n \nMy attacks on Islam are based on:\n\n You repeatedly ignore the fact that there are a variety of expressions of Islam, as there are in Christianity.\n \n \nI am saying that their goodness is in spite of Islam. Further to that, my citations about how Muslims take their faith are from Muslim cites. Your ideas on how Christians take their faith are from your own interpretations of the Bible.\n\n My ideas about Islam as well as Christianity are based on history, texts, and personal experience. You pick-and-choose citations to bolster your points, and ignore the vast information which demontrates that Muslims are no more sexist, violent, (or any other nasty thing) more than Christians, or other people. Finding little examples of violent sexism in nations self-described as \"Islamic\" is not conclusive, as many self-described \"Christian\" nations have been guilty of similar atrocities against women and others.\n \n \nThen you should have no problem with Orthodoxy believing in Holy Tradition above the Bible\n\n I have no problem with you believing in any absurd notion you like. That is, however, not equivalent to the development of First Nations traditions, as yours are based on interpretations of scripture handed down by religious \"experts\", and ours are based on community needs and wants.\n \n \nThen you should have no problem with Paul saying to husbands and wives to have mutual obligations towards each other.\n\n I wouldn't, except that isn't exactly what he said, is it?\n \n \nAgain, you play the exception instead of the rule to contort things to suit your argument.\n The majority of Muslims don't believe as you would have them.\n\n How can you possibly speak with such authority as to what the \"majority of Muslims\" believe? Muslims are globally incredibly diverse. Neither does \"majority\" rule in defining a religious practice.\n \n \nThen you don't understand the difference between how Christians view the Bible, and how Muslims view the Koran. (see above).\n\n Sorry, but you clearly can't speak to how all Muslims view the Quran.\n \n \nCentered in God and self-critical, the original Muslims believed that although God had given them the Qur'an and the Prophet had exemplified its teachings, it was their responsibility to implement its message in the \"Islamic\" societies that they were creating. These Muslims read the Qur'an as an \"open,\" rather than a \"closed,\" text and strove continually to understand its deeper meaning. This intellectual striving (\"ijtihad\") -- which Allama Muhammad Iqbal, poet-philosopher of Pakistan, calls \"the principle of movement\" in history(3) -- made the Muslims of the first three centuries dynamic and creative peoples who paved the way for the European Renaissance.\n \n It is a profound tragedy and irony that today's Muslims, in large numbers, regard Islam in monolithic terms and regard the \"shari'ah\" (the code regulating all aspects of a Muslim's life) as fixed. In much of the contemporary Muslim world, we see the substitution of traditionalism for the exercise of ijtihad -- even a denial of the right of ijtihad. \n\n This shift is very unfortunate, and many courageous persons are fighting it. However, this repudiates your thesis that it is inherent to Islam to view the Quran as somehow uninterpretable.\n \n \nIn Islam there is not the same differences, as there's uniform adherence to the Koran, and uniformly the idea that Muhammad was the most ideal man - the best example for all believers to follow.\n\n For one, the adherence to the Quran is not \"uniform\", due to differing interpretations, and secondly, although Mohammad is considered an exemplary person, people are not expected to literally imitate him.\n \n \nI recognise (and have done so in the past) that there are other cultures that practice this. However, in Islam we have the example of the 'ideal man' doing this, and thus Muslim's continue to do this.\n\n So you keep saying. Thus, even though a \"righteous man\" in the Bible would throw his daughters to rapists (then have sex with them), that different. Of course, there is no Biblical equivalent to Mohammad at all. But there is Jesus, who approves of polygamy (Matthew 25:1), rudely rejects his family (Matthew 12:47-49, Mark 3:31-34, Luke 8:20-21, John 2:4), and lies (John 7:8-10). But then, I suppose that's also different. You're full of excuses for Christian scriptures that could be used to excuse terrible behavior, but the first one to point fingers. \n \n \nWho knows - you simply suggest that they were totally virtuous girls and that this would have been a shock to them - the same daughters that later got Lot drunk and slept with him.\n\n Oh, of course, they must have been sluts! Lot's slutty daughters, that explains everything. After all, what father, when drunk, would pass up having sex with his own kids? Er.... emoticon_wow \n \n Do we know how old his daughters are? No. Given the Bible's track record, they could be any age from 6 to 90. Hey, how do you know that Mohammad's young wife wasn't a hot little hussy herself? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n In fact, how do you know that Lot wasn't lying about it being their idea to get it on? It is completely typical for sexual abusers to blame their abused children of \"seducing\" them- whereas children \"raping\" their innocently incapacitated (er, but still able enough..) father is literally unheard of. In fact, sexual abusers also frequently enough offer up their children to others. Hmmm.... Yet you blame them for their father's abusive behavior...\n \n Way to prove how \"good to women\" you are, despite not being Muslim. \n \n \nIt is relevant because it states what was; it states what lead up to Jesus coming to save us. It shows us how the world was created. etc.\n\n Plus detailed instructions on dealing with boils. That's always handy.\n \n \nYes, and it goes on to say that(...)\n\n Sure, sure, the nicey-nice stuff comes later. That kind of context is exactly what you don't include in your snippets of the Quran and Hadiths.\n \n \nSo He's stated nothing about killing children. What can you possibly mean? \n\n By the way, since you're the only other person who seems to care about citations on this board, these were all excerpts from the Sceptic's Annotated Bible....\n \n Matthew, Chapter 15\n \n SAB\n 15:1\n Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,\n 15:2\n Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.\n 15:3\n But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? \n 15:4\n For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\n \n \nYou've been accusing Christianity of sexism, repression etc well before I entered the debate about Islam. Secondly, I don't just take passages out of Islamic context.\n\n First, I never accused \"Christianity\" of anything. I am not, however, confused about religious history.\n \n Second, yes you do take Islamic passages out of context. Despite your pleas to the contrary.\n \n \nNo it suggests most of the work; clothes making, child-rearing, food preparation, food gathering.\n\n Actually, the quote you used specifically said \"family food supply\". Besides, this is an absurd accusation. If you knew anything at all about First Nations, you would know that if women had a problem with the distribution of tasks, they could have changed this in a second. First Nations women could, and did, decide for ourselves on issues from the personal to the political, from those only affecting us as individuals to those which impacted the entire community. You can't even begin to understand the nature of the difference between these ways of life and those which are patriarchal. Neither can you even begin to compare.\n \n From your own source- \n \nThe overwhelming pressures of the dominant culture have produced social problems found in the non-Indian world, rape, incest, alcoholism, lack of self esteem and loss of identity as an Indian woman.\n\n Many other problems could be added to this list, such as what is called \"domestic abuse\", which was unknown to us before the invasions.\n \n \nI recognise the limitations on women's rights in Islam. You don't.\n\n On the contrary. I recognize sexism wherever it is found. You seem only able to recognize it when it is in between the pages of the Quran.\n \n \nWhy don't you give a citation then?\n\n I did, it's from the Landover Baptists website, which I'm sure you would love.\n \n \nIn the context of Christianity I have no problem with the Jesus sacrifice story. Instead you duck the issue with regards to native American human sacrifices.\n\n In the context of Christianity I doubt you would have a problem with anything.\n \n Aztecs, who are BTW very far away from me, and very different from my Nation and other Northern Nations, are supposed to have used \"human sacrifices\". So what? There's no \"issue\", you're just trying to mud-sling. If this is even true, which is contested, what's your point? Human sacrifice happens all the time, all over the place. What do you think war is?\n \n \nWhen you hate Christians, you show this not only by stating hate for particular groups, but by telling Christians how we should interpret the Bible, and how sexist it is, and how repressive Christianity is etc.\n\n There's the rub. As far as you're concerned, saying anything about anyone or any group who was ever Christian is \"hate\". No matter what they did/do, no matter how terrible. However, for you, because you're Christian (in your mind the only people who have value, feelings or deserve respect), everyone else is fair game.\n \n \nYou said - and I quoted your words, you hate it - or at lest in this case the single largest Christian group - which has the same notions on Holy Tradition as the second biggest group - the Orthodox.\n\n I see the humor of this argument escapes you, so I'll help you out. \n \n For me to argue that the historical and/or present day behavior of certain Christian groups is sexist, violent, racist, whatever- despite how factual these statements are- is in your view \"hate\". Even though I am careful not to lump all Christians in with the \"bad\" ones- in fact, I don't even lump in all Catholics with the bad ones. For me to bring up any problematic scripture, use of scripture, historical inaccuracies or anything else that could ever in any way be contstrued as critiquing anything related to Christianity, despite the validity of my points, is \"hate\". \n \n You state that the groups I have a problem with- Catholicism and Orthodoxy- are the majority of Christians, so if I say \"boo\" to them, I'm insulting all Christians, and thus demonstrating my underlying \"hatred\" for all \"Christianity\", which I suppose I am afflicted with simply because I'm such a heathen.\n \n However, for you to take selections from Muslim texts (including Hadiths, which some Muslims don't follow), and certain horror stories about some totalitarian governements, wrap that all up in some hyperbole and call it Islam, claim that any good Muslim is simply not being actually Muslim (thus defining their religion for them), and outright attacking Islam on that basis, that's okay by you. Because, after all, they're Muslim. You're Christian. So, obviously, they're baddies and you're a goody.\n \n \nThis is to demonstrate two things; one, social context, two, many of the things she thinks to be bad, are in fact practiced by Native Americans. This seems to have upset her.\n\n All it has done is demonstrate how little you understand our cultures. Pity, you could seriously learn some things.\n \n \nShe has stated she hates Catholics and also she mistakes my religion for Catholic...\n\n Actually, I said that given my experience, I'm allowed to hate Catholicism. You presume that this means that if I meet a Catholic person I have to hold myself back from attacking them or something? Please. I detest all things opposed to truth, justice and freedom. The RC is one example. People are just people. Hating people is a waste of time.",

I know ignorance is bliss, but you need to know about it's central position to Muslims. \n\n \nThat doesn't mean that they are not open to interpretation \n\n That's a truism of any beliefs. You said that it didn't form a central part. This is clearly wrong for the majority of Muslims.

The majority of Muslims, including women disagree. Your exception doth not maketh the rule. I am debating with a Muslim on another forum and he is a convert who admits...\n \nNo its not claimed that men and women are equal.

And God is Exalted in Power, Wise\n http://www.onlinedebate.net/forums/showthread.php?t=294\n \n\n Again, I don't take isolated texts from the Koran, I use current and Islamic understanding about the texts... Look to the question put to a cleric regarding a woman's right to work:\n \"The fact that Allaah has given men more than women in terms of reasoning, thinking and physical strength is something concerning which there is no dispute.

But look at the stated reason...\n \"One of the reasons why it is obligatory for the husband to spend on the wife is that the wife is prevented from earning an income because of her duties towards her husband, children and house.\"\n (Ibid.)\n If you want more then go visit http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&CR=0&dtree=1&dgn=4\n \n You say that not 'all' of Christianity is sexist, just the over-whelming majority \n\n Yes, I believe that a lot of people are sexist. So what? [/quote]\n Well, it's one of your main criticisms; that it's embedded in Christian teaching - your interpretation of them - no wonder then!\n \n You repeatedly ignore the fact that there are a variety of expressions of Islam, as there are in Christianity.\n\n No, I don't. What is a Moslem? The very fact that we have a term means that there are common definitions of this. What do the majority of them believe. That's what I argue from. You know a few western educated examples and you decry they are the example, or the proof at least that Islam is not so bad.\n Further, I stated correctly the centrality of the Koran. You did not. You thus don't even know the central text that Islamic faith is based on. Yet you've been debating me (even with this lack of knowledge on the subject), not so much to defend Islam, but to attack Christianity.\n [quote=Montalban]I am saying that their goodness is in spite of Islam. Further to that, my citations about how Muslims take their faith are from Muslim cites. Your ideas on how Christians take their faith are from your own interpretations of the Bible. \n \nMy ideas about Islam as well as Christianity are based on history, texts, and personal experience.

Finding little examples of violent sexism in nations self-described as \"Islamic\" is not conclusive, as many self-described \"Christian\" nations have been guilty of similar atrocities against women and others.\n\n What vast information? It's rather dishonest to ignore that I cite sites as above, and have done so continually through my debate on Islam. You have made a statement about your notion of the Koran, and it's a major mistake. How many Muslims do you know? You base your knowledge on them. Are they themselves experts in their own religion? It might at first seem an odd question but I know many people of many faiths who aren't well versed in their own faiths - they have knowledge of some of the basics - but a majority of people in western society are irreligious.\n Further, you continually ignore what Muslims believe about Muhammad. You pick a few odd examples like Lot, and we don't hold Lot up to be the example from all his life for all time.\n \nThen you should have no problem with Orthodoxy believing in Holy Tradition above the Bible \n\n \nI have no problem with you believing in any absurd notion you like. That is, however, not equivalent to the development of First Nations traditions, as yours are based on interpretations of scripture handed down by religious \"experts\", and ours are based on community needs and wants.\n\n Are you saying then that your religion is one dominated by pocularis, and whims? We acknowledge no one Holy Father as supreme in teaching. We acknowledge some made the occasional, and very human, mistakes.\n \n Then you should have no problem with Paul saying to husbands and wives to have mutual obligations towards each other. \n\n \nI wouldn't, except that isn't exactly what he said, is it?\n\n Yes, it is. I gave you the over-all settings. You took one verse here, and one verse there. I gave you secondary references from Fox's book on the high position of women in the church c.200 AD\n \n This debate is turning into a 'yes you did', 'no you didn't' debate. I leave it then to the readers to determine your sources vs. mine.\n \n I note in ending the fact that you defend Muhammad's actions towards an under-age girl. You do in deed defend his actions by drawing any criticisms of mine towards that act into relativist arguments - that if it is indeed a bad act (something you've not stated), then it should be put into the perspective that a lot of bad things went on.\n \n For those interested, here are a few more questions and answers (by Muslims) (this is especially important to note because Mizmaxx believes that it is me interpreting Islamic texts - yet she's quite happy to take her own interpretation of Biblical texts!)\n Q Are women allowed to be rulers in the islamic shariah? (i would prefer evidence from the Qur'an).\n A The evidence from the Qur?aan and Sunnah indicates that it is not permissible for a woman to assume positions of senior public authority, such as the caliph (khaleefah), minister of state (wazeer or vizier) or judge (qaadi) and so on. \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=20677&dgn=4\n \n Q Is it permissible for a woman to be appointed as a judge (qaadi) in Islamic sharee?ah?.\n A With regard to jobs which a woman may need, there is nothing wrong with a woman being appointed to them, such as teaching female students, being a doctor or nurse treating female patients. A woman may also work in offices that are visited only by women, so that women will not be forced to mix with men, which may be a cause of spreading wanton display (tabarruj) and unveiling, and other things that lead to evil and immorality. And Allaah knows best.\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=21062&dgn=4\n \n Mizmaxx ignores the opinions of Muslims when they base they interpret their beliefs in a way contrary to what she wants; likewise she demands that Christians interpret passages the way she wants - to prove that Christians are sexist - for when I state that my church doesn't interpret them her way, she seems rather angry.",

   "A lot of this is repeated from previous post, I do so to arrange it into a more concise critique of three aspects of Mizmaxx's argument.\n 1) her misinterpretation of Christian texts\n 2) her misunderstanding of Islamic texts\n 3) comparisons between her culture and Judeo-Christian culture to show that some of the things she proclaims 'evil' in mine, are practiced in hers.\n \n 1: I give a summary of Mizmaxx's misrepresentations of Christian doctrine... which I've already dealt with, but which she has not so far addressed.\n False claim one: Christians endorse sex-slavery...\n \nLot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two \"virgin daughters\" instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to \"do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your eyes.\" This is the same man that is called \"just\" and \"righteous\" in 2 Pet.2:7-8. Genesis 19:8\n\n \n The Angels aren't rapists, because they don't have sex with the daughters, let alone non-consensual sex (Mizmaxx assumes that they do, and that the act would not be consensual). The daughters, though having never slept with men (whether they've slept with Angels in the past or not, we do not know) are not total paradigms of virtue (later they get their father drunk, and sleep with him). Lot himself makes mistakes, and realises this and leaves Sodom (which is where Peter's reference comes in). All in all, there's a lot of supposition here on what might have happened. The greatest mistake however is to put forward Lot's actions of offer as the ideal of Christian virtue. It is not. Peter specifically refers to Lot's leaving the city of sin as virtuous.\n \n Further \nThe last two examples also suggest that the OT is not so \"irrelevant\" to Paul...\n\n Err.. you mean Peter?\n \n False claim two: Jesus urged the killing of children.\n \nJesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\" (See Ex.21:15, Lev.20:9, Dt.21:18-21) So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It sure sounds like it. Matthew 15:4-7, Mark 7:9-10\n\n Jesus was accused of not following the law - by not washing His hands. He turns around and says that the Jews don't honour their fathers and mothers. That is all, He is doing; accusing them of hypocrisy.\n \n False claim three: \n \nWives are to use \"chaste conversation, coupled with fear.\" They are not to braid their hair, wear gold, or put on any \"apparel.\" They are to do these things in imitation of the \"holy\" women of the Old testament who were \"in subjection to their own husbands(...) 1 Peter 3:2-6\n\n Far from this. The passage reads\n \"1 Peter 3\n Wives and Husbands \n 1 Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behaviour of their wives, 2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewellery and fine clothes. 4 Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.\"\n In other words, wives be a model of virtue (not 'chaste' as Mizmaxx suggests which has purely sexual connotations), so that should their husbands lose faith, the woman's strength of faith will win them back. Quite empowering, to suggest that women can be the anchor of a Christian family. It is in fact suggesting that women can be stronger in regards to this than men can be.\n \n False claim four\n \n Is a wife permitted to follow her own conscience?\n Correct answer: A woman must obey her husband in all matters at all times. \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their husbands in every thing\" (Ephesians 5:22-24).\n\n This is the key passage that debunks your argument, not that you'd know from the editing out of the important bits...\n Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savoir. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30 for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[3] 32 This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\n \"Christian women also exercised far more choice in whom they wed...\"Carroll, V & Shiflett, D (2002), \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against Anti-Religious Bigotry\", p4\n It's mutual obligation. \"In fact what distinguished Paul from his non-Christian contemporaries was not the patriarchal views he sometimes expressed...but rather his repeated emphasis on the obligations of husbands to wives.\" Ibid, p5\n \n False claim five Christians claim women are for sex (yes, it's similar to False Claim one, but she made it as a separate criticism)\n \nPaul explains that \"the natural use\" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men. Romans 1:27\n\n Romans 1: 27 \n \"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n It's talking about how men were. Men committed indecent acts with other men. It's not suggesting that this is the way to go, either. It is saying that the place for sex, should be within marriage. It would be just as valid, therefore to argue that men are there in marriage for women's sexual use.\n \n False claim six: St. Paul was a eunuch\n This starts of with a wishy-washy statement\n \n It's possible that Paul was a Eunuch\n\n but moves to a more definitive statement\n \nAbout Paul being a Eunuch, these were not uncommon in the Early Church, and certainly Paul alludes to this as \"marks of the Lord Jesus\" and a \"light affliction\" that would bring him eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17). He also hints that he is one of the \"new creatures\" in Christ, neither circumcised nor uncircumcised- which is hard to pull off, unless he had no penis at all.\n\n Further\n \nSo how can he be both circumcised and uncircumcised at once?\n\n This is based on St.Paul's talks about circumcision.\n In this case circumcision is not just literal, it is that of belonging to God.\n Romans 2\n 27 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. \n 28 A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 29 No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.\n Thus you can be 'inwardly' circumcised, that is, in your heart, be committed to God. You can be physically signed to God, but not emotionally.\n He repeats this analogy throughout Romans, and in\n 1 Corinthians 7\n 18 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.\n \n False claim seven: Christians support the stoning of Adulterers\n \nI hope you wouldn't support the stoning to death of adulterous women, and few Christians I know of would. The same goes for Muslims.\n\n Christ said to those who were to stone the adulteress to stop. \n John 8\n 1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. \n 7 But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. \n 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \n 11\"No one, sir,\" she said. \n \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\"\n \n 2: Mizmaxx's false claims about Islam which I've already dealt with, but which she has not so far addressed.\n \n the Quran, it is not followed as a universal \"Islamic teaching\".\n\n The Koran is central to Muslim teaching.\n \"There are two main texts consulted by Muslims: \n the Qur'an (Recitation) are the words of God. Muslims believe that it was revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Jibril (Gabriel). This was originally in oral and written form; they were later assembled together into a single book, the Qur'an. Its name is often spelled \"Koran\" in English. This is not recommended, as some Muslims find it offensive. \n The Hadith, which are collections of the sayings of Muhammad (pbuh). They are regarded as the Sunnah (lived example) of Muhammad. The Quran gives legitimacy to the Hadith. It states: \"Nor does he say aught of his own desire. It is no less than inspiration sent down to him\" (53:3-4). However, the writings are not regarded as having the same status as the Holy Qur'an; the latter is considered to be God's word. The great Islamic scholar Yahya bin Sharaf Ul-Deen An-Nawawi compiled a collection of 43 sayings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is is now known as \"Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths\"\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/isl_intr.htm\n \"The Holy Qur'an :The most sacred book and the primary source of legislation. \n Hadith : The second source of legislation.\"\n http://www.al-islam.com/\n \n Context:\n Are the Mosaic laws for all time? NO... otherwise they'd have appeared at the beginning of Genesis. Is the Koran for all time? Yes (except for abrogated verses).\n \n \"Question : What is the Qur'aan? \n Answer : Praise be to Allaah. \n The Qur'aan is the word of the Lord of the Worlds, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to bring mankind forth from darkness into light: \n 'It is He Who sends down manifest Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to His slave (Muhammad) that He may bring you out from darkness into light\n [al-Hadeed 57:9 ? interpretation of the meaning] \n ...\n 'And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur'aan) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allaah as Muslims)?\n ...\n The Qur'aan is the Book of Allaah for all of mankind: \n ...\n After the Qur'aan was revealed, it became the Book for all of mankind until the Hour begins. Whoever does not believe in it is a kaafir who will be punished with torment on the Day of Resurrection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n 'But those who reject Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), the torment will touch them for their disbelief (and for their belying the Message of Muhammad)?[al-An'aam 6:49] \n Because of the greatness of the Qur?aan and the signs, miracles, parables and lessons contained therein, in addition to its eloquence and beautiful style, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n 'Had We sent down this Qur'\n aan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allaah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect'[al-Hashr 58:21] \n Allaah has challenged mankind and the jinn to produce something like it, even one soorah or one aayah, but they could not do that and will never be able to do that, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n 'Say: 'If the mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another''[al-Israa' 17:88] \n Because the Qur?aan is the greatest of the heavenly Books, the most complete, the most perfect and the last of them, Allaah commanded His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to convey it to all of mankind, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n 'O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allaah will protect you from mankind' [al-Maa'idah 5:67] \n Because of the importance of this book and the ummah?s need for it, Allaah has honoured us with it. He sent it down to us and has guaranteed to preserve it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n 'Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur'aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)' [al-Hijr 15:9] \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=e...&QR=10197&dgn=4\n \n Further to this I cited questions Moslems today ask of Islamic experts on a whole range of issues. Thus it is not my interpretation of the Koran, but theirs! They are in fact the people whom Moslems ask for interpretation of Islamic texts.\n \n \n 3: Mizmaxx's criticism of religion - displaying lack of insight.\n Several things Mizmaxx has used to point out the evils of Christianity - based on teachings in the Bible. Here is a brief and incomplete list of these same practices being used in Native American spirituality.\n \n Uncleanliness\n Mizmaxx cites Leviticus 12:1-5\n I cite this interesting little conversation...\n \"It's your period!\" I chuckle, pretentiously. \"You're taboo! Indians isolate menstruating women. They regard them as unclean, with dangerous powers.\" \n \"You're stupid!\" she scoffs. \"Indians will welcome me; they're my people.\" \n I yank some old textbooks off my shelf, to bolster my point. \n \"Menstrual fluid pollutes the world,\" I laugh, paraphrasing page 371 of Harold Driver's Indians of North America.\n \"Tribes will cover you with a blanket!\" I cackle, perusing James Frazer's, The Golden Bough, page 599. \n \"You're forbidden to pound acorns, enter sweat lodges, attend ceremonies, or mingle with hunters or shamans,\" I chortle, narrating the Smithsonian's Handbook of North American Indians, and Oglala Women by Marla Powers.\n http://www.gettingit.com/article/677\n \"Many Native American societies publicly celebrated a girl's first menstruation. For instance, the parents of girls among the Luise\u00f1o Indians of Southern California proudly announced to the community that their daughters were becoming women. The girls were partly buried in heated sand. They were not permitted to scratch themselves or eat salt, and they were given instructions by older women about the physiological changes that were occurring and how to behave as a woman and wife. For most North American girls today, public announcements that they had begun menstruating would be considered humiliating. However, it was a matter of personal and family pride in many Native American cultures.\"\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/social/soc_4.htm\n \"Starting with a girl's first menses in Native tradition, a woman's bleeding time was honored as inherently sacred, a spiritual calling her body made visible. \"Ancient mythology/spirituality envisions the fragile, vulnerable and utterly perishable body as indistinct from soul.\" (3) During her moon time, so called because it occurred during the darkness of the new moon, she was relieved of her daily responsibilities by family and relatives to spend these 4-5 days resting, praying, being cared for in the moon lodge tipi with other women.\"\n http://www.ofspirit.com/florencegaia1.htm\n \"...women on their Moon Time do not participate in Lakota ceremony...\"\n http://www.buffalodreaming.com/lakota.html (anyone can judiciously edit).\n \n Rape and other assault as a result of spirtuality\n Mizmaxx cites Deuteronomy 22:23-27, and Leviticus 19:20\n I cite\n \"The Native American family is an extended one that includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, as well as adopted relatives. The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family. Native American families are very close. If domestic violence occurs, the family is expected to take care of the problem. If a Native American woman goes outside the family for help, she is ostracized by her family and the batterer's family.\"\n http://www.msnusers.com/WomenandAbu...ricanwomen.msnw\n also\n \"Native American spirituality can be a source of profound support, comfort, and healing for many battered women. According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition, it can also serve to keep them in abusive relationships. The idea of connectedness to the earth and to each other is frequently used by the batterer and other family members as a reason for the woman to remain in a violent relationship.\"(Ibid.)\n Probably why\n \"Native American women experience the highest rate of violence of any group in the United States\"\n http://www.libertadlatina.org/nativ...%20violence.htm\n \n The value of men and women.\n Mizmaxx cites Leviticus 27:1-7\n I cite \n \"Native women performed so many tasks that to the settlers, they appeared to be slaves. For example, the title on this 1880s stereocard is 'Women's rights' followed by the elaboration: \"An Indian's idea of the same. Showing two squaws sitting beside their Teepe [sic], resting after carrying the wood seen beside them . . . while their leige [sic] lords and masters, (the noble red men,) are smoking.?\n http://photoswest.org/exhib/gallery4/daily.htm\n \"In the past, in all tribes women were valued for their skills. They brought forth the future nation and contributed as much as 80% of the labor needed to produce the family food supply.\"\n http://www.ldb.org/indheal.htm",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \nI know plenty of Muslim women who have lived in Muslim countries. You're mixing up religious fundamentalism + sexism with Islam. \n\n How have these women fared? Do they have the same rights that you have? (they may, I'm just curious)\n \n Perhaps I am mixing up fundamentalism with Islam. But if we compare the Christian fundamentalist with the Muslim fundamentalist what do we see? Is the Jerry Falwell school of bible-thumping or the Pat Robertson ultra-Christian similar to the Taliban warrior?\n \n What is the judicial system like in the moderate Muslim countries? I have heard that one can get his hand chopped off for stealing in Saudi Arabia. But that was a long time ago when I heard that. \n \n \nThe power of the Inquisition was established and enlarged by the Papacy through numerous Papal bulls. Don't forget that there was no \"separation of Church and State\".\n\n Heresy was a crime against the state (and the Church) at that time. Heresy was a denial of truth. People believed in the truth back then. They believed in it enough to kill to defend it. Was it the best way? No. Was it immoral? In most cases, yes. Were the inquisitions established and enlarged by the papacy? Yes. Was the Church's intent to go on a killing rampage via inquisitions? No.\n \n \nYes.\n\n You're saying Native Americans and other natives had the technology and ability to travel overseas and attempt to conquer other nations?\n \n \nI've never heard of them doing to anyone what the Europeans did to them. Don't try to limit this to \"warring\" with other Nations (\"tribes\" is a misnomer, BTW), or \"taking bounty\". There is simply no comparison in Native cultures to the wholesale slaughter which came with colonisation.\n\n \n \nIt doesn't matter what Native people were. There is absolutely no excuse for the behavior of the colonial Church/government in the Americas. \n That said, it's clear that Native ppl at least had going for them that they weren't as bad as the Europeans. And on the whole, Native Nations were much more democratic, egalitarian and non-violent than their European counterparts. \n \n You are attempting to hold the Europeans to a higher law than the Native Americans were held to or held themselves to before the Europeans ever appeared. Natives did, in fact, war on and conquer others.\n \n I have taken two introductory college level courses on Native Americans. I have read In The Spirit of Crazy Horse  by Peter Matthiesen on the American Indian Movement, Black Elk Speaks  by John Nierhardt on native spirituality, and am currently reading The Lance and The Shield The Life and Times of Sitting Bull  by Robert M. Utley. I own and have watched the Discovery Channel documentaries How the West Was Lost I & II. I own Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and it is on my \"To Read\" list.\n \n I do not share this with you to become a pedant or to pretend to be an authority. I simply wish to demonstrate my interest in Native American culture. I find Native Americans to be fascinating and I respect their history of bravery, intimacy with and knowledge of nature, tribal solidarity, and perseverence. But to say that they were the victims of war and had never been the perpetrators of war is false.\n \n Let me quote from The Lance and The Shield page 8, \"Even more than the hunt, war preoccupied the Hunkpapas. Alone and allied with friendly tribes such as the Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho, they fought continually against enemy tribes. Where their range overlapped with that of others, they fought for control of hunting grounds. They fought in defense against the aggressions of others. They fought for plunder, chiefly the horses that comprised the prime measure of wealth. They fought for revenge, in retaliation for injuries real and fancied. They fought for glory and the strictly prescribed war honors that determined prestige and leadership. They fought because they had always fought and knew no other way.\"\n \n The tomahawk of the Native was no more virtuous than the gun of the European. There was treachery on both sides and valor on both sides.\n \n \nI'm saying it is debated whether \"Aztec human sacrifices\" actually occurred. The evidence is unclear. Regardless, yes, generally cultures which exalt human sacrifice use willing participants. I mean, you tell me- wasn't Jesus a \"voluntary sacrifice\"?\n\n Yes, Jesus was a voluntary sacrifice. But his goal was not to perpetuate human sacrifice it was to end it (in the violent, malicious sense). His goal was to give meaning to sacrifice to end meaningless sacrifice. His sacrifice was a sacrifice of God as well as man. \n \n \nSo, in conclusion, you opinion is that these actions and encouragements by the Catholic Church were morally correct?\n\n Men of the Church are sinners but the teaching of the Church on faith and morals is incorruptible.\n \n \nThe word marriage came from Latin maritare, union under the auspices of the Goddess Aphrodite-Man. Because the Goddess's patronage was constantly invoked in every aspect of marriage, Christian fathers were opposed to the institution. Origen declared, \"Matrimony is impure and unholy, a means of sexual passion.\" St. Jerome said the primary purpose of a man of God was to \"cut down with an ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage.\"' St. Ambrose said marriage was a crime against God, because it changed the state of virginity that God gave every man and woman at birth.2 Marriage was prostitution of the members of Christ, and \"married people ought to blush at the state in which they are living.\" Tertullian said marriage was a moral crime, \"more dreadful than any punishment or any death.\" It was spurcitiae, \"obscenity,\" or \"filth.\"\n St. Augustine flatly stated that marriage is a sin. Tatian said marriage is corruption, \"a polluted and foul way of life.\" Influenced by him, Syrian churches ruled that no person could become Christian except celibate men, and no man who had ever been married could be baptized. Saturninus said God made only two kinds of people, good men and evil women. Marriage perpetuated the deviltry of women, who dominated men through the magic of sex.4 Centuries later, St. Bernard still proclaimed that it was easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his soul.5\n St. Paul damned marriage with faint praise, remarking that to marry was only better than to burn (1 Corinthians 7:9); but later followers of Pauline Christianity damned marriage altogether, according to the word of Jesus: \"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple\" (Luke 14:26). Jesus renounced his family, declaring that he had no relatives except the faithful (Mark 3:31-35). Jerome interpreted this as a mandate to destroy marriage and the family. He was disgusted by motherhood: \"the tumefaction of the uterus, the care of yelling infants, all those fond feelings which death at last cuts short.\"6 He said every man who loves his wife passionately was guilty of adultery.7 Augustine also expressed disgust at feminine sexual and maternal functions. He coined the saying that birth is demonstrably accursed because every child emerges \"between feces and urine.\"8\n An example of anti-family virtue was made of one of the artificial saints built on a title of the pro-family Goddess, Perpetua, \"the Eternal One.\" In her new Christian disguise as St. Perpetua, she was so devoted to single blessedness that she not only faced martyrdom with equanimity but also renounced her parents, her husband, and her suckling infant in order to become Christian. Her pagan relatives tried to soften her heart by putting the infant to her breast, but she threw it aside and said to them, \"Begone from me, enemies of God, for I know you not!\"9\n This was the early Christian notion of a \"good\" woman: one who placed faith before family. Church customs reflected this view. There was no Christian sacrament of marriage until the 16th century.'\u00b0 Catholic scholars say the wedding ceremony was \"imposed on\" a reluctant church, and \"nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved.\" It is perhaps not remarkable to find that these liturgical forms were not evolved by the church at all, but borrowed from pagans' common law.1' \n \n Aren't Paul's writings the earliest Christian ones? What does Ephesians 5 say about marriage?\n \n \"21Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. \n 22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy, cleansing[1] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\"",

Then on the other hand - she provides evidence from Islamic women who find Islam actualy quite liberating.

   "Jito,\n \nThe common also deserves the right to think about a thing and make up his/her own mind.\n\n Yes, the common man does deserve that right. He also deserves the truth. The common man uses common sense. He has enough sense to know that some are smarter than he. He has enough sense not to throw away the knowledge of those before him. One must shuffle through all of the information that is there, not throw it out wholesale, and then determine what is the most accurate history of the truth. \n \n What would you do if you lost your Bible and couldn't replace it for some reason?\n \n \nTruth is not an institution.\n\n No it is not. Nor is the Catholic Church simply an institution.\n \n \nI don't know - I don't think so. But Mary is dead. I certainly won't ask the dead.\n \n The whole praying to anyone but God makes me highly unfortable from what I have read in the Bible. I am not gonna do it.\n\n We do not pray to dead people. Our God is a God of the living, not of the dead. (Mk 12:26-27, Luke 16:19-30, luke 23:43, Mk 9:4). We are promised eternal LIFE. Do not forget the living presence of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration. And the elders in Revelation were living souls in heaven. They were not dead. They were not angels because the angels were mentioned separately. Who were they? Unless there is a species besides humans and angels that we have not heard of, then this seems to be evidence that human souls live and are in action in heaven. Remember also that we are united in the mystical body of Christ as believers.\n \n Now, it is true that the saints mentioned in Revelation are the living Christians on earth. But their prayers are submitted to God nonetheless. Why do they pray? They petition God, as Paul tells us to do (Rom 15:30, Col 4:3, 1 Thess 5:25, 2 Thess 3:1, Eph 6:18,19, 1 Tim 2:1-7). So, their prayer is intercessory whether they are asking the ones in heaven to pray for them or whether they are praying to God themselves. Even if they ask God for something for themselves they are interceding. This shows that we can take action in prayer and petition God. The fact that Paul asks us to intercede for others and the fact that there are animated human souls in heaven presents the implication that we may ask those in heaven for prayers just as we ask those on earth to pray for us. This also tells us something of the nature of intercession. We can intercede for one another without taking any of the glory away from the mediation of Christ. This is what Catholics do. When it is said that we pray \"to\" saints this is perhaps a misleading choice of words. In reality, Catholics ask the saints for their prayers so that they may intercede for us. Paul understood this, Catholics understand it.\n \n \nNo. I don't believe Jesus and the Holy Spirit are God. They are seperate and inferior.\n\n I have a few questions then:\n Why does it say in John 1:1-14  that Jesus was the Word and the Word is God?\n \n Why does Jesus take the name of God as his own in John 8:58-59? Why are the Jews ready to stone him to death for \"making himself God?\"\n \n Why does Thomas call Jesus \"my Lord and my God\" in John 20:28  with no correction from Jesus?\n \n Why does Paul say of Jesus in Colossians 2:9 that the \"whole fullness of deity bodily\" dwells in him?\n \n Why in the letter to Titus (Titus 2:13) is Jesus spoken of as great God and Savior?\n \n Is Jesus inferior to God?\n John 10:30-33  \"the Father and I are one\"\n John 14:8-12  \"whoever has seen me has seen the Father\"\n \n \nThey can. However, Kerry is running on the Democratic ticket and has made his stance with the issues on that. For the church to try and get him to change his stance is unfair to his constituency - and innapropriate. To Kerry's credit, the church has been unsuccessful.\n\n But is Kerry truly a Catholic if he does not hold Catholic views? He is profiting from pretending to be a \"Catholic\" politician yet he does not want to put forth Catholic teaching. Therefore his title as a Catholic politician is a sham.\n \n \nBecause they believe that private medical decisions don't belong with government. Because they can't possibly know every story and be equipped to make decisions for strangers. Because they don't believe in enforcing their morality on total strangers.\n\n So you want a pro-life person to sit quietly, not defend his beliefs, and call himself pro-choice?\n \n \nI never argued for sex outside of marriage. I know the Bible stands against that. I argued against the Pope sticking his nose is married people's sex lives and I disagree with the church's stand on birth control.\n\n The pope does not stick his nose into people's sex lives. He conveys Christian teaching on marriage and sex that has been around for ages. \n \n Have you ever tried to really understand the Church's teaching on contraception or are you just reactionary?\n \n \nTo step away from religion a moment - as a contemporary (rock) music fan and musician - contemporary Christian (rock) music is TERRIBLE. Horrible copy-cats - nothing original about it. You want to hear rock I can name dozens of bands and artists that are original and much, much MUCH better.\n\n Well I would like to hear the names of those original and better bands--I'm always interested in music and would be curious about your tastes. You are right-- a lot of Christian music is horrible, downright sappy, and lacking talent.\n \n But have you heard Switchfoot? They have a song (#2, I think) on the VH-1 countdown now. I have had that album \"The Beautiful Letdown\" for months now and it is just now getting some secular airplay--all of their previous albums are good by the way. \n \n What about Third Day, Polarboy, Telecast, Salvador, LaRue, Crispin, 12 Stones? You might be surprised.\n \n What about those bands that show a strong Christian influence--Creed, P.O.D., Evanescence, Lifehouse, Ben Harper?\n \n What about Weezer, The Cure, Jimi Hendrix, Cake, Depeche Mode, Midnight Oil? (just kidding)\n \n \nYou have a point about judgment - but we were talking about extremes - you said none exist in Catholicism. I would say this is an extreme.\n\n Extremism exists in the people of the Catholic Church that is certain. But the teaching of the Church balances all things and encourages its people to do so. It knows that extremism leads to heresy.\n \n \nStudying the creation is not erroneous - and the creation is so much cooler than a book, anyway. Science keeps me faithful. I see God's hand everywhere.\n \n AND when faith and science cross and agree is when you have it.\n\n I didn't mean to say that studying creation was erroneous. I meant that erroneous information must be recognized and discarded. There is no contradiction in faith and science. God works in his creation. But we cannot confine God to working in his creation. He is supernatural. The explanations of the moon bleeding and David and Goliath seem reasonable and are possible but we don't have to examine every aspect of God's Word by science. He can act in creation and be proven by science but he can act outside of the creation known to us and baffle science.\n \n \nNobody - but you have not addressed my question as to why celibacy is required for priests by your church.\n\n I thought I had. All of what I previously posted answers that question. It is a demonstration and oath of total self-giving following that total self-giving of Christ. It is a pledge that one forsakes things of this world for a higher purpose out of this world. \n \n No one forces anyone to be a priest. It is a choice in response to a calling. One who becomes a priest also chooses celibacy so that he can be about the things of the Lord, not about the things of the world. Celibacy is not a restriction but a freedom. It is not an imposition but a gift.",

   "\n Yes, the common man does deserve that right. He also deserves the truth. The common man uses common sense. He has enough sense to know that some are smarter than he. He has enough sense not to throw away the knowledge of those before him. One must shuffle through all of the information that is there, not throw it out wholesale, and then determine what is the most accurate history of the truth. \n\n \n I don't throw anything out wholesale. I listen, and then I make up my own mind.\n \n \nWhat would you do if you lost your Bible and couldn't replace it for some reason?\n\n \n Be very sad - and also be very grateful that I have had the chance to read it much.\n \n \nWe do not pray to dead people. Our God is a God of the living, not of the dead. (Mk 12:26-27, Luke 16:19-30, luke 23:43, Mk 9:4). We are promised eternal LIFE. Do not forget the living presence of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration. And the elders in Revelation were living souls in heaven. They were not dead. They were not angels because the angels were mentioned separately. Who were they? Unless there is a species besides humans and angels that we have not heard of, then this seems to be evidence that human souls live and are in action in heaven. Remember also that we are united in the mystical body of Christ as believers.\n \n Now, it is true that the saints mentioned in Revelation are the living Christians on earth. But their prayers are submitted to God nonetheless. Why do they pray? They petition God, as Paul tells us to do (Rom 15:30, Col 4:3, 1 Thess 5:25, 2 Thess 3:1, Eph 6:18,19, 1 Tim 2:1-7). So, their prayer is intercessory whether they are asking the ones in heaven to pray for them or whether they are praying to God themselves. Even if they ask God for something for themselves they are interceding. This shows that we can take action in prayer and petition God. The fact that Paul asks us to intercede for others and the fact that there are animated human souls in heaven presents the implication that we may ask those in heaven for prayers just as we ask those on earth to pray for us. This also tells us something of the nature of intercession. We can intercede for one another without taking any of the glory away from the mediation of Christ. This is what Catholics do. When it is said that we pray \"to\" saints this is perhaps a misleading choice of words. In reality, Catholics ask the saints for their prayers so that they may intercede for us. Paul understood this, Catholics understand it.\n\n \n OK OK - I get it. But I am still not comfortable with it, so I am not gonna do it. The idea just makes me feel all guilty and icky. I can't do it.\n \n \n\n I have a few questions then:\n Why does it say in John 1:1-14  that Jesus was the Word and the Word is God?\n\n \n I have also seen this translated \"the word was with God.\" As a matter of fact my college religion prof used that translation. - AND he was a monk.\n \n \nWhy does Jesus take the name of God as his own in John 8:58-59? Why are the Jews ready to stone him to death for \"making himself God?\"\n\n \n I do believe Jesus pre-dates Abraham. I think lots of stuff did. The angels pre-date the earth for starters. I think Jesus was around before his earthly birth.\n \n \nWhy does Thomas call Jesus \"my Lord and my God\" in John 20:28  with no correction from Jesus?\n\n \n He is our Lord.\n \n \nWhy does Paul say of Jesus in Colossians 2:9 that the \"whole fullness of deity bodily\" dwells in him?\n \n Why in the letter to Titus (Titus 2:13) is Jesus spoken of as great God and Savior?\n\n \n I think I need to do a lot more research on Paul. I am starting to notice that almost everything that frustrates me in the Bible, everything that causes discord for me came from Paul. Why is he included, when several gospels were left out? Why was he chosen over the stories of those who actually knew Christ? I need to find out more. Until then I think I will refrain from commenting on Paul.\n \n \nIs Jesus inferior to God?\n John 10:30-33  \"the Father and I are one\"\n John 14:8-12  \"whoever has seen me has seen the Father\"\n\n \n Because he is a reflection of the father. He has an intimacy with him we do not. He is our link to God. It is like I said before \"you hurt my kid, you hurt me\" - I do not think they are one and the same.\n \n \nBut is Kerry truly a Catholic if he does not hold Catholic views? He is profiting from pretending to be a \"Catholic\" politician yet he does not want to put forth Catholic teaching. Therefore his title as a Catholic politician is a sham.\n\n \n See this is what I hate about churches. You must absolutely agree with Guidelines A through X - no using your own brain. It's why I won't belong to any church.\n \n \nSo you want a pro-life person to sit quietly, not defend his beliefs, and call himself pro-choice?\n\n \n Let's stop. There is a whole section dedicated to this topic and we are gonna digress here...\n \n \nThe pope does not stick his nose into people's sex lives. He conveys Christian teaching on marriage and sex that has been around for ages.\n\n \n Hey - YOU were the one who said that the Pope wants people to be chaste in their marriages. Why he should have any expectations of anyone's (married) sex lives is beyond me.\n \n \nHave you ever tried to really understand the Church's teaching on contraception or are you just reactionary?\n\n \n I tell you what I am. I am a product of a world where women weren't given choices, power or rights over their own bodies. My grandmother and mother had to fight tooth and nail to have any say over how many children they would have. My grandmother never got the right - she was not allowed (by law) tubals, birth control or the right to tell her sorry sod of a husband no. They had 11 kids in a one room shack that he would not work to support. My mother's doctor had to lie to my dad so she could get her tubes tied and stop having babies as he was not going to grant her permission. My old man walked out ten years later. I myself spent three years physically and sexually abused by my loser of an ex who does not support his kid today. One in three women is raped. Men walk on their kids ALL THE TIME. The Catholic church's stand on birth control is mighty pretty in writing - but hurts women in the real world. I know - I am woman living there and I have seen it.\n \n \nWell I would like to hear the names of those original and better bands--I'm always interested in music and would be curious about your tastes. You are right-- a lot of Christian music is horrible, downright sappy, and lacking talent.\n\n \n So many bands! Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Offspring, U2, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Doors, Tho Who, The Headstones, Everclear (OK they are kinda poppy), Concrete Blonde, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Jet, The Living End, Likehell, The Cure, Led Zepplin, Janis Joplin, ZZ Top, The Talking Heads, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Blondie, The RAMONES!!!, ummm give me an hour and I will talk your ear off. I love music - especially ROCK AND ROLL. And I play bass.\n \n \nBut have you heard Switchfoot? They have a song (#2, I think) on the VH-1 countdown now. I have had that album \"The Beautiful Letdown\" for months now and it is just now getting some secular airplay--all of their previous albums are good by the way. \n \n What about Third Day, Polarboy, Telecast, Salvador, LaRue, Crispin, 12 Stones? You might be surprised.\n\n \n I have heard of Switchfoot, and I heard a very nice song on VH1 - a woman singing about jesus - very bluesy. It was good.\n \n \nWhat about those bands that show a strong Christian influence--Creed, P.O.D., Evanescence, Lifehouse, Ben Harper?\n\n \n I hate to break it to you but Creed sucks big time. Pearl Jam wannabies. Gag. And Evanescence needs to join the Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Dido, Tori Amos \"please get me some anti-depressants\" club.\n \n U2 has quite a bit of Christian influence and Bono is an AMAZING poet. Lots of Biblical references.\n \n \nWhat about Weezer, The Cure, Jimi Hendrix, Cake, Depeche Mode, Midnight Oil? (just kidding)\n\n \n Nice list - but Midnight Oil? I have been working on \"Long Line of Cars\" by Cake this week (on bass).\n \n \nI didn't mean to say that studying creation was erroneous. I meant that erroneous information must be recognized and discarded. There is no contradiction in faith and science. God works in his creation. But we cannot confine God to working in his creation. He is supernatural. The explanations of the moon bleeding and David and Goliath seem reasonable and are possible but we don't have to examine every aspect of God's Word by science. He can act in creation and be proven by science but he can act outside of the creation known to us and baffle science.\n\n \n I think we do need to examine his word by science and history and all of it. It will help us to see his hand NOW. Too often the faithful dismiss the creation. \n \n Plus it's FUN.\n \n I think God ALWAYS acts within his creation. He is quite organized. We just don't have all the answers yet. \n \n Wasn't it cool for him to make it all so interesting? How can we ever be bored?\n \n \nI thought I had. All of what I previously posted answers that question. It is a demonstration and oath of total self-giving following that total self-giving of Christ. It is a pledge that one forsakes things of this world for a higher purpose out of this world. \n\n \n But my point is that it's a rule of men - not God. \n \n \nNo one forces anyone to be a priest. It is a choice in response to a calling. One who becomes a priest also chooses celibacy so that he can be about the things of the Lord, not about the things of the world. Celibacy is not a restriction but a freedom. It is not an imposition but a gift.\n\n \n You do not have to tell me that. I would just as soon toss myself off a cliff than marry again. I like owning my life.",

   "Do you think that the insertion of the word \"and\" is important?\n \n LF,\n\n \n It is very important. It connects the two phrases \"our great God\" AND \"Saviour Jesus Christ\"\n \n \"Greek: prosdechomenoi (PMPMPN) ten makarian elpida kai epiphaneian tes doxes tou megalou theou kai soteros hemon Iesou Christou,\n Young's Literal: waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,\n KJV: Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;\"\n \n If these two were separate it would read \"and the glorious appearing of the great God and of Saviour Jesus Christ\"\n or\n \"and the glorious appearing of the great God and with Saviour Jesus Christ\"\n \n Even if you contest this as the heretical Arians do, it ignores context of other verses such as\n Jesus is equal to God\n \n Colossians 1:19 \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n and the plethora of other verses I addressed to you in another thread which you simply ignored.\n \n \n \n As one commentator says....\n \n Verse 13. Of the great God. There can be little doubt, if any, that by \"the great God\" here, the apostle referred to the Lord Jesus, for it is not a doctrine of the New Testament that God himself as such, or in contradistinction from his incarnate Son, will appear at the last day. It is said, indeed, that the Saviour will come \"in the glory of his Father with his angels,\" (Matthew 16:27,) but that God as such will appear, is not taught in the Bible. The doctrine there is, that God will be manifest in his Son; that the Divine approach to our world will be through him to judge the race; and that though he will be accompanied with the appropriate symbols of the Divinity, yet it will be the Son of God who will be visible. No one, accustomed to Paul's views, can well doubt that when ne used this language he had his eye throughout on the Son of God, and that he expected no other manifestation than what would be made through him. In no place in the New Testament is the phrase \\~epifaneian tou yeou\\~ \" the manifestation or appearing of God\"--applied to any other one than Christ. It is true that this is spoken of here as the \"appearing of the glory \\~thv doxhv\\~ --of the great God;\" but the idea is that of such a manifestation as became God, or would appropriately display his glory. It is known to most persons who have attended to religious controversies, that this passage has given rise to much discussion. The ancients, in general, interpreted it as meaning, \"The glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" This sense has been vindicated by the labours of Beza, Whitby, Bull, Matthaei, and Middleton, (on the Greek article,) and is the common interpretation of those who claim to be orthodox. See Bloomfield, Rec. Syn., and Notes, in loc. He contends that the meaning is, \"the glorious appearance of that GREAT BEING who is our GOD AND SAVIOUR.\" The arguments for this opinion are well summed up by Bloomfield. Without going into a critical examination of this passage, which would not be in accordance with the design of these Notes, it may be remarked in general, \n \n (1.) that no plain reader of the New Testament, accustomed to the common language there, would have any doubt that the apostle referred here to the coming of the Lord Jesus. \n \n (2.) That the \"coming\" of God, as such, is not spoken of in this manner in the New Testament. \n \n (3.) That the expectation of Christians was directed to the advent of the ascended Saviour, not to the appearing of God as such. \n \n (4.) That this is just such language as one would use who believed that the Lord Jesus is Divine, or that the name God might properly be applied to him. \n \n (5.) That it would naturally and obviously convey the idea that he was Divine, to one who had no theory to defend. \n \n (6.) That if the apostle did not mean this, he used such language as was fitted to lead men into error. And \n \n (7.) that the fair construction of the Greek here, according to the application of the most rigid rules, abundantly sustains the interpretation which the plain reader of the New Testament would affix to it. The names above referred to are abundant proof that no violation is done to the rules of the Greek language by this interpretation, but rather that the fair construction of the original demands it. If this be so, then this furnishes an important proof of the divinity of Christ\n \n http://www.studylight.org/com/bnn/view.cgi?book=tit&chapter=2&verse=1#Tit2_1\n \n Another commentary reads:\n \"Various arguments have been used in an attempt to get around the fact this is a clear affirmation of the deity of Christ, but the same point of grammar (the Granville Sharp rule) that shows ?the blessed hope and glorious appearing? are one and the same event applies here as well. That only one article governs the two nouns, God and Savior, shows us only one person is in view, namely, our great God and Savior who is Jesus Christ. This verse is very precise and is a clear example of the grammatical rule discussed in footnote above.136 Further, nowhere in the New Testament is the term ?appearing? or epiphany, used with reference to God the Father nor is He portrayed as coming with the Lord Jesus at the time of Christ?s return. Towner summarizes some of the arguments in favor of the interpretation that two persons are in view, God the Father (the great God) and Jesus Christ (our Savior):\"\n http://www.bible.org/docs/nt/books/tit/jhk3/tit-06.htm#TopOfPage\n \n \n It is why the church stated in the Nicean Creed...\n \"I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; (Exodus 33.20; Job 36:26; Deuteronomy 4:39; Isaiah 45:5-6; Matthew 16:25-26; 10:28; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Hebrews 10:38-39), \n And in one Lord Jesus Christ (John 5:18-23; Revelation 19:11-16; Romans 10:8-13) the Son of God (John 8:58; 1 John 4:9; Exodus 3:6; Hebrews 1:2-8), the Only-begotten Begotten of the Father before all worlds (John 1:18; Hebrews 1:3), (John 3:16), (John 1:1-2; 1:18; Hebrews 1:8-9), Light of Light (Isaiah 60:19-20; John 1:4-9, 8:12, 10:30, 17:21; 1 John 1:5) Very God of Very God (John 20:28; Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1; Psalm 106:21), Begotten not made; (1:14; Colossians 1:16-17), of one essence with the Father (John 1:1; 10:30; 14:9-10; Hebrews 1:3), by Whom all things were made: (John 1:3; 1 Corinthians 8:6; ; Hebrews 1:2),\n Who for us men and for our salvation (Genesis 1:26 5:1. 9:6 2:7; Matthew 10:28; 1 Timothy 1:15; James 5:20; Ephesians 2:8), came down from heaven (John 16:28) and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; (Matthew 16:13-16; John 1:14; Hebrews 4:15;Philippians 2:6-7),\n And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; (Matthew 16:21; Mark 10:45; Romans 8:32; Philippians 2:8) \n And on the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; (Mark 10:34; Luke 24:46; 1 Corinthians 15:4), \n And ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9) and sits at the right hand of the Father;\n And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose Kingdom shall have no end (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:25-29; Revelation 22:12), \n And Believe in the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; John 15:26; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 3:17-18; 13:14), the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the prophets;\n And I believe in the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.\n I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.\n I look for the resurrection of the dead,\n and the life of the world to come.

   "That's a truism of any beliefs. You said that it didn't form a central part. This is clearly wrong for the majority of Muslims. \n\n Not the ones I know. The ones I know could be a minority, or a majority. I don't know. Do you have statistics on the matter, or are you just assuming that the ones you've spoken to are in the majority?\n \n \nAgain, I don't take isolated texts from the Koran, I use current and Islamic understanding about the texts... \n\n We're supposed to presume that the one person you're speaking for speaks for all or even \"the majority\" of Muslims? \n \n Even if he/she did, would this be proof that Islam itself is inherently oppressive to women or anything else you accuse it of? No.\n \n \nWhat is a Moslem? The very fact that we have a term means that there are common definitions of this.\n\n Sure. That doesn't mean that yours is the correct definition, neither does it mean that there is no diversity in it's expression.\n \n \n You have made a statement about your notion of the Koran, and it's a major mistake. \n\n Which is that? \n \n \nAre you saying then that your religion is one dominated by pocularis, and whims?\n \n Nope.\n \n \nYes, it is. I gave you the over-all settings.\n\n Which do not erase the beginning of the statement. \"Your wife is inferior. Oh, but be nice to her.\" Gee, what a heart-warming declaration of equality... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI note in ending the fact that you defend Muhammad's actions towards an under-age girl.\n\n Actually, I didn't. I said that it is not necessary to follow that particular action of Muhammad's to be Muslim, as it is not necessary to follow's Lot's, or even Jesus', to be Christian. Everyone picks and chooses, despite what some say.\n \n On the contrary, you defend Lot's action of having sex with his two daughters by blaming the entire thing on the daughters (who, for all you know, could have been small children), and on top of it accusing them of being \"sluts\". I never did anything of the sort in regards to Muhammad's actions.\n \n \n1) her misinterpretation of Christian texts\n\n Sorry, but I think you're the one misinterpreting. The texts should speak for themselves. It seems clear to me that\n \n -Lot was a child abuser who wanted to give his daughters to a rabid mob to save to male strangers.\n \n - Jesus refers to a law which states that disobedient children should be killed, and admonished the Jewish priests for not following it. (You say he's just talking about the first part of the law, not the second, but this is not specified, whereas in other places other laws are specifically refuted).\n \n -The portion of \"Peter\" you refer to clearly is about wives being submissive so that they can convert their husbands through manipulation.\n \n -Ephesians is equally clear. No amount of canonical pussyfooting can escape the fact that the word \"submit\" is used, and the concept is clearly one of female inferiority.\n \n -Romans is homophobic, and thus women are relagated to secondary status.\n \n -\nFalse claim six: St. Paul was a eunuch\n This starts of with a wishy-washy statement\n\n Actually, I said he \"may have been a eunuch\". \n \n -\nFalse claim seven: Christians support the stoning of Adulterers\n\n Some do, and many have done at different times. Scripture notwithstanding- it's not my job to make sure people don't misuse scripture to excuse horrendous acts...\n \n \nThe Koran is central to Muslim teaching.\n\n You keep repeating the same tired arguments, but they aren't getting any more convincing.\n \n \nIts name is often spelled \"Koran\" in English. This is not recommended, as some Muslims find it offensive.\n\n Yet you this is how you spell it. So much for your \"expertise\" on Islam, you can't even spell the name of their holy book.\n \n \nSeveral things Mizmaxx has used to point out the evils of Christianity - based on teachings in the Bible. Here is a brief and incomplete list of these same practices being used in Native American spirituality.\n\n You quote passages which describe not \"uncleanliness\", but sacredness and respect for transitions to womanhood. \n \n \nRape and other assault as a result of spirtuality\n\n The best you can come up with, in response to child molestation and throwing your children to a horny mob, is that Native families are close-knit and thus it is hard to escape your abuser (just as in non-Native close-knit communities)? Is this a joke?\n \n \nThe value of men and women.\n\n Again, the best you can come up with are settler impressions of Native culture (er, the same ppl who considered Natives non-human), and the quote from the same article which says, on the one hand \"As far as North America is concerned, this relates to the large cultural diversity among American Indians (Hodgkenson 1990), which makes it almost impossible to write about Indigenous people as they are by no means one distinctive population group.\"\n \n \"In the past, in all tribes women were valued for their skills. (...)Traditionally, in Indigenous cultures women have their own power. Some call it Moon Power, but nevertheless it is a power owned only by women.\n \n \nHow have these women fared? Do they have the same rights that you have? (they may, I'm just curious)\n\n They didn't live in a fundamentalist country, so they didn't see it as much different from here.\n \n \nHeresy was a crime against the state (and the Church) at that time. Heresy was a denial of truth. People believed in the truth back then.\n\n Doesn't seem like the \"people\" believed in the Church's idea of \"truth\", as so many ppl were found guilty, in fact some whole towns were burned.\n \n \nYou're saying Native Americans and other natives had the technology and ability to travel overseas and attempt to conquer other nations?\n\n Those living in coastal areas had means to travel overseas, but most Native cultures did not invest time and energy in developing tools for warfare so much as they developed political, social and cutural abilities. Remember, the Haudenosaunee (and many other nations) had a direct participatory democracy during an era when most Europeans were oppressed serfs.\n \n \nNatives did, in fact, war on and conquer others.\n\n Can you find an example which parallels the level of destruction and indiscriminate slaughter which the Europeans caused in North America? Native warriors, in general, had honor, thus did not kill ppl who were defenseless, such as children and their mothers. The European colonists made this type of activity common protocol. There's no comparison.\n \n \nYes, Jesus was a voluntary sacrifice. But his goal was not to perpetuate human sacrifice it was to end it (in the violent, malicious sense).\n\n Why did your God demand human sacrifice in the first place? How is this different from any other human sacrifice tradition?\n \n \nMen of the Church are sinners but the teaching of the Church on faith and morals is incorruptible.\n\n Who decides what the \"teachings of the Church\" are? Wasn't it the clergy?\n \n \nAren't Paul's writings the earliest Christian ones? \n\n The best Paul could say for marriage, it would seem, was that it was \"better to marry than to burn\". However, he was clear that he felt chastity was superior.\n \n \nFor she can't say it is sexist, and then present evidence to suggest the opposite - and have us believe in both.\n\n That's a difference between you and I, I don't believe that any faith is defined by the worst of it's number, whereas you seem to believe that all are, excepting of course your own.\n \n There are sexist forms of Islam, and there are sexist forms of Christianity. There are women fighting sexism in both, who find something liberating in both. Neither do I particularly understand, as they aren't my beliefs, but I am supportive of liberation everywhere.",

If you want to divide the Islamic world between those who follow Islamic practices and those who don't, that's fine. You know a few good Muslims, and so do I.\n \nAgain, I don't take isolated texts from the Koran, I use current and Islamic understanding about the texts... \n\n \nWe're supposed to presume that the one person you're speaking for speaks for all or even \"the majority\" of Muslims?\n\n Firstly, you do that very thing, by assuming the few Muslims you know are typical. I have quoted from two different sites that Moslems right to for advice. You haven't. You should also look at the views put forward by TruthKeeper in his arguments with me - especially note how he tries to justify Muhammad's sex with an under-age girl - by suggesting she, at nine years old, was exceptionally bright. \n \nWhat is a Moslem? The very fact that we have a term means that there are common definitions of this. \n\n \nSure. That doesn't mean that yours is the correct definition, neither does it mean that there is no diversity in it's expression.\n\n I'm not arguing that there's diversity in expression - yet another of your straw-man arguments you're so intent on making... except you don't see that there's much variety with regards to Catholicism, which is why you express such hate for it.\n I am saying that Moslems for the most part believe the Koran is central. You don't. I've provided evidences to back up my claim, you just make supposition that some Muslims might not hold the Koran as dear. Again, you weight your opinion as being the equal to evidentiary citations - even when those sites are Islamic.\n \nYou have made a statement about your notion of the Koran, and it's a major mistake. \n\n \nWhich is that? \n\n Don't be coy. The one where you suggested it's not central to their beliefs....\n Post 107\n \nBecause despite being written in the Quran, it is not followed as a universal \"Islamic teaching\".\n\n It is. You do your case no good by such supposition. Not only did I give you quotes from several Islamic sites that agree with this... you don't. All you do is take the lazy way and suggest the opposite. You in fact make a gross mistake here and goes to show just how little you know about the subject - because the very text that they rely on, which is at the centre of Islamic belief, well how it relates to them is something you're not even familiar with. Far be that to stand in your way.\n \nYes, it is. I gave you the over-all settings.\n\n \nWhich do not erase the beginning of the statement. \"Your wife is inferior. Oh, but be nice to her.\" Gee, what a heart-warming declaration of equality... \n\n I think you'll always believe this. However, even if you are correct, then you still have to reconcile how you believe that this is in anyway comparable to Islamic texts. They are not. Your argument here would again revert to one based on you misunderstanding of Muslim ideas of Muhammad, and the Koran - only two small glitches in your debate.\n Further, your interpretation simply proves that you interpret it so. I gave secondary sources, notably from the book \"Pagans and Christians\" by Fox that show that women in early Christian society had a prominent status. Thus your opinion - how you interpret the Bible - you place the same evidential weight on that, as against actual citations that I have made from historical proofs. That's rather arrogant of you Mizmaxx - your opinion = experts in the field - and you don't even show what basis you base your opinion on - no citations whatsoever.\n \n I note in ending the fact that you defend Muhammad's actions towards an under-age girl. \n\n \nActually, I didn't. I said that it is not necessary to follow that particular action of Muhammad's to be Muslim, as it is not necessary to follow's Lot's, or even Jesus', to be Christian. Everyone picks and chooses, despite what some say.\n\n This is incorrect. You do defend Islam's treatment of women (ipso facto Muhammad's relations with Aisha) based on your notion that Christianity teaches the same levels of sexism.\n Secondly why don't you just come out and say what you believe about Aisha? You've spouted your opinion instead of facts on every other issue - here's an opportunity simply for you to offer an opinion -where an opinion is warranted. I would like to hear this because it's interesting in light of the fact you think wearing a head-scarf in church is deeply oppressive.\n Next you argument is illogical because it is based on your wrong notions about how the majority of Muslims see Muhammad. You simply make 'just so' statements to this matter; whereas I have cited sites that show that Muhammad is viewed as the ideal man... who's behaviour is an example for all time. Most of your argument is based on mere suppositions and just-so statements. It would have helped your case if you provided evidence, but you don't want to. I think you're just intent on spamming this debate and say \"maybe it isn't\" without recourse to anything but your opinion... which as shown, is not even well enough versed in Islamic beliefs to know what the central holy book is to their faith... that's pretty lame... again, don't let ignorance of the subject matter stand in your way.\n \nOn the contrary, you defend Lot's action of having sex with his two daughters by blaming the entire thing on the daughters (who, for all you know, could have been small children), and on top of it accusing them of being \"sluts\". I never did anything of the sort in regards to Muhammad's actions.\n\n Egad, your just-so statements are incredible. You don't even bother to read the actual context - Lot was got drunk when his daughters slept with him; most importantly, no where is this held up to be ideal behaviour - it's stated, because that's what happened.(See Appendix) No, far be it for you to actually provide any evidence. And, you add straw-man argument too. I didn't say that they were sluts. I simply said, you and I don't know if they were, or not. You simply portrayed the angels as rapists - even though they didn't have sex (some weird definition of rape) and assumed that the girls would have been unwilling actors had the angels been with them. You make suppositions left, right and centre. All I say is based on the texts you can't have the certainty that you profess.\n \n1) her misinterpretation of Christian texts \n\n \n Sorry, but I think you're the one misinterpreting. The texts should speak for themselves. It seems clear to me that\n -Lot was a child abuser who wanted to give his daughters to a rabid mob to save to male strangers.\n\n They weren't men. They were angels. Yes, it would seem clear to you. But where does it say that his daughters were kids? It doesn't. You have so much hate in your mind towards Christianity that you read in quite a lot. You could very well be correct - but how would we know? Based on what it actually says, not what you think it says, it doesn't say that they were kids.\n Second to that, what evidence do you have that Lot's behaviour was ideal? Again, you base this on your interpretation of Peter, who only calls Lot good, for having realised that Sodom is not a place to live in.\n I cited sites that show Muslims believe that Muhammad is the example of behaviour for all time... you have shown nothing comparable for Christian teachings with regards to Lot. You simply make really trite statements that you suppose this is so.\n \n- Jesus refers to a law which states that disobedient children should be killed, and admonished the Jewish priests for not following it. (You say he's just talking about the first part of the law, not the second, but this is not specified, whereas in other places other laws are specifically refuted).\n\n Jesus was calling them to be less hypocritical. You could interpret the verses that way. Do Christians? No. Unless you cite sites that suggest this you are doing just-so statements. I have shown what the Koran says, and what Muslims did, and what they do. You don't. I feel that this is just what you intend doing, making just-so statements until I give up this debate. Victory then, is yours.\n \n-The portion of \"Peter\" you refer to clearly is about wives being submissive so that they can convert their husbands through manipulation.\n\n You're not helping your case by being so odd with your interpretation. It clearly says that women can be the strength in the household - by holding faith when their husbands have not.[/quote]\n \n Actually this to me is the end of this debate with you unless you actually provide evidences about your interpretations of the Koran and the Bible being correct. You haven't so far, you simply cast doubt about my sources - and that's very lazy of you - as you provide none (except one woman's views). You are deeply upset with Christianity, which is why you're so willing to attack it, but I note too that you've simply dropped the discussions we were having on this thread re: Native American spirituality. You even pretend that I have not made such citations...this is why you can argue the way you do...\n \nThe Koran is central to Muslim teaching. \n \n \nYou keep repeating the same tired arguments, but they aren't getting any more convincing.\n\n I am not sure if you've genuinely missed these, or are now being dishonest. I cited proofs which you ignore. You simply make supposition; suggesting that it may not be... whereas the Islamic sites I cited clearly suggest that Muslims views on the Koran differ from yours. What's the point in making citations if you simply pretend that they don't exist?\n \n In fact this is the major flaw in your argument. You can, at best, show that you can interpret some passages of the Bible the way that you do. This still leaves you to prove that this is in fact Christian teaching*... that is, that your interpretation is similar to that of the majority of Christians. If you can't, then you've wasted your time. Try drawing on some actual proofs from Christian sites. You haven't yet, so far. I have drawn proofs from Islamic sites - even if you reckon that they're not typical - and this too is just your supposition, my case is still stronger because I have shown passages from the Koran, as well how many Muslims interpret this. All you've done is shown how you interpret the Bible, that's it. You are, in the weight of proof, trying to show that anyone can interpret the Bible anyway. So what? The Church of Mizmaxx's interpretation is her's and her's alone.\n \n So, all you've got to do, aside from brush up on some facts about Islam (regarding how they view the Koran, and Muhammad), find a sizeable bunch of Christians who interpret the Bible the same way you've been trying to. I know this goes against the grain of your arguing style so far -as it entails you actually presenting more than just your opinion. Failing to do so will result in me resorting to your style of argument.\n \n Statements you make about any thing on religion - all I need do to refute it is say \"No, it's not\" (see Monty Python below - you should give them some credit) emoticon_xangel \n \n So the weight of evidence summary:\n Montalban has\n Koranic text in context of Islamic teaching backed by Islamic sites showing how they themselves interpret these texts - that is, Islamic scholarly groups who are actually relied upon by Muslims in gaining insights into Islamic texts. You've cited no Muslim sites that disagree with these - other than a novelist who claims that Islam is liberating. A single person's view to back your own.\n \n Mizmaxx has\n Biblical text in the context of how she interprets it backed by nothing but her supposition that her way might be correct. Further, Islamic texts taken with no reference to any Islamic scholarly site - again her interpretation of what might be so... backed with some anecdotal stuff about she knows a few Muslims which at best is hearsay - although we don't even know their words on this issue either. Only Mixmaxx's statement that she knows what they have said. Hardly convincing stuff.\n \n *Otherwise your accusations about sexism are simply based on how you interpret the Bible.\n \n Appendix - There are incest stories in Native American society too, so again your lack of insight on this is frightening. (you haven't really addressed the last lot of examples from Native American culture)\n \"Another French scholar, Laura Makarius, works in the same structuralist tradition. She associates Coyote with impurity and qualifies him as \"symbolical of incest\" (Makarius 1973a:173). The culture hero of the Menominee, Manabozo, accepts his brother being killed in order to institute the midewiwin ceremony for the good of humanity, a breach of blood taboo, performed for magical purposes. Makarius comments, \"The contradiction between the individual and asocial character of the violation of taboo, and its perpetration by the trickster for the benefit of society as a whole, is the essence of the trickster myth\" (Makarius 1973b:668). Perhaps, but only in this myth spread among Central Algonquin peoples.\"\n http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/trickster.html\n \"An interesting intertwining of insect behavior and human sexuality is found in the Mothway myth of the Navajo. In the Mothway legend, a bisexual god named Begochidi was leader of the butterfly people and serviced the sexual needs of both male and female butterflies. However, when Begochidi decided to leave the country, the butterfly people decided to commit incest rather than marry outsiders. This made the butterfly people \"go wild\" which is currently manifested for example, in the tendency of moths to rush into flames. The basis for the Mothway myth is the widespread concern about incest in small, isolated groups. Thus, the Mothway legend is to Navajos an explanation of the prohibition against sibling and clan incest\"\n http://www.insects.org/ced4/mythology.html\n also\n http://www.innu.ca/myth.html\n \"To those familiar with Native American culture, some things in this book should be familiar, particularly the antics of Coyote, Inktome the spider, Raven and other tricksters, but also the tales of Glooskap, giants, floods, disembodied cannibal heads, the place of emergence, Hiawatha and so forth. One thing I should point out before going further is that some of these tales deal with adult themes (in the Inuit tale \"Moon Rapes His Sister Sun\" the moon commits the sins of rape and incest and forever chases his sister across the sky) and can be downright raunchy (as is the case with several of the Coyote and Inktome stories). There is nothing wrong with these stories, as they either are meant to teach a moral lesson (as is the case with the former) or because they are meant to amuse (in the case of the trickster stories). But it can come as something of a shock to those who are expecting \"mere children's stories\". Still, if you or someone you know has an interest in Native American culture, this book is certainly worth getting\"\n http://www.outdoorshub.com/American_Indian_Myths_and_Legends_0394740181.html\n Just as in Greek culture there's the story of Oedipus - who is also not put forward as example of how to behave. This is another case of your cake and eat it too, argument. Are you now going to allow us to infer simply because there are tales of incest in Native American society that these are actually giving Native Americans the go ahead to commit incest?",

   "Jito,\n \nI have also seen this translated \"the word was with God.\" As a matter of fact my college religion prof used that translation. - AND he was a monk.\n\n That is a part of the verses I quoted, John 1:1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"\n \n \nI do believe Jesus pre-dates Abraham. I think lots of stuff did. The angels pre-date the earth for starters. I think Jesus was around before his earthly birth.\n\n Yes. Jesus was around since the time God was around. John 1:2-3 \"He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.\"\n \n \nHe is our Lord.\n\n And our God as the verse says.\n \n \nI think I need to do a lot more research on Paul. I am starting to notice that almost everything that frustrates me in the Bible, everything that causes discord for me came from Paul. Why is he included, when several gospels were left out? Why was he chosen over the stories of those who actually knew Christ? I need to find out more. Until then I think I will refrain from commenting on Paul.\n\n If you read Paul and Acts then you will find that Paul met with the apostles who did walk with Jesus. They confirmed that what he was teaching was from God and in accord with the Revelation of Jesus.\n \n \nBecause he is a reflection of the father. He has an intimacy with him we do not. He is our link to God. It is like I said before \"you hurt my kid, you hurt me\" - I do not think they are one and the same.\n\n You do not think they are one and the same but Jesus did. He said so.\n \n \nSee this is what I hate about churches. You must absolutely agree with Guidelines A through X - no using your own brain. It's why I won't belong to any church.\n\n \"...purity was preserved by dogmatic definitions and exclusions. It could not possibly have been preserved by anything else.\" Dogma is what condemned heresy and preserved orthodoxy. \"Nothing else but dogma could have resisted the riot of imaginative invention with which the pessimists were waging their war against nature...\"\n \n \"For our doctrine of salvation does really mean a labour like that of a man trying to make a statue beautiful...For that there must be a final choice; for a man cannot make statues without rejecting stone...\n \n There will be no end to the weary debates about liberalising theology, until people face the fact that the only liberal part of it is really the dogmatic part. If dogma is incredible, it is because it is incredibly liberal. If it is irrational, it can only be in giving us more assurance of freedom than is justified by reason. The obvious example is that essential form of freedom which we call free-will...\n \n What the denouncer of dogma really means is not that dogma is bad; but rather that dogma is too good to be true. That is, he means that dogma is too liberal to be likely. Dogma gives man too much freedom when it permits him to fall. Dogma gives even God too much freedom when it permits him to die...We say, but not lightly but very literally, that the truth has made us free.\" G.K. Chesterton The Everlasting Man\n \n \nHey - YOU were the one who said that the Pope wants people to be chaste in their marriages. Why he should have any expectations of anyone's (married) sex lives is beyond me.\n\n Perhaps because marriage is a Christian covenant ordained by God. It is a sign of committment between man and woman but also a sign of their committment to God. The pope teaches on Christian marriage and morals within marriage just as Christian leaders have done since scripture was written. Just as Jesus spoke on divorce. \n \n \nI tell you what I am. I am a product of a world where women weren't given choices, power or rights over their own bodies. My grandmother and mother had to fight tooth and nail to have any say over how many children they would have. My grandmother never got the right - she was not allowed (by law) tubals, birth control or the right to tell her sorry sod of a husband no. They had 11 kids in a one room shack that he would not work to support. My mother's doctor had to lie to my dad so she could get her tubes tied and stop having babies as he was not going to grant her permission. My old man walked out ten years later. I myself spent three years physically and sexually abused by my loser of an ex who does not support his kid today. One in three women is raped. Men walk on their kids ALL THE TIME. The Catholic church's stand on birth control is mighty pretty in writing - but hurts women in the real world. I know - I am woman living there and I have seen it.\n\n I am sorry for the transgressions against women. I am sorry that you have had experiences with bad men. But contraception contributes to the sexual oppression and abuse of which you speak. It eliminates any requirement of committment from the male and in effect makes the female a sexual object.\n \n \nSo many bands! Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Offspring, U2, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Doors, Tho Who, The Headstones, Everclear (OK they are kinda poppy), Concrete Blonde, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Jet, The Living End, Likehell, The Cure, Led Zepplin, Janis Joplin, ZZ Top, The Talking Heads, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Blondie, The RAMONES!!!, ummm give me an hour and I will talk your ear off. I love music - especially ROCK AND ROLL. And I play bass.\n\n ROCK ON! YEAH BABY, YEAH!\n \n \nI hate to break it to you but Creed sucks big time. Pearl Jam wannabies. Gag. And Evanescence needs to join the Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Dido, Tori Amos \"please get me some anti-depressants\" club.\n\n Yeah, some of those guys and gals need some anti-depressants.\n \n \nNice list - but Midnight Oil? I have been working on \"Long Line of Cars\" by Cake this week (on bass).\n\n I have no doubt that you will \"go the distance\" in your study of Cake.\n \n \nI think we do need to examine his word by science and history and all of it. It will help us to see his hand NOW. Too often the faithful dismiss the creation. \n \n Plus it's FUN.\n \n I think God ALWAYS acts within his creation. He is quite organized. We just don't have all the answers yet. \n \n Wasn't it cool for him to make it all so interesting? How can we ever be bored?\n\n Very cool.\n \n \nBut my point is that it's a rule of men - not God.\n \n Not so much a rule of men as a devotion of men.",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \nDoesn't seem like the \"people\" believed in the Church's idea of \"truth\", as so many ppl were found guilty, in fact some whole towns were burned.\n\n Yes, there were many heretics. Whole towns were burned during the inquisitions?\n \n \nThose living in coastal areas had means to travel overseas, but most Native cultures did not invest time and energy in developing tools for warfare so much as they developed political, social and cutural abilities. Remember, the Haudenosaunee (and many other nations) had a direct participatory democracy during an era when most Europeans were oppressed serfs.\n\n Natives trained all the time to become better in warfare. It was an integral part of their life. That is not to say anything against their political, social, and cultural abilities.\n \n \nCan you find an example which parallels the level of destruction and indiscriminate slaughter which the Europeans caused in North America? Native warriors, in general, had honor, thus did not kill ppl who were defenseless, such as children and their mothers. The European colonists made this type of activity common protocol. There's no comparison.\n\n Are you saying Natives did not kill women and children?\n \n \"In combat, although quarter was sometimes granted on impulse, no one was immune. Men, women, and children of all ages expected to be killed if seized or cornered, their scalps and other parts of the body torn off as trophies, their remains hacked and disfigured as a permanent affliction in the spirit world.\" page 16 The Lance and The Shield Robert M. Utley\n \n Are you sure there's no comparison?\n \n \nWhy did your God demand human sacrifice in the first place? How is this different from any other human sacrifice tradition?\n\n My God is one of the few gods of history who has NOT demanded human sacrifice. Instead he sacrificed himself so that we would be spared.\n \n \nWho decides what the \"teachings of the Church\" are? Wasn't it the clergy?\n\n The clergy guided by the Holy Spirit conveys the teachings of the Church found in the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Of what teachings do you speak?\n \n \nThe best Paul could say for marriage, it would seem, was that it was \"better to marry than to burn\". However, he was clear that he felt chastity was superior.\n\n No that wasn't the best Paul could say for marriage.

   "Can you find an example which parallels the level of destruction and indiscriminate slaughter which the Europeans caused in North America? Native warriors, in general, had honor, thus did not kill ppl who were defenseless, such as children and their mothers. The European colonists made this type of activity common protocol. There's no comparison.\n\n \nAre you saying Natives did not kill women and children?\n \"In combat, although quarter was sometimes granted on impulse, no one was immune. Men, women, and children of all ages expected to be killed if seized or cornered, their scalps and other parts of the body torn off as trophies, their remains hacked and disfigured as a permanent affliction in the spirit world.\" page 16 The Lance and The Shield Robert M.

The fact that Europeans of a particular time were better able to do so than Native American Indians does not excuse the later for what they did.\n \n It is a well known fact that some Native Americans; viz The Aztecs ritually killed people as part of their religion.\n \n Here's another account...\n \"In 1635, they killed Capt.

The woman who gave birth to Huitzil was Coatlicul. She conceived him from a ball of feathers that fell from the sky. Huitzil wore a helmet shaped like a giant hummingbird.

   "Do you even want to present any evidence? No, just base your whole argument about Islam not on any Islamic sites, but that you know some nice Muslims.\n\n Actually, I cited two separate Muslim sites. Besides, I was asking you for evidence here. You consistently ignore burden of evidence. Clue: if you wish to put forth a theory, such as \"Islam is evil\", you actually have to provide the evidence to back it up. \n \n You have simply not proven your thesis. No point getting all huffy with me just because you can't support your argument.\n \n \nFirstly, you do that very thing, by assuming the few Muslims you know are typical.\n\n Actually, I explicitely stated that I don't know whether the people I know are the majority, or the minority, and I doubt it matters.\n \n \nYou should also look at the views put forward by TruthKeeper in his arguments with me - especially note how he tries to justify Muhammad's sex with an under-age girl\n\n Why? That has nothing to do with me. If he was arguing that nine years old is the prime marrigeable age that would not have proved your thesis.\n \n \nexcept you don't see that there's much variety with regards to Catholicism, which is why you express such hate for it.\n\n Again you are wrong. Read my posts. I explicitely say that there are Catholics I agree with, as they oppose the more oppressive and inhuman historical and present aspects of Catholicism.\n \n \nI am saying that Moslems for the most part believe the Koran is central. You don't. I've provided evidences to back up my claim, you just make supposition that some Muslims might not hold the Koran as dear.\n\n Actually I didn't. I said some do not follow the Hadiths. I also said, repeatedly, that holding a book \"dear\", revering it, and even ascribing divine status to the author as a prophet do not prove that Muslims by necessity must do exactly as the Quran says word for word as interpreted by you.\n \n \nIt is. You do your case no good by such supposition. Not only did I give you quotes from several Islamic sites that agree with this...\n\n Er, no you didn't. You cited a couple of cases of rabid fundamentalism, but nowhere did you prove that child molestation is an Islamic creed.\n \n Here are some quotes for you, since you are so intent on them (and despite the fact that the burden of evidence is on you)-\n \n \nThe Prophet was an exemplary man. All his actions were most virtuous so that we, Muslims, can emulate them. However, most people in our Islamic Center of Toledo, including me, would not think of betrothing our seven years daughter to a fifty-two year-old man. If a parent agrees to such a wedding, most people, if not all, would look down upon the father and the old husband.\n\n \n This article by T.O. Shanavas is interesting, as it explores the controversy surrounding the topic of Ayesha/Aisha. The author puts forth the thesis that Aisha was not a pre-pubescent child when married, but a girl in her mid-to-late teens. For myself, I would still find it a problematic age difference. However, this would support the arguments that such marriages were common at the time, as they were, in Europe as well, until the nineteenth century.\n \n His evidence seems convincing;\n \n \nEVIDENCE #2: The Betrothal\n According to Tabari (also according to Hisham ibn `Urwah, Ibn\n Hunbal and Ibn Sad), Ayesha was betrothed at seven years of age and began to cohabit with the Prophet at the age of nine years. However, in another work, Al-Tabari says: \"All four of his [Abu Bakr's] children were born of his two wives during the\n pre-Islamic period\" (Tarikhu'l-umam wa'l-mamlu'k, Al-Tabari (died\n 922), Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Dara'l-fikr, Beirut, 1979).\n If Ayesha was betrothed in 620 CE (at the age of seven) and started to live with the Prophet in 624 CE (at the age of nine), that would indicate that she was born in 613 CE and was nine when she began living with the Prophet. Therefore, based on one account of Al- Tabari, the numbers show that Ayesha must have born in 613 CE, three years after the beginning of revelation (610 CE). Tabari also states that Ayesha was born in the pre-Islamic era (in Jahiliya). If she was born before 610 CE, she would have been at least 14 years old when she began living with the Prophet. Essentially, Tabari contradicts himself.\n CONCLUSION: Al-Tabari is unreliable in the matter of determining\n Ayesha's age. \n\n \n \nEVIDENCE #6: Surat al-Qamar (The Moon)\n According to the generally accepted tradition, Ayesha was born about eight years before hijrah. But according to another narrative in Bukhari, Ayesha is reported to have said: \"I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)\" when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, kitabu'l-tafsir, Bab Qaulihi Bal al-sa`atu Maw`iduhum wa'l-sa`atu adha' wa amarr).\n Chapter 54 of the Quran was revealed eight years before hijrah (The Bounteous Koran, M.M. Khatib, 1985), indicating that it was revealed in 614 CE. If Ayesha started living with the Prophet at the age of nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she was a newborn infant (sibyah in Arabic) at the time that Surah Al-Qamar (The Moon) was revealed. According to the above tradition, Ayesha was actually a young girl, not an infant in the year of revelation of Al-Qamar. Jariyah means young playful girl (Lane's Arabic English Lexicon). So, Ayesha, being a jariyah not\n a sibyah (infant), must be somewhere between 6-13 years old at the time of revelation of Al-Qamar, and therefore must have been 14-21 years at the time she married the Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: This tradition also contradicts the marriage of Ayesha at the age of nine. \n\n And so on, and so forth...\n \n \nLot was got drunk when his daughters slept with him;\n\n As I said before, this is a deplorable excuse. Obviously, he wasn't so drunk he couldn't get erect- and alcohol tends to prevent erection- and no amount of alcohol could make a decent man have sex with his own daughters.\n \n \n most importantly, no where is this held up to be ideal behaviour - it's stated, because that's what happened.\n\n Again, neither is marrying children specifically \"held up to be ideal behavior\". You argue that Islam encourages pedophilia on the basis that Muhammad had a child for a wife, and is described as an ideal man, to be emulated. Yet, Lot was also described in the Bible as a \"righteous man\", despite having been willing to throw his daughters to a rabid mob then having sex with them. You can't have it both ways.\n \n \nYou simply portrayed the angels as rapists - even though they didn't have sex (some weird definition of rape) and assumed that the girls would have been unwilling actors had the angels been with them.\n\n You're getting the story all mixed up. Lot was protecting the \"angels\" from the horny mob, and proposed his daughters instead. He tried to sell them by emphasizing their virginity. This man, described later as \"righteous and just\", then gets drunk and sleeps with his two daughters.\n \n Besides, obviously you are the one being presumptuous by claiming that these girls would have been happy to be thrown to a crazed mob of rapists. Unless they had specifically discussed this prior, \"Gee Daddy, next time a crazed mob pounds on our door, I want the chance to be gang-banged\", Lot would have no reason to suspect that his daughters had such urgings, and neither do you.\n \n \n Genesis\n 19:1\n And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n 19:2\n And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n 19:3\n And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n 19:4\n But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:\n 19:5\n And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.\n 19:6\n And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,\n 19:7\n And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n 19:8\n Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n\n Clearly he's saying 'hey, violent mob, do what you want with my virgin daughters'. \n \n \nThey weren't men. They were angels.\n\n Have you even read Genesis?\n \n \nBut where does it say that his daughters were kids? It doesn't. \n\n It doesn't describe them by age at all, just that they were virgins. Ancient Hebrew girls married young. For all you know, they could have been children.\n \n \nSo, all you've got to do, aside from brush up on some facts about Islam (regarding how they view the Koran, and Muhammad)\n\n You might want to do some \"brushing up\" yourself, as you're still spelling Quran incorrectly.\n \n \nThere are incest stories in Native American society too(...) Are you now going to allow us to infer simply because there are tales of incest in Native American society that these are actually giving Native Americans the go ahead to commit incest?\n\n As I said, you were the one saying that the claim that Aisha was a child when she married Muhammad was proof that all Islam approved of child-rape. \n \n \nyou haven't really addressed the last lot of examples from Native American culture\n\n Actually, I did. They were pathetic. Really, if you want to accuse Native cultures of something, try something that really was an aspect of Native cultures. Sexism, in particular violence against women, were virtually unknown. Sure, post-colonisation, there is domestic violence. But this is due to European \"influence\", ie a reaction to the destruction of our communities because of biological warfare etc. This is not at all to do with Native spiritualities. Since you'll probably want a cite, see the article As Gentle as Little Lambs: Images of Huron and Montagnais-Naskapi Women in the Writings of the 17th Century Jesuits\n Journal article by Karen Anderson; Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology, Vol. 25, 1988. I haven't read it in a while, but I recall that it was quite informative as to the nature of women's roles in Eastern Woodlands cultures.\n \n \nYes, there were many heretics. Whole towns were burned during the inquisitions?\n\n Virtually, some were left with only a few (3-4) residents. This was a profitable business, \"witch-hunters\" got paid on commission. If you want cites, I have a few I could give you.\n \n \nNatives trained all the time to become better in warfare. It was an integral part of their life.\n\n Some nations had very well-developed warrior cultures, but they did not expend time and energy in developing methods of mass-murder as did European armies. \n \n \nThe Lance and The Shield Robert M. Utley\n\n This is the biography of Sitting Bull, thus the period described is after centuries of colonization. Find a citation for Natives committing mass slaughter on the scale of millions, then we'll talk.\n \n \nMy God is one of the few gods of history who has NOT demanded human sacrifice. \n\n He did in the OT. I guess he changed his mind. Blood sacrifice used to make an odor pleasing unto him. \n \n \nThe clergy guided by the Holy Spirit conveys the teachings of the Church found in the Revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\n Exactly. So, either the Holy Spirit was guiding the clergy to torture people on a mass scale, or the clergy was ignoring the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Spirit and the clergy have nothing to do with each other.\n \n \nIf you read Ephesians 5: 21-33 as I asked then you will find that Paul had a very noble view of marriage.\n\n You call that \"noble\"? He says that \"wives should submit to their husbands\" as though their husbands are gods. Paul clearly states that celibacy is best, but not for everyone, so as a second option it's \"better to marry than to burn\" (1 Corinthians 7:9).\n \n \nIt is a well known fact that some Native Americans\n\n Actually, that is a contested proposition, as I've said before.\n \n From http://www.mexika.org/NoSac.htm-\n \n \nAccording to these Spanish accounts, after an initial battle with the Aztecs, the Spanish main force was outnumbered and had fled to the base camp at Tlacopan, on the shore of Texcoco lake. From here our witnesses claim to have seen about fifty Spanish captives being sacrificed on the Great Temple of Tlatelolco, which ritual is described by D\u00a1az in great gory detail. A glance on a map reveals that the distance between our witnesses and the alleged sacrifice must have been in excess of four miles. D\u00a1az can hardly have been nearer to the place since Tlatelolco (Mexico city) was built on an island then. It does not seem very convincing that he actually saw exactly what was happening four miles away. Anyway D\u00a1az wrote his account more than forty years afterwards, and like Cort\u00e9s, was probably interested in justifying the Spanish conduct and genocide in the New World. A similar reason may lie behind the instances of Cannibalism (a word deriving from the Caribs, native inhabitants of the Caribbean exterminated by Christians) the invaders apparently encountered on their voyages. \n\n \n \nHere's another account...\n \"In 1635, they killed Capt. Oldham in his Bark at Block-Island;\n\n You could do with reading up on the Pequot.\n \n Capt Oldham was killed by the Narragansetts, for deliberately infecting their villages with smallpox. Over 700 people died because of his \"infected gifts\", from Narragansett communities and their allies. However, the Narragansetts were still numerous and powerful, so strategically the Massachusetts Governor and William Bradford (from the Plymouth Plantation) decided to pin the murder on the Pequot (adding some gory details of fantastic \"torture\"), in order to excuse their subsequent \"almost total annihilation in 1637\" of the Pequot Nation. For more information on this particular scheme, \"the process is described in notations dated July 26 and 30, 1636, in John Winthrop's the History of New England from 1630 to 1649, 2 vols, p 191. It is also covered in a letter from Roger Williams to Governor Winthrop dated Sept. 9, 1637.\"\n \n \nAs to pre-Columbian warfare we know almost nothing, and what little we know suggests that where wars took place, they were infrequent, short, and mild: in fact 'war' seems a misnomer for the kinds of [fighting] which took place, in which some act of bravery or retribution rather than death, say, or territory (...) Early European settlers often made a mockery of Indian warfare... John Underhill wrote of the Pequots that their wars were more for pastime than to conquer and subdue their enemies, and Henry Spelman, who lived among the Powhatans, said that \"they might fight seven yeares and not kill seven men\"... Organized violence, in short, was not an attribute of traditional Indian societies, certainly not as compared with their European contemporaries, and on the basis of this imperfect record what is most remarkable about them is their apparent lack of conflict and discord.\nKirkpatrick Sale, The Conquest of Paradise, 1990.\n \n On the other hand, the same Plymouth Governor who \"framed\" the Pequot for the murder of the biological terrorist described the scene of the massacre of the Pequot which followed, whence as many as \"900 women, children, and helpless old men\" were burned alive;\n \nIt was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the stink and scent thereof;\n\n He goes on to thank God for the victory nonetheless. I won't quote that part, because we all know how \"anti-Christian\" it is to be historically accurate... emoticon_rolleyes",

However, this would support the arguments that such marriages were common at the time, as they were, in Europe as well, until the nineteenth century.\n\n That's hearsay at best - someone supposing that their were marriages in Europe of six year old girls (that's the age Aisha got married).\n If you find examples of six year olds being married - as a matter of common practice, then you also need to show that these marriages were viewed by the participants as an example for the rest of humanity - because that's what Muslims believe Muhammad is, an example for all time.\n Here's another of your attempts to justify Aisha's marriage.\n \nEVIDENCE #2: The Betrothal\n According to Tabari (also according to Hisham ibn `Urwah, Ibn Hunbal and Ibn Sad), Ayesha was betrothed at seven years of age and began to cohabit with the Prophet at the age of nine years. However, in another work, Al-Tabari says: \"All four of his [Abu Bakr's] children were born of his two wives during the pre-Islamic period\" (Tarikhu'l-umam wa'l-mamlu'k, Al-Tabari (died 922), Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Dara'l-fikr, Beirut, 1979).\n If Ayesha was betrothed in 620 CE (at the age of seven) and started to live with the Prophet in 624 CE (at the age of nine), that would indicate that she was born in 613 CE and was nine when she began living with the Prophet. Therefore, based on one account of Al- Tabari, the numbers show that Ayesha must have born in 613 CE, three years after the beginning of revelation (610 CE). Tabari also states that Ayesha was born in the pre-Islamic era (in Jahiliya). If she was born before 610 CE, she would have been at least 14 years old when she began living with the Prophet. Essentially, Tabari contradicts himself.\n CONCLUSION: Al-Tabari is unreliable in the matter of determining Ayesha's age. \n\n Tabari may contradict himself, certainly your Islamic sites contradict each other. One accepts that she was nine years old, the others don't. Be handy if you could cite references that aren't trying to disprove everything at once...\n How do we reconcile if Al-Tabari seems to contradict himself? If we assume that all the children mentioned included girl children too then the two statements quoted are quite reconcilable. However, what sources do we have to suggest she was nine...? (Note, this is why Muslims for the most part accept her age)\n From Bukhari vol. 7, #65:\n \"Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: \"I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\"\n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah?s Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine?. \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n (Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.)\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\"\n FROM THE HISTORY OF TABARI\n (Tabari wrote the most authentic Islamic history. It covers 39 volumes. Tabari was one of the greatest Islamic scholars and the greatest Islamic Historian.)\n From Tabari, volume 7, page7:\n  \"....my marriage (to Muhammad) was consummated when I was nine.....\"\n From Tabari, volume 9, page 131\n \"Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me\"......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal. She was eighteen years old when he died.\n (I also want to provide evidence from the best Islamic Ency. available in English, and other Islamic writers. They also acknowledge Aisha's age being 9.)\n FROM THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ISLAM, under \"Aisha\". (pub. by E.J. Brill). \n \"Some time after the death of Khadija, Khawla suggested to Muhammad that he should marry either Aisha, the 6 year old daughter of his chief follower, or Sawda Zama, a widow of about 30, who had gone as a Muslim to Abyssinia and whose husband had died there. Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both. It had already been agreed that Aisha should marry Djubayr Mutim, whose father, though still pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. By common consent, however, this agreement was set aside, and Muhammad was betrothed to Aisha.... The marriage was not consummated until some months after the Hidjra, (in April 623, 624). Aisha went to live in an apartment in Muhammad's house, later the mosque of Median. She cannot have been more than ten years old at the time and took her toys to her new home.\"\n From the Muslim book \"WOMEN IN ISLAM\" by Said Abjullah Seif-Al-Hatimy, published by Islamic Publications in Lahore Pakistan:\n \"...(Aisha) She was the youngest of his wives. It is said that she was nine years of age when he married her.\" \n SUMMATION OF THE EVIDENCE OF AISHA'S AGE\n I've belabored the point. But because of the controversy within the Islamic world I had to document her age thoroughly. The most respected Hadith and Islamic scholars from early on until this present day state that Aisha was 9 when Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with her.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n EVIDENCE #6: Surat al-Qamar (The Moon)\n According to the generally accepted tradition, Ayesha was born about eight years before hijrah. But according to another narrative in Bukhari, Ayesha is reported to have said: \"I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)\" when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, kitabu'l-tafsir, Bab Qaulihi Bal al-sa`atu Maw`iduhum wa'l-sa`atu adha' wa amarr).\n Chapter 54 of the Quran was revealed eight years before hijrah (The Bounteous Koran, M.M. Khatib, 1985), indicating that it was revealed in 614 CE. If Ayesha started living with the Prophet at the age of nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she was a newborn infant (sibyah in Arabic) at the time that Surah Al-Qamar (The Moon) was revealed. According to the above tradition, Ayesha was actually a young girl, not an infant in the year of revelation of Al-Qamar. Jariyah means young playful girl (Lane's Arabic English Lexicon). So, Ayesha, being a jariyah not\n a sibyah (infant), must be somewhere between 6-13 years old at the time of revelation of Al-Qamar, and therefore must have been 14-21 years at the time she married the Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: This tradition also contradicts the marriage of Ayesha at the age of nine. \n And so on, and so forth...\n\n Where is it a generally accepted tradition that Ayesha was born about eight years before the hijrah? You have an un-sourced reference that gives an unsourced reference. \n Although Al-Tabari is considered 'the best' secondary source, he is writing more than 200 years after the fact. Good work Mizmaxx, and open and open case! Have you noticed, Mizmaxx, the lengths you go to, in order to justify this behaviour? You say you're not anti-Christian. Doesn't seem that way. Let me ask again... Do you support the idea of child brides?\n Hadith Bukhari 5:58:235.\n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammad) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" \n Remember, that she was only a child. He is dreaming about a little girl who was six or under (because she was six at the age of betrothal).\n \n Lot was got drunk when his daughters slept with him; \n\n \nAs I said before, this is a deplorable excuse. Obviously, he wasn't so drunk he couldn't get erect- and alcohol tends to prevent erection- and no amount of alcohol could make a decent man have sex with his own daughters.\n\n I can almost see that you were smiling snidely as you wrote that. You go to such lengths to justify Muhammad sleeping with a child. It goes to show just how anti-Christian you are - to spend so much time devoted to defending such an abomination. Where does Lot's behaviour, regardless of circumstances (as these are still moot) put forward as a prime example of behviour for future generations. I know it's a small problem with your line of argument, but let's just ignore it again, shall we?\n \nmost importantly, no where is this held up to be ideal behaviour - it's stated, because that's what happened. \n\n \nAgain, neither is marrying children specifically \"held up to be ideal behavior\". You argue that Islam encourages paedophilia on the basis that Muhammad had a child for a wife, and is described as an ideal man, to be emulated. Yet, Lot was also described in the Bible as a \"righteous man\", despite having been willing to throw his daughters to a rabid mob then having sex with them. You can't have it both ways.\n\n Don't twist so fast. It'll hurt your back This will be the third time I've said this, but you're eye sight is quite selective. Peter's calling Lot 'righteous man' was regarding his leaving Sodom. Does Peter say \"Lot never was with sin, let's follow his behaviour?\"\n Mohammedans maintain that 'the prophet' was the best example for moral behaviour...\n \"The Lord of the universe, The Most Merciful and Compassionate sent about 124,000 prophets and messengers to every nook and corner of this earth to guide humanity towards understanding the purpose of its creation and thereby surrender to His Divine Laws and achieve its final destiny of Eternal Peace in His Paradise. The last messenger of God who brought His last revelation the Holy Quraan to humanity is Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, born in Mekkah, approximately 550 years after Jesus, son of Mary, peace and blessings of God be on them both. This is the account of this last Messenger of God, the most remarkable man, that human history has known.\"\n http://www.daar-ul-ehsaan.org/truth/must.htm\n \"The Prophet accomplished all this through the strength of his character and personal example;\"\n http://www.missionislam.com/youth/muhammad.htm \n Mohammedans argue that even today, he is still a role-model! Even here I can use how Mohammedans view him; you would use supposition. They even give him a special blessing each time they mention him; unique to him!\n So remarkable a man was he, that not only did he sleep with an under-age girl, but he also rejoiced at the killing of prisoner-of-war...\n \"The members of the last surviving Jewish tribe in Medinah, Banu Qurayzah, were even less fortunate. Muhammad offered the men conversion to Islam as an alternative to death; upon their refusal, all 900 were decapitated in front of their enslaved women and children. The women were subsequently raped; Muhammad chose as his concubine one Raihana Bint Amr, whose father and husband were both slaughtered before her eyes only hours earlier.\"\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/C...99Trifkovic.htm\n Muhammad is the ideal. That is why people like the Ayatollah Khomeini followed his example (Khomeini was 20 when he married a 10 year old).\n \nClearly he's saying 'hey, violent mob, do what you want with my virgin daughters'. \n\n I concede that I thought he was offering the daughters to the angels. Did they sleep with the daughters? No. There's no evidence of it, perhaps it was an example to put the men to shame. Like someone crying \"Why don't you just put a gun to my head\". You simply guess one thing. All you have demonstrated is an ability to interpret one thing one way. How does this make your interpretation correct?\n \nSo, all you've got to do, aside from brush up on some facts about Islam (regarding how they view the Koran, and Muhammad) \n\n \nYou might want to do some \"brushing up\" yourself, as you're still spelling Quran incorrectly.\n\n Koran is how it is on my edition of the Koran, sorry to nip that feeble attempt to point score; in fact you've not even noticed the various ways of spelling Aisha, even in your own quotes! LOL! There's also Quo'ran in some of my references. However, as stated, if you can only read up on Islamic understanding, then you'd not make laughable mistakes about the Koran and its place in Islam. And instead of addressing this, you\n a) pretend you said Haddith (which still doesn't help your case - because the Haddiths are also widely accepted)\n b) attempt your own feeble point scoring and fail, because you've used various spellings too. As I say, I do enjoy debating you.\n [Quote-Montalban]There are incest stories in Native American society too(...) Are you now going to allow us to infer simply because there are tales of incest in Native American society that these are actually giving Native Americans the go ahead to commit incest? [/quote]\n \nAs I said, you were the one saying that the claim that Aisha was a child when she married Muhammad was proof that all Islam approved of child-rape. \n\n Nice straw-man, I thought you'd given up on this non-device. I am not for one moment suggesting that Native Americans approve of child rape. I am suggesting that the odd story in a culture about such things happens every where. The difference is that Muslims believe Muhammad's example is for all time! You are. You are making the argument that although Muslims regard Muhammad as the prime example, the very fact that there's one instance in the Bible of Lot, sleeping with his daughters that this is in any way comparable. Therefore, by your logic, the fact that there's singular examples in Native American legend, you should draw the same conclusions about Native Americans supporting incest etc. But you don't. You only selectively apply such rules when you think it does a disservice to Christianity - hence you are anti-Christian.\n \n you haven't really addressed the last lot of examples from Native American culture \n\n \nActually, I did. They were pathetic. Really, if you want to accuse Native cultures of something, try something that really was an aspect of Native cultures. Sexism, in particular violence against women, were virtually unknown. Sure, post-colonisation, there is domestic violence. But this is due to European \"influence\", i.e. a reaction to the destruction of our communities because of biological warfare etc. This is not at all to do with Native spiritualities. Since you'll probably want a cite, see the article As Gentle as Little Lambs: Images of Huron and Montagnais-Naskapi Women in the Writings of the 17th Century Jesuits\n Journal article by Karen Anderson; Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology, Vol. 25, 1988. I haven't read it in a while, but I recall that it was quite informative as to the nature of women's roles in Eastern Woodlands cultures.\n\n As I said, I am not making the same argument you do... singular examples prove the point. You do so with regards to a few Muslim friends, and one woman author... prove Islam's a great faith.\n \"Question : I know that Allah (S) has permitted us to marry Christians and the Jews. Now, can she practice her religious rites in the same house and have pictures of the crucifixion of Jesus (A) and celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas and etc. Can her kids join her? If no, would not it hurt her feelings? Please, answer me on this issue.\n Answer : Praise be to Allaah.\n It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=e...e&QR=3320&dgn=4",

If dogma is incredible, it is because it is incredibly liberal. If it is irrational, it can only be in giving us more assurance of freedom than is justified by reason. The obvious example is that essential form of freedom which we call free-will...\n \n What the denouncer of dogma really means is not that dogma is bad; but rather that dogma is too good to be true. That is, he means that dogma is too liberal to be likely. Dogma gives man too much freedom when it permits him to fall.

I love that movie. (OK - I am being silly now...)\n \n \nPerhaps because marriage is a Christian covenant ordained by God.

I am sorry that you have had experiences with bad men. But contraception contributes to the sexual oppression and abuse of which you speak. It eliminates any requirement of committment from the male and in effect makes the female a sexual object.\n\n \n Oh please. Show the example where men have not viewed women as sex objects before birth control. They have always treated women as such. Look around you! Women are sex objects to men - regardless of whether they use birth control. Men get their pleasure - through coercian. Sometimes they use their sex to gain power (1 in 3 women is raped). Birth control protects women. The examples I give are proof of it. Exactly how did my grandmother not having the option to stop having babies improve her situation? The exactr opposite is true! I am not having more babies and have had my tubes tied to ensure it. It's my body - I don't want babies, I am making sure.

He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. \n \n Submit to one another? What does that mean? How much did Christ love the Church? He died for it. So Paul tells men that they must love their wives enough to die for her.

Otherwise, people would have objected to Prophet's marriage with Ayesha.\n However, such an explanation would be gullible only for those who are naive enough to believe it. But unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the answer.\n The Prophet was an exemplary man. All his actions were most virtuous so that we, Muslims, can emulate them. However, most people in our Islamic Center of Toledo, including me, would not think of betrothing our seven years daughter to a fifty-two year-old man. If a parent agrees to such a wedding, most people, if not all, would look down upon the father and the old husband.\n In 1923, registrars of marriage in Egypt were instructed not to\n register and issue official certificates of marriage for brides less\n than sixteen and grooms less than eighteen years of age. Eight years later, the Law of the Organization and Procedure of Sheriah courts of 1931 consolidated the above provision by not hearing the marriage disputes involving brides less than sixteen and grooms less than eighteen years old. (Women in Muslim Family Law, John Esposito, 1982). It shows that even in the Muslim majority country of Egypt the child marriages are unacceptable.\n So, I believed, without solid evidence other than my reverence to my Prophet, that the stories of the marriage of seven-year-old Ayesha to 50-year-old Prophet are only myths. However, my long pursuit in search of the truth on this matter proved my intuition correct. My Prophet was a gentleman. And he did not marry an innocent seven or nine year old girl. The age of Ayesha has been erroneously reported in the hadith literature. Furthermore, I think that the narratives reporting this event are highly unreliable. Some of the hadith regarding Ayesha's age at the time of her wedding with prophet are problematic. I present the following evidences against the acceptance of the fictitious story by Hisham ibn Urwah and to clear the name of my Prophet as an irresponsible old man preying on an innocent little girl.\n EVIDENCE #1: Reliability of Source\n Most of the narratives printed in the books of hadith are reported\n only by Hisham ibn `Urwah, who was reporting on the authority of his father. First of all, more people than just one, two or three should logically have reported. It is strange that no one from Medina, where Hisham ibn `Urwah lived the first 71 years of his life narrated the event, despite the fact that his Medinan pupils included the well- respected Malik ibn Anas. The origins of the report of the narratives of this event are people from Iraq, where Hisham is reported to have shifted after living in Medina for most of his life.\n Tehzibu'l-Tehzib, one of the most well known books on the life\n and reliability of the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet,\n reports that according to Yaqub ibn Shaibah: \"He [Hisham] is\n highly reliable, his narratives are acceptable, except what he narrated after moving over to Iraq\" (Tehzi'bu'l-tehzi'b, Ibn\n Hajar Al- `asqala'ni, Dar Ihya al-turath al-Islami, 15th century. Vol 11, p. 50).\n It further states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham which were reported through people in Iraq: \"I have been told that Malik objected on those narratives of Hisham which were reported through people of Iraq\" (Tehzi'b u'l-tehzi'b, Ibn Hajar Al- `asqala'ni, Dar Ihya al-turath al-Islami, Vol.11, p. 50).\n Mizanu'l-ai`tidal, another book on the life sketches of the\n narrators of the traditions of the Prophet reports: \"When he was old, Hisham's memory suffered quite badly\" (Mizanu'l-ai`tidal, Al-Zahbi, Al- Maktabatu'l-athriyyah, Sheikhupura, Pakistan, Vol. 4, p. 301).\n CONCLUSION: Based on these references, Hisham's memory was\n failing and his narratives while in Iraq were unreliable. So, his narrative of Ayesha's marriage and age are unreliable.\n CHRONOLOGY: It is vital also to keep in mind some of the pertinent\n dates in the history of Islam:\n pre-610 CE: Jahiliya (pre-Islamic age) before revelation\n 610 CE: First revelation\n 610 CE: AbuBakr accepts Islam\n 613 CE: Prophet Muhammad begins preaching publicly.\n 615 CE: Emigration to Abyssinia\n 616 CE: Umar bin al Khattab accepts Islam\n 620 CE: Generally accepted betrothal of Ayesha to the Prophet\n 622 CE: Hijrah (emigation to Yathrib, later renamed Medina)\n 623/624 CE: Generally accepted year of Ayesha living with the Prophet\n EVIDENCE #2: The Betrothal\n According to Tabari (also according to Hisham ibn `Urwah, Ibn\n Hunbal and Ibn Sad), Ayesha was betrothed at seven years of age and began to cohabit with the Prophet at the age of nine years. However, in another work, Al-Tabari says: \"All four of his [Abu Bakr's] children were born of his two wives during the pre-Islamic period\" (Tarikhu'l-umam wa'l-mamlu'k, Al-Tabari (died 922), Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Dara'l-fikr, Beirut, 1979).\n If Ayesha was betrothed in 620 CE (at the age of seven) and started to live with the Prophet in 624 CE (at the age of nine), that would indicate that she was born in 613 CE and was nine when she began living with the Prophet. Therefore, based on one account of Al- Tabari, the numbers show that Ayesha must have born in 613 CE, three years after the beginning of revelation (610 CE). Tabari also states that Ayesha was born in the pre-Islamic era (in Jahiliya). If she was born before 610 CE, she would have been at least 14 years old when she began living with the Prophet. Essentially, Tabari contradicts himself.\n CONCLUSION: Al-Tabari is unreliable in the matter of determining\n Ayesha's age.\n \n EVIDENCE # 3: The Age of Ayesha in Relation to the Age of Fatima According to Ibn Hajar, \"Fatima was born at the time the Ka`bah was rebuilt, when the Prophet was 35 years old... she was five years older that Ayesha\" (Al-isabah fi tamyizi'l-sahabah, Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani, Vol. 4, p. 377, Maktabatu'l-Riyadh al-haditha, al-Riyadh, 1978).\n If Ibn Hajar's statement is factual, Ayesha was born when the\n Prophet was 40 years old. If Ayesha was married to the Prophet when he was 52 years old, Ayesha's age at marriage would be 12 years.\n CONCLUSION: Ibn Hajar, Tabari an Ibn Hisham and Ibn Humbal contradict each other. So, the marriage of Ayesha at seven years of age is a myth.\n \n EVIDENCE #4: Ayesha's Age in relation to Asma's Age\n According to Abda'l-Rahman ibn abi zanna'd: \"Asma was 10\n years older than Ayesha (Siyar A`la'ma'l-nubala', Al-Zahabi, Vol.2,\n p. 289, Arabic, Mu'assasatu'l-risalah, Beirut, 1992).\n According to Ibn Kathir: \"She [Asma] was elder to her sister\n [Ayesha] by 10 years\" (Al-Bidayah wa'l-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p.\n 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).\n According to Ibn Kathir: \"She [Asma] saw the killing of her son\n during that year [73 AH], as we have already mentioned, and five days later she herself died. According to other narratives, she died not after five days but 10 or 20, or a few days over 20, or 100 days later. The most well known narrative is that of 100 days later. At the time of her death, she was 100 years old.\" (Al-Bidayah\n wa'l- nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933)\n According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani: \"She [Asma] lived a hundred\n years and died in 73 or 74 AH.\" (Taqribu'l-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fi'l-nisa', al-harfu'l-alif,\n Lucknow).\n According to almost all the historians, Asma, the elder sister of\n Ayesha was 10 years older than Ayesha. If Asma was 100 years old in 73 AH, she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of the hijrah.\n If Asma was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Ayesha should have been 17 or 18 years old. Thus, Ayesha, being 17 or 18 years of at the time of Hijra, she started to cohabit with the Prophet between at either 19 to 20 years of age.\n Based on Hajar, Ibn Katir, and Abda'l-Rahman ibn abi zanna'd,\n Ayesha's age at the time she began living with the Prophet would\n be 19 or 20. In Evidence # 3, Ibn Hajar suggests that Ayesha was 12 years old and in Evidence #4 he contradicts himself with a 17 or 18- year-old Ayesha. What is the correct age, twelve or eighteen?\n CONCLUSION: Ibn Hajar is an unreliable source for Ayesha's age.\n \n EVIDENCE #5: The Battles of Badr and Uhud\n A narrative regarding Ayesha's participation in Badr is given in\n the hadith of Muslim, (Kitabu'l-jihad wa'l-siyar, Bab\n karahiyati'l- isti`anah fi'l-ghazwi bikafir). Ayesha, while narrating the journey to Badr and one of the important events that took place in that journey, says: \"when we reached Shajarah\". Obviously, Ayesha was with the group travelling towards Badr. A narrative regarding Ayesha's participation in the Battle of Uhud is given in Bukhari (Kitabu'l- jihad wa'l-siyar, Bab Ghazwi'l-nisa' wa qitalihinna ma`a'lrijal): \"Anas reports that on the day of Uhud, people could not stand their ground around the Prophet. [On that day,] I saw Ayesha and Umm-i-Sulaim, they had pulled their dress up from their feet [to avoid any hindrance in their movement].\" Again, this indicates that Ayesha was present in the Battles of Uhud and Badr.\n It is narrated in Bukhari (Kitabu'l-maghazi, Bab\n Ghazwati'l-khandaq wa hiya'l-ahza'b): \"Ibn `Umar states that the Prophet did not permit me to participate in Uhud, as at that time, I was 14 years old. But on the day of Khandaq, when I was 15 years old, the Prophet permitted my participation.\"\n Based on the above narratives, (a) the children below 15 years were sent back and were not allowed to participate in the Battle of Uhud, and (b) Ayesha participated in the Battles of Badr and Uhud\n CONCLUSION: Ayesha's participation in the Battles of Badr and\n Uhud clearly indicates that she was not nine years old but at least 15 years old. After all, women used to accompany men to the battlefields to help them, not to be a burden on them. This account is another contradiction regarding Ayesha's age.\n \n EVIDENCE #6: Surat al-Qamar (The Moon)\n According to the generally accepted tradition, Ayesha was born about eight years before hijrah. But according to another narrative in Bukhari, Ayesha is reported to have said: \"I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)\" when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, kitabu'l-tafsir, Bab Qaulihi Bal al-sa`atu Maw`iduhum wa'l-sa`atu adha' wa amarr).\n Chapter 54 of the Quran was revealed eight years before hijrah (The Bounteous Koran, M.M. Khatib, 1985), indicating that it was revealed in 614 CE. If Ayesha started living with the Prophet at the age of nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she was a newborn infant (sibyah in Arabic) at the time that Surah Al-Qamar (The Moon) was revealed. According to the above tradition, Ayesha was actually a young girl, not an infant in the year of revelation of Al-Qamar. Jariyah means young playful girl (Lane's Arabic English Lexicon). So, Ayesha, being a jariyah not\n a sibyah (infant), must be somewhere between 6-13 years old at the time of revelation of Al-Qamar, and therefore must have been 14-21 years at the time she married the Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: This tradition also contradicts the marriage of Ayesha at the age of nine.\n \n EVIDENCE #7: Arabic Terminology\n According to a narrative reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, after the\n death of the Prophet's first wife Khadijah, when Khaulah came to\n the Prophet advising him to marry again, the Prophet asked her regarding the choices she had in mind. Khaulah said: \"You can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)\". When the Prophet asked the identity of the bikr (virgin), Khaulah mentioned Ayesha's name.\n All those who know the Arabic language are aware that the word bikr in the Arabic language is not used for an immature nine-year-old girl. The correct word for a young playful girl, as stated earlier,\n is jariyah. Bikr on the other hand, is used for an unmarried lady\n without conjugal experience prior to marriage, as we understand the word \"virgin\" in English. Therefore, obviously a\n nine-year-old girl is not a \"lady\" (bikr) (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, p. .210, Arabic, Dar Ihya al-turath al-`arabi,Beirut).\n CONCLUSION: The literal meaning of the word, bikr (virgin), in the\n above hadith is \"adult woman with no sexual experience prior to\n marriage.\" Therefore, Ayesha was an adult woman at the time of\n her marriage.\n \n EVIDENCE #8. The Qur'anic Text\n All Muslims agree that the Quran is the book of guidance. So, we need to seek the guidance from the Quran to clear the smoke and confusion created by the eminent men of the classical period of Islam in the matter of Ayesha's age at her marriage. Does the Quran allow or disallow marriage of an immature child of seven years of age? There are no verses that explicitly allow such marriage. There is a verse, however, that guides Muslims in their duty to raise an orphaned child. The Quran's guidance on the topic of raising orphans is also valid in the case of our own children. The verse states: \"And make not over your property (property of the orphan), which Allah had made a (means of) support for you, to the weak of understanding, and maintain them out of it, clothe them and give them good education.\n And test them until they reach the age of marriage. Then if you find them maturity of intellect, make over them their property...\"\n (Quran, 4:5-6).\n In the matter of children who have lost a parent, a Muslim is ordered to (a) feed them, (b) clothe them, (c) educate them, and (d) test them for maturity \"until the age of marriage\" before\n entrusting them with management of finances.\n Here the Quranic verse demands meticulous proof of their intellectual and physical maturity by objective test results before the age of marriage in order to entrust their property to them.\n In light of the above verses, no responsible Muslim would hand over financial management to a seven- or nine-year-old immature girl. If we cannot trust a seven-year-old to manage financial matters, she cannot be intellectually or physically fit for marriage. Ibn Hambal (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hambal, vol.6, p. 33 and 99) claims that nine-year- old Ayesha was rather more interested in playing with toy-horses than taking up the responsible task of a wife. It is difficult to believe, therefore, that AbuBakr, a great believer among Muslims, would betroth his immature seven-year-old daughter to the 50-year-old Prophet. Equally difficult to imagine is that the Prophet would marry an immature seven-year-old girl. Another important duty demanded from the guardian of a child is to educate them. Let us ask the question, \"How many of us believe that we can educate our children satisfactorily before they reach the age of seven or nine years?\" The answer is none. Logically, it is an impossible task to educate a child satisfactorily before the child attains the age of seven. Then, how can we believe that Ayesha was educated satisfactorily at the claimed age of seven at the time of her marriage?\n AbuBakr was a more judicious man than all of us. So, he definitely\n would have judged that Ayesha was a child at heart and was not\n satisfactorily educated as demanded by the Quran. He would not have married her to anyone. If a proposal of marrying the immature and yet to be educated seven-year-old Ayesha came to the Prophet, he would have rejected it outright because neither the Prophet nor AbuBakr would violate any clause in the Quran.\n CONCLUSION: The marriage of Ayesha at the age of seven years would violate the maturity clause or requirement of the Quran. Therefore, the story of the marriage of the seven-year-old immature Ayesha is a myth.\n \n EVIDENCE #9: Consent in Marriage\n A women must be consulted and must agree in order to make a marriage valid (Mishakat al Masabiah, translation by James Robson, Vol. I, p. 665). Islamically, credible permission from women is a prerequisite for a marriage to be valid.\n By any stretch of the imagination, the permission given by an\n immature seven-year-old girl cannot be valid authorization for\n marriage. It is inconceivable that AbuBakr, an intelligent man, would take seriously the permission of a seven-year-old girl to marry a 50-year- old man.\n Similarly, the Prophet would not have accepted the permission given by a girl who, according to the hadith of Muslim, took her toys with her when she went live with Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: The Prophet did not marry a seven-year-old Ayesha because it would have violated the requirement of the valid permission clause of the Islamic Marriage Decree. Therefore, the Prophet married an intellectually and physically mature lady Ayesha.\n \n SUMMARY:\n It was neither an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as seven or nine years, nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.\n Obviously, the narrative of the marriage of nine-year-old Ayesha by Hisham ibn `Urwah cannot be held true when it is contradicted by many other reported narratives. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to accept the narrative of Hisham ibn `Urwah as true when other scholars, including Malik ibn Anas, view his narrative while in Iraq, as unreliable. The quotations from Tabari, Bukhari and Muslim show they contradict each other regarding Ayesha's age. Furthermore, many of these scholars contradict themselves in their own records. Thus, the narrative of Ayesha's age at the time of the marriage is not reliable due to the clear contradictions seen in the works of classical scholars of Islam.\n Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the\n information on Ayesha's age is accepted as true when there are\n adequate grounds to reject it as myth. Moreover, the Quran rejects the marriage of immature girls and boys as well as entrusting them with responsibilities.\n \n T.O. Shanavas is a physician based in Michigan. This article first\n appeared in The Minaret in March 1999.\n \u00a9 2001 Minaret\n Extracted 09/06/02 from The Minaret was not married until\n \n \n Above all that I would like to add that the Holy Prophet (pbuh) was twenty-five years of age, then he and his wife lived in\n happiness and fidelity for twenty-four years, until her death when he was fourty-nine. Only between the age of fifty and his death at sixty- two did Prophet Mohammed take other wives, only one of whom was a virgin, and most of them were taken for dynastic and political reasons. Certainly the Prophet's record was better than the head of the Church of England, Henry VIII.\"\n Geoffrey Parrinder, Mysticism in the World's Religions (New York:\n Oxford University Press, 1976, pg. 121)\n In addressing the issue of Prophet Prophet Mohammed's polygynous marriages, it is important to remember several points.\n First, Semitic culture in general and Arab practice in particular\n permitted polygyny. It was common practice in Arabian society,\n especially among nobles and leaders. Though less common, polygyny was also permitted in biblical and even in postbiblical Judaism. From Abraham, David and Solomon down to the reformation period, polygyny was practised by some Jews. While Jewish law changed after the middle Ages due to the influence of Christian rule, for Jews under Islamic rule, polygyny remained licit, though it was not extensively practised.\n Second, during the prime of his life, Prophet Mohammed remained\n married to one woman, Khadija.\n Third, it was only after her death that he took a number of wives.\n Fourth, Prophet Mohammed's use of the special dispensation from God to exceed the limit of four wives imposed by the Quran, occurred only after the death of Khadija. Moreover, most of the eleven marriages had political and social motives. As was customary for Arab chiefs, many were political marriages to cement alliances. Others were marriages to the widows of his companions who had fallen in combat\n and were in need of protection. Remarriage was difficult in a society that emphasised the importance of virgin marriages.\n Aisha was the only virgin that Prophet Prophet Mohammed married and the wife with whom he had the closest relationship.\n Fifth, Prophet Prophet Mohammed's teachings and actions, as well as the Qur'anic message, improved the status of all women - wives, daughters, mothers, widows and orphans.\n Talk of the political and social motives behind many of the Prophet's marriages should not obscure the fact that Prophet Mohammed was attracted to women and enjoyed being with his wives. To deny this would contradict the Islamic outlook on marriage and sexuality, found in both revelation and Prophetic traditions, which emphasises the importance of family and views sex as a gift from God to be enjoyed within the bonds of marriage. The many stories about Prophet Mohammed's concern and care for his wives reflect these values.\n Ref: Rachel Biale, Women and Jewish Law (New York: Schocken Books,\n 1984, pg. 49-51)\n\n \n If Islam, as you contend, leads all it's followers to be child-rapists, how do you explain this obviously learned and pious man's mere existence? \n \n Further interesting material- from here \n \n \nConsider the numerous verses in the Quran that ask Muslims to refrain from aggression and violence, except in self-defense, even in a war... how is it possible that the same God would allow aggression toward a mate? \n \n S\u00fbrah al Nisa 4.77\n \"Art thou not aware of those who have been told, 'Curb your hands'....\"\n \n S\u00fbrah al Imran 3.134\n \"... and hold in check their anger...\"\n \n S\u00fbrah 42.41-42 \n But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them, against such there is no cause of blame. The blame is only against those who oppress in wrongdoing and insolently transgress beyond bounds, defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous. \n \n S\u00fbrah al Baqarah 2.217 \n Oppression is worse than killing. \n \n Consider the verses that directly address and order men not to hold women against their will. \n \n S\u00fbrah Al-Baqarah 2. 230 \n 'And women have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable.'\n \n S\u00fbrah Al-Baqarah 2. 231\n 'Do not retain them against their will in order to hurt...' \n \n S\u00fbrah An Nisa 4:19\n 'It is not lawful for you to try to hold your wives against their will, and neither shall you keep them under constraint with a view to taking away anything of what you may have given them, unless it be that they have become guilty of immoral conduct in an obvious manner. Consort with wives in goodly manner; for if you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something which God might yet make a source of abundant good.' \n \n Consider the verses that explain the purpose of a marital relationship, and the creation of mates. \n \n S\u00fbrah ar Rum 30.21\n \"And among His wonders is this: He creates for you mates out of your own kind, so that your might incline towards then, and He engenders love and tenderness between you: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who think!\n \n S\u00fbrah al Baqarah 2.187\n \"...

And consort with your wives in a goodly manner, for if you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something which God might yet make a source of abundant good.\"\n \n S\u00fbrah al Nisa 4.1\n \"O mankind! Be conscious of your Sustainer, who has created you out of one living entity (nafs), and out of it created its mate, and out of the two spread abroad a multitude of men and women. And remain conscious of God, in whose name you demand your rights from one another, and of these ties of kinship. Verily, God is ever watchful over you!\"\n \n S\u00fbrah at Tawb\u00e2h 9.71\n \"And [as for] the believers, both men and women - they are friends and protectors of one another: they [all] enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid the doing of what is wrong, and are constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues, and pay heed unto God and His apostle. It is they upon whom God will bestow His Grace: verily, God is Almighty, Wise.\"\n \n Consider the verses that guide women when they fear mistreatment from their husband. \n \n S\u00fbrah al Nisa 4.128\n \"And if a woman has reason to fear ill-treatment from her husband, or that he might turn away from her, it shall not be wrong for the two to set things peacefully to rights between themselves, for peace is best, and selfishness is ever-present in human souls...\"\n \n Ahadith\n \n This view is strengthened by the Prophet's authentic hadith found in a number of authorities, including Bukhari and Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad bin Hanbal and others to the effect that he forbade the beating of any woman: \n \n \"Could any of you beat your wife as he would a slave, and then lie with her in the evening?\"\n \n \"Never beat God's handmaidens.\"\n \n \"O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right, then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with anyone of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste\".\n \n \"Your wife has a right against you and your children have a right against you. Give to everyone their rightful claims\".\n \n AND think for yourself!\n\n \n \n Inequalities between men and women are common the world over, albeit the forms and conditions vary and change. It is a nearly universal truism that gender matters in ways that make and keep women relatively less free, less independent, less empowered, less financially and physically secure than men.\n \n The arena where gender inequalities are most entrenched, in the context of family relations, is also where they are most widely accepted and thus most difficult to alter. Sexual and other physical differences between men and women lend themselves to understandings of social inequalities as both derivative of and conforming to 'nature', especially in terms of family roles and relations. Such understandings prevail in many cultures. But the challenges of contesting and altering inequalities are compounded in societies where gender and family relations are governed by religious laws, because the resultant hierarchies can be defended as divinely sanctioned.\n \n Debates over the legitimacy of gender equality have been especially vigorous in Muslim societies, and display some common patterns related to shari'a.[6] The Qur'an, which believers accept as the literal word of God and thus eternally applicable, contains many verses that would seem inescapably discriminatory toward women. So, too, do many of the hadith (sayings by and stories about the Prophet Muhammad). Yet there are also many Qur'anic verses and hadith establishing the equality of men and women. These seeming contradictions lend themselves to multiple readings, claims and counter-claims about what Islam prescribes for women.[7]\n from here.\n \n \nThat's hearsay at best - someone supposing that their were marriages in Europe of six year old girls \n\n Hearsay? I thought it was such common knowledge that surely you would know about it, but I guess not. See here-\n \nThe very idea of child marriage -- the use of a child as a bargaining chip, a counter in the game of family politics and inheritance -- is as abhorrent to us as it was apparently completely non-exceptionable in the 14th century. A social practice which entered the written record in the 12th century, but which seems to have had roots in the barbaric past, that extended from the royal abattoirs down to the lives of neighboring fishmongers and shop-keepers in medieval London, yet that seems to have received little more than passing notice in canon law beyond exhortation to limit it to age seven and ensure mutual consent of the parties, is now regarded with horror and disgust by decent- minded people from every point along the political and social spectrum. \netc., etc.\n \n \nThere's no evidence of it, perhaps it was an example to put the men to shame. \n\n Oh, now there's a liberal interpretation...\n \n \nThe difference is that Muslims believe Muhammad's example is for all time! \n\n As I've shown, not all Muslims believe a) that Aisha was a child when married, or b) that this is a practice to be replicated.\n \n \nAre you speaking of Protestant witch burnings or the inquisitions?\n\n The Catholic Inquisition, as experienced in Europe.\n \n \nYou may be right. They murdered and tortured on a small scale. Perhaps they didn't have the technology to do otherwise.\n\n Where's your evidence of pre-colonization murder and torture among First Nations? \n \n And no, development of technology for such things would not have been considered a valuable pursuit.\n \n \nGenocide was a policy of the U.S. Government long after the conquistadors were gone.\n\n The genocide began in Trinidad with Columbus, and followed across the East Coast on the part of the British, the French, and even the Dutch. It was continued across the continent and despite changes in the names of the governments in power.\n \n \nCan you tell me where. I know of only two human sacrifices in the Old Testament (I think two).\n\n \n Yahweh, like the other gods of the era, demanded human sacrifice of fristborn sons-\n \n \"Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openest the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\" (Exodus 13:2)\n \n \nTwo facts seem evident: the sacrifice of the firstborn was demanded usually when the God Yahweh was displeased or when his people wished his favor. He, like all gods, had to be appeased, or, so the people were made to believed.\nhttp://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/f/first_fruits.html\n \n Later, for some reason, the firstborn sons were replaced by only animals, then eventually the practice ended entirely.\n \n Anyway, this is a list of sacrifices of children for God in the Bible, besides the firstborn children of Isreal -\n \n Gen.7:21-22\n God drowns all children (except for Noah's) in a flood. \n \n Gen.19:24\n God kills all the children of Sodom and Gomorrah. \n \n Gen.22:2\n God tells Abraham to kill his son for a burnt offering. \n \n Ex.12:30\n God murders the Egyptian firstborn children. \n \n Ex.21:15, Lev.20:9, Dt.21:18-21\n Children who are disobedient, or who curse or strike their parents are to be killed. \n \n Dt.20:16, Jos.10:40\n God ordered the Israelites to kill all of the children in the cities that they invaded. \n \n 1 Sam.15:2-3\n God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekite children. \n \n 2 Sam.12:15, 18\n To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills David's newborn son. \n \n 2 Kg.2:23-24\n God sends bears to kill 42 little boys for making fun of Elisha's bald head. \n \n Jer.13:13-14\n God will make everyone drunk and then \"dash the fathers and the sons together.\" He vows to \"not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.\" \n \n Jer.19:9\n God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. \n \n Ps.135:8, 136:10\n God is praised for slaughtering little babies. \n \n Ps.137:9\n Happiness is smashing your little children against rocks. \n \n Ezek.5:10\n God will cause fathers to eat their sons and sons to eat their fathers. \n \n Hos.9:16\n God assures Hosea that he will \"slay even the beloved fruit of the womb.\" \n \n Hos.13:16\n God promises to dash to pieces the infants of Samaria and \"their women with child shall be ripped up.\" \n \n Zech.13:3\n A prophet must be killed by his own parents by \"thrusting him through when he prophesieth.\" \n \n \nDid the clergy torture people on a mass scale?\n\n Yes.

   "\"If a minor child is given away by her father or grandfather the marriage is binding on her. A girl is often virtually forced to marry an old man because he owns some land or can provide a large dowry. The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time. Even today Islam believes a girl is adult at the first signs of puberty.\"\n http://pnews.org/art/5art/MISOGYNY.shtml\n When in Islam is a girl a woman?\n Sura At-Talaaq\n 65:4\n \"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=27&bid=65\n \"Thus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult.\"\n http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/Polemics/aishah.htm\n Muslims generally have a prohibition on images (of people, usually). So, what about dolls? This question was put to an expert site..\n Answer... it was deemed permissible because...\n \"The majority of scholars quote as evidence for this exemption the hadeeth of ?Aa?ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) in which she says: \n ?I used to play with dolls in the house of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I had friends who used to play with me. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came in, they would hide themselves, then he would call them to join me and play with me.?\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=9473&dgn=4\n Aisha when married to Muhammad played with dolls. Muhammad allowed this, and as his example is the ideal, Muslims are allowed to let their children play with dolls.\n How is this relevant? It goes to show just how young Aisha was, she was still a child. (I quoted previously a Haddith that also showed she played on swings with her girl friends)\n Mizmaxx wants to defend Muhammad's child sex abuse by introducing a number of apologetic sites.\n \nNote there are several of many sites quoted. \n\n \nQuoting \"experts\" doesn't mean you've proven your thesis, which you haven't.\n\n Are you serious? I shouldn't quote experts? :) Perhaps you'd prefer a battle of suppositions? Really, now Mizmaxx, you crack me up.\n \nNo, you said you hate Catholicism.\n\n \nActually, I said I would be allowed to, given their history with my people.\n\n No, you said you hate it. You said it is violent, stupid, run by a ***-hole pope, that it screws up people; including your grandmother. A pity the level of honesty has plummeted in your debates.\n \nI also said that Catholicism was violent and stupid, in the past, but that there were some Catholics who were working on this, and I support them.\n\n No, You didn't say 'in the past'. You stated that it isharmful and that it encourages hate, YOU DID NOT SAY it was harmful and that it encouraged hate.\n Your words of hate just won't go away. Sorry you said them? Obviously not.\n \n I think you could escape if you were trying to be pedantic. If you were to suggest that what you meant was that not every single Muslim believes in the Koran... \n\n \nNo, you just misunderstood me. I said-\n Because despite being written in the Quran, it is not followed as a universal \"Islamic teaching\". \n I figured anyone with a basic understanding of English grammar could tell that the \"it\" in the sentence refers not to the Quran itself, but the idea of child-marriages. \n\n You are still wrong, in an illogical way... The teachings of the Koran are accepted by most Moslems. That doesn't mean that all will marry a child-bride any more than all Christians will want to be nailed to a cross. We've already established that Muhammad is the example. I've also stated that some people who are Muslim do the right thing IN SPITE OF the Koran. That has been my argument - the basic tenets of Islam are bad. The idea of following a man doing bad things, is bad. Some good Muslims don't... good for them, we've met examples.\n \nAs for the Hadiths, I believe what I said was that they were not universally followed, however the \"majority\" of Muslims consider them.\n\n Show me the Muslims that don't follow the Haddiths. As I suspected, this is actually what you meant re: Koran above.\n \n He believes that sleeping with a nine year old, as Muhammad did, was something ordained by their god, and therefore not evil. \n\n \nAgain, not every Muslim believes that, and there are non-Muslims that believe in child marriages, so what's your point?\n\n Egad! Of course they don't believe Muhammad sleeping with a nine year old girl is evil. I stated that last post. They try to put every excuse on the table - as you have, that she was exceptionally 'advanced' for her age, or that she in fact was older than nine by some convoluted logic. They do this BECAUSE they believe Muhammad is the example - so even when faced with the fact he did something evil - something you're still not willing to admit to, they bring forth all types of excuses to, well excuse it. No matter what he did, kill PoWs, have sex with a child, marry 9 or 11 women, celebrate assignations, whatever he did, is right because it is right in their god's eyes. You are in fact proving my point.\n \n It is as I said truly amazing that you would even go down this path in order to win a debate - to ignore the fact she was a child - yes, let's pretend shall we simply because she's menstruated she was far and away ahead of her years. \n\n \nThis is completely out of left field. I never said anything about whether or not she was menstruating. I didn't cite the article link because I got it from a forum, so it is hard to find, but I'll reproduce it here because you're so obviously confused.\n\n Before proceeding, I've highlighted bits you've obviously missed from your own source.\n \nThe Ancient Myth Exposed\n by T.O. Shanavas\n A Christian friend asked me once, \"Will you marry your seven year old daughter to a fifty year old man?\" I kept my silence. He continued, \"If you would not, how can you approve the marriage of an innocent seven year old, Ayesha, with your Prophet?\" I told him, \"I don't have an answer to your question at this time.\" My friend smiled and left me with a thorn in the heart of my faith. Most Muslims answer that such marriages were accepted in those days. Otherwise, people would have objected to Prophet's marriage with Ayesha.\n However, such an explanation would be gullible only for those who are naive enough to believe it. But unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the answer\n The Prophet was an exemplary man. All his actions were most virtuous so that we, Muslims, can emulate them. However, most people in our Islamic Center of Toledo, including me, would not think of betrothing our seven years daughter to a fifty-two year-old man. If a parent agrees to such a wedding, most people, if not all, would look down upon the father and the old husband.\n In 1923, registrars of marriage in Egypt were instructed not to register and issue official certificates of marriage for brides less than sixteen and grooms less than eighteen years of age. Eight years later, the Law of the Organization and Procedure of Sheriah courts of 1931 consolidated the above provision by not hearing the marriage disputes involving brides less than sixteen and grooms less than eighteen years old. (Women in Muslim Family Law, John Esposito, 1982). It shows that even in the Muslim majority country of Egypt the child marriages are unacceptable.\n So, I believed, without solid evidence other than my reverence to my Prophet, that the stories of the marriage of seven-year-old Ayesha to 50-year-old Prophet are only myths. However, my long pursuit in search of the truth on this matter proved my intuition correct. My Prophet was a gentleman. And he did not marry an innocent seven or nine year old girl. The age of Ayesha has been erroneously reported in the hadith literature. Furthermore, I think that the narratives reporting this event are highly unreliable. Some of the hadith regarding Ayesha's age at the time of her wedding with prophet are problematic. I present the following evidences against the acceptance of \n the fictitious story by Hisham ibn Urwah and to clear the name of my Prophet as an irresponsible old man preying on an innocent little girl.\n\n For the most part I've already refuted his re-working of Haddith... simply because of his axiomatic idealisation of Muhammad. However, you need to contextualise your source. The first Muslim to challenge this notion was...\n \"It appears that Maulana Muhammad Ali was the first Islamic scholar directly to challenge the notion that Aisha was aged six and nine, respectively, at the time of her nikah and consummation of marriage. This he did in, at least, the following writings: his English booklet Prophet of Islam, his larger English book Muhammad, the Prophet, and in the footnotes in his voluminous Urdu translation and commentary of Sahih Bukhari entitled Fadl-ul-Bari, these three writings being published in the 1920s and 1930s. In the booklet Prophet of Islam, which was later incorporated in 1948 as the first chapter of his book Living Thoughts of the Prophet Muhammad, he writes in a lengthy footnote as follows:\"\n http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.htm\n That is, 1,400 years after the event, I would speculate because of his own need to make an apology to westerners - being as he was involved with English works on Islam.\n Your source then is truly un-orthodox. You should enjoy this site as they too try a relativist argument - even saying that Joseph was 90 when he married a 14 year old Mary!\n Let's skip to the end...\n \nSUMMARY:\n It was neither an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as seven or nine years, nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.\n Obviously, the narrative of the marriage of nine-year-old Ayesha by Hisham ibn `Urwah cannot be held true when it is contradicted by many other reported narratives. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to accept the narrative of Hisham ibn `Urwah as true when other scholars, including Malik ibn Anas, view his narrative while in Iraq, as unreliable. The quotations from Tabari, Bukhari and Muslim show they contradict each other regarding Ayesha's age. Furthermore, many of these scholars contradict themselves in their own records. Thus, the narrative of Ayesha's age at the time of the marriage is not reliable due to the clear contradictions seen in the works of classical scholars of Islam.\n Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the information on Ayesha's age is accepted as true when there are adequate grounds to reject it as myth. Moreover, the Quran rejects the marriage of immature girls and boys as well as entrusting them with responsibilities.\n T.O. Shanavas is a physician based in Michigan. This article first appeared in The Minaret in March 1999.\n \u00a9 2001 Minaret\n\n That is one interesting Muslim who doubts the dozen or more haddith quotes I gave that specifically give her age. As I said they try every argument - here's another attack - the relativist argument...\n \n Above all that I would like to add that the Holy Prophet (pbuh) was twenty-five years of age, then he and his wife lived in happiness and fidelity for twenty-four years, until her death when he was forty-nine. Only between the age of fifty and his death at sixty- two did Prophet Mohammed take other wives, only one of whom was a virgin, and most of them were taken for dynastic and political reasons. Certainly the Prophet's record was better than the head of the Church of England, Henry VIII.\"\n Geoffrey Parrinder, Mysticism in the World's Religions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, pg. 121)\n\n Next you introduce a laughably irrelevant spiel of random quotes from the Koran that don't support anything (as you claim that if I put forward such quotes they are out of context)\n What is the point? How does it attest to Aisha as we're debating? As you say 'what is your point?'\n Here's a better excuse...\n \"All the stories circulating on the Internet and in the hadiths books about Aisha's marriage at age of 6 or 9, are no more than lies found in the corrupted books of Hadiths and completely contradict the teachings of the prophet Muhammad that came from his mouth, the Glorious Quran. We only need to read the Quran to know how false these stories are. \"\n http://www.submission.org/women/Aisha.html\n Here's another (not disputing her age... but suggesting that it was wide-spread practice - which still doesn't make it right)\n http://www.tafsirquran.com/age3.htm\n and another\n http://www.geocities.com/marriedin2001/marryhusband2.html\n As stated, they believe that Muhammad's actions were green-lighted by their god. Relativist arguments then don't wash.\n As I say, they try every single excuse in the book.\n \nThat's hearsay at best - someone supposing that their were marriages in Europe of six year old girls \n\n \nHearsay? I thought it was such common knowledge that surely you would know about it, but I guess not. See here-\n Quote:\n The very idea of child marriage -- the use of a child as a bargaining chip, a counter in the game of family politics and inheritance -- is as abhorrent to us as it was apparently completely non-exceptionable in the 14th century. A social practice which entered the written record in the 12th century, but which seems to have had roots in the barbaric past, that extended from the royal abattoirs down to the lives of neighboring fishmongers and shop-keepers in medieval London, yet that seems to have received little more than passing notice in canon law beyond exhortation to limit it to age seven and ensure mutual consent of the parties, is now regarded with horror and disgust by decent- minded people from every point along the political and social spectrum. \n\n Mizmaxx, a) where did you find this (can you in future actually follow convention and give the web-site)\n b) how are these people, such as a medieval London shop-keeper viewed as exemplary men for all us to follow for all time? (please quote Christian doctrine saying we follow the examples of these men as their behaviour is ordained by God)\n c) are you saying that there were child marriages in Native American culture?\n \nThere's no evidence of it, perhaps it was an example to put the men to shame. \n\n \nOh, now there's a liberal interpretation...\n\n I think your's is too. All you and I have to go on is in fact very little. You get out of it that they are in fact raped - even though theirs no evidence.\n That is in fact your best argument on this - speculation, and supposition. You've run with it now for about a week, and you've produced nothing more then re-working of your opinion on the matter. I simply counter with my opinion, as you believe opinion is so worth while.\n \nThe difference is that Muslims believe Muhammad's example is for all time! \n\n \nAs I've shown, not all Muslims believe a) that Aisha was a child when married, or b) that this is a practice to be replicated.\n\n Yes, another false argument. We know that most Muslims believe that Muhammad is the example for all time. And, not all Muslims live up to this ideal. You did have a point, didn't you? I have maintained repeatedly that good Muslims are good DESPITE not following Islamic tenets - in this case, the example of Muhammad. That is why I accept there are some good Muslims. However, the central themes of Islam are evil, based on the conception that such an evil man is the ideal.\n \n Here are some more Islamic sites that recognise Aisha's true age...\n \"Aisha bint Abu Bakr 9 Started living with the prophet at the age of 9\"\n http://www.themodernreligion.com/prophet/prophet_aisha.htm\n why...?\n \"The Prophet married Aisha primarily for three reasons:\n To reinforce the friendly relations already existing with Abu Bakr (his closest companion).\n To educate and train Aisha so she may serve the purposes of Islam.\n To teach her to utilize her capabilities for the sake of Islam.\"\n (Ibid)\n As I said, to set an example for all man kind.\n (also at http://www.geocities.com/islaminme001/_aishah2.htm)\n \"The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time.\"\n http://www.hraic.org/women_in_islam.html\n also at\n http://www.amcoptic.com/read_for_u/women_and_islam.htm\n \n \"The phrase \"he married ?Aa?ishah\" means that the marriage contract was drawn up; the marriage was consummated later on, when she was nine.\"\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=59970#post59970\n Why?\n In summary, then, it is permitted to contract marriage with a young girl and to hand her over to her husband to stay with him before she reaches adolescence. As for consummating the marriage, this does not happen until she is physically able for it. Thus the matter becomes quite clear. Do you see anything wrong with a man living with his young wife in one house, bringing her up and teaching her, but delaying consummation until she is ready for it? We ask Allaah to show us truth and falsehood and to make each clear. And Allaah knows best.\n Ibid.\n Again, because their god ordained it.\n \n Here again are the primary Islamic sources...(with some secondary sources)\n From Bukhari vol. 7, #65:\n \"Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: \"I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\"\n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah's Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine\". \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n (Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.)\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\"\n FROM THE HISTORY OF TABARI\n (Tabari wrote the most authentic Islamic history. It covers 39 volumes. Tabari was one of the greatest Islamic scholars and the greatest Islamic Historian.)\n From Tabari, volume 7, page 7:\n \"....my marriage (to Muhammad) was consummated when I was nine.....\"\n From Tabari, volume 9, page 131\n \"Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me\"......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal. She was eighteen years old when he died.\n (I also want to provide evidence from the best Islamic Ency. available in English, and other Islamic writers. They also acknowledge Aisha's age being 9.)\n FROM THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF ISLAM, under \"Aisha\". (pub. by E.J. Brill). \n \"Some time after the death of Khadija, Khawla suggested to Muhammad that he should marry either Aisha, the 6 year old daughter of his chief follower, or Sawda Zama, a widow of about 30, who had gone as a Muslim to Abyssinia and whose husband had died there. Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both. It had already been agreed that Aisha should marry Djubayr Mutim, whose father, though still pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. By common consent, however, this agreement was set aside, and Muhammad was betrothed to Aisha.... The marriage was not consummated until some months after the Hidjra, (in April 623, 624). Aisha went to live in an apartment in Muhammad's house, later the mosque of Median. She cannot have been more than ten years old at the time and took her toys to her new home.\"\n From the Muslim book \"WOMEN IN ISLAM\" by Said Abjullah Seif-Al-Hatimy, published by Islamic Publications in Lahore Pakistan:\n \"...(Aisha) She was the youngest of his wives. It is said that she was nine years of age when he married her.\" \n SUMMATION OF THE EVIDENCE OF AISHA'S AGE\n I've belabored the point. But because of the controversy within the Islamic world I had to document her age thoroughly. The most respected Hadith and Islamic scholars from early on until this present day state that Aisha was 9 when Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with her.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n Iran thus gives the age of responsibility...\n \"The age of criminal responsibly in Iran is very low: for a girl it is nine and for a boy it's 15.\"\n http://www.payvand.com/news/03/oct/1133.html\n Why? Because she can be married at the age of nine.\n \" Early marriage is a common fate, with nine-year-old girls married off to men as old as ninety.\"\n http://www.saidit.org/archives/may01/article3.html\n Note too that Iran is one of the largest Muslim nations on earth... so don't try a 'minority' argument.\n \n You are defending the indefensible, simply because you hate Christianity - well done Mizmaxx, kudos! I guess betraying children is worth it. When you are against Christianity, the you support all sorts of evils.\n \n But your argument falls down, not just because of your giant chip, but because you have little knowledge of Islam, you've been forced, on the hop, to rely on un-orthodox Muslim interpretations that are at best, lying in order to portray Islam in a better light. And in order to do so, you propose supposition in regards to Genesis accounts about Lot - that's the best you have?\n I suggest you look at\n http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/ayesha_age.htm\n before responding.\n \n And please do some real research. I once considered becoming a Muslim (in my immediate post-Catholic days). I researched it in private - buying a Koran* and I did so at university - I was part of my university's Muslim Students Association. I knew and know some many good Muslims, but there's no way I want to say that Muhammed is the ideal man. No way.\n \n *note too, I could, like you, just give Koranic verses, but I prefer to give you the on-line sites so you can view these for yourself, as I do with the majority of my quotes. You seem to have little wish to accord me the same opportunities to refute you.",

   "Are you serious? I shouldn't quote experts?\n\n Go right ahead. However, your 'experts' are not proving your thesis.\n \n \nNo, you said you hate it. You said it is violent, stupid, run by a ***-hole pope, that it screws up people; including your grandmother.(...)You stated that it isharmful and that it encourages hate, YOU DID NOT SAY it was harmful and that it encouraged hate.\n\n Whatever. I know what my words were, and so do you. You will interpret them any way you like.\n \n Anyway, are you trying to say I hate my grandmother? I don't, I think she's mislead, and yes I do think the current Pope is a good-for-nothing *******. A single Pope is not all Catholicism.\n \n \nI've also stated that some people who are Muslim do the right thing IN SPITE OF the Koran. That has been my argument - the basic tenets of Islam are bad. The idea of following a man doing bad things, is bad.\n\n See, that's the part you haven't proven. You have shown one bad thing that Muhammad seems to have done, though it is disputed. Despite the fact that not all Muslims practice this particular act, you wish to say that it in itself is Islam, thus Islam is bad. That has not been proven, by any stretch.\n \n \n \nShow me the Muslims that don't follow the Haddiths.\n\n \n Although there are some Muslim scholars who consider hadith to be the words of the Prophet (pbuh), but then there are those who do not, just on the basis of its being \"Sahih\", take them to be the words of the prophet (pbuh). Ibn al-Salaah writes:\n \n \"When they say: \"Such and such is a Sahih hadith\", it means that its chain of narrators is not broken and the chain fulfills the conditions specified above, but this does not necessitate that the information given in it is absolutely true.\"\n \n The above statement clearly shows that what you have written is not true.\n \n You further write:\n \n \"If we took the Hadith merely to be words that are 'ascribed' to him, much of the Sharia'h would not exist nor have any background.\"\n \n In my opinion, the basis of Shari`ah are the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh) and none of these two sources are dependent on hadith.\n \n As far as taking hadith as 'merely' words ascribed to the Prophet (pbuh) is concerned, I do not know, what else can be said about hadith. I shall write the questions that arise in my mind regarding these words, which are 'merely' words 'ascribed' to the Prophet (pbuh) at the end of this response. If you can provide me with satisfactory answers, I assure you, I shall, very open-mindedly, reconsider my point of view.\nmore \n here \n \n \n \n Title:\n Is Hadith an Independent Source of Religion...\n \n Question:\n \n There is considerable debate among Muslims, especially in the US about the validity of believing in the ahaadith compilations and even considering them as authenticated Sunnah. \n More here \n \n \nTitle:\n A Clarification on the Reliability of Hadith\n \n Question:\n \n In your section on \"Sources of Islam\" you stated that your position on hadith is that even the sahih canonical collections can contain flaws and errors because the compilation, no matter how scrupulous, was done by imperfect human beings. What is your opinion on the entirely separate body of Hadith, which the Shiites follow? Was their science of compiling and classifying hadith similar to the method used by Bukhari, Muslim, etc? Also, when it comes to sahih hadith, such as Bukhari, one is sometimes forced to rely on them to provide details (i.e. Muhammad's first revelation at the cave of Hira and his reaction to it). Yet if one acknowledges that there could be errors in even sahih hadith, an outsider can easily accuse you of referring to an unreliable source, so what is one to do when the details of an incident are provided only in hadith reports? Also, in your opinion, is the science of clasifying hadith really as reliable and accurate as many Muslim scholars make it to be?\n \n \n Answer:\n \n The reason of the vulnerability of the information received through Hadith, in my opinion lies in the fact that it is, in fact, the transmission of the \"understanding\" and \"perception\" of each narrator to his subsequent narrator. We can never be certain about the correctness of this transmission. Thus, it is not possible to be certain about the correctness of the ascription of a saying or an action to the Prophet (pbuh). The same holds true for Shiite principles. The transmission of hadith is equally dependent on human understanding and narration in both (Shiite or Sunni) principles.\nhttp://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=319&sscatid=69\n \n Whereas the Quran is seen as immutable, a word-for-word transcription from Allah (although interpretable by scholars), hadiths are not universally considered so. The possibility of human error thus exists in hadiths.\n \n \nThey try to put every excuse on the table - as you have, that she was exceptionally 'advanced' for her age, or that she in fact was older than nine by some convoluted logic.\n\n The logic is hardly \"convoluted\". Hadiths are open to human error according to many Muslims, and since the Hadiths are not consistent in describing Aisha's age it is very possible that she was not a young child but a girl in her mid-to-late-teens. As I said before, I still wouldn't marry such a young girl to a fifty-year-old. However, such marriages happen all the time, not only in the Muslim world by any stretch of the imagination.\n \n \nFor the most part I've already refuted his re-working of Haddith... simply because of his axiomatic idealisation of Muhammad.\n\n Sorry, that doesn't make his arguments any less valid. Ad hominem, montalban.\n \n \nMizmaxx, a) where did you find this (can you in future actually follow convention and give the web-site)\n\n Can you in the future click on the highlighted portions as these are links?\n \n \nb) how are these people, such as a medieval London shop-keeper viewed as exemplary men for all us to follow for all time?\n\n You're getting confused again. I said that child marriages were common in Europe, you said that was \"hearsay\", and I gave a historical reference. \n \n \nc) are you saying that there were child marriages in Native American culture?\n\n No. My people didn't have \"marriages\" at all. I don't know about other Nations.\n \n \nYou get out of it that they are in fact raped - even though theirs no evidence.\n\n Where do you get this stuff? I repeatedly said that their father was willing to throw them to the mob, because I happen to think that's bad enough. Oh, then he gets drunk and has sex with them. And BTW, he is not later described as \"a sinner who did one good thing\", the specific wording is \"righteous man\", and \"just Lot\". That doesn't leave much room for your apology that the author wanted the statement taken with a grain of salt considering his incestuous and cruel behaviour towards his daughters.\n \n \nAgain, because their god ordained it.\n\n Many things have been claimed to have been done on behalf of your god, yet you're the first to say that these are not \"real Christians\". The same could go for these people. \n \n \nI suggest you look at\n http://www.faithfreedom.org/Article.../ayesha_age.htm\n before responding.\n\n Interestingly enough, I already have. I've also visited http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=discussion&did=307, the rebuttal. It boils down to this- Moiz Amjad provides Hadiths to back up his statements, the other author provides only suppositions (such as that when ppl are 100 yrs old their exact age is often not known because they are so old, etc). I guess supposition is okay by you, so long as it's supposition you agree with...\n \n In conclusion, I have perused the very interesting website understanding-islam.org, and have found it to summarily refute your claims that it is \"minority\" opinion which disagrees with child-marriages within Islam (as has been my personal experience as well). \n \n \nTitle:\n Compelling Marriage on Minors...\n \n Question:\n \n I recently attended a lecture by Shaiyk Hamza Yusuf in California in which he detailed that all four major Madhabs in the Sunni sect allow provisions for compelling marriages on minors. This came as a shock to me, however, Shaiyk Hamza said that this is part of our tradition and we have to believe in it. He had cited that the early marriage of Hadhrat Ayesha (RA) had taken place precisely under this provision of Shari`ah. He had also cited the various positions that each Madhab takes on the compulsion of marriage of minor boys and girls by their parents. He cited the 12th book of Ihya of Imam Al-Ghazzali as one of the sources of this knowledge. I would like to ask if you subscribe to this view of our traditional madhabs? If yes, can you quote the Qur'an and the Ahadith, which support such view. I know that there exist a hadith in which the Prophet (pbuh) annulled the marriage of a women as it was done without her permission. I do not know of any hadith in which marriages were forced on children by their parents. If you do not support the view of forced child marriages then please provide reasons as to why you differ from the traditional madhabs in this perspective?\n \n \n Answer:\n \n In his concise work on the compilation of Islamic Fiqh (\"Bidayah al-Mujtahid\"), Ibn Rushd (Averroes) has mentioned that Muslim scholars, generally, allow that a father can marry his minor son/daughter, without the consent or even without consulting the minor (Kitaab al-Nikaah, Al-Baab al-Thaaniy). Ibn Rushd has also mentioned the basis of this opinion of the Muslim jurists. It should come as no surprise, that the basis of this opinion of the Muslim jurists, as given by Ibn Rushd is the marriage of the Prophet (pbuh) with Hadhrat Ayesha (ra), while she was a minor. I have already explained my reservations in accepting the narrative that relates the referred incident of the Prophet (pbuh)'s marriage, in one of my previous responses[1]. If my reservations carry any weight, then the very incident, which provides the basis of the opinion of the Muslim jurists, becomes questionable. We are then left with no basis of ascribing to that opinion.\n \n Another point generally held as a basis for holding the opinion that Islam allows marriage of a minor child is a particular interpretation of Al-Nisaa 4: 3 - 6. I have also commented on this interpretation of the referred verses and have tried to clarify their correct meaning of these verses in one of my previous responses[2].\n \n Thus, it should remain clear that the matter of 'compelling marriage on minors' is not a part of the Islamic Shari`ah. However, it should remain clear that the Islamic Shari`ah does not disallow a father or a guardian of a minor boy or a girl to marry[3] the child that is in his custody. Nevertheless, the child in question shall have the option of upholding or rejecting this decision of the father (or the guardian), at the time of attaining the age of majority. This option of the child, at the time of attaining the age of majority, is termed as 'Khiyaar al-Buloogh' (literally meaning: \"exercising choice at the time of attaining majority\"). Although, it may be of some interest to note that the Muslim jurists are, generally, of the opinion that a child does not have this option of upholding or rejecting a marriage, if such marriage has been carried-out by their real fathers. However, this opinion of the jurists is not supported by any clear directive of the Islamic Shari`ah.\n \n 24th April 2000 \n\n Note that the questioner was surprised to hear that a particular sect allowed for child marriages, and the respondant does not agree with the practice. This belies your thesis that child marriages are accepted save by a \"fringe\" opinion.\n \n Under \"General Muslim Customs\", many listings on cleanliness, greetings and sayings are noted, but nowhere does it say \"marry a seven-year-old\". On Muslim marriage, the website states the following-\n \nAs far as the teachings and recommendations of the Shari`ah regarding a Nikah (marriage) ceremony are concerned, the basic necessary ingredients that should be present in a marriage, according to the recommendations of Islam, are:\n \n 1.\n \n Marriage should primarily be a contract that materializes from the expression of the intent of a man and a woman to live the rest of their lives as husband and wife. This contract should be based on the free consent of the man and the woman. In other words, it should not be a temporary contract (i.e. a marital contract for a specified period of time) or one, which is based on coercion and force.\n 2.\n \n There should be a general declaration of the marriage in the society. Islam does not recognize a secret marital contract. The declaration of the marriage may take any shape or form that is generally adopted in the society. For instance, inviting friends and relatives to the marriage ceremony is an acceptable method of this declaration. Holding two or more persons as witnesses to the marriage contract is also a legislated method for such declaration adopted in various societies and cultures.\n 3.\n \n The man should give a mutually agreed upon amount as what the Islamic Shari`ah (law) terms as 'Mehr' to the woman. The factors that may be considered in the settlement of the amount of 'Mehr' include the financial position and the social status of the man and the woman. A woman may refuse marriage merely on the basis of the fact that she considers the amount of 'Mehr' to be inadequate. 'Mehr' is a basically a token from the man, given to his wife, to express and symbolize the fact that he is willing and capable to fulfill the financial responsibility of the family that would be formed subsequent to the marriage contract. It may be mentioned here that although Islam does not prohibit a woman to take up a financial activity of her choice, yet puts the ultimate responsibility of providing for the family on the husband. \n\n \n This article is also of interest as pertaining to Ayesha's age at marriage- http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=375&sscatid=412. For example-\n \nTabari has also reported that at the time Abu Bakr (ra) planned on migrating to Habshah (8 years before Hijrah), he went to Mut`am - with whose son Ayesha (ra) was engaged at that time - and asked him to take Ayesha (ra) in his house as his son's wife. Mut`am refused, because Abu Bakr had embraced Islam. Subsequently, his son divorced Ayesha (ra). Now, if Ayesha (ra) was only seven years old at the time of her marriage, she could not have been born at the time Abu Bakr decided on migrating to Habshah. On the basis of this report it seems only reasonable to assume that Ayesha (ra) had not only been born 8 years before hijrah, but was also a young lady, quite prepared for marriage.\n\n \n It is also not impossible that she was 12-16 and playing with dolls- it's not unheard of, in particular in cultures which don't have a set period of adolescence, where girls go directly from childhood to adulthood. As for \"swinging on swings\", well, that's even less cut-and-dry.",

   "Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems...\n Q). I have a nine year-old girl who is married to a person at the age of 20. The marriage contract was made a year ago but the girl is refusing to live with her husband or even to look at him. In addition to that she requires him to divorce her. Could you please advise me what to do? Should I separate them or force my daughter to live with him?\n (Name and address withheld) \n A). It is certainly possible for a father to get his daughter married to someone who he thinks is suitable for her. Whether he should force her into any marriage is something totally different Let me relate this to you: A woman companion of the Prophet came to him and said: \"My father has married me away to one of his relatives without asking my opinion. I do not wish to stay with this man as his wife.\" The Prophet ordered their separation. When she realized that she was free and that she was no longer married to the man, she said to the Prophet: \"I now accept what my father has done and I am marrying this man. I only did this so that women may know that it is not up to men to marry them away against their wishes.\"\n Scholars have discussed at length the marriage of a young girl who has not attained puberty and whether her father may marry her away without her permission. If such a marriage takes place it is valid. However, it is perhaps best if the marriage is not allowed to be consummated until the girl attains puberty, when she is given the choice whether to continue with this marriage or not. Moreover her father may not marry her away to someone who is of a lesser status than hers. If he does and she objects, the marriage is not valid. Generally speaking, however. a girl must be asked to express her opinion in any proposed marriage. If she has been married before, then her verbal consent should be requested. If she has not been married previously, then her consent is also to be requested, but if she keeps quiet, her silence is taken as approval.\n To say that the marriage is valid is not to say that people should go ahead and make such marriages. There may be certain circumstances, which make it desirable or advisable that a very young girl should be married away in this manner but this must not be taken as the normal situation. In marriage, the normal thing is that people should marry when they are of marriageable age. That does not include girls of nine or ten years of age, although some girls may attain puberty that early. Marriage involves certain responsibilities and a very young girl could not be expected to shoulder these. There are also other problems, which the may face, as she grows older. If things go wrong with her marriage, she will always blame her father for having messed up her life, well intentioned though he may be. If you take the example of your own daughter, and you force her to go and live with her husband despite her protestations, you will never be sure whether the marriage will work out well or not. If it does, then well and good. But there is an equal chance that problems may arise especially with your daughter behaving like the child she is. While her husband expects from her the attitude of a married woman. How could you expect her to overcome the feeling that she has been thrown into this situation without being allowed the slightest say in the whole matter which is to affect the rest of her life?\n \n As we see it, your choice is either to get her divorced now, before the marriage is consummated or to keep her with you until she has attained puberty and she is in a position to express her opinion about this marriage. If she still objects to it, then you divorce her without any compulsion to go through with it. If, on the other hand, if she approves of this marriage, at that time, then you go ahead with it. Perhaps it is better for you to consult with the young man to whom you have already married her. He should be understanding and accommodating. Between the two of you should work out the best solution which ensures that he is not lumbered with marriage which is forced on a young girl who cannot be expected to give an opinion about such a matter.\n http://www.islamicvoice.com/august.98/marriage.htm#EAR\n \n Here's another...\n \"According to the Shari?ah, if a girl is a minor (did not attain puberty), she may be given in marriage by her father. When she attains puberty, she has the right to maintain the marriage or discontinue the marriage. There is no age limit to be intimate with one?s wife even if she is a minor. \n It is important for you, in your situation, to consider the age difference reservation expressed by your wife. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best \n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\"\n http://islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6737\n \n Here's some more good Islamic advice...\n The Appropriate Age for Marriage\n Question: What is the appropriate age for men and women to marry? Some of the young ladies of today do not accept to be married to men older than them and also some of the men do not get married from anyone older than them either. We hope for a response, may Allah reward you.\n Response: I advise the young ladies not to refuse a man because of his older age. Even if he be ten, twenty or thirty years older, this is not a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) married Aisha when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old. Older age is not harmful.\n http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/articles/fatawawom/marriage.html#age\n \n I asked in my previous post the following\n \nwhere did you find this (can you in future actually follow convention and give the web-site)\n\n Mizmaxx does not wish to provide this courtesy for it would actually provide a chance for me to check these sources, and refute them. She only does so most sparingly. In passing through this brief spiel we will see why...\n \nAre you serious? I shouldn't quote experts? \n\n \nGo right ahead. However, your 'experts' are not proving your thesis.\n\n Such a trite and cheap thing is wishful thinking on your part.\n I have shown consistent proofs regarding\n -the place of the Koran in Islamic thought\n -the place of the Haddiths, in Islamic thought\n -the idea of Muhammad as the ideal man for all time.\n Your 'experts' is one woman who believes Islam isn't as chauvinistic as people believe - which in fact refutes your idea about the sexism in Islam, and also a few sites that suggests that Muhammad wasn't really having sex with an under-age girl, because it is impossible for a great man like him to do such a thing. \n \nNo, you said you hate it. You said it is violent, stupid, run by a ***-hole pope, that it screws up people; including your grandmother.(...)You stated that it is shameful and that it encourages hate, YOU DID NOT SAY it was harmful and that it encouraged hate. \n\n \nWhatever. I know what my words were, and so do you. You will interpret them any way you like.\n\n Another trite attempt. Ah, Mizmaxx. Rather than just admit you were angered, you've tried several attempts to be dishonest including\n a) saying you never said anything about hate (you got me on a pedantic point because you said Catholic, not Christian). You said some rather unkind things about her - simply because she is Catholic. When you say that about her, and the head of the church, how am I and the rest reading this to conclude that you make an exemption on everyone else... especially when...\n b) saying that what you said about Catholicism was confined to the past - even though your words are in the present continuous tense.\n and\n c)\n \nAnyway, are you trying to say I hate my grandmother? I don't, I think she's mislead, and yes I do think the current Pope is a good-for-nothing *******. A single Pope is not all Catholicism.\n\n You certainly haven't abandoned the old straw-man, now have you. I said nothing about what you think about your grand-mother other than quoting what you said about her. And then you try and re-work your own generalised hate of Catholicism (see first quote), to one particular Catholic - how dishonest. Further, your pathetic attempt to back pedal fails too because a vast majority of Catholics revere the Pope. So, calling him a good for nothing ****-head - I mean seriously Mizmaxx, are you trying to convey this as something less than a major assault on Catholics everywhere. You see to think that my attacks on Muhammad are an insult to all Muslims. Application of a rule judiciously again, Mizmaxx. It's why I enjoy debating you so much, you so undermine your cause with such talk.\n \nI've also stated that some people who are Muslim do the right thing IN SPITE OF the Koran. That has been my argument - the basic tenets of Islam are bad. The idea of following a man doing bad things, is bad. \n\n \nSee, that's the part you haven't proven. You have shown one bad thing that Muhammad seems to have done, though it is disputed. Despite the fact that not all Muslims practice this particular act, you wish to say that it in itself is Islam, thus Islam is bad. That has not been proven, by any stretch.\n\n I've established the central role of Muhammad, even one of your own sources said it! Simply pretending now that I've cited heaps of sources, and that your own sources comply is ridiculous. I have posted stuff on Muhammad executing PoWs - I asked you to read my debates with TruthKeeper. The best you can say is that I have not introduced this material to you directly in this thread. That is different from saying what you are saying - which is that I've only mentioned the sex attack on Aisha.\n As to Muhammad actually sleeping with her when she was nine, again, a majority of sources have agreed for a majority of time. I showed that your liberal interpretations are relatively recent, dating only from 80 years ago. Again, you just want to post here now that no such thing was ever said and therefore the case has not been proven. I think that is quite a good tactic. Just keep saying it. Perhaps, some people will actually believe you.\n You then introduce a vacuous argument about the Haddith based on yet another boring straw-man. There is no where that they say that they don't follow the Haddiths, which is what I asked you to prove... You made the statement based on lack of knowledge of Islam, and instead of answering my question, you refute a concept I never put forward. As all your source says is that they're not considered 100% true. In conjunction with the sites I gave, which quite clearly show that the Haddiths are seen as second only to the Koran, this shows that they do indeed follow the Haddiths - simply putting the Koran first... which they believe is the word of their god. Naturally enough they place the word of their god above the word of men. I cited heaps of sites that you can check against, and mine all say that the Haddiths are followed in conjunction with the Koran.\n It is exactly the same as an Orthodox Christian will venerate the teachings of a Holy Father and yet recognise that even someone as great as St.John Damascene was human who made mistakes. But we still revere his words, and incorporate them into Holy Tradition. You simply attempt to argue something I did not put forward. And it is getting really really boring that you keep doing this. I guess this sort of tactic will win out.\n As to the rest of the argument I will continue no more. You don't do me the courtesy of citing your sources. I've mentioned this in the last post. You are curbing a free debate by not showing me where on the net you got your information from. You here had given one reference that I can check on your claim about Haddith\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=60063#post60063 and \n http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=319&sscatid=69 and both say nothing about not following Haddith. Just about taking into consideration that it is written by men. It goes no where to justifying your claim, and as I said, this form of argument - presenting refutations to straw-man debate, and not citing your sources is frustrating, as is your ignorance of the subject and your continual suppositions that no matter how many 'expert' sources I cite (something you suggest I don't do), that nothing is there in my case.\n In fact, your second site says this of the Haddith\n \"The point is not that Hadith is an unreliable source of information. On the contrary, Hadith lacks the level of reliability which is entailed in the basic sources of the Shari`ah. In other words, it is only when compared to the Qur'an and the Sunnah that Hadith seems wanting in reliability. Nevertheless, if one were to compare Hadith with, for instance, sources of other histories, it would easily surpass the reliability of the sources of other histories on all accounts. This is only due to the strenuous work done by the scholars of Hadith in this field of study.\"\n (Ibid)\n Which in fact refutes your point. I guess this is why in general you're unwilling to give citations. They can be checked otherwise. Your site here says that the Haddith is only unreliable when compared to the Koran - which goes as I said to the point that they believe that the Koran is the word of their god - note that they say that compared to all other sources of history, they surpass the other histories on all accounts. Oddly you don't read your own sources - because this source that you introduce in fact totally refutes your previous sites that say the Haddiths are unreliable sources of Islamic history.\n It directly refutes the claim your souce (http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=375&sscatid=412) says about the Haddith. It would be interesting for you to let people know which of your sources you rely on and which of your sources you don't :) )\n Not too it states \"Tabari has also reported that at the time Abu Bakr\"\n (Ibid)\n Your sources say Tabari is unreliable. Fortunately we have the Haddiths to fall back on, and, as one of your sources, and all of mine say, the Haddiths are reliable sources on Islam, and in fact you've still to show that Muslims don't rely on the Haddiths - even those that accept that they're not 100% accurate :)\n \nAccording to the generally accepted tradition,\n http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=discussion&did=307 \n\n Your site simply repeats what you've already stated before - and I questioned this before, so re-stating it, without answering my question is a bit weird. That is, where is this 'generally accepted'? (I asked this in post #127)\n \nIt is also not impossible that she was 12-16 and playing with dolls- it's not unheard of, in particular in cultures which don't have a set period of adolescence, where girls go directly from childhood to adulthood. As for \"swinging on swings\", well, that's even less cut-and-dry.\n\n Taken by themselves, you would be correct. We aren't taking them by themselves, because the sources state she was 9 at the time, you just simply ignore that. In fact not only do the sources say she was 9, my secondary sources say she was 9. Your secondary sources are out of step with historical interpretations (those lasting over 1,000 years - and they are doing so because they are trying desperately to present a more humane face of Islam to westerners, and even here they contradict each other. I guess you believe that they speak for the majority of Muslims... and all the rest, the remaining 90% are fundamentalists :)\n One other thing you simply have failed to realise (and I'm referring to your quote that begins...)\n \nAs far as the teachings and recommendations of the Shari`ah regarding a Nikah (marriage) ceremony are concerned, the basic necessary ingredients that should be present in a marriage, according to the recommendations of Islam, are:\n\n Is that they consider a girl to be a woman the moment she has her first menstruation. SO, a ten year old, who is menstruating, is according to Islamic law a woman, and therefore it is not a child marriage - by their custom. So, when they say 'we are not for child marriages, and that a woman must decide' this is true. Unfortunately it is ignoring actual Islamic ideas of 'adulthood'\n I stated this before, but as per normal, you just ignore it. It's easier than to face the fact you're supporting a reprehensible practice.\n When in Islam is a girl a woman?\n Sura At-Talaaq\n 65:4\n \"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?ta...tabid=27&bid=65\n \"Thus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult.\"\n http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/Polemics/aishah.htm\n So, citing someone deploring 'child marriages' is you taking it in your own context, not theirs, ironically this is what you accuse me of doing. :) Thus, when you and I are talking about 'child brides' we both are thinking probably that a 9 year old is a child. Not in Islam, if she's menstruated.\n Thus\n \"Islam teaches that female puberty begins when the menses is started. From Bukhari, volume 3, Book of Witnesses, chapter 18, page 513: \"The boy attaining the age of puberty and the validity of their witness and the Statement of Allah: \"And when the children among you attain the age of puberty, then let them also ask for permission (to enter).\" Quran 24:59. Al Mughira said, \"I attained puberty at the age of twelve.\" The attaining of puberty by women is with the start of menses, as is referred to by the Statement of Allah: \"Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them prescribed period if you have any doubts (about their periods) is three months... [65:4] ...Al-Hasan bin Salih said, \"I saw a neighbouress of mine who became a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.\" [1] [1] The note for this reference says, \"This women attained puberty at the age of nine and married to give birth to a daughter at ten; the daughter had the same experience.\" My understanding of the above is that Islam considers that when a child \"attains\", or begins, \"puberty\", then he / she is considered an adult. Hence the validity of the witness. Muhammad followed a cultural norm in marrying and having sex with a young girl. After all, she was considered an adult. Not only did he do that, but he taught his followers to do as he did. Therefore is acceptable for Muslim men to marry and have intercourse with girls who have had their menarche. Muhammad established this cultural practice as a precedent in Islam. I add that there are other primitive cultures that allow girls to marry following their menarche. But that does not make it right or in the best interests of the child. Some cultures killed baby daughters for various reasons. Cultural norms do not make an action morally right\"\n http://www.exmuslim.com/com/puberty.htm\n In Jordan there is little public recognition of sexual exploitation, although there are laws regarding abduction which attempt to combat it. While this does not adequately protect children from sexual exploitation, a further concern is that the penalties differ in severity depending on the sex of the person abducted.\n http://www.ecpat.com/eng/CSEC/faq/faq7.asp\n Thus we need to know this when reading\n \"It is the duty of parents to arrange the marriage of their children when they come of age. The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has stressed that it should be taken seriously and with a full sense of responsibility. Abu Saeed Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas (R.A.) narrated that the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said \"Whoever is blessed by the Creator with children should give them good names, a good training, teach them good manners, and arrange for their marriage when they attain the age of puberty. If he does not pay due heed to it and fails to get them married, on reaching marriagable age (due to negligence) and they take to ways that are forbidden, the father will be held responsible for it.\"\n http://www.islam.tc/social_conduct/social_conduct_of_a_muslim.html\n Mizmaxx, it's called 'context'. Islam does not have a set age for 'puberty'. Puberty is, as shown, from when a girl menstruates. No matter what her age, she is then considered marriagable.\n Thus...\n \"Revealed: the child brides who are forced to marry in Britain\"\n http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/000972.php\n \"Pegging the Marriageable Age The most contentious issue arising from the contents of the 2003 Child Rights Act is the feasibility, or otherwise, of pegging the marriageable age for the female gender by the Government. This appears to offend the culture that prevails in many communities of Northern Nigeria under which young girls are married off at ages between 9 and 16 years. Upon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste).'\n http://allafrica.com/stories/200407200423.html\n (Note they try a Mizmaxx-argument - a straw-man; no one says that Muslims MUST be married at puberty, just that in Islam they can be - because they are following the example of Muhammad)\n \n \n I feel great pity for you that you are so hateful of Christianity that you have gone into so much effort to support a man who molested children. It is doing your soul absolutely no good to do this. It manifests itself in the way you are so willing to stifle debate with phantom sources... and even to present accounts that refute your earlier sources. It can not help you to be so hateful of everyone else... for even when you attack what you perceive to be evil examples of Christian behaviour - you ignore these when paralleled in your own culture. Thus they are either universally evil, or not.\n \n A final word from Muslims themselves...(from my previous post which Mizmaxx did not address for some reason)\n \"If a minor child is given away by her father or grandfather the marriage is binding on her. A girl is often virtually forced to marry an old man because he owns some land or can provide a large dowry. The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time. Even today Islam believes a girl is adult at the first signs of puberty.\"\n http://pnews.org/art/5art/MISOGYNY.shtml\n Muslims generally have a prohibition on images (of people, usually). So, what about dolls? This question was put to an expert site..\n Answer... it was deemed permissible because...\n \"The majority of scholars quote as evidence for this exemption the hadeeth of ?Aa?ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) in which she says: \n 'I used to play with dolls in the house of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I had friends who used to play with me. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came in, they would hide themselves, then he would call them to join me and play with me.'\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=e...e&QR=9473&dgn=4",

   "Jito,\n \n Or that they were one God in three persons existing for all eternity.\n \n Look at John 10:30-33.\n\n \n OK OK. Let me rephrase. I have seen the arguments and scriptures to back the arguments of those for and against the idea of a trinity. The arguments against have been more convicing, and quite frankly make more sense.\n \n \nIt sounds like you had a right to divorce. Your \"husband\" if you can apply that term to him did not live up to his marital promises and committments. The pope would tell you that.\n\n \n Yeah. That's what my reading of the Bible says, too. Not to mention the bastage cheated.\n \n \nYou make a direct correlation between how many babies your grandma had and how much your grandfather abused her. Did she ever tell you this or is it an assumption you are making? \n \n Are you saying that birth control will protect women from abuse and rape?\n\n \n No, no. The point was that she could not stop having babies. She was not allowed to do so, nor did she have legal grounds to tell her husband no (to sex).\n \n After my grandpa died she actually said that she would not take a million dollars for any one of her kids - but she would not pay one dime for another.\n \n Same with my mum. The issue wasn't the abuse. The issue was being able to say - \"no, this is my body and my life and I do not wish to have more children.\" Why do some men just squirm at the idea of women making reproductive decisions for themselves? We are not children.\n \n \nAnd what happens if/when you meet someone kind, exciting, compassionate, good enough that you want to share your entire self with him for the rest of your life?\n\n \n Don't believe it will happen. I really like being single. Autonomy is the best thing EVER. But even if it should - if this person wants to start a new family, we are not a good match.\n \n I do not want more children. I am absolutely positive of this. Maybe five years ago. \n \n But now? My son is nearly ten, I have BIG PLANS for both him and me that include world travel and education. I am saving for these things. I am excited about that future.\n \n More diapers, potty training, sleepless nights with new borns, outrageous child care costs just so I can work (or not working and losing my mid with boredom), no no NO nononono. I really, really REALLY know that I don't want more kids. Nope.\n \n \nYou shouldn't wait around for men to treat you better. You should demand it. \n\n \n Of course. But that don't mean you will get it. I opt instead to demand they leave me be (except as friends).\n \n \nI'm not sure contraception or sterilization is the best way to do that.\n\n \n It has nothing to do with getting men to treat me well. It's me taking control and doing what I want with my life and my body. It's all about me.\n \n \nStrange Occurence--that's another cool Christian band-they're kinda heavy though.\n \n \n Heavy how? In music or lyrical content? Fast or slow?\n \n \nWhy not?\n\n \n I dunno. Just seems so to me. Seems lonely. I think it may contribute to some of the abuses we have heard about. Maybe not. Just seems sad to me.\n \n And let me state - I do not harbor any negativity to the Catholic church regarding those abuses. That kind of abuse is everywhere - and in other churches, too. Just wanted you to know that, as I know it is a sesitive topic.",

Nevertheless, if one were to compare Hadith with, for instance, sources of other histories, it would easily surpass the reliability of the sources of other histories on all accounts. This is only due to the strenuous work done by the scholars of Hadith in this field of study.\"\n http://understanding-islam.org/rela...=319&sscatid=69\n \n C- The Haddiths provide the primary sources showing Aisha was nine when the relationship with Muhammad was consummated\n From Bukhari vol. 7, #65:\n \"Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: \"I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\" \n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah's Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine\". \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n (Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.)\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\" \n quoted at an anti-Islamic site...\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n BUT\n verifiable by checking\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx\n which is an Islamic site that gives Koranic Suras, and Haddiths.\n \n D(j)- Secondary Sources on Aisha's age from the same anti-Islamic site... \n FROM THE HISTORY OF TABARI\n (Tabari wrote the most authentic Islamic history. It covers 39 volumes. Tabari was one of the greatest Islamic scholars and the greatest Islamic Historian.)\n From Tabari, volume 7, page 7:\n \"....my marriage (to Muhammad) was consummated when I was nine.....\" \n From Tabari, volume 9, page 131\n \"Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me\"......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal. She was eighteen years old when he died.\n (I also want to provide evidence from the best Islamic Ency. available in English, and other Islamic writers. They also acknowledge Aisha's age being 9.)\n FROM THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF ISLAM, under \"Aisha\". (pub. by E.J. Brill). \n \"Some time after the death of Khadija, Khawla suggested to Muhammad that he should marry either Aisha, the 6 year old daughter of his chief follower, or Sawda Zama, a widow of about 30, who had gone as a Muslim to Abyssinia and whose husband had died there. Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both. It had already been agreed that Aisha should marry Djubayr Mutim, whose father, though still pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. By common consent, however, this agreement was set aside, and Muhammad was betrothed to Aisha.... The marriage was not consummated until some months after the Hidjra, (in April 623, 624). Aisha went to live in an apartment in Muhammad's house, later the mosque of Median. She cannot have been more than ten years old at the time and took her toys to her new home.\"\n From the Muslim book \"WOMEN IN ISLAM\" by Said Abjullah Seif-Al-Hatimy, published by Islamic Publications in Lahore Pakistan:\n \"...(Aisha) She was the youngest of his wives. It is said that she was nine years of age when he married her.\" \n also quoted at an anti-Islamic site...\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n BUT\n verifable by checking\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx\n which is an Islamic site that gives Koranic Suras, and Haddiths.\n \n D(ii)- Further secondary sources.... \n \"The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time.\"\n http://www.hraic.org/women_in_islam.html\n also at\n http://www.amcoptic.com/read_for_u/women_and_islam.htm\n \n Muhammad married her when she was six (or engaged to her), and actually took her into his household (and consummated the marriage) when she was nine. However he had told of him 'dreaming' about her when she was 4 or 5!\n Hadith Bukhari 5:58:235.\n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammad) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" \n Remember, that she was only a child. He is dreaming about a little girl who was six or under (because she was six at the age of betrothal).\n \n E- Expert advice\n (i) When is a girl considered in Islam to be a woman? \n Muslim experts cite that once a girl menstruates, she's marriageable. This is based on the Koran...\n When in Islam is a girl a woman?\n Sura At-Talaaq\n 65:4\n \"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?ta...tabid=27&bid=65\n \n \"Thus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult.\"\n http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/Polemics/aishah.htm\n \n \"Islam teaches that female puberty begins when the menses is started. From Bukhari, volume 3, Book of Witnesses, chapter 18, page 513: \"The boy attaining the age of puberty and the validity of their witness and the Statement of Allah: \"And when the children among you attain the age of puberty, then let them also ask for permission (to enter).\" Quran 24:59. Al Mughira said, \"I attained puberty at the age of twelve.\" The attaining of puberty by women is with the start of menses, as is referred to by the Statement of Allah: \"Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them prescribed period if you have any doubts (about their periods) is three months... [65:4] ...Al-Hasan bin Salih said, \"I saw a neighbouress of mine who became a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.\" [1] [1] The note for this reference says, \"This women attained puberty at the age of nine and married to give birth to a daughter at ten; the daughter had the same experience.\" My understanding of the above is that Islam considers that when a child \"attains\", or begins, \"puberty\", then he / she is considered an adult. Hence the validity of the witness. Muhammad followed a cultural norm in marrying and having sex with a young girl. After all, she was considered an adult. Not only did he do that, but he taught his followers to do as he did. Therefore is acceptable for Muslim men to marry and have intercourse with girls who have had their menarche. Muhammad established this cultural practice as a precedent in Islam. I add that there are other primitive cultures that allow girls to marry following their menarche. But that does not make it right or in the best interests of the child. Some cultures killed baby daughters for various reasons. Cultural norms do not make an action morally right\"\n http://www.exmuslim.com/com/puberty.htm\n (this is an anti-Muslim site)\n \n E(ii) Actual advice to Muslims by Islamic centres of advice... \n \"According to the Shari'ah, if a girl is a minor (did not attain puberty), she may be given in marriage by her father. When she attains puberty, she has the right to maintain the marriage or discontinue the marriage. There is no age limit to be intimate with one's wife even if she is a minor. \n It is important for you, in your situation, to consider the age difference reservation expressed by your wife. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best \n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\"\n http://islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6737\n \n Here's some more good Islamic advice...\n The Appropriate Age for Marriage\n Question: What is the appropriate age for men and women to marry? Some of the young ladies of today do not accept to be married to men older than them and also some of the men do not get married from anyone older than them either. We hope for a response, may Allah reward you.\n Response: I advise the young ladies not to refuse a man because of his older age. Even if he be ten, twenty or thirty years older, this is not a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) married Aisha when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old. Older age is not harmful. \n http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/articl...rriage.html#age\n \n \"It is the duty of parents to arrange the marriage of their children when they come of age. The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has stressed that it should be taken seriously and with a full sense of responsibility. Abu Saeed Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas (R.A.) narrated that the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said \"Whoever is blessed by the Creator with children should give them good names, a good training, teach them good manners, and arrange for their marriage when they attain the age of puberty.  If he does not pay due heed to it and fails to get them married, on reaching marriageable age (due to negligence) and they take to ways that are forbidden, the father will be held responsible for it.\"\n http://www.islam.tc/social_conduct/social_conduct_of_a_muslim.html\n \n Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems...\n Q). I have a nine year-old girl who is married to a person at the age of 20. The marriage contract was made a year ago but the girl is refusing to live with her husband or even to look at him. In addition to that she requires him to divorce her. Could you please advise me what to do? Should I separate them or force my daughter to live with him?\n (Name and address withheld) \n A). It is certainly possible for a father to get his daughter married to someone who he thinks is suitable for her. Whether he should force her into any marriage is something totally different Let me relate this to you: A woman companion of the Prophet came to him and said: \"My father has married me away to one of his relatives without asking my opinion. I do not wish to stay with this man as his wife.\" The Prophet ordered their separation. When she realized that she was free and that she was no longer married to the man, she said to the Prophet: \"I now accept what my father has done and I am marrying this man. I only did this so that women may know that it is not up to men to marry them away against their wishes.\"\n Scholars have discussed at length the marriage of a young girl who has not attained puberty and whether her father may marry her away without her permission. If such a marriage takes place it is valid.   However, it is perhaps best if the marriage is not allowed to be consummated until the girl attains puberty, when she is given the choice whether to continue with this marriage or not. Moreover her father may not marry her away to someone who is of a lesser status than hers. If he does and she objects, the marriage is not valid. Generally speaking, however. a girl must be asked to express her opinion in any proposed marriage. If she has been married before, then her verbal consent should be requested. If she has not been married previously, then her consent is also to be requested, but if she keeps quiet, her silence is taken as approval.\n To say that the marriage is valid is not to say that people should go ahead and make such marriages. There may be certain circumstances, which make it desirable or advisable that a very young girl should be married away in this manner but this must not be taken as the normal situation. In marriage, the normal thing is that people should marry when they are of marriageable age. That does not include girls of nine or ten years of age, although some girls may attain puberty that early. Marriage involves certain responsibilities and a very young girl could not be expected to shoulder these. There are also other problems, which the may face, as she grows older. If things go wrong with her marriage, she will always blame her father for having messed up her life, well intentioned though he may be. If you take the example of your own daughter, and you force her to go and live with her husband despite her protestations, you will never be sure whether the marriage will work out well or not. If it does, then well and good. But there is an equal chance that problems may arise especially with your daughter behaving like the child she is. While her husband expects from her the attitude of a married woman. How could you expect her to overcome the feeling that she has been thrown into this situation without being allowed the slightest say in the whole matter which is to affect the rest of her life?\n \n As we see it, your choice is either to get her divorced now, before the marriage is consummated or to keep her with you until she has attained puberty and she is in a position to express her opinion about this marriage. If she still objects to it, then you divorce her without any compulsion to go through with it. If, on the other hand, if she approves of this marriage, at that time, then you go ahead with it. Perhaps it is better for you to consult with the young man to whom you have already married her. He should be understanding and accommodating. Between the two of you should work out the best solution which ensures that he is not lumbered with marriage which is forced on a young girl who cannot be expected to give an opinion about such a matter.\n http://www.islamicvoice.com/august.98/marriage.htm#EAR\n \n This is why there was a dispute about having a mandatory age for consent recently in Nigeria...\n \"Pegging the Marriageable Age The most contentious issue arising from the contents of the 2003 Child Rights Act is the feasibility, or otherwise, of pegging the marriageable age for the female gender by the Government. This appears to offend the culture that prevails in many communities of Northern Nigeria under which young girls are married off at ages between 9 and 16 years. Upon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste).'\n http://allafrica.com/stories/200407200423.html\n \n F.

Every social grouping in the world has specific traditional cultural practices and beliefs, some of which are beneficial to all members, while others are harmful to a specific group, such as women. These harmful traditional practices include female genital mutilation (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price. Despite their harmful nature and their violation of international human rights laws, such practices persist because they are not questioned and take on an aura of morality in the eyes of those practising them.\"\n http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs23.htm\n Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children\n \"Child marriage robs a girl of her childhood-time necessary to develop physically, emotionally and psychologically. In fact, early marriage inflicts great emotional stress as the young woman is removed from her parents' home to that of her husband and in-laws. Her husband, who will invariably be many years her senior, will have little in common with a young teenager. It is with this strange man that she has to develop an intimate emotional and physical relationship. She is obliged to have intercourse, although physically she might not be fully developed.\"\n (Ibid)\n \n \"Research interest in the long-term effects of sexual contact between female children and adults has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Two sets of issues have driven this enhanced attention. The first concerns the nature and extent of the impact these experiences have on subsequent well-being in adulthood. Empirical research has offered evidence of the severe and wide ranging effects of adult-child sex by documenting its associations with a host of later \"symptoms,\" such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.\"\n \"Sexual contact between children and adults: A life course perspective.\"\n Browning, Christopher R; Laumann, Edward O \n Citation: American Sociological Review, v62n4, pp.540-560, Aug 1997 \n Number: 03374356 Features: Table; Illustration; References \n Copyright: American Sociological Association 1997 \n quoted at http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n Conclusion:\n Not all Muslims will marry young girls. That is not at all the point if this argument of mine. Muhammad had nine (some say eleven wives). Muhammad by his example showed his followers just exactly what type of wives they can have. For instance, Muhammad married a Jewess, and he also married a Christian (Mary, the Copt). He married a widow, and also a woman older than himself. Similarly, consulting an Islamic site for advice, you will find that it is permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Christian woman. Not all Mohammedans will marry Christian women.\n \n However, Muslims are, by following Muhammad?s example, permitted to marry girls as young as nine years old. This is, quite clearly a deplorable situation and should be condemned. Those men that marry such girls are doing so BECAUSE of their religion. Therefore there is something deplorable with such a belief system that allows for such actions.",

   "Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems...\n\n All you have shown is that this is the opinion of some Muslims, who use the Hadiths as an excuse. \n \n \nI have shown consistent proofs regarding\n (...)\n -the place of the Haddiths, in Islamic thought\n\n Yes, well, your interpretation of the sources you had as \"universal\" turned out to be wrong.\n \n \nYour 'experts' is one woman who believes Islam isn't as chauvinistic as people believe - which in fact refutes your idea about the sexism in Islam, \n\n No, it doesn't.\n \n \nand also a few sites that suggests that Muhammad wasn't really having sex with an under-age girl, because it is impossible for a great man like him to do such a thing. \n\n er, as well as the tiny issue of all the evidence of inconsistency in relating Aisha's age from the Hadiths. Nice try, though. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nFurther, your pathetic attempt to back pedal fails too because a vast majority of Catholics revere the Pope. So, calling him a good for nothing ****-head - I mean seriously Mizmaxx, are you trying to convey this as something less than a major assault on Catholics everywhere. \n\n Not all Catholics accept the present Pope. \n \n \nAs to Muhammad actually sleeping with her when she was nine, again, a majority of sources have agreed for a majority of time.\n\n Argumentum ad antiquitatem. A majority is not an entirety, and does not necessarily define a religion.\n \n \nYou then introduce a vacuous argument about the Haddith based on yet another boring straw-man.\n\n Do you think maybe if you say \"straw-man\" enough times, nobody else will notice that you haven't proven your assertion? Or do you just not bother to read the posts, but then get all huffy because you don't understnd them?\n \n The claim that Aisha was nine yrs old when she first had sex with Muhammad is from the Haddiths. Since not everyone considers the Hadiths word-for-word accurate, not everyone has to believe that this was true. Especially given the inconsistencies.\n \n \nYou don't do me the courtesy of citing your sources. I've mentioned this in the last post. You are curbing a free debate by not showing me where on the net you got your information from. \n\n You are being ridiculous. Last time you whined about sources I had posted the source. You see, montalban, on the internet, when some letters are higlighted (often underligned and blue) this is usually an indication that if you click (with your mouse) on the word, it will bring you to a web site. This is called a link.\n \n \nYour site simply repeats what you've already stated before - and I questioned this before, so re-stating it, without answering my question is a bit weird. That is, where is this 'generally accepted'? (I asked this in post #127)\n\n Where is what \"generally accepted\"?\n \n \nTaken by themselves, you would be correct. We aren't taking them by themselves, because the sources state she was 9 at the time, you just simply ignore that. \n\n In some places it is stated that she was 9 at the time she started to live with Muhammad, and other statements contradict. So, the record is inconsistent as to her age.\n \n \nI guess you believe that they speak for the majority of Muslims... and all the rest, the remaining 90% are fundamentalists :)\n\n Do you have statistics on the percentage of Muslims that support child marriages? Furthermore, do you wish to claim that the majority of participants in a religion at any given time are what defines that religion per se?\n \n \nOne other thing you simply have failed to realise (...) Is that they consider a girl to be a woman the moment she has her first menstruation.\n\n This is ridiculous. Again and again, who are \"they\"? The majority of Muslims, or the Muslims who made the website you quote? Does that even matter? What proof do you have that simple majority at any given time defines a religion? \n \n \nTherefore is acceptable for Muslim men to marry and have intercourse with girls who have had their menarche. Muhammad established this cultural practice as a precedent in Islam. I add that there are other primitive cultures that allow girls to marry following their menarche. \n\n This is ridiculous, again. The problem of having your child marry an adult is the difference in age. If a 13 yr old girl wants to \"marry\" a person around her age, that is not the same thing as a parent having their child marry a 50 yr old man. As Islamic law states, it is up to the girl whether she wants to be married or not. So, if a teenage girl wants to marry, she can, but if she doesn't want to, she is not supposed to be forced to. The passage you quoted above is a particular man's interpretation of Muslim law- he is trying to convince younger women to marry older men. If such women were to be forced to, they would not have to be \"convinced\". Regardless, his opinion, or that of any other number of \"experts\", does not prove that child marriage is a necessary part of Islam.\n \n Thus, from your own quote\n \nUpon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste).\n\n \n This is strange-\n \nno one says that Muslims MUST be married at puberty, just that in Islam they can be - because they are following the example of Muhammad)\n\n So, even though child marriage, as you attest, is not a necessary part of Islam, and even though Aisha's age is written inconsistently in the Hadiths, you continue to claim (through some logic of your own) that Islam itself is \"bad\".\n \n \nHowever, Muslims are, by following Muhammad?s example, permitted to marry girls as young as nine years old.\n\n According to some people....\n \n \nThis is, quite clearly a deplorable situation and should be condemned. \n\n As it is by many Muslims.\n \n \nThose men that marry such girls are doing so BECAUSE of their religion.\n\n So they say, as did the medieval crusaders.\n \n \nTherefore there is something deplorable with such a belief system that allows for such actions.\n\n Yes, but not the entire religion.",

   "Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems... \n\n \nAll you have shown is that this is the opinion of some Muslims, who use the Hadiths as an excuse. \n\n Not quite. I've shown that the majority of Muslims respect the Hadith. It was your intent to show that this was false, and instead you actually provided one source that agrees with my stance (see below). Therefore you've attempting another flawed argument, to denigrate the status of the Hadith in order to lessen it's impact on this debate - and so far you've merely shown your lack of knowledge of Islam in doing so.\n Further, I've shown several different sites which are expert sites that Muslims write to in order to gain advice - and I'm restricted here to those that write in English - and yet I'm still able to show many sites.\n You made a statement about the Hadiths, and you've been shown to be woefully lacking. And in fact, you're providing evidences for a question I've never asked...\n One of your sites asks...\n Title: Is Hadith an Independent Source of Religion...\n http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=329&sscatid=69\n No where have I claimed that the Haddiths are independent. You use this source to prove that Muslims (or some of them) don't rely on the Haddiths. They don't rely entirely on the Haddiths - as I've said - when compared to the Koran. However, this is entirely different from them saying that the Haddiths are so unreliable that they've scrapped them... as you suggest. You argue that the Haddiths are so inaccurate in relation to Aisha's age, that they can't be relied upon. No where does this article of yours suggest that!\n Here's another of your sites which you obviously didn't read.\n \"The point is not that Hadith is an unreliable source of information. On the contrary, Hadith lacks the level of reliability which is entailed in the basic sources of the Shari`ah. In other words, it is only when compared to the Qur'an and the Sunnah that Hadith seems wanting in reliability. Nevertheless, if one were to compare Hadith with, for instance, sources of other histories, it would easily surpass the reliability of the sources of other histories on all accounts. This is only due to the strenuous work done by the scholars of Hadith in this field of study.\"\n http://understanding-islam.org/rela...=319&sscatid=69\n And this supports your ideas of the Hadith, how?\n Not only are the Hadith important...\n \"Sunnah or Hadith is the second source from which the teachings of Islam are drawn\"\n http://www.islaam.com/Article.aspx?id=232\n But the most respected of Hadith are...\n \"A hadith is a saying of Muhammad or a report about something he did. Over time, during the first few centuries of Islam, it became obvious that many so-called hadith were in fact spurious sayings that had been fabricated for various motives, at best to encourage believers to act righteously and at worse to corrupt believers' understanding of Islam and to lead them astray. Since Islamic legal scholars were utilizing hadith as an adjunct to the Qur'an in their development of the Islamic legal system, it became critically important to have reliable collections of hadith. While the early collections of hadith often contained hadith that were of questionable origin, gradually collections of authenticated hadith called sahih (lit. true, correct) were compiled. Such collections were made possible by the development of the science of hadith criticism, a science at the basis of which was a critical analysis of the chain of (oral) transmission (isnad) of the hadith going all the way back to Muhammad. The two most highly respected collections of hadith are the authenticated collections the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. (Sahih literally means \"correct, true, valid, or sound.\") In addition to these, four other collections came to be well-respected, although not to the degree of Bukhari and Muslim's sahih collections. These four other collections are the Sunan of Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Abu Da'ud. Together these four and the two sahih collections are called the \"six books\" (al-kutub al-sitta). Two other important collections, in particular, are the Muwatta of Ibn Malik, the founder of the Maliki school of law, and the Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school of law.\"\n http://www.uga.edu/islam/hadith.html\n Of all the collectors of hadith, al-Bukhari and Muslim were greatly admired because of their tireless attempt to collect sahih hadith only.\n http://www.islaam.net/main/display.php?part=full&category=6&id=191\n Note that the Bukhari Hadith is one of the most respected - think about that when you read the following...\n From Bukhari vol. 7, #65:\n \"Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: \"I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\"\n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah's Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine. \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n (Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.)\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\"\n Thus the Bukhari Hadith, then the Shaih Muslim, then the Abu Dawud Hadith, are, in that order the most respected Hadiths.\n \nI have shown consistent proofs regarding\n (...)\n -the place of the Haddiths, in Islamic thought \n\n \nYes, well, your interpretation of the sources you had as \"universal\" turned out to be wrong.\n\n Again you think your argument stands because of exceptions. The few sites you've actually presented, even taking away those that actually support my stance simply state that the Haddiths have errors - not that they're not relied upon.\n \nYour 'experts' is one woman who believes Islam isn't as chauvinistic as people believe - which in fact refutes your idea about the sexism in Islam, \n\n \nNo, it doesn't.\n\n Yes, it does. It states that Islam is an egalitarian and anti-sexist religion that's been hijacked by a few rogue elements. Or, are you now claiming that Islam is inherently sexist? You need to make up your mind.\n \n and also a few sites that suggests that Muhammad wasn't really having sex with an under-age girl, because it is impossible for a great man like him to do such a thing. \n\n \ner, as well as the tiny issue of all the evidence of inconsistency in relating Aisha's age from the Hadiths. Nice try, though.\n\n You present a number of 'sources'. Some of these aren't even referenced. And some of those that are referenced aren't on-line for me to check. Those that are on-line have stated that Tabari is unreliable as a historical source.\n Two others merely make a generalised allegation that according to some general story about when one book was revealed - we can't be certain about her age. Now, for the third time I ask you, what story is this based on? You've yet to answer this.\n \n Further, your pathetic attempt to back pedal fails too because a vast majority of Catholics revere the Pope. So, calling him a good for nothing ****-head \n\n \nMizmaxx, are you trying to convey this as something less than a major assault on Catholics everywhere.\n \n \nNot all Catholics accept the present Pope. \n\n Yawn. The majority do respect the Pope. That's one of the things about being 'Catholic.' I don't know why you keep feeling the need to make exceptions the rule.\n They call him the Vicar of Christ.\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm\n \"WHAT IS A CATHOLIC?\n Rosemary Esmay has started an interesting discussion, the essence of which is whether one can simultaneously be a Catholic and yet pick and choose the tenets of its beliefs that you wish to adhere to. I take the \"no\" position on this one.\n The essential element of Roman Catholicism, it seems to me, is the claim to unbroken apostolic succession of the Pope as the Vicar of Christ. If you believe the pontiff is the infallible interpreter of God's word on this Earth then you're Catholic. If you think he's a nice old man in a funny hat who renders judgments from which you can pick and choose as if in a cafeteria, you are not Catholic. By this definition, the vast majority of American \"Catholics\" aren't Catholics. \"\n http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/002902.html\n Your continual dishonest back-pedalling is amazing. You should have nipped this in the bud earlier, to state that you didn't mean to call their most revered spiritual leader a *****-head. And yet you go to enormous lengths to defend a man who slept with a child. Shows your own character.\n \nAs to Muhammad actually sleeping with her when she was nine, again, a majority of sources have agreed for a majority of time. \n\n \nArgumentum ad antiquitatem. A majority is not an entirety, and does not necessarily define a religion.\n\n So what? What is your point? My argument is that Muhammad is a bad example, and when people follow his bad example it is because of religion, not in spite of it.\n \nYou then introduce a vacuous argument about the Hadith based on yet another boring straw-man.\n\n \nDo you think maybe if you say \"straw-man\" enough times, nobody else will notice that you haven't proven your assertion? Or do you just not bother to read the posts, but then get all huffy because you don't understand them?\n\n Do you think just saying 'no you haven't does the same thing - when regards to my claims I've cited evidence. So far you've been quite consistent in re-creating my arguments - and even your own quotes about the Catholic church.\n \n The claim that Aisha was nine yrs old when she first had sex with Muhammad is from the Haddiths. Since not everyone considers the Hadiths word-for-word accurate, not everyone has to believe that this was true. Especially given the inconsistencies.\n\n Simple re-working now of Islamic thought.\n a) Muslims regard the Haddiths - regardless of any inconsistencies as second in authority only to the Koran... even one of your own sites did this.\n b) a majority of Muslims regard the Haddiths, in relation to Aisha's age as authoritative. I've cited several Muslim web-sites giving Islamic rulings on this. I've also shown that your 'more liberal' interpretations are only very recent - and only in the west - as the majority of Muslims live not in the west, your more recent interpretation is not just limited in time, but also in space. Yet you seem to believe that because you know a few that proves the many.\n Here's some of your sources on Hadith which you've not read properly.\n \"Hadith should also be tested on the grounds that it should not be contrary to:\n The Qur'an;\n The Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh); and\n The established and acknowledged facts.\"\n http://understanding-islam.org/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=329&sscatid=69\n Does this say reject the Haddiths? No! Look at the second 'test' - the Sunnah of the Prophet - that is, the sayings and doings of the Prophet - and where do we get these from? The Hadith!\n [quote=Montalban]Your site simply repeats what you've already stated before - and I questioned this before, so re-stating it, without answering my question is a bit weird. That is, where is this 'generally accepted'? (I asked this in post #127) \n \nWhere is what \"generally accepted\"?\n\n In case you really have missed it...\n \n\n EVIDENCE #6: Surat al-Qamar (The Moon)\n According to the generally accepted tradition,...blah blah\n\n Three times I've asked you about this, and you're only response is 'where is what 'generally accepted'?\n I want you to point out where this 'generally accepted' theory is. I don't accept you giving an un-referenced source about an un-known source.\n \nTaken by themselves, you would be correct. We aren't taking them by themselves, because the sources state she was 9 at the time, you just simply ignore that.\n\n \nIn some places it is stated that she was 9 at the time she started to live with Muhammad, and other statements contradict. So, the record is inconsistent as to her age.\n\n That's not true at all. She was 'taken into his household' at the age of nine is one way of putting what happened, that the marriage was 'consummated when she was nine is another. They are not exclusive statements at all.\n \nI guess you believe that they speak for the majority of Muslims... and all the rest, the remaining 90% are fundamentalists \n\n \nDo you have statistics on the percentage of Muslims that support child marriages? Furthermore, do you wish to claim that the majority of participants in a religion at any given time are what defines that religion per se?\n\n What a phoney argument. I have never said that the majority of Muslims support sleeping with children. However, you've described any Muslims who are sexist, as fundamentalists!\n \nOne other thing you simply have failed to realise (...) Is that they consider a girl to be a woman the moment she has her first menstruation. \n \n \nThis is ridiculous. Again and again, who are \"they\"? The majority of Muslims, or the Muslims who made the website you quote? Does that even matter? What proof do you have that simple majority at any given time defines a religion? \n\n I have an idea that you don't read my argument, but just skim through it. I've posted Islamic idea on when a girl becomes a woman.\n \nTherefore is acceptable for Muslim men to marry and have intercourse with girls who have had their menarche. Muhammad established this cultural practice as a precedent in Islam. I add that there are other primitive cultures that allow girls to marry following their menarche.\n\n \nThis is ridiculous, again. The problem of having your child marry an adult is the difference in age. If a 13 yr old girl wants to \"marry\" a person around her age, that is not the same thing as a parent having their child marry a 50 yr old man. As Islamic law states, it is up to the girl whether she wants to be married or not. So, if a teenage girl wants to marry, she can, but if she doesn't want to, she is not supposed to be forced to. The passage you quoted above is a particular man's interpretation of Muslim law- he is trying to convince younger women to marry older men. If such women were to be forced to, they would not have to be \"convinced\". Regardless, his opinion, or that of any other number of \"experts\", does not prove that child marriage is a necessary part of Islam.\n\n False argument again.\n a) we're talking about a nine year old. How does a nine year old girl determined what is right for her with regards marriage\n b) when she was nine, he, Muhammad was in his mid to late 40s\n c) Islam calls for her consent because they deem that once she's menstruated, she's a woman... so see a) how does a nine year old determined whom she should marry?\n \nThus, from your own quote\n Upon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste). \n\n That's a straw-man you introduce here. Never have I stated that Islam determines that a nine year old must be married. However, they do allow a marriage of a nine year old girl... So, I want you to tell the world how a nine year old can determine whom she should marry?\n \nno one says that Muslims MUST be married at puberty, just that in Islam they can be - because they are following the example of Muhammad) \n\n \nSo, even though child marriage, as you attest, is not a necessary part of Islam, and even though Aisha's age is written inconsistently in the Hadiths, you continue to claim (through some logic of your own) that Islam itself is \"bad\".\n\n This is your straw-man. I never said that Islam makes it compulsory for a nine year old to marry, I said that it allows for a nine year old to marry. I think this is child abuse - you don't. Muhammad married as many as 11 brides. Each one is an 'example' to Moslems on the types of brides a Moslem may have. He married an older woman, a Christian (Mary the Copt), a Jewess, a widow, a nine year old girl. Not all Muslims will, by any rationale marry a Christian. However, it is allowed, because Muhammad set the example. Thus a Muslim can marry someone the moment she is marriageable - as young as nine. This is wrong.\n \nHowever, Muslims are, by following Muhammad's example, permitted to marry girls as young as nine years old.\n\n \nAccording to some people....\n\n Yawn. This is what you'll keep going on with forever. No matter how many Muslim sites I cite.\n \nThis is, quite clearly a deplorable situation and should be condemned. \n\n \nAs it is by many Muslims.\n\n Another straw-man! Yikes! Don't you get tired of doing this? I have stated that there are many good Muslims, this is probably the eighth time on this thread alone, but just ignore that. I have stated that when they do a deplorable thing, like marry an under-age girl, it's because they're allowed to by Islam, therefore Islam is deplorable.\n \nThose men that marry such girls are doing so BECAUSE of their religion. \n\n \nSo they say, as did the medieval crusaders.\n\n AH, now you change to a relativist argument. Show me Christ's teachings that lead to a crusade.\n \n Therefore there is something deplorable with such a belief system that allows for such actions. \n\n \nYes, but not the entire religion.\n\n We've already established that they believe Muhammad is the ideal man. Not all Muslims will marry under-age girls, not all will marry Christians. Some will actually marry a woman out of love and mutual respect.\n \n Considering that your own sites show that Muslims value the Hadith (except one by some American apologist) you're just going to continue to argue - no matter how many sites I cite, that they don't speak for the majority. It's a rather lazy way to debate.\n \n I expect also you to re-work my argument again in straw-man style... and ignore that I've pointed out the hatred you display for Catholicism.",

   "\"Islam And the Age of Puberty\n Islam clearly teaches that adulthood starts when a person have attained puberty.\"\n http://www.alinaam.org.za/social/myaaisha.htm\n (this whole site is an argument in defence of Muhammad - giving relativist arguments)\n \n \"Bul\u00fbgh [Puberty]\n GENERAL DEFINITIONS:\n Throughout the booklet we have used the word ?MAS?ALA? which means the proposition or an explanation or an answer to expected Questions.\n MAS'ALA 1\n According to Shar\u00ee?ah when a person attains puberty he/she is said to have become B\u00e2ligh. No girl becomes B\u00e2ligh before the age of nine years. NB. Only lunar months and years are taken into consideration in Isl\u00e2mic matters, therefore, only lunar months and years are meant wherever these words appear in this booklet.\n MAS'ALA 2\n A girl is said to be B\u00e2ligh [matured] if she experiences any of the following:\n The monthly Period (Haiz - Menstruation) after the are of nine years.\n She enjoys intercourse in her dream and the mani [seminal fluid] is discharged.\n She has no menstruation, but becomes pregnant.\n MAS'ALA 3\n If the above signs are not evident but the girl reaches the age of fifteen years, she will also be regarded as having reached the age of puberty.\n MAS'ALA 4\n On reaching the age of puberty, all the principles of Isl\u00e2m, such as sal\u00e2h [nam\u00e2z], saum [roza], etc. become Fardh [obligatory] on her. If she disobeys or neglects any, then she becomes a sinner.\n MAS'ALA 5\n If a girl attains puberty before the age of fifteen and experiences ihtil\u00e2m [nocturnal wet dream] it would become w\u00e2jib [obligatory] upon her to have ghusl [bath].\"\n http://www.islamsa.org.za/library/hadiyatul_nisa.html\n \n \"Of the four ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in Sah\u00eeh al-Bukhari, two were narrated from cAishah (7:64 and 7:65), one from Ab\u00fb Hish\u00e2m (5:236) and one via 'Ursa (7:88). All three of the ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in Sah\u00eeh Muslim have cAishah as a narrator. Additionally, all of the ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in both books agree that the marriage betrothal contract took place when cAishah was \"six years old\", but was not consummated until she was \"nine years old\". Additionally, a had\u00eeth with the same text (matn) is reported in Sunan Ab\u00fb D\u00e2w\u00fbd. Needless to say, this evidence is - Islamically speaking - overwhelmingly strong and Muslims who deny it do so only by sacrificing their intellectual honesty, pure faith or both.\n This evidence having been established, there doesn't seem much room for debate about cAishah's age amongst believing Muslims. Until someone proves that in the Arabic language \"nine years old\" means something other than \"nine years old\", then we should all be firm in our belief that she was \"nine years old\" (as if there's a reason or need to believe otherwise!?!). In spite of these facts, there are still some Muslim authors that have somehow (?) managed to push cAishah's age out to as far as \"fourteen or fifteen years old\" at the time of her marriage to the Prophet(P). It should come as no surprise, however, that none of them ever offer any proof, evidence or references for their opinions. This can be said with the utmost confidence, since certainly none of them can produce sources more authentic than the had\u00eeth collections of Im\u00e2ms al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee and Muslim! Based on the research that I've done, I feel that there is a common source for those who claim that cAishah's age was \"fourteen or fifteen years old\" at the time of the marriage. This source is The Biographies of Prominent Muslims which is published in book form, on CD-ROM and is posted in several places on the Internet. Just another example of why going to the sources is important . . .\"\n http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Polemics/aishah.html\n (We concur with the general contents of the article. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6618)\n \n Action Items for the uttaqun: \n Single Muslims should have intentions to marry as soon as Islamically permissible and a suitable candidate for marriage is available. \n For a female, it is permissible to marry at any time near puberty. \n For a man, he is ordered to marry after puberty once he has established a means to support a family. \n It is recommended (in order to avoid being jailed) to not marry until old enough according to the laws in the land they live, but it is Islamically permissible before that.

Even the prophet himself was unable to do so. He cherished and worshipped his youngest wife Aiesha (his six-year old bride) more than the others. The institution of marriage of one man and multiple women is what was described by Ayatollah Ghomi, \"A rooster satisfies several hens, an stallion several mares. A woman is unavailable during certain periods where as a man is always active....\", LE MONDE, January 20, 1979. Therefore in Islam a man is nothing more than an animal slaved to his sexual needs. His function is to impregnate a multitude of women in order to expand the faith of Islam. No wonder Islam is so proud of men such as Mulla Omar, Khomeini, Usama Bin Laden and so on.\n I have come to the conclusion that the institution of marriage in Islam is nothing but a whorehouse for the man and a jailhouse for the woman.\"\n Parvin Darabi\n She was the first Iranian who was ever able to pass the board in Child-Psychiatry in U.S. and was the one who established the Psychiatric Clinic of Shahid Sahami in Tehran.\n http://members.aol.com/ahreemanxiii/page21.html\n \n Question: Is it possible to have intercourse with girls before puberty, would not this physically and mentally harmful to the girl. Is such a thing permissible in Islam, and if it is permissible then what is the minimum age for marriage execution in Islam, since puberty is not a requirement.\n Answer: In The Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. \n All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. \n Jurists discussed the issue of marrying a girl before puberty, i.e. a girl who might not be able to have sexual intercourse due to her young age. \n They agreed that the Wali can marry a girl before puberty. But when she reaches puberty, she has the right to choose either to nullify the marriage contract or to continue her marital life. \n Also, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, married `Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, before she reached the age of puberty. \n Hence, we conclude that puberty is not a condition for executing marriage. The only condition is the wife?s ability to bear responsibilities of marital life. However, we do not recommend marriage before puberty because at that early age the girl can?t fulfil her obligations towards her husband properly, nor can she know her rights towards him. \n Thus, to avoid any negligence or liability on her part we do not recommend marriage at such an early age. \n Allah Almighty knows best.\n Dr. Su`aad Ibrahim Salih\n http://www.islam-online.net/livefatwa/english/Browse.asp?hGuestID=YFCeOS\n (NOTE: When they say she can't bear her responsibilities, they mean she's probably unable to cook and clean for him)\n \n The appropriate age for marriage\n \n Question: What is the appropriate age for men and women to marry? Some of the young ladies of today do not accept to be married to men older than them and also some of the men do not get married from anyone older than them either. We hope for a response, may Allaah reward you.\n Response:... The Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) married ?Aa.ishah when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old. Older age is not harmful. There is no problem if the woman is older than the man and there is no problem if the man is older than the woman.\n http://www.fatwa-online.com/fataawa/marriage/interview/9991018_20.htm",

   "Post 131 Mizmaxx posted a T O Shanavas' explanation of Muhammad. How 'Islamic' is it?\n \nThe Ancient Myth Exposed by T.O. Shanavas\n\n There are two (consistent) problems with the claims made herein by Mizmaxx's western-orientated Muslim apologist. The first problem with most of these claims is that they are based on the 'commentaries' of Muslims on the Hadiths. Not the Hadiths themselves. The Hadiths are a source for the age of Aisha, and they agree about her age. Therefore, in weighing up who to believe, most Muslims will bow to the Hadith, over tradition. It seems T O Shanavas is unaware of this, and by extension, Mizmaxx has repeated his mistake.\n The second problem deals with the actual concept of when a girl becomes a woman, wherein this apologist actually applies western values to dating a girls age. He uses the wrong measure.\n Claim:\n \nThe Prophet was an exemplary man. All his actions were most virtuous so that we, Muslims, can emulate them. However, most people in our Islamic Center of Toledo, including me, would not think of betrothing our seven years daughter to a fifty-two year-old man. If a parent agrees to such a wedding, most people, if not all, would look down upon the father and the old husband.\n However, my long pursuit in search of the truth on this matter proved my intuition correct. My Prophet was a gentleman. And he did not marry an innocent seven or nine year old girl. The age of Ayesha has been erroneously reported in the hadith literature. Furthermore, I think that the narratives reporting this event are highly unreliable. Some of the hadith regarding Ayesha's age at the time of her wedding with prophet are problematic. I present the following evidences against the acceptance of the fictitious story by Hisham ibn Urwah and to clear the name of my Prophet as an irresponsible old man preying on an innocent little girl.\n\n Problem:\n The Hadith are so widely accepted by Moslems that they are deemed second in importance ONLY to the Koran (which they believe to be the word of their god). \n Claim:\n \n\n EVIDENCE #1: Reliability of Source\n Most of the narratives printed in the books of hadith are reported only by Hisham ibn `Urwah, who was reporting on the authority of his father. First of all, more people than just one, two or three should logically have reported. It is strange that no one from Medina, where Hisham ibn `Urwah lived the first 71 years of his life narrated the event, despite the fact that his Medinan pupils included the well- respected Malik ibn Anas. The origins of the report of the narratives of this event are people from Iraq, where Hisham is reported to have shifted after living in Medina for most of his life.\n\n Problem:\n We're not looking at the narratives of the Hadith, but the Hadith themselves. The Hadith were collections of sayings of Muhammad and his followers. They were compiled by Islamic scholars, who tested them for accuracy. They were formed into collections such as Hadith Bukhari. Some later Islamic scholars made commentary on them, and it is these that they base their objections upon.\n There's a whole notion in Islam called the 'science of Hadith' where-by certain Hadith are more accepted BECAUSE of the sources. Mizmaxx's argument is that the problem is not with the Hadith itself, but with someone's commentary on the Hadith! This lessens her proofs greatly, for all she is showing is that the commentators, Ibn Hajar et al, are unreliable. NOT the Hadith, which as shown, are widely accepted by Moslems.\n Consult:\n Outlines of the Development of the Science of Hadith \n Dr. Mustafa Awliya'i\n http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/hadith-science/\n OR\n An Introduction to the Science of Hadith\n Suhaib Hassan, Al-Quran Society, London\n http://www.ymofmd.com/hadith/Intro_Science_Hadith/\n also at\n http://www.islamworld.net/hadith.html\n It is an important part of Islam that their own holy books are authentic - naturally enough.\n Claim:\n \n\n EVIDENCE #2: The Betrothal\n According to Tabari (also according to Hisham ibn `Urwah, Ibn Hunbal and Ibn Sad), Ayesha was betrothed at seven years of age and began to cohabit with the Prophet at the age of nine years. However, in another work, Al-Tabari says: \"All four of his [Abu Bakr's] children were born of his two wives during the pre-Islamic period\" (Tarikhu'l-umam wa'l-mamlu'k, Al-Tabari (died 922), Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Dara'l-fikr, Beirut, 1979).\n If Ayesha was betrothed in 620 CE (at the age of seven) and started to live with the Prophet in 624 CE (at the age of nine), that would indicate that she was born in 613 CE and was nine when she began living with the Prophet. Therefore, based on one account of Al- Tabari, the numbers show that Ayesha must have born in 613 CE, three years after the beginning of revelation (610 CE). Tabari also states that Ayesha was born in the pre-Islamic era (in Jahiliya). If she was born before 610 CE, she would have been at least 14 years old when she began living with the Prophet. Essentially, Tabari contradicts himself.\n CONCLUSION: Al-Tabari is unreliable in the matter of determining Ayesha's age.\n\n Problem:\n Accepting that Al-Tabari is unreliable is superfluous as the primary evidence (that of the Hadith), say she was nine when the marriage was consummated.\n Claim:\n \n\n EVIDENCE # 3: The Age of Ayesha in Relation to the Age of Fatima According to Ibn Hajar, \"Fatima was born at the time the Ka`bah was rebuilt, when the Prophet was 35 years old... she was five years older that Ayesha\" (Al-isabah fi tamyizi'l-sahabah, Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani, Vol. 4, p. 377, Maktabatu'l-Riyadh al-haditha, al-Riyadh, 1978).\n If Ibn Hajar's statement is factual, Ayesha was born when the Prophet was 40 years old. If Ayesha was married to the Prophet when he was 52 years old, Ayesha's age at marriage would be 12 years. CONCLUSION: Ibn Hajar, Tabari an Ibn Hisham and Ibn Humbal contradict each other. So, the marriage of Ayesha at seven years of age is a myth.\n\n Problem:\n Ibn Hajar died in the year 852. This puts him two hundred years or so after the event. Secondly, Islamic tradition maintains that people are fallible, and their proclamations should be tested - against the Koran, first, then against the Hadith. Any discrepancies are subsumed by these works.\n Claim:\n \n\n EVIDENCE #4: Ayesha's Age in relation to Asma's Age According to Abda'l-Rahman ibn abi zanna'd: \"Asma was 10 years older than Ayesha (Siyar A`la'ma'l-nubala', Al-Zahabi, Vol.2,\n p. 289, Arabic, Mu'assasatu'l-risalah, Beirut, 1992).\n According to Ibn Kathir: \"She [Asma] was elder to her sister\n [Ayesha] by 10 years\" (Al-Bidayah wa'l-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p.\n 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).\n According to Ibn Kathir: \"She [Asma] saw the killing of her son\n during that year [73 AH], as we have already mentioned, and five days later she herself died. According to other narratives, she died not after five days but 10 or 20, or a few days over 20, or 100 days later. The most well known narrative is that of 100 days later. At the time of her death, she was 100 years old.\" (Al-Bidayah\n wa'l- nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933)\n According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani: \"She [Asma] lived a hundred\n years and died in 73 or 74 AH.\" (Taqribu'l-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fi'l-nisa', al-harfu'l-alif,\n Lucknow).\n According to almost all the historians, Asma, the elder sister of Ayesha was 10 years older than Ayesha. If Asma was 100 years old in 73 AH, she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of the hijrah.\n If Asma was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Ayesha should have been 17 or 18 years old. Thus, Ayesha, being 17 or 18 years of at the time of Hijra, she started to cohabit with the Prophet between at either 19 to 20 years of age.\n Based on Hajar, Ibn Katir, and Abda'l-Rahman ibn abi zanna'd,\n Ayesha's age at the time she began living with the Prophet would\n be 19 or 20. In Evidence # 3, Ibn Hajar suggests that Ayesha was 12 years old and in Evidence #4 he contradicts himself with a 17 or 18- year-old Ayesha. What is the correct age, twelve or eighteen?\n CONCLUSION: Ibn Hajar is an unreliable source for Ayesha's age.\n\n Problem:\n These people don't even understand their own conclusion. Of course they are unreliable; they are written by fallible men. Fortunately, we have the Hadith which say she was nine at the time the marriage was consummated; Hadith which Moslems proudly announce follow strict rules of 'Hadith science'. Ibn Hajar wrote more than 200 years later, and had a number of sources, Hadith, Koran, tradition. He mixed them all up... with the best intentions, but relying on his mistakes is in fact, un-Islamic.\n Claim:\n \n EVIDENCE #5: The Battles of Badr and Uhud\n A narrative regarding Ayesha's participation in Badr is given in\n the hadith of Muslim, (Kitabu'l-jihad wa'l-siyar, Bab\n karahiyati'l- isti`anah fi'l-ghazwi bikafir). Ayesha, while narrating the journey to Badr and one of the important events that took place in that journey, says: \"when we reached Shajarah\". Obviously, Ayesha was with the group travelling towards Badr. A narrative regarding Ayesha's participation in the Battle of Uhud is given in Bukhari (Kitabu'l- jihad wa'l-siyar, Bab Ghazwi'l-nisa' wa qitalihinna ma`a'lrijal): \"Anas reports that on the day of Uhud, people could not stand their ground around the Prophet. [On that day,] I saw Ayesha and Umm-i-Sulaim, they had pulled their dress up from their feet [to avoid any hindrance in their movement].\" Again, this indicates that Ayesha was present in the Battles of Uhud and Badr.\n It is narrated in Bukhari (Kitabu'l-maghazi, Bab Ghazwati'l-khandaq wa hiya'l-ahza'b): \"Ibn `Umar states that the Prophet did not permit me to participate in Uhud, as at that time, I was 14 years old. But on the day of Khandaq, when I was 15 years old, the Prophet permitted my participation.\"\n Based on the above narratives, (a) the children below 15 years were sent back and were not allowed to participate in the Battle of Uhud, and (b) Ayesha participated in the Battles of Badr and Uhud\n CONCLUSION: Ayesha's participation in the Battles of Badr and Uhud clearly indicates that she was not nine years old but at least 15 years old. After all, women used to accompany men to the battlefields to help them, not to be a burden on them. This account is another contradiction regarding Ayesha's age.\n\n Problem:\n Aisha was Muhammad's favourite wife, and he made exemptions especially for her. For instance, he had banned the use of graven images, but when Aisha was seen playing fondly with her dolls, he made a proclamation that human-like images in the form of dolls were okay. Accompanying Muhammad, but not participating in battle does not prove the point. It simply states that Aisha was not allowed to participate - it says nothing about 'accompanying him'. It only says one boy was sent back.\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=45618&dgn=4 is a site that shows women can, and have accompanied men into battle... where they can tend to men's wounds.\n Claim:\n \nEVIDENCE #6: Surat al-Qamar (The Moon)\n According to the generally accepted tradition, Ayesha was born about eight years before hijrah. But according to another narrative in Bukhari, Ayesha is reported to have said: \"I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)\" when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, kitabu'l-tafsir, Bab Qaulihi Bal al-sa`atu Maw`iduhum wa'l-sa`atu adha' wa amarr).\n Chapter 54 of the Quran was revealed eight years before hijrah (The Bounteous Koran, M.M. Khatib, 1985), indicating that it was revealed in 614 CE. If Ayesha started living with the Prophet at the age of nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she was a newborn infant (sibyah in Arabic) at the time that Surah Al-Qamar (The Moon) was revealed. According to the above tradition, Ayesha was actually a young girl, not an infant in the year of revelation of Al-Qamar. Jariyah means young playful girl (Lane's Arabic English Lexicon). So, Ayesha, being a jariyah not a sibyah (infant), must be somewhere between 6-13 years old at the time of revelation of Al-Qamar, and therefore must have been 14-21 years at the time she married the Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: This tradition also contradicts the marriage of Ayesha at the age of nine.\n\n Problem:\n Again, the 'tradition' where ever that is - as it's not stated here, may contradict the Hadith. This is irrelevant. Faced with such a dilemma, most Muslims would trust the Hadith over the tradition. No Moslem worth his salt would put tradition above Hadith\n Claim:\n \nEVIDENCE #7: Arabic Terminology\n According to a narrative reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, after the death of the Prophet's first wife Khadijah, when Khaulah came to the Prophet advising him to marry again, the Prophet asked her regarding the choices she had in mind. Khaulah said: \"You can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)\". When the Prophet asked the identity of the bikr (virgin), Khaulah mentioned Ayesha's name.\n All those who know the Arabic language are aware that the word bikr in the Arabic language is not used for an immature nine-year-old girl. The correct word for a young playful girl, as stated earlier, is jariyah. Bikr on the other hand, is used for an unmarried lady without conjugal experience prior to marriage, as we understand the word \"virgin\" in English. Therefore, obviously a nine-year-old girl is not a \"lady\" (bikr) (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, p. .210, Arabic, Dar Ihya al-turath al-`arabi,Beirut).\n CONCLUSION: The literal meaning of the word, bikr (virgin), in the above hadith is \"adult woman with no sexual experience prior to marriage.\" Therefore, Ayesha was an adult woman at the time of her marriage.\n\n Problem:\n Aisha was considered a 'woman' at the age of nine. Aisha was a virgin at the time of marriage, only one of two virginal women that Muhammad married. This apologist is laughably unfamiliar with the Islamic idea of claiming a girl as a woman, three months after her first menstruation. It doesn't matter what age this happens - but once it does, she's no longer considered a 'girl', but a 'woman'. I suspect that the apologist is a western-educated Muslim, who simply an unconsciously applies western values in deeming when someone becomes a woman.\n Claim:\n \nEVIDENCE #8. The Qur'anic Text\n All Muslims agree that the Quran is the book of guidance. So, we need to seek the guidance from the Quran to clear the smoke and confusion created by the eminent men of the classical period of Islam in the matter of Ayesha's age at her marriage. Does the Quran allow or disallow marriage of an immature child of seven years of age? There are no verses that explicitly allow such marriage. There is a verse, however, that guides Muslims in their duty to raise an orphaned child. The Quran's guidance on the topic of raising orphans is also valid in the case of our own children. The verse states: \"And make not over your property (property of the orphan), which Allah had made a (means of) support for you, to the weak of understanding, and maintain them out of it, clothe them and give them good education.\n And test them until they reach the age of marriage. Then if you find them maturity of intellect, make over them their property...\"\n (Quran, 4:5-6).\n In the matter of children who have lost a parent, a Muslim is ordered to (a) feed them, (b) clothe them, (c) educate them, and (d) test them for maturity \"until the age of marriage\" before\n entrusting them with management of finances.\n Here the Quranic verse demands meticulous proof of their intellectual and physical maturity by objective test results before the age of marriage in order to entrust their property to them.\n In light of the above verses, no responsible Muslim would hand over financial management to a seven- or nine-year-old immature girl. If we cannot trust a seven-year-old to manage financial matters, she cannot be intellectually or physically fit for marriage. Ibn Hambal (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hambal, vol.6, p. 33 and 99) claims that nine-year- old Ayesha was rather more interested in playing with toy-horses than taking up the responsible task of a wife. It is difficult to believe, therefore, that AbuBakr, a great believer among Muslims, would betroth his immature seven-year-old daughter to the 50-year-old Prophet. Equally difficult to imagine is that the Prophet would marry an immature seven-year-old girl. Another important duty demanded from the guardian of a child is to educate them. Let us ask the question, \"How many of us believe that we can educate our children satisfactorily before they reach the age of seven or nine years?\" The answer is none. Logically, it is an impossible task to educate a child satisfactorily before the child attains the age of seven. Then, how can we believe that Ayesha was educated satisfactorily at the claimed age of seven at the time of her marriage? AbuBakr was a more judicious man than all of us. So, he definitely would have judged that Ayesha was a child at heart and was not satisfactorily educated as demanded by the Quran. He would not have married her to anyone. If a proposal of marrying the immature and yet to be educated seven-year-old Ayesha came to the Prophet, he would have rejected it outright because neither the Prophet nor AbuBakr would violate any clause in the Quran.\n CONCLUSION: The marriage of Ayesha at the age of seven years would violate the maturity clause or requirement of the Quran. Therefore, the story of the marriage of the seven-year-old immature Ayesha is a myth.\n\n Problem:\n This again ignores actual Islamic practice as with the above.\n Claim:\n \n\n EVIDENCE #9: Consent in Marriage\n A women must be consulted and must agree in order to make a marriage valid (Mishakat al Masabiah, translation by James Robson, Vol. I, p. 665). Islamically, credible permission from women is a prerequisite for a marriage to be valid.\n By any stretch of the imagination, the permission given by an\n immature seven-year-old girl cannot be valid authorization for\n marriage. It is inconceivable that AbuBakr, an intelligent man, would take seriously the permission of a seven-year-old girl to marry a 50-year- old man.\n Similarly, the Prophet would not have accepted the permission given by a girl who, according to the hadith of Muslim, took her toys with her when she went live with Prophet.\n CONCLUSION: The Prophet did not marry a seven-year-old Ayesha because it would have violated the requirement of the valid permission clause of the Islamic Marriage Decree. Therefore, the Prophet married an intellectually and physically mature lady Ayesha.\n\n Problem:\n Here the apologist reveals his western-values. He simply believes that 'consent' for marriage can't be given by a girl, therefore Aisha can't be a girl because she gave 'consent'. The problem with this is that consent can be given by a parent, or, and more importantly, by the girl - because she is not considered by them as a girl, but as a woman. There is no fixed date as to when a Muslim girl becomes an adult. She does so, three months after her first menstruation. Thus Aisha, if she became pubescent aged nine, she's considered an adult, and able to give consent.\n \nSUMMARY:\n It was neither an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as seven or nine years, \n\n Oddly, Mizmaxx has been one of the most vociferous critics of this particular concept, having pointed out that it was in fact 'common practice' everywhere.\n \n nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.\n\n This is then to deny the second most important foundation of Islamic teaching.\n \nObviously, the narrative of the marriage of nine-year-old Ayesha by Hisham ibn `Urwah cannot be held true when it is contradicted by many other reported narratives. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to accept the narrative of Hisham ibn `Urwah as true when other scholars, including Malik ibn Anas, view his narrative while in Iraq, as unreliable. The quotations from Tabari, Bukhari and Muslim show they contradict each other regarding Ayesha's age. Furthermore, many of these scholars contradict themselves in their own records. Thus, the narrative of Ayesha's age at the time of the marriage is not reliable due to the clear contradictions seen in the works of classical scholars of Islam.\n\n Oddly enough T O Shanavas is giving a devastating argument for NOT believing in Islam, by criticising it as being so inaccurate. Mizmaxx greedily gulps all this down without applying any critical thought to what Shanavs says.\n \nTherefore, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the information on Ayesha's age is accepted as true when there are adequate grounds to reject it as myth. Moreover, the Quran rejects the marriage of immature girls and boys as well as entrusting them with responsibilities.\n T.O. Shanavas is a physician based in Michigan. This article first\n appeared in The Minaret in March 1999.\n \u00a9 2001 Minaret\n Extracted 09/06/02 from The Minaret was not married until\n\n The Koran does say something about immature girls, but unfortunately, Muslims reckon the nine year old Aisha to be mature.\n \n Above all that I would like to add that the Holy Prophet (pbuh) was twenty-five years of age, then he and his wife lived in\n happiness and fidelity for twenty-four years, until her death when he was forty-nine. Only between the age of fifty and his death at sixty- two did Prophet Mohammed take other wives, only one of whom was a virgin, and most of them were taken for dynastic and political reasons. Certainly the Prophet's record was better than the head of the Church of England, Henry VIII.\"\n Geoffrey Parrinder, Mysticism in the World's Religions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, pg. 121)\n In addressing the issue of Prophet Prophet Mohammed's polygynous marriages, it is important to remember several points. First, Semitic culture in general and Arab practice in particular permitted polygyny. It was common practice in Arabian society, especially among nobles and leaders. Though less common, polygyny was also permitted in biblical and even in postbiblical Judaism. From Abraham, David and Solomon down to the reformation period, polygyny was practised by some Jews. While Jewish law changed after the middle Ages due to the influence of Christian rule, for Jews under Islamic rule, polygyny remained licit, though it was not extensively practised.\n Second, during the prime of his life, Prophet Mohammed remained married to one woman, Khadija.\n Third, it was only after her death that he took a number of wives.\n Fourth, Prophet Mohammed's use of the special dispensation from God to exceed the limit of four wives imposed by the Quran, occurred only after the death of Khadija. Moreover, most of the eleven marriages had political and social motives. As was customary for Arab chiefs, many were political marriages to cement alliances. Others were marriages to the widows of his companions who had fallen in combat and were in need of protection. Remarriage was difficult in a society that emphasised the importance of virgin marriages. Aisha was the only virgin that Prophet Prophet Mohammed married and the wife with whom he had the closest relationship.\n Fifth, Prophet Prophet Mohammed's teachings and actions, as well as the Qur'anic message, improved the status of all women - wives, daughters, mothers, widows and orphans.\n Talk of the political and social motives behind many of the Prophet's marriages should not obscure the fact that Prophet Mohammed was attracted to women and enjoyed being with his wives. To deny this would contradict the Islamic outlook on marriage and sexuality, found in both revelation and Prophetic traditions, which emphasises the importance of family and views sex as a gift from God to be enjoyed within the bonds of marriage. The many stories about Prophet Mohammed's concern and care for his wives reflect these values.\n Ref: Rachel Biale, Women and Jewish Law (New York: Schocken Books,\n 1984, pg. 49-51)\n\n This is Mizmaxx wasting space as she quotes a source that doesn't deal with the age of Aisha AT ALL!",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \nThe Catholic Inquisition, as experienced in Europe.\n\n Could you give me some of the names of the towns that were wiped out, down to 3-4 residents as you offered previously by the commissioned witch hunters? That would be helpful.\n \n Why were the inquisitions wrong in the context of your belief system? Can you put it into the words of your beliefs?\n \n \nWhere's your evidence of pre-colonization murder and torture among First Nations? \n \n Who do you consider the First Nations?\n \n \nAnd no, development of technology for such things would not have been considered a valuable pursuit.\n\n So the Natives when presented with the options of using a more advanced technology, say a rifle, would have neglected that technology due to their lack of interest and pursuit in killing?\n \n \nThe genocide began in Trinidad with Columbus, and followed across the East Coast on the part of the British, the French, and even the Dutch. It was continued across the continent and despite changes in the names of the governments in power.\n\n And you believe that the Natives, if possessing the technology, would not have destroyed as many Europeans as possible to repel their advancement?\n \n \nYahweh, like the other gods of the era, demanded human sacrifice of fristborn sons-\n \n \"Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openest the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\" (Exodus 13:2)\n\n \n \nLater, for some reason, the firstborn sons were replaced by only animals, then eventually the practice ended entirely.\n\n Your quote is taken totally out of context. It says sanctify to me all the first-born. What does that mean?\n \n Read further in the chapter to find the full meaning of what you quote: \"For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord slwe all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man an dthe first-born of cattle. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all the males that first open the womb; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.\" (Exodus 13:15-16)\n \n If you need evidence that the first-born men were not sacrificed then simply read about Esau, Isaac's first-born and Reuben, Jacob's first-born. \n \n \nAnyway, this is a list of sacrifices of children for God in the Bible, besides the firstborn children of Isreal -\n \n Gen.7:21-22\n God drowns all children (except for Noah's) in a flood. \n \n Gen.19:24\n God kills all the children of Sodom and Gomorrah. \n \n Gen.22:2\n God tells Abraham to kill his son for a burnt offering. \n \n Ex.12:30\n God murders the Egyptian firstborn children. \n \n Ex.21:15, Lev.20:9, Dt.21:18-21\n Children who are disobedient, or who curse or strike their parents are to be killed. \n \n Dt.20:16, Jos.10:40\n God ordered the Israelites to kill all of the children in the cities that they invaded. \n \n 1 Sam.15:2-3\n God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekite children. \n \n 2 Sam.12:15, 18\n To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills David's newborn son. \n \n 2 Kg.2:23-24\n God sends bears to kill 42 little boys for making fun of Elisha's bald head. \n \n Jer.13:13-14\n God will make everyone drunk and then \"dash the fathers and the sons together.\" He vows to \"not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.\" \n \n Jer.19:9\n God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. \n \n Ps.135:8, 136:10\n God is praised for slaughtering little babies. \n \n Ps.137:9\n Happiness is smashing your little children against rocks. \n \n Ezek.5:10\n God will cause fathers to eat their sons and sons to eat their fathers. \n \n Hos.9:16\n God assures Hosea that he will \"slay even the beloved fruit of the womb.\" \n \n Hos.13:16\n God promises to dash to pieces the infants of Samaria and \"their women with child shall be ripped up.\" \n \n Zech.13:3\n A prophet must be killed by his own parents by \"thrusting him through when he prophesieth.\" \n \n None of these names human sacrifices for God but rather destruction of peoples by God.\n \n Human sacrifice is forbidden:\n \n Leviticus 18:20-22: Do not give any of your children to devote them by fire to Molech, and so profane the name of your God; I am the Lord.\n \n Deuteronomy 12:31: You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods. \n Deuteronomy 18:9-12: When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire...Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. \n 2 Kings 16:3: He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. \n Psalm 106:38: They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. \n Jeremiah 19:4-5: For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned sacrifices in it to gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as offerings to Baal - something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. \n \n \nSorry, but no amount of later niceties erase the sentence \"submit to your husbands\".\n\n Can you tell me why you find it so appaling to submit to one you love?\n \n Do you feel the same sense of outrage against Paul for asking husbands to submit to their wives even to the point of death? Do you feel outrage that he asked men to treat women as their own bodies?",

   "Jito,\n \nIt has nothing to do with getting men to treat me well. It's me taking control and doing what I want with my life and my body.

Just as you condemn the \"all about me\" philosophy of men who subject their wives to abuse and coerced sex I think you should be wary of it in your own life. \n \n Concerning this and your antipathy toward churches, I heard a phrase this week that I hope you will contemplate.

Just seems sad to me.\n\n I don't think loneliness contributes to pedophilia/ephebophilia in a normal person.\n \n \nAnd let me state - I do not harbor any negativity to the Catholic church regarding those abuses. That kind of abuse is everywhere - and in other churches, too.

   "There are two (consistent) problems with the claims made herein by Mizmaxx's western-orientated (sic) Muslim apologist.\n \n emoticon_rolleyes Again, you figure, 'why bother arguing when you can call someone names'.\n \n \nThis apologist is laughably unfamiliar with the Islamic idea of claiming a girl as a woman, three months after her first menstruation.\n\n This is by far my favorite quote of this post. The \"apologist\", a Muslim, is \"unfamiliar\" with the \"Islamic\" (Muslim) way of deciding female maturity. montalban, however, knows exactly how Muslims judge female maturity, even if they themselves are confused about it.\n \n \nFaced with such a dilemma, most Muslims would trust the Hadith over the tradition. No Moslem worth his salt would put tradition above Hadith\n\n montalban feels knowledgeable enough even to judge whether a Muslim is \"worth his salt\". He knows, based on some stuff he's read, what \"most Muslims\" would decide in a case of ideological conflict! Is montalban omnipotent in all areas, or only in the area of the interior of the heads of \"most Muslims\"?\n \n Interesting that in montalban's estimation a Muslim scholar of international recognition is less able to discern what Islam is, and what Muslims believe, than montalban is. \n \n \nOddly, Mizmaxx has been one of the most vociferous critics of this particular concept, having pointed out that it was in fact 'common practice' everywhere.\n\n I don't recall saying \"everywhere\". I do agree that it was not a specifically Arab or Islamic practice. \n \n \nMizmaxx offered up her site as having authority. It says that it respects these three Hadith. These three Hadith all agree on the age of Aisha.\n\n As I said, organized religions by their very nature tend towards inconsistency. \n \n \nHence thrice I've asked you if you condemn the practice, your silence has been deafening.\n\n You really don't read replies do you? If this wasn't a public forum, I really wouldn't bother.\n \n \nI know some self-stylted Christians who don't believe that Christ rose from the dead, therefore, by your logic, the idea of Christ's rising is not 'Christian' theology - as it's not universally held to be true \n\n Exactly. One could call it a form of 'Christian' theology, but it would be inaccurate to regard it as universal.\n \n \n... show me the teachings of Christ that lead to a Crusade?\n\n Such specific wording, montalban. Shouldn't I look to the entire tradition to find words which would induce someone to mass slaughter? \n \n However, since you asked (from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible)-\n \n Matthew (Mark & Luke have equivalent quotes also)-\n \n # Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned \"with unquenchable fire.\" 3:10, 12\n \n # Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament. 5:17\n \n # Jesus says that most people will go to hell. 7:13-14\n \n # \"the children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" 8:12\n \n # Cities that neither \"receive\" the disciples nor \"hear\" their words will be destroyed by God. It will be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly did to those poor folks (see Gen.19:24). 10:14-15\n \n # Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his preaching. 11:20-24\n \n # Jesus will send his angels to gather up \"all that offend\" and they \"shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\" 13:41-42, 50\n \n # Jesus says, \"He that is not with me is against me.\" 12:30\n \n # Jesus will send his angels to gather up \"all that offend\" and they \"shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\" 13:41-42, 50\n \n # Jesus refuses to heal the Canaanite (Mk.7:26 says she was Greek) woman's possessed daughter, saying \"it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.\" 15:22-26\n \n Intolerance in John-\n \n # People are damned or saved depending only on what they believe. 3:18, 36\n \n # The \"wrath of God\" is on all unbelievers. 3:36\n \n # John, with his usual anti-Semitism, says that the Jews persecuted Jesus and \"sought to slay him.\" 5:16, 18\n \n # John says that Jesus \"would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.\" 7:1\n \n # No one could speak openly about Jesus \"for fear of the Jews.\" 7:13\n \n # Jesus says we must believe in him or we will \"die in our sins.\" 8:24\n \n # Jesus calls his opponents (the Jews) the sons of the devil. 8:44\n \n # Once again, \"the Jews\" are accused of trying to kill Jesus. 11:8\n \n # If you don't believe in Jesus you are going to hell. 12:48\n \n # John blames the Jews for the death of Jesus. 19:7, 12, 14-15\n \n # Those who do not believe in Jesus will be cast into a fire to be burned. 15:6\n \n # John, with his usual anti-Semitism, says tht the disciples hid in locked room \"for fear of the Jews.\" 20:19\n \n Acts-\n \n # Peter blames the Jews for the death of Jesus. 3:14-15\n \n # Peter wrongly claims that Dt.18:18-19 refers to Jesus, saying that those who refuse to follow him (all nonchristians) must be killed. 3:23\n \n # Once again, Peter accuses the Jews of murdering Jesus. 5:30\n \n # The Jews are again blamed for the death of Jesus. 10:39\n \n # The author of Acts brags about God destroying \"seven nations of the land of Canaan.\" 13:19\n \n # The Jews hate the word of God and are always just stirring up trouble. 17:13\n \n # \"And when they [the Jews of Corinth] opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he [Paul] shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads.\" 18:6\n \n Romans-\n \n # \"The wrath of God\" is on all unbelievers. 1:18\n \n # Paul claims that the existence and nature of God is self-evident; thus, unbelievers are \"without excuse.\" 1:20\n \n # \"He that doubteth is damned ... Whosoever is not of faith is sin.\" 14:23\n \n # Shun those who disagree with your religious views. 16:17\n \n Philippians-\n \n \"Beware of dogs ... beware of the concision.\" I'm not sure who Paul is calling \"dogs\" here. Some say he is referring to Jews -- to those of \"the concision\", as opposed to Christians, who are of the \"true circumcision\". In any case, Paul is expressing hostility and intolerance toward his fellow human beings. 3:2\n \n 2 Timothy-\n \n \"The Lord knoweth them that are his.\" This verse was used by the Catholic Church during the inquisition to justify killing those suspected of heresy. (Kill them all, for `the Lord knows them that are His'.\" ) 2:19\n \n Titus-\n \n # To Paul, Jews are unruly liars \"whose mouths must be stopped.\" 1:10-11\n \n # According to Paul, the people of Crete are \"always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.\" 1:12\n \n # Heretics are to be rejected since they are subverted, sinners, and condemned by God. 3:10-11\n \n Hebrews-\n \n # Every skeptic and nonbeliever has \"an evil heart of unbelief.\" 3:12\n \n # It is impossible for fallen-away Christians to be saved. (Didn't the author know about confession or the finality of being saved?) 6:4-6\n \n # Those who disobeyed the Old Testament law were killed. It will be much worse for those who displease Jesus. 10:28-29\n \n # If you don't believe the same things as the author of Hebrews, then it's impossible to please God. 11:6\n \n James-\n \n # Whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. 4:4\n \n 1 John-\n \n Every nonchristian is liar and an antichrist. 2:22, 4:2-3\n \n 2 John-\n \n # The nonchristian is \"a deceiver and an antichrist.\" 1:7\n \n # \"Whosoever ... abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.\" 1:9\n \n \n In any case, I don't think that \"teachings of Christ\" led to the Crusades, but the Church sure did. \n \n \nCould you give me some of the names of the towns that were wiped out, down to 3-4 residents as you offered previously by the commissioned witch hunters?\n\n \n \nThe victims in those five and a half centuries were literally countless. Official burnings were only a beginning. There were also the disrupted, starving families; unrecorded suicides; unofficial lynch ings; hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, who died unnoticed i the papal crusades against heretical groups. There were late-Renaissance witch hunts in Protestant countries, which had no formal connection with the Inquisition but certainly took their impetus from it.\n \n The chronicler of Tr\u00e8ves reported that in the year 1586, the entire female population of two villages was wiped out by the inquisitors, except for only two women left alive. Two other villages were destroyed completely and erased from the map. A hundred and thirty-three persons were burned in a single day at Quedlinburg in 1589, out of a town of 12,000. Henri Boguet said Germany in 1590 was \"almost entirely occupied with building fires (for witches); and Switzerland has been compelled to wipe out many of her villages on their account. Travelers in Lorraine may see thousands and thousands of the stakes to which witches are bound\".\n \n In 1524, one thousand witches died at Como. Strasbourg burnt five thousand in a period of 20 years. The Senate of Savoy condemned 800 witches at one time. Param stated that over thirty thousand were executed in the 15th century. Nicholas Remy said he personally sentenced 800 witches in 15 years and in one year alone forced sixteen witches to suicide. A bishop of Bamberg claimed 600 witches in 10 years; a bishop of Nancy, 800 in 16 years; a bishop of Wurtzburg, 1900 in 5 years. Five hundred were executed within three months at Geneva and 400 in a single day at Toulouse. The city of Tr\u00e8ves burned 7,000 witches. The Lutheran prelate Benedict Carpzov, who claimed to have read the Bible 53 times, sentenced 20,000 devil-worshippers. Even relatively permissive England killed 30,000 witches between 1542 and 1736. The slaughter went on throughout Christian Europe for nearly five centuries.\nBarbara G. Walker-\n Sources: \n Summers, Montague. The Geography of Witchcraft.

Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1952 pp.292-293\n \n \nWhy were the inquisitions wrong in the context of your belief system? Can you put it into the words of your beliefs?\n\n I think rounding ppl up and torturing then killing them for disagreeing with the authority of the Church is pretty clearly wrong, no matter what your belief system.\n \n \nWho do you consider the First Nations?\n\n First Peoples of the land now called \"Canada\" and \"United States\".\n \n \nSo the Natives when presented with the options of using a more advanced technology, say a rifle, would have neglected that technology due to their lack of interest and pursuit in killing?\n\n Nope. Just wouldn't spend valuable time developing such things. Working on democracy, feeding everyone, and other things \"Western Civilization\" has never been very skilled at, by contrast.\n \n \nAnd you believe that the Natives, if possessing the technology, would not have destroyed as many Europeans as possible to repel their advancement?\n\n Let's be honest- when you say \"advancement\", you mean \"attack on Natives and their land\". So, no, obviously if Native ppl had to choose between those attacking them and their own ppl, they would not be confused as to what the right choice would be.\n \n \nIt says sanctify to me all the first-born. What does that mean?\n\n It means sacrifice them. This was the original practice of the ancient Hebrews, and many other nearby faiths.\n \n \nIf you need evidence that the first-born men were not sacrificed then simply read about Esau, Isaac's first-born and Reuben, Jacob's first-born.\n\n The Bible is contradictory- the anti-sacrifice messages are later interpolations. According to Barbara G. Walker, ancient Hebrews \"did retain a custom of human sacrifice, for special occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of influence of the Roman Empire\". Her source is Franz Cumont's Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism. \n \n \nNone of these names human sacrifices for God but rather destruction of peoples by God.\n\n Er, that only washes if you happen to believe that the Bible is literal, and there was a god Yahweh interecting with the Ancient Hebrews. \n \n \nCan you tell me why you find it so appaling to submit to one you love?\n\n I think it should be obvious. Submission is giving up your own judgement in exchange for someone else's- never a good thing, IMO. Noone who is truly in love wants the one they love to literally \"submit\" to them. \n \n \nDo you feel the same sense of outrage against Paul for asking husbands to submit to their wives even to the point of death? Do you feel outrage that he asked men to treat women as their own bodies?\n\n Especially as he said that they were the \"heads\".\n \n \nThe \"all about me\" philosophy does not fit well into Christianity. Just as you condemn the \"all about me\" philosophy of men who subject their wives to abuse and coerced sex I think you should be wary of it in your own life.\n\n I can't speak for Jito, but it seems clear from the post that she's saying that this particular decision re: her own body is all about her. I think it's pretty low to equate that with abusive behavior. As they say, your right to punch ends where your fist hits my nose.",

   "Mizmaxx, two things.\n \n a) your post doesn't prove your point about Muhammed, you're not citing any sources so a 'just-so' argument doesn't wash. I take it you've actually given up trying to find Muslim sources to back your stance in favour of this pedophile, and yes, your source that I refer to above is indeed wrong about the weight of evidence from Haddith. If you like I can quote two sources you actually cited earlier that support my case :)\n \n b) how would Jesus condemning someone to hell, if that's what He says, equate to a Crusade? There's a massive gap there. All you've done is post a serious of Biblical verses in the hope that there's some kind of link somewhere.\n \n Take Mat 3:10\n The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\n \n How does this equate to a call for a crusade?\n \n Mat 7\n 13 \"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.\n \n How does this equate to a call for a crusade?\n \n Mat 8\n 12 But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n How does this equate to a call for a crusade?\n etc.\n \n Thanks in advance. It should be interesting, I've never heard this theory before.\n \n Actually a third, you don't consider yourself anti-Christian, but you're willing to pass your post off as an argument\n emoticon_emb",

   "I don't mean to step onto the Maximus v Mizmaxx debate but a few things make me curious...(and as Mizmaxx's into relativist arguments I give you this...) :)\n \n \nWhy were the inquisitions wrong in the context of your belief system? Can you put it into the words of your beliefs? \n\n \nI think rounding ppl up and torturing then killing them for disagreeing with the authority of the Church is pretty clearly wrong, no matter what your belief system.\n\n Why then do you introduce relativist arguments regarding child brides? Is killing bad, but paedophilia good, according to your beliefs?\n What about\n \"An Offer You Can't Refuse: Human Sacrifice and the Aztec State (with special emphasis on Tenochtitlan)\"\n http://www.wynja.com/arch/aztec.html\n and\n \"Human Sacrifice\"\n http://www.anthro.mankato.msus.edu/prehistory/latinamerica/topics/human_scacrifice.html\n What about scarification? Is that okay?\n What about a Native American religious wars? (Tenskwatawa) Shawnee Prophet lead his people to purify themselves (get rid of 'white' culture) and to fight against the infidel white men.\n \"A factor in our Indiana troubles that became historic was the influence of the Shawnee chief, Tecumtha (often written Tecumseh) and his brother, known as the \"Prophet,\" and the part that influenced played in precipitating important issues. These two remarkable Indians first appeared in Indiana history in 1805, among the Delawares on White River, where the Prophet fomented a witchcraft craze which resulted in the murder of several victims accused by him, and which had somewhat the complexion of a crusade of vengeance against those who were friendly to the settlers and who had sanctioned the sales of land. In 1808 the tow appeared among the Potawatomis and established themselves at the mouth of Tippecanoe River a few miles above the site of Lafayette. Here they drew about them Indians of various tribes and the place became known as the Prophet's Town. The Prophet was a religious teacher whose propaganda was a strange mingling of ethics, wisdom and gross superstition. He claimed to be a divine spokesman and to have supernatural vision, and this seems to have been the great source of his power among his followers. This power he exercised in the furtherance of the plans conceived by his brother Tecumseh.\"\n http://www.countyhistory.com/history/090.htm\n ...the crusade led by Tecumseh and his brother, the Shawnee Prophet, during the first two decades of the nineteenth century-the Kickapoos were in the forefront of unsuccessful multitribal Indian resistance movements.\n http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/view/KK/bmk9.html\n As a young man Laulewasika lacked direction. Then in 1805 he underwent a powerful transformation. Overcome by images of his own wickedness, he fell into a deep trance during which he met the Indian Master of Life. On the basis of this mystical experience, he embarked on a crusade \"to reclaim the Indians from bad habits.\" Adopting a new name, Tenskwatawa (\"the open door\"), he called on Indians to stop drinking alcohol. Then, like other Indian prophets before and after, he demanded an end to intertribal fighting and a return to ancestral ways. His central message was Indian unity as the key to blocking white encroachment on tribal lands.\n http://www.hfac.uh.edu/gl/colonialindians.htm\n and\n http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=20\n \n What context then are the Zuni War Gods to be taken in?*\n \n Who do you consider the First Nations? \n\n \nFirst Peoples of the land now called \"Canada\" and \"United States\".\n\n Aren't their Indians in Mexico? Maybe you're trying to distance yourself from the Aztecs. :)\n Are the Indian groups/nations in Canada and the United States homogenous, and contiguous to these two nations?(with regards to Mexico). Were there times when one group of Indians displaced or even assimilated any other group?\n \n \nCan you tell me why you find it so appalling to submit to one you love? \n\n \nI think it should be obvious. Submission is giving up your own judgement in exchange for someone else's- never a good thing, IMO. Noone who is truly in love wants the one they love to literally \"submit\" to them.\n\n Not at all. Submission can be done in trust. Just as you lie with your partner in bed, you absolutely trust that they're not going to get up in the middle of the night, when you're asleep, and cut your throat. If you look at the NT it gives obligations to both partners, including love.. you probably missed that when you mis-quoted the Epistles of St.Paul some weeks ago :). Obligations/duties etc, aren't bad either. We have to submit to obligations. If you have children, you know you need to make sacrifices. In fact if you're in a relationship, you do so, as you don't think of 'me' and 'I' but 'we' and 'us'.\n What about polygamy? Did your 'nation' practice this, and how does this sit with a belief of 'equality'?\n \"The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family. Native American families are very close. If domestic violence occurs, the family is expected to take care of the problem. If a Native American woman goes outside the family for help, she is ostracized by her family and the batterer's family\"\n http://www.msnusers.com/WomenandAbu...ricanwomen.msnw\n also\n \"Native American spirituality can be a source of profound support, comfort, and healing for many battered women. According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition, it can also serve to keep them in abusive relationships. The idea of connectedness to the earth and to each other is frequently used by the batterer and other family members as a reason for the woman to remain in a violent relationship.\"(Ibid.)\n Probably why\n \"Native American women experience the highest rate of violence of any group in the United States\"\n http://www.libertadlatina.org/nativ...%20violence.htm\n \n *Native American war gods...\n AHAYUTA-ACHI (Native_American) \n Also known as AHAYUTA, ACHI \n \n CORN-WOMAN (Native_American) \n \n GUNNODAYAK (Native_American) \n \n ICTINIKE (Native_American) \n Also known as IKTO, IKTOMI, INKTOMI, UNKTOME \n God of War and Treachery.

   "Again, you figure, 'why bother arguing when you can call someone names'.\n\n Mizmaxx thinks that if she posts anti-Christian junk, she's not being anti-Christian. Note I don't call you against Christ... but your attitude to Him is also questionable.\n \n This is by far my favorite quote of this post. The \"apologist\", a Muslim, is \"unfamiliar\" with the \"Islamic\" (Muslim) way of deciding female maturity. Montalban, however, knows exactly how Muslims judge female maturity, even if they themselves are confused about it.\n\n Mizmaxx also seems to think that if she can make excuses for a paedophile, she's not an apologist.\n \n Montalban feels knowledgeable enough even to judge whether a Muslim is \"worth his salt\". He knows, based on some stuff he's read, what \"most Muslims\" would decide in a case of ideological conflict! Is Montalban omnipotent in all areas, or only in the area of the interior of the heads of \"most Muslims\"?\n\n Mizmaxx feels that if I post a large number of expert cites that this is being un-representative. And, even when she posts cites that agree with my stance, I'm being unrepresentative of Muslim beliefs. She believes that if she just keeps repeating this, it's an argument. And I for one feel that if I quote 20 sites, or 30, or 50, she'd be making the same argument. Oddly enough, she reverses tact (see quote below) and agrees somewhat in a guarded way that most Muslims accept the Hadith.\n \nInteresting that in Montalban's estimation a Muslim scholar of international recognition is less able to discern what Islam is, and what Muslims believe, than Montalban is.\n\n Nice straw-man. All my cites are equally expert. I specifically chose cites that Muslims actually contact for advice. All the Q & A sites are exactly that. Further to her dishonest re-working of my argument is the fact that two of her expert sites, agree with my assertion on the value, strength and importance of the Hadith.\n Your cite on the Hadith...\n http://understanding-islam.org/rela...375&sscatid=412\n disagrees with your statement on the Hadith (but note again, you change your mind and slip in a tacit recognition about the Hadith -see below)\n Further to that, what qualifications does T.O. Shanavas have? I ask about him, because he's the only 'expert' that is consistently in agreement with you.\n But then you changed your mind and said\n \nAs for the Hadiths, I believe what I said was that they were not universally followed, however the \"majority\" of Muslims consider them.\n\n And the Hadiths agree with the age of Aisha. But of course, most of this arguing between us is over her attempt to draw me to say ALL MUSLIMS are paedophiles, or some such statement, but I don't believe I've done that. Certainly hope not :) However, most Muslims believe that Muhammad was the ideal man, this same man who slept with a child, and therefore at the heart of their belief is a prophet who did many vile things.\n \nI don't recall saying \"everywhere\". I do agree that it was not a specifically Arab or Islamic practice.\n\n Yeesh, another re-working. You suggested it was widespread -though I imagine you'd say not amongst your great peoples.\n Interestingly enough several Muslim apologist sites suggest that it was a Semitic practice.\n \"Additionally, this marriage followed the norms for all Semitic peoples,...\"\n http://www.angelfire.com/ny/dawahpage/aisha.html\n and\n http://www.noor-al-islam.com/Aisha.html\n and\n http://www.muslim-answers.org/aishah.htm\n They give the same relativist arguments, and therefore tacitly agree with her young age, but simply 'moderate' it by suggesting that everyone did it.\n \nAs I said, organized religions by their very nature tend towards inconsistency.\n\n Then you are again making a claim no Muslim worth his salt would make; most Muslims actually do put great stock in their own Holy books.\n \n You really don't read replies do you? If this wasn't a public forum, I really wouldn't bother.\n\n You again avoid answering the question. If you've answered 'yes' or 'no' before, and I've missed it, why not just repeat it here, or cite where you answered this... for the public record\n \nExactly. One could call it a form of 'Christian' theology, but it would be inaccurate to regard it as universal.\n\n So what? You've only been able to cast this kind of speculation. When pressed you claimed that the Hadith aren't universally believed, or that they're believed to be largely inaccurate. You've yet to offer any proof of this - as mentioned above, two of your cites actually disagree with you on this. The majority of Muslims believe the Hadith, the Hadith say Aisha was 9 when the marriage was consummated. Keep offering opinion that it 'might' be something else.\n \n Often Mizmaxx has accused me of taking words of the Koran, and Hadith out of any context, and therefore she offers exactly this kind of argument here...\n \n Such specific wording, Montalban. Shouldn't I look to the entire tradition to find words which would induce someone to mass slaughter?\n\n Yes, you should look into the entire tradition, because no where do Orthodox believe that the teachings of Christ are contained wholly within the Bible. We are not a sola scriptura church. Thus your attempt to be crafty, thinking this was an opportunity for you to list a random lot of Bible passages has failed. Incidentally, Catholics believe too the same thing regarding Christ's teachings, as do the Copts. Catholics alone would make a majority of Christians. So you've failed again. It is also funny because it shows the lengths you will go to in order to debate.\n \nHowever, since you asked (from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible)-\n\n various versese from Bible without any context are given....\n \nMatthew (Mark & Luke have equivalent quotes also)-\n\n Mizmaxx, you should take your own advice\n Post 111 \"Islam\" thread\n \nThe point is that if you're looking to find horrendous things in a religion, take a sentence from an ancient text- it always looks bad.\n\n \n \n In any case, I don't think that \"teachings of Christ\" led to the Crusades, but the Church sure did.\n\n Really, then why just rant off that list above? This is the first thing you've said nice about Christ. Oddly enough you once thought that Jesus advocated violence and was comparable in that regards to Muhammad\n Post 113 \"Islam\" thread\n \nIn terms of Jesus being all about \"peace\", what about when he violently threw the money-changers out of the Temple? Mat 21:12, Mark 11:15\n\n Not only that you thought that 'turn the other cheek' was 'daft'.\n \n But anyway, how did the Orthodox Church turn any/most/all of these quotes you give into a call for a crusade?\n \n In case people are wondering Mizmaxx and I have been debating Islam for some time. She's been wrong before..\n Islam thread post 115\n \nThe problem with arguing about Christianity is that the forms are so varied and the Bible so inconsistent that you could argue that the Bible says virtually anything. The Koran on the other hand was written at a certain time, and passed down intact, never translated or added to or censored.\n\n As I stated the following post\n No, that's simply not true. The Koran didn't achieve final and definitive form till some time after.\n http://www.isisforum.com/research/origins.htm",

   "\n The \"all about me\" philosophy does not fit well into Christianity. Just as you condemn the \"all about me\" philosophy of men who subject their wives to abuse and coerced sex I think you should be wary of it in your own life. \n\n \n Wow, that's offensive.\n \n How can you possibly consider my choice to not have any more children akin to those who have abused women? Are we really just to to be baby ovens and only men and your pope gets to decide when and if I procreate?\n \n I am divorced. I don't want to marry again. One in three women are raped.

   "Mizmaxx has levelled some generalised attacks on 'the Church' whether she means \"Christianity\" in general, or the Catholic Church it's hard to tell\n \n When she makes such sweeping attacks as if they are 'just-so' it's hard to reconcile this with the fact she now says\n a) Jesus wasn't the cause\n and yet\n b) the idea of 'turn the other cheek' is 'daft' (to use her word).\n \n What are we to make of this, where she both condemns a call of universal love, but absolves that person from causing the Crusades.\n \n I think the idea here is for her just to be criticial of Christianity, there doesn't need to be a 'sense' behind hate.\n \n Oddly enough too, her own 'culture' celbrates war within a 'religious' frame-work. There are Native American war-gods, and war heroes, and I believe warriors would seek some kind of sanctification before going into battle.\n \n The only difference, and Maximus touched upon this, was simply that with technology, westerners were better killers. Given the opportunity, there seems no reason why Native Americans would not have been the same.\n \n Into this violent world came a Man, Jesus, urging peace... even Mizmaxx has agreed to this... at least as far as the Crusades are concerned, yet even she rejects His idea of universal peace.*\n \n And, into this debate, we've seen her defend a pedophille Muhammed simply because she claims (in an earlier post) she can't stand 'racist' remarks (even though Isalm is not a 'race' and she even says 'race' doesn't exist anyway) (more confusion).\n \n She's tried to undermine Muslim reliance on the Hadith, then reverse this. And, whilst she now admits most Muslims consult the Hadith, she's yet to acknowledge that they suggest that Muhammed was a horrid man... even when the evidence is based on the strongest, most accepted Hadiths there are. She can't admit this, because to do so might be to agree with a Christian.\n \n *Even here she believes Jesus just to be a myth - which is strange that a violent culture would 'invent' a person who goes against all the things she high-lighted as evil in the Old Testament.

   "Montalban, although I don't seem to have as much time on my hands as you do, I will try to respond to your numerous posts and clear up your obvious confusion.\n \n \nyour post doesn't prove your point about Muhammed\n\n My only point is that you have not proven yours. Despite having taken up tons of thread space, and even trying to start a thread on the subject, you still don't actually have evidence that Islam is problematic per se, especially in comparison to other monotheistic religions.\n \n \n how would Jesus condemning someone to hell, if that's what He says, equate to a Crusade?\n\n As I said, I don't think it does necessarily, however such passages have been used to excuse crusading and other terrible behaviors. However, they are clearly messages of intolerance towards non-Christian beliefs.\n \n \nNative American war gods\n\n What is this supposed to prove?\n \n \nThe nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family.\n\n Yet again, this is re: abuse within the colonist framework. To quote the entire passage-\n \n \nWithin Varying rates and patterns of abuse exist among different tribes. It is important to note, however, that domestic violence is a relatively new phenomenon in the Native American culture. Abuse of both Native American women and children by Native American men can be traced to the introduction of alcohol, Christianity, and the European hierarchical family structure. Women from the Sacred Shawl Women's Society on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota report that while domestic violence existed in pre-reservation society, it was both rare and severely reprobated.\n \n Many traditional Native American histories indicate that when domestic violence did occur, the community responded. The batterer would be banished or ostracized, or retaliation was left to the male relatives of the victim. Such traditional methods of addressing domestic violence were eliminated or limited with the advent of a Western European criminal justice process.\n \n Societal Oppression\n Several factors have accompanied the increase in domestic violence in Native American communities. These include the removal of Native Americans from their ancestral lands, suppressed religious and cultural practices, forced removal of Native American children into foster homes and boarding schools, a disruption of traditional living patterns compounded by the poverty of reservation life, and a 90% reduction of the Native American population from the time of European contact to the establishment of reservations. These dramatic changes in social, spiritual, and economic structure have drastically undermined traditional ways of life. \n \n The Family\n The Native American family is an extended one that includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, as well as adopted relatives. The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family.(...)\n http://www.actabuse.com/NativeAmerican.html\n \n Furthermore, from the same article-\n \nThe Reservation\n Some Native American women have resided on the same reservation for their entire lives. If a battered woman leaved her home to go to a shelter, she is forced to leave both familiar surroundings and her support system.\n \n Many women residing on reservations live in such poverty that they do not have access to telephones, transportation, or child care. In many cases, the remote areas in which they live do not even have telephone lines or a transportation system. Some battered Native American women do not speak English. All these factors severely impact women's help-seeking behavior.\n \n There are, now, as many Native Americans living in urban areas as there are on reservations, and according to the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics report on \"Native Americans and Crime\" most Indian women are assaulted by non-Indian perpetrators (both on and off the reservations) so the jurisdictional and legal issues are just as viable as to battering itself.\n\n That doesn't go very far into proving your point. Surely you must have read these points when you picked out the sentence you used as a quote. It makes me wonder why you bothered to post this at all, except as some pathetic attempt at badgering me.\n \n \nWhat about polygamy? Did your 'nation' practice this, and how does this sit with a belief of 'equality'?\n\n What does this have to do with \"equality\"? Number of wives or husbands hasn't anything to do with equality- it's the political power of wives and husbands that matter. \n \n Anyway, we didn't necessarily have formalized \"marriages\" as you know them (with exchanges of goods and change in living situation, etc.), so it's an irrelevant point.\n \n \nNot at all. Submission can be done in trust.\n\n Exactly. Neither submission nor trust can come from an external command- any attempt to control these feelings from outside a relationship are tyrannical. If the people in a relationship do not trust each other, they should not be \"commanded\" to submit to each other. In particular, given the patriarchal environments we're talking about, this creates a very dangerous situation for women. As you point out in regards to how this view has effected Native cultures.\n \n \nAren't their Indians in Mexico? Maybe you're trying to distance yourself from the Aztecs. Are the Indian groups/nations in Canada and the United States homogenous, and contiguous to these two nations?(with regards to Mexico). Were there times when one group of Indians displaced or even assimilated any other group?\n\n Indigenousness is not geographical, or racial. It is a political and economic relationship created by colonization. I specify US and Canada because our nations do not follow their borders, so I have much more in common with peoples of my nation or neighboring nations \"across the border\" than I do those in the same \"country\" as me, but further away culturally and geographically. There would be no reason to include \"Mexico\" but not \"Guatemala\", or Hawai'i, or the Phillipines, etc. \n \n My nation is part of the larger \"Eastern Woodlands\" group, and the Wabenaki Confederacy, being located in the North Eastern US and South Eastern Canada, aka the Maritimes or \"New England\". \n \n \nOn the basis of this mystical experience, he embarked on a crusade \"to reclaim the Indians from bad habits.\" Adopting a new name, Tenskwatawa (\"the open door\"), he called on Indians to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n This is hilarious. Obviously the word \"crusade\" is not meant literally, all he did was tell people to stop drinking- obviously not at all equivalent to the historical bloody crusades. Neither are the three people who may have died from your other example. This is the best you can do? \n \n \nThe total number of deaths due to the crusades had been estimated at around nine million, at least half of which were Christians.\nsource: Robertson, History of Christianity p168, web site: http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/crusades.html\n \n \n Given below is one taken from Gesta Francorum (The Deeds of the Franks):\n \n The defenders fled along the walls and through the city, and our men pursued them killing and cutting them down as far as Solomon's Temple, where there was such a massacre that our men were wading ankle deep in blood ... Then the crusaders rushed around the whole city, seizing gold and silver, horses and mules, and looting the housing that were full of costly things. Then, rejoicing and weeping from excess of happiness, they all came to worship and give thanks at the sepulchre of our saviour Jesus. Next morning, they went cautiously up the temple roof and attacked the Saracens, both men and women [who had taken refuge there], cutting off their heads with drawn swords ... Our leaders then gave orders that all the Saracen corpses should be thrown outside the city because of the stench, for almost the whole city was full of dead bodies ... such a slaughter of pagans had never been seen or heard of, for they were burned in pyres like pyramids, and none save God alone knows how many they were.\nSame web site as above.\n \n \nBut anyway, how did the Orthodox Church turn any/most/all of these quotes you give into a call for a crusade?\n\n \n \nReally, then why just rant off that list above? This is the first thing you've said nice about Christ. Oddly enough you once thought that Jesus advocated violence and was comparable in that regards to Muhammad\n\n Exactly. My point is that either text can be used and manipulated to encourage peace, or to encourage violence. I don't think the writers of the Gospels were encouraging the Crusades because they were clearly writing within the context of their own time and environment- they weren't speaking about Europeans and they did not have an opinion on the spice trade in Medieval times. So no, \"Christ\" did not cause the Crusades, and neither does the Koran necessarily lead one to violence. Both texts could be harvested for quotes which vould be used either for proof of intolerance or to bolster intolerance. \n \n \nYou again avoid answering the question. If you've answered 'yes' or 'no' before, and I've missed it, why not just repeat it here, or cite where you answered this... for the public record\n\n The 'public record' has already seen me say several times that adults having sex with children is reprehensible behavior. I don't know why you keep missing it, maybe you should read the replies posted to you more thoroughly.\n \n \nHowever, most Muslims believe that Muhammad was the ideal man, this same man who slept with a child, and therefore at the heart of their belief is a prophet who did many vile things.\n\n That does not mean that they will be led to do this \"vile thing\" themselves. \n \n At base, your argument with Islam is not that it encourages child abuse. You dismiss anyone within Islam who argues against child marriages as either \"not Muslim\" or \"fringe\" because your problem is not concern for young Muslim girls. It is that you believe that Muhammad was inspired by Satan, and therefore the religion is Satanic. *edited to add- I really wish you had been honest about this from the beginning.* How can anyone possibly argue against this idea with fact and reason? You will persist in believing that Islam=Satanic=Evil no matter how much fact and logic you are presented with. The same way you persist in believing in \"Creationism\", and the Tooth Fairy, for all I know. There's really no point in continuing, as nobody can prove that Satan did or did not visit Muhammad, or if Satan exists at all. If there was a true debate happening, I would be interested in exploring the history of Lucifer/Satan the god of light/lightening in ancient Hebrew mythology and his transformation into the devil, but that isn't the case. There's no point discussing the cultural ramifications of the Cinderella story with someone who believes that Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother are real people, or the history of Waterloo with someone who believes that they are Napoleon.",

Despite waves of evidences from Islamic sites, it's easy for you just to repeat this. Obviously not only my interpretation is wrong, but so is there, and so are some of your own cites. We're all wrong :) That's very very funny.\n \nDespite having taken up tons of thread space, and even trying to start a thread on the subject, you still don't actually have evidence that Islam is problematic per se, especially in comparison to other monotheistic religions.\n\n Oh, no, of course, I've only presented that Muslims hold Muhammad as the prime example of a person, and loads of primary evidence about him sleeping with a child. Then about a dozen Muslim sites that agree with this. Sure that's not a problem. :)\n \nhow would Jesus condemning someone to hell, if that's what He says, equate to a Crusade?\n\n \nAs I said, I don't think it does necessarily, however such passages have been used to excuse crusading and other terrible behaviours. However, they are clearly messages of intolerance towards non-Christian beliefs.\n\n Really, then how did whomever called a crusade use these passages. Please give specific references. You've had several days so far to come up with some. Which passages specifically, and which person used them for a crusade? I'd be interested to know. It could be that you've got something here, but you just saying 'it's so' isn't an argument. I studied the first Crusade called for by Urban, and its impact, especially as they crossed Orthodox lands - I have the Alexiad - a primary source (from the Byzantine point of view). I'd be interested in your sources that suggest what you believe as I am genuinely interested in Medieval history.\n \nNative American war gods\n\n \nWhat is this supposed to prove?\n\n That you should not go on criticising other people's versions of God with a sweeping statement, or they come back to bite you. After all, you've got Native American deities that specialise in war.\n It's good to see you on the hop about that Native American article that clearly says one of the problems is the culture.\n \nWhat about polygamy? Did your 'nation' practice this, and how does this sit with a belief of 'equality'? \n\n \nWhat does this have to do with \"equality\"? Number of wives or husbands hasn't anything to do with equality- it's the political power of wives and husbands that matter. \n\n You're kidding. I love it when you joke. I didn't say 'number of husbands' I said POLYGAMY which is one husband and a number of wives - go look up the word for the opposite. You don't think that polygamy, the idea of one man and many wives is anything about abuse?\n Further to that, if a woman knowlingly 'submits' to her husband, then you shouldn't have any problems then. She's not lost 'free will' at all... unless you just believe a woman's choice is only valid if she follows what you believe :)\n \nAnyway, we didn't necessarily have formalized \"marriages\" as you know them (with exchanges of goods and change in living situation, etc.), so it's an irrelevant point.\n\n So you're saying that Native Americans didn't have monogamy rules? Taboos regarding promiscuity?\n \nNot at all. Submission can be done in trust.\n\n \nExactly. Neither submission nor trust can come from an external command- any attempt to control these feelings from outside a relationship are tyrannical. If the people in a relationship do not trust each other, they should not be \"commanded\" to submit to each other. In particular, given the patriarchal environments we're talking about, this creates a very dangerous situation for women. As you point out in regards to how this view has effected Native cultures.\n\n No, this is still the wrong idea. If some one yells \"Don't go in there!\", I can submit to this and still exhibit free will. And you miss the point that the rules are about mutual obligation. It was stated that a husband should love his wife as Jesus loved us - and Jesus died for us - that's an extremely big ask, but it's a noble one.\n \nAren't their Indians in Mexico? Maybe you're trying to distance yourself from the Aztecs. Are the Indian groups/nations in Canada and the United States homogenous, and contiguous to these two nations?(with regards to Mexico). Were there times when one group of Indians displaced or even assimilated any other group? \n\n \nIndigenousness is not geographical, or racial. It is a political and economic relationship created by colonization. I specify US and Canada because our nations do not follow their borders, so I have much more in common with peoples of my nation or neighbouring nations \"across the border\" than I do those in the same \"country\" as me, but further away culturally and geographically. There would be no reason to include \"Mexico\" but not \"Guatemala\", or Hawaii, or the Philippines, etc.\n\n Then if you don't follow 'borders' why'd you exclude Mexico? Your final sentence has too many negatives for me to actually work out what you're trying to say.\n \nMy nation is part of the larger \"Eastern Woodlands\" group, and the Wabenaki Confederacy, being located in the North Eastern US and South Eastern Canada, aka the Maritimes or \"New England\".\n\n \n On the basis of this mystical experience, he embarked on a crusade \"to reclaim the Indians from bad habits.\" Adopting a new name, Tenskwatawa (\"the open door\"), he called on Indians to stop drinking alcohol. \n\n \nThis is hilarious. Obviously the word \"crusade\" is not meant literally, all he did was tell people to stop drinking- obviously not at all equivalent to the historical bloody crusades. Neither are the three people who may have died from your other example. This is the best you can do?\n\n It is meant literally, he went on a religious inspired hate of white men war. What do you call a crusade? Do you think he went on one like Billy Graham? :)\n \n The total number of deaths due to the crusades had been estimated at around nine million, at least half of which were Christians. \n source: Robertson, History of Christianity p168, web site: http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/crusades.html \n\n And your point is? I am aware of Christian victims of the Crusades, I am an Orthodox and we are full aware of the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Crusaders.\n \n Given below is one taken from Gesta Francorum (The Deeds of the Franks):\n \n The defenders fled along the walls and through the city, and our men pursued them killing and cutting them down as far as Solomon's Temple, where there was such a massacre that our men were wading ankle deep in blood ... Then the crusaders rushed around the whole city, seizing gold and silver, horses and mules, and looting the housing that were full of costly things. Then, rejoicing and weeping from excess of happiness, they all came to worship and give thanks at the sepulchre of our saviour Jesus. Next morning, they went cautiously up the temple roof and attacked the Saracens, both men and women [who had taken refuge there], cutting off their heads with drawn swords ... Our leaders then gave orders that all the Saracen corpses should be thrown outside the city because of the stench, for almost the whole city was full of dead bodies ... such a slaughter of pagans had never been seen or heard of, for they were burned in pyres like pyramids, and none save God alone knows how many they were. \n Same web site as above.\n\n Is this going somewhere? No one sane denies that the crusaders didn't do horrid things. You're the one however that's trying to link them with passages in the New Testament. Rather than address the challenge, you address one not made.\n \nBut anyway, how did the Orthodox Church turn any/most/all of these quotes you give into a call for a crusade? \n\n I note you've not answered this. You simply just say 'the church'. Yet often you acknowledge that there's 'divisions' in Christianity. If however here you mean all Christianity, then you are, as I suspect making one of your generalist and factless attacks.\n \nReally, then why just rant off that list above? This is the first thing you've said nice about Christ. Oddly enough you once thought that Jesus advocated violence and was comparable in that regards to Muhammad \n\n \nExactly. My point is that either text can be used and manipulated to encourage peace, or to encourage violence. I don't think the writers of the Gospels were encouraging the Crusades because they were clearly writing within the context of their own time and environment- they weren't speaking about Europeans and they did not have an opinion on the spice trade in Medieval times. So no, \"Christ\" did not cause the Crusades, and neither does the Koran necessarily lead one to violence. Both texts could be harvested for quotes which could be used either for proof of intolerance or to bolster intolerance.\n\n I still don't see your point. If you believe that texts can be interpreted any particular way, then St.Paul calling for submission is not of itself sexist, because you believe it can be interpreted differently. Therefore your objections are illogical. I've demonstrated that women have had a strong position in the early church - which of itself actually goes to prove your belief in interpretation of passages - therefore as I stated, you've got no leg to stand on, based on your own argument. Thank you.\n \n Further...\n We have two streams of thought.\n Jesus is the ideal example for Christians\n Jesus taught peace\n Jesus did not cause the crusades\n The Gospels did not cause the crusades.\n You've now stated you agree to these points.\n \n On the other hand (and we've got Muslim sources for these...)\n Muslims believe Muhammad was the ideal example for Moslems.\n Muhammad practiced paedophilia\n Muhammad ordered the execution of PoWs\n Muhammad applauded political assignations\n Muhammad lead armies into battle and ordered people (sometimes) to submit, or 'else'.\n \n But hey, you don't see any difference. I can't help it if you believe that such an ideal person is okay.\n \n You again avoid answering the question. If you've answered 'yes' or 'no' before, and I've missed it, why not just repeat it here, or cite where you answered this... for the public record \n\n \nThe 'public record' has already seen me say several times that adults having sex with children is reprehensible behaviour. I don't know why you keep missing it, maybe you should read the replies posted to you more thoroughly.\n\n Because you're missing the point. Muslims don't believe Aisha was a 'child'. So you're doing a very legalistic step like they are. Do you believe a nine year old is a child? They don't make such a ruling - for them adulthood comes for women when she menstruates. For the public record, you've actually tried to suggest that someone very young like her is in fact an adult.\n \nHowever, most Muslims believe that Muhammad was the ideal man, this same man who slept with a child, and therefore at the heart of their belief is a prophet who did many vile things.\n\n \nThat does not mean that they will be led to do this \"vile thing\" themselves.\n\n Oh dear, we back to straw-man again? I never said that they would I've said 'for the record' that most Muslims fail to 'live up' to this ideal. Not all Muslims will follow Muhammad's example and marry a nine year old, or a Christian, or a Jew. That still doesn't stop them venerating a man who did.\n \n At base, your argument with Islam is not that it encourages child abuse. You dismiss anyone within Islam who argues against child marriages as either \"not Muslim\" or \"fringe\" because your problem is not concern for young Muslim girls. It is that you believe that Muhammad was inspired by Satan, and therefore the religion is Satanic. *edited to add- I really wish you had been honest about this from the beginning.* How can anyone possibly argue against this idea with fact and reason?\n\n I mentioned this to you in a PM, but you have no respect for the \"Private\" notion of this. However, now that you've decided to go against all considerations of decency, yes, I do believe that Muhammad was inspired by Satan to sleep with a child. Regardless of whether you or anyone else believes in a real Satan, or many evil 'forces' or whatever, need not detract from the debate that is\n a) Muhammad is viewed by Muslims as an ideal man\n and\n b) He did many horrid things.\n Your attempt at ridicule is interesting though... let's see how it continues...\n \n You will persist in believing that Islam=Satanic=Evil no matter how much fact and logic you are presented with.\n\n What logic? You've present one so-called expert on the age of Aisha, and lots of supposition to boot.\n But, let's go for a huge ad hominem...\n \n The same way you persist in believing in \"Creationism\", and the Tooth Fairy, for all I know. There's really no point in continuing, as nobody can prove that Satan did or did not visit Muhammad, or if Satan exists at all. If there was a true debate happening, I would be interested in exploring the history of Lucifer/Satan the god of light/lightening in ancient Hebrew mythology and his transformation into the devil, but that isn't the case.\n\n Ouch. You are happy to make sweeping statements about 'the church' and the crusades, and I ask 'which church', and you just go on with a rant (above) about the cruelty of the crusades. No one denies this, but it doesn't answer the question. But when some people want to get on with a hate-crime, a rant can't be stopped for the sake of rational discussion.\n It is in fact irrelevant as far as rebuttal that I believe Satan exists. You can actually debate whether you believe that Muhammad did horrid things. For the sake of your argument, you need not see why. Instead, because you've failed with total lack of interest in proper research (laughably your sites don't, for the most part agree with you - even the site I gave, which you did actually read makes the point about Native American culture being part of the problem - note I make no dispute with the ultimate cause of the violence - however clearly the institutions that are Native culture are not capable of properly coping with the needs of women in their communities).\n \nThere's no point discussing the cultural ramifications of the Cinderella story with someone who believes that Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother are real people, or the history of Waterloo with someone who believes that they are Napoleon.\n\n I don't believe in a literal Prince Charming. You will go on reinventing argument, using straw-man, won't you.\n It is you who denies all fable/myth simply because it is shared in common - believing that it is only 'real' in people's minds... with no historic worth - oddly enough, you put down a great deal of Native American belief by doing so.\n And then you go denying one thing, then changing your mind, sheltering in pedantic arguments, quoting from phantom sites, then boiling it down to no matter how many experts I've quoted, I've not done so.\n Note, I could make fun of your belief in gods that are 'forces', but I am not you. :) You are the one who attacks all historical elements of myths; even by default, Native American ones. Such is your hate that you'd even attack your own people in an effort for the cheap shot against Christians - in this case on the issue of the flood.",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n \nMaximus wrote << The name \"Purgatory\" is not in the bible. But the \"place\" or \"state\" is mentioned. See my earlier post . . . \"1 Corinthians 3 is a good illustration of purgatory. Paul wrote, \"...I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.\" Then he speaks of the fact that \"any man's\" work will be put to the test.\"\n\n \n Terral's reply << Yes, Maximus. \"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.\" 2Cor. 5:10. \n \n However, this is not the judgment of Rev. 20:11-15. \"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" Rev. 20:15. Note that Paul tells us, \"Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\" 1Cor. 6:2. According to Paul, we actually participate in that final judgment. Again, our judgment before Christ is to determine our rewards. As it is written, \"Each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is {to be} revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the QUALITY OF EACH MAN'S WORK.\" 1Cor. 3:13 (Caps for emphasis).\n \n \nMaximus << Furthermore, you are confusing the theological concept of Limbo with the doctrine of Purgatory when you speak of the Fathers creating a place for non-baptized babies.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Yes, Maximus, my mistake, you are indeed correct; neither of which are supported by Scripture. A good place to see the difference in the two RC doctrines is here:\n \n http://www.conservativeonline.org/journals/06_19_journal/2002v6n19_id03.htm\n \n \nMaximus << Regarding not being judged on our sins what do you think of Paul's statement in Romans 2:5-8.\n\n \n Terral's reply << The Apostle Paul is here speaking to the unsaved, just as he speaks to the Jews in beginning in Rom. 2:17. Scripture says, \n \n \"But because of your [Unsaved] stubbornness and unrepentant heart you [Unsaved] are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS: to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.\" Rom. 2:5-8 (Caps for Paul's OT quotes). \n \n Again, the unsaved are the ones who \"did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.\" 2Thes. 2:10. Those souls never had a foundation to build upon like the 'saved' being addressed by Paul in 1Cor. 3:6-15. To those saved souls he wrote, \"For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.\" 1Cor. 3:9.\n \n \nMaximus << and Colossians 3:25?\n\n \n Terral's reply << Paul is here addressing our reward at the judgment seat of Christ (2Cor. 5:10, 1Cor. 3:6-15).\n \n \nMaximus asks << What do you mean when you say above that we are not judged by sins and then you quote 2 Corinthians 5:10 saying that we will be before the Judgment seat of Christ and recompensed for bad deeds? What are bad deeds? How will we be recompensed for them? Will we be rewarded for them, as you say that we will appear for rewards around the judgment seat?\n\n \n Terral's reply << A very good question. Look at Christ at the transfiguration. \"And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.\" Matt. 17:2. Then, imagine that each of us will stand before Him with the same white garments, before the judgment. Then read through Paul's descriptions of our judgment for rewards again. \n \n \"Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is {to be} revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.\" 1Cor. 3:12+13.\n \n The outcome of this judgment will see the members of the body of Christ placed into positions in His body like this: \"But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.\" 1Cor. 12:18. Each of us will place the works of this lifetime on the altar before the Lord. Then, fire shall rise up and consume them. Every single thing we present to others about God's Word is an offering and a sacrifice for that alter. Who has it right? And who has it wrong? \n \n Who among us is really teaching the things of the Spirit? And who is passing out the counterfeit doctrines of men? These things shall become evident to All in that day, as will all of our works in the flesh. If what remains is gold, silver and precious stones, then Christ will place that crown on our head for everyone to see throughout the 'ages to come' (Eph. 2:7). If, however, you place wood, hay and straw upon the altar, then the fire shall rise up to fill your garment with smoke, and our Lord shall place an itsy bitsy ring upon your finger. In that day we shall come to know that we would be far better off to keep our mouths shut, than to teach one of God's children in error.\n \n Those among us with great crowns filled with precious stones, and bright white garments, shall ascend to the top of the pyramid like structure, and have positions of honor near the capstone (Christ). Just one moment in the presence of one of these great souls shall leave a white glow upon the faces of all who see them, as a testament that they had indeed stood before a child of God. Those among us who have no crown at all, and dark garments shall occupy positions near the bottom of the same structure in New Jerusalem ('our mother' Gal. 4:26). And yet, \"he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.\" 1Cor. 3:15. \"As through fire\" is the smoke, but, compare that condition with those who are thrown into the fire in Rev. 20:15; big difference.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Mizmaxx, you should take your own advice\n Post 111 \"Islam\" thread\n \nThe point is that if you're looking to find horrendous things in a religion, take a sentence from an ancient text- it always looks bad.\n\n Yet, she has doggedly attacked Judeo-Christian beliefs based on her interpretations of a handful of Biblical quotes taken out of context.\n If I were to have just posted secondary non-Muslims sites such as\n \"If a minor child is given away by her father or grandfather the marriage is binding on her. A girl is often virtually forced to marry an old man because he owns some land or can provide a large dowry. The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time. Even today Islam believes a girl is adult at the first signs of puberty.\"\n http://pnews.org/art/5art/MISOGYNY.shtml\n One could easily suggest what Mizmaxx does, of my argument. However, I have taken Hadith quotes (quoted extensively elsewhere), and shown that the Hadith is both influential and well-respected. Further to this, I have shown Muslim interpretations of these verses.\n Which I recap...(first a quick look at when she's an adult)\n - Expert advice\n (i) When is a girl considered in Islam to be a woman? \n Muslim experts cite that once a girl menstruates, she's marriageable. This is based on the Koran...\n When in Islam is a girl a woman?\n Sura At-Talaaq\n 65:4\n \"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?ta...tabid=27&bid=65\n \"Thus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult.\"\n http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/Polemics/aishah.htm\n Here's the bits Mizmaxx has to ignore...\n The Actual advice to Muslims by Islamic centres of advice to Muslims... \n \"According to the Shari'ah, if a girl is a minor (did not attain puberty), she may be given in marriage by her father. When she attains puberty, she has the right to maintain the marriage or discontinue the marriage. There is no age limit to be intimate with one's wife even if she is a minor. \n It is important for you, in your situation, to consider the age difference reservation expressed by your wife. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best \n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\"\n http://islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6737\n Here's some more good Islamic advice...\n \"The appropriate age for marriage\n Question: What is the appropriate age for men and women to marry?

We hope for a response, may Allaah reward you.\n Response:... The Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) married ?Aa.ishah when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old.

Some of the young ladies of today do not accept to be married to men older than them and also some of the men do not get married from anyone older than them either. We hope for a response, may Allah reward you.\n Response: I advise the young ladies not to refuse a man because of his older age. Even if he be ten, twenty or thirty years older, this is not a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) married Aisha when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old. Older age is not harmful. \n http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/articl...rriage.html#age\n \"It is the duty of parents to arrange the marriage of their children when they come of age. The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has stressed that it should be taken seriously and with a full sense of responsibility. Abu Saeed Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas (R.A.) narrated that the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said \"Whoever is blessed by the Creator with children should give them good names, a good training, teach them good manners, and arrange for their marriage when they attain the age of puberty.  If he does not pay due heed to it and fails to get them married, on reaching marriageable age (due to negligence) and they take to ways that are forbidden, the father will be held responsible for it.\"\n http://www.islam.tc/social_conduct/social_conduct_of_a_muslim.htm\n Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems...\n Q). I have a nine year-old girl who is married to a person at the age of 20. The marriage contract was made a year ago but the girl is refusing to live with her husband or even to look at him. In addition to that she requires him to divorce her. Could you please advise me what to do? Should I separate them or force my daughter to live with him?\n (Name and address withheld) \n A). It is certainly possible for a father to get his daughter married to someone who he thinks is suitable for her. Whether he should force her into any marriage is something totally different Let me relate this to you: A woman companion of the Prophet came to him and said: \"My father has married me away to one of his relatives without asking my opinion. I do not wish to stay with this man as his wife.\" The Prophet ordered their separation. When she realized that she was free and that she was no longer married to the man, she said to the Prophet: \"I now accept what my father has done and I am marrying this man. I only did this so that women may know that it is not up to men to marry them away against their wishes.\"\n Scholars have discussed at length the marriage of a young girl who has not attained puberty and whether her father may marry her away without her permission. If such a marriage takes place it is valid.   However, it is perhaps best if the marriage is not allowed to be consummated until the girl attains puberty, when she is given the choice whether to continue with this marriage or not. Moreover her father may not marry her away to someone who is of a lesser status than hers. If he does and she objects, the marriage is not valid. Generally speaking, however. a girl must be asked to express her opinion in any proposed marriage. If she has been married before, then her verbal consent should be requested. If she has not been married previously, then her consent is also to be requested, but if she keeps quiet, her silence is taken as approval.\n To say that the marriage is valid is not to say that people should go ahead and make such marriages. There may be certain circumstances, which make it desirable or advisable that a very young girl should be married away in this manner but this must not be taken as the normal situation. In marriage, the normal thing is that people should marry when they are of marriageable age. That does not include girls of nine or ten years of age, although some girls may attain puberty that early. Marriage involves certain responsibilities and a very young girl could not be expected to shoulder these. There are also other problems, which the may face, as she grows older. If things go wrong with her marriage, she will always blame her father for having messed up her life, well intentioned though he may be. If you take the example of your own daughter, and you force her to go and live with her husband despite her protestations, you will never be sure whether the marriage will work out well or not. If it does, then well and good. But there is an equal chance that problems may arise especially with your daughter behaving like the child she is. While her husband expects from her the attitude of a married woman. How could you expect her to overcome the feeling that she has been thrown into this situation without being allowed the slightest say in the whole matter which is to affect the rest of her life?\n As we see it, your choice is either to get her divorced now, before the marriage is consummated or to keep her with you until she has attained puberty and she is in a position to express her opinion about this marriage. If she still objects to it, then you divorce her without any compulsion to go through with it. If, on the other hand, if she approves of this marriage, at that time, then you go ahead with it. Perhaps it is better for you to consult with the young man to whom you have already married her. He should be understanding and accommodating. Between the two of you should work out the best solution which ensures that he is not lumbered with marriage which is forced on a young girl who cannot be expected to give an opinion about such a matter.\n http://www.islamicvoice.com/august.98/marriage.htm#EAR\n This is why there was a dispute about having a mandatory age for consent recently in Nigeria... That is, this is Islam at work...\n \"Pegging the Marriageable Age The most contentious issue arising from the contents of the 2003 Child Rights Act is the feasibility, or otherwise, of pegging the marriageable age for the female gender by the Government. This appears to offend the culture that prevails in many communities of Northern Nigeria under which young girls are married off at ages between 9 and 16 years. Upon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste).'\n http://allafrica.com/stories/200407200423.html\n Action Items for the uttaqun: \n Single Muslims should have intentions to marry as soon as Islamically permissible and a suitable candidate for marriage is available. \n For a female, it is permissible to marry at any time near puberty. \n For a man, he is ordered to marry after puberty once he has established a means to support a family. \n It is recommended (in order to avoid being jailed) to not marry until old enough according to the laws in the land they live, but it is Islamically permissible before that. In the U.S., the typical legally permissible age is 14 or 15 with a parent's permission, but it will vary depending on where you live, so check with the local authorities first.\n http://www.muttaqun.com/marriage.html\n Q: Aalim has proved thru his research that Aisha?s (Rad.) age was not 9 at the time of her marriage, she was 19. one of the Raavi, due to weak memory started giving false hadith\n 1. If you made a mistake while performing the missed Rakaats, then you must compensate for that by making Sajdah-e-Sahw. \n 2. It is advisable to make Mashwara (consult) and/or make Istikhaara in all major issues even if one is confident. Our knowledge and insight is limited. The guidance of Allah Ta?ala is perfect and absolute. \n 3. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) was married at the age of six. The Ahaadith pertaining to this are in Bukhari and Muslim, all the narrators of these Ahaadith are authentic. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best \n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6778\n \"How can love of one man be divided equitably between so many women? Even the prophet himself was unable to do so. He cherished and worshipped his youngest wife Aiesha (his six-year old bride) more than the others. The institution of marriage of one man and multiple women is what was described by Ayatollah Ghomi, \"A rooster satisfies several hens, an stallion several mares. A woman is unavailable during certain periods where as a man is always active....\", LE MONDE, January 20, 1979. Therefore in Islam a man is nothing more than an animal slaved to his sexual needs. His function is to impregnate a multitude of women in order to expand the faith of Islam. No wonder Islam is so proud of men such as Mulla Omar, Khomeini, Usama Bin Laden and so on.\n Question: Is it possible to have intercourse with girls before puberty, would not this physically and mentally harmful to the girl. Is such a thing permissible in Islam, and if it is permissible then what is the minimum age for marriage execution in Islam, since puberty is not a requirement.\n Answer: In The Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. \n All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. \n Jurists discussed the issue of marrying a girl before puberty, i.e. a girl who might not be able to have sexual intercourse due to her young age. \n They agreed that the Wali can marry a girl before puberty. But when she reaches puberty, she has the right to choose either to nullify the marriage contract or to continue her marital life. \n Also, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, married `Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, before she reached the age of puberty. \n Hence, we conclude that puberty is not a condition for executing marriage. The only condition is the wife?s ability to bear responsibilities of marital life. However, we do not recommend marriage before puberty because at that early age the girl can?t fulfil her obligations towards her husband properly, nor can she know her rights towards him. \n Thus, to avoid any negligence or liability on her part we do not recommend marriage at such an early age. \n Allah Almighty knows best.\n Dr. Su`aad Ibrahim Salih\n http://www.islam-online.net/livefatwa/english/Browse.asp?hGuestID=YFCeOS\n (NOTE: When they say she can't bear her responsibilities, they mean she's probably unable to cook and clean for him)\n \"Bul\u00fbgh [Puberty]\n GENERAL DEFINITIONS:\n Throughout the booklet we have used the word ?MAS?ALA? which means the proposition or an explanation or an answer to expected Questions.\n MAS'ALA 1\n According to Shar\u00ee?ah when a person attains puberty he/she is said to have become B\u00e2ligh. No girl becomes B\u00e2ligh before the age of nine years. NB. Only lunar months and years are taken into consideration in Isl\u00e2mic matters, therefore, only lunar months and years are meant wherever these words appear in this booklet.\n MAS'ALA 2\n A girl is said to be B\u00e2ligh [matured] if she experiences any of the following:\n The monthly Period (Haiz - Menstruation) after the age of nine years.\n She enjoys intercourse in her dream and the mani [seminal fluid] is discharged.\n She has no menstruation, but becomes pregnant.\n MAS'ALA 3\n If the above signs are not evident but the girl reaches the age of fifteen years, she will also be regarded as having reached the age of puberty.\n MAS'ALA 4\n On reaching the age of puberty, all the principles of Isl\u00e2m, such as sal\u00e2h [nam\u00e2z], saum [roza], etc. become Fardh [obligatory] on her. If she disobeys or neglects any, then she becomes a sinner.\n MAS'ALA 5\n If a girl attains puberty before the age of fifteen and experiences ihtil\u00e2m [nocturnal wet dream] it would become w\u00e2jib [obligatory] upon her to have ghusl [bath].\"\n http://www.islamsa.org.za/library/hadiyatul_nisa.html\n \"Of the four ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in Sah\u00eeh al-Bukhari, two were narrated from cAishah (7:64 and 7:65), one from Ab\u00fb Hish\u00e2m (5:236) and one via 'Ursa (7:88). All three of the ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in Sah\u00eeh Muslim have cAishah as a narrator. Additionally, all of the ah\u00e2d\u00eeth in both books agree that the marriage betrothal contract took place when cAishah was \"six years old\", but was not consummated until she was \"nine years old\". Additionally, a had\u00eeth with the same text (matn) is reported in Sunan Ab\u00fb D\u00e2w\u00fbd. Needless to say, this evidence is - Islamically speaking - overwhelmingly strong and Muslims who deny it do so only by sacrificing their intellectual honesty, pure faith or both.\n This evidence having been established, there doesn't seem much room for debate about cAishah's age amongst believing Muslims. Until someone proves that in the Arabic language \"nine years old\" means something other than \"nine years old\", then we should all be firm in our belief that she was \"nine years old\" (as if there's a reason or need to believe otherwise!?!). In spite of these facts, there are still some Muslim authors that have somehow (?) managed to push cAishah's age out to as far as \"fourteen or fifteen years old\" at the time of her marriage to the Prophet(P). It should come as no surprise, however, that none of them ever offer any proof, evidence or references for their opinions. This can be said with the utmost confidence, since certainly none of them can produce sources more authentic than the had\u00eeth collections of Im\u00e2ms al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee and Muslim! Based on the research that I've done, I feel that there is a common source for those who claim that cAishah's age was \"fourteen or fifteen years old\" at the time of the marriage. This source is The Biographies of Prominent Muslims which is published in book form, on CD-ROM and is posted in several places on the Internet. Just another example of why going to the sources is important . . .\"\n http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Polemics/aishah.html\n (We concur with the general contents of the article. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6618)\n To counter this, Mizmaxx has said 'no it isn't', repeatedly. And as to these expert sites, well she pretends that it is not there interpretation, but mine. And then she's had the hide to make sweeping statements about 'the Church' using the Bible for the Crusades. I challenged her to make at least an attempt at a connection and she's only conceded that Jesus wasn't the cause of the crusades. Sadly Mizmaxx is conducting the type of argument she wrongly accuses me of! In fact, when I pressed her for a connection between her rant/list of Biblical quotes and the Crusades, she posts stuff about how horrid the Crusades were! Again, she can't answer a direct challenge, so rather than do this, she goes in for more of the unstructured ranting that she wishes I was guilty of. Why? Because she hates Catholics, she has no respect for their current leader, and even questions the mental faculties of family who are true to Catholicism.\n \n One Muslim woman says...\n I have come to the conclusion that the institution of marriage in Islam is nothing but a whorehouse for the man and a jailhouse for the woman.\"\n Parvin Darabi\n She was the first Iranian who was ever able to pass the board in Child-Psychiatry in U.S. and was the one who established the Psychiatric Clinic of Shahid Sahami in Tehran.\n http://members.aol.com/ahreemanxiii/page21.html",

   "Despite waves of evidences from Islamic sites, it's easy for you just to repeat this. \n\n Please. Your \"waves\" of evidence are just that many ppl agree with the traditional interpretation of Aisha's age. What the ad nauseum list of cites you provided doe not prove is your thesis- \"Islam is bad\". I doubt the people you cited would agree with you there, so I can safely say that you are wrong.\n \n \nOh, no, of course, I've only presented that Muslims hold Muhammad as the prime example of a person, and loads of primary evidence about him sleeping with a child. Then about a dozen Muslim sites that agree with this. Sure that's not a problem. :)\n\n It is a problem for many ppl, Muslims included. The article I cited is one example of a prominent member of a Muslim community who finds this problematic. It does not mean that Islam itself is problematic.\n \n \nReally, then how did whomever called a crusade use these passages.\n\n So you don't believe that Pope Urban believed he was divinely inspired and supported in calling the crusades?\n \n \nThat you should not go on criticising other people's versions of God with a sweeping statement, or they come back to bite you. \n\n Such as what \"sweeping statements\"? \n \n \nAfter all, you've got Native American deities that specialise in war.\n\n Again, I was well aware of that. What's your point?\n \n \nIt's good to see you on the hop about that Native American article that clearly says one of the problems is the culture.\n\n What does \"on the hop\" mean? Are you referring to the article which explained that abuse was not traditional to Native culture?\n \n \nI didn't say 'number of husbands' I said POLYGAMY which is one husband and a number of wives - go look up the word for the opposite. You don't think that polygamy, the idea of one man and many wives is anything about abuse?\n\n As I said, number of husbands or wives does not by necessity indicate their relationship. Why would it?\n \n \nFurther to that, if a woman knowlingly 'submits' to her husband, then you shouldn't have any problems then. She's not lost 'free will' at all... unless you just believe a woman's choice is only valid if she follows what you believe :)\n\n When you say \"knowingly\" and \"by choice\" do you mean \"because my god will make me burn in hell and my religious community will ostracize me if I don't\"?\n \n \nSo you're saying that Native Americans didn't have monogamy rules? Taboos regarding promiscuity?\n\n Not all Nations practiced required and homogenous monogamy. It isn't a universal necessity the way mutual respect and care for the land would be.\n \n \nIf some one yells \"Don't go in there!\", I can submit to this and still exhibit free will.\n\n Yes, because you are presuming that the other person knows about some reason why \"going in there\" is unsafe. If that person continues to \"cry wolf\" by telling you to do things just to control you, then listening to them is no longer a good idea. Thus, it is not good to suspend your own judgement as a rule.\n \nAnd you miss the point that the rules are about mutual obligation.\n\n If it's \"mutual\" then why is the husband the \"head\". Why are they not two seperate bodies with equal abilities and responsibilities?\n \n \nThen if you don't follow 'borders' why'd you exclude Mexico? \n\n Did you not read what I wrote? \n \n \nYour final sentence has too many negatives for me to actually work out what you're trying to say.\n\n Then I'll try again. \n \n Although Indigenous ppls globally share a lot in common, those who live closest to each other and in political union (such as confederacies) share even more of a historical and cultural link. Because we are now politically divided according to settler-state borders, our dealings with the settler-states differ accordingly.\n \n Therefore, when I use a term like \"Native ppls\" or \"Native Nations of US and Canada\", I am referring to a group of nations who have a degree of shared history as colonized nations.\n \n \nIt is meant literally, he went on a religious inspired hate of white men war.\n\n All it said was that he told Native ppl to stop drinking. And the other person you mentioned was responsible for what, three deaths? I hardly think that's comparable to the millions of deaths from the Crusades.\n \n \nIs this going somewhere? No one sane denies that the crusaders didn't do horrid things. You're the one however that's trying to link them with passages in the New Testament.\n\n No, I'm not. You're continually confused on this point.\n \n \nI still don't see your point. If you believe that texts can be interpreted any particular way, then St.Paul calling for submission is not of itself sexist, because you believe it can be interpreted differently. \n\n Texts can be interpreted any way, but that doesn't mean they didn't have an original intention. People constantly dismiss things in their religious tradition they find problematic. For example, someone could argue that St Paul merely stating his opinion, and that the structure of the early Christians (or the Holiness of Mary, or whatever else) are more accurate indicators of women's \"true\" place in Christianity. \n \n You seem to have this \"my way or the highway\" view of religion, which you also project onto others. There is no \"one, right\" way to be Christian, or Muslim, or whatever else. \n \n \nNot all Muslims will follow Muhammad's example and marry a nine year old, or a Christian, or a Jew. That still doesn't stop them venerating a man who did.\n\n So what? As long as they don't abuse children, as long as they don't believe abusing children is okay, what's the problem? Even if Muhammad did have sex with a child, if ppl who believe he is a good man believe he didn't do that, the fact that they venerate him does no harm. Unless you believe that Satan inspired him to lead ppl astray from Christianity, of course.\n \n \nI mentioned this to you in a PM, but you have no respect for the \"Private\" notion of this.\n\n a) How was I to know you wanted this kept secret?\n b) I don't keep track of where you say everything you say to me. \n \n Of course, you will believe I did this purposely, as part of my plot against you, and thus Christianity as a whole. Perhaps also directed by Satan? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nRegardless of whether you or anyone else believes in a real Satan, or many evil 'forces' or whatever, need not detract from the debate that is\n a) Muhammad is viewed by Muslims as an ideal man\n and\n b) He did many horrid things.\n\n And yet, even is this were true, this would not stop people from being Muslim and being good ppl at the same time. Aren't ppl wonderful?\n \n \nOuch. You are happy to make sweeping statements about 'the church' and the crusades, and I ask 'which church', and you just go on with a rant (above) about the cruelty of the crusades.\n\n You know very well it was the Roman Catholic Church. \n \n \nIt is in fact irrelevant as far as rebuttal that I believe Satan exists. \nNot if that is your sole reason for believing Islam is bad. Especially since you dishonestly pretended that this is not the main reason you attack Islam. \n \n \nclearly the institutions that are Native culture are not capable of properly coping with the needs of women in their communities\n\n Yawn... \n \n From the same article, again, because I guess reading more than a few sentences in sequence is beyond your abilities...\n \nMany traditional Native American histories indicate that when domestic violence did occur, the community responded. The batterer would be banished or ostracized, or retaliation was left to the male relatives of the victim. Such traditional methods of addressing domestic violence were eliminated or limited with the advent of a Western European criminal justice process.\n\n \n \nIt is you who denies all fable/myth simply because it is shared in common - believing that it is only 'real' in people's minds... with no historic worth\n\n Do you have a string on your back which, when pulled, repeats the same tired arguments?\n \n Again, and for the last time (because anyone with half a brain can discern this from my posts anyway), I never \"denied\" fable/myth, for any reason. You brought up commonality as evidence of historicity, and I argued against this fallacy. Nowhere did I say that commonality was evidence of non-historicity. Neither is it true that a myth must be historic to be 'real', in ppl's minds or otherwise.",

Are you referring to the article which explained that abuse was not traditional to Native culture?\n\n Yes, the same one that said that because of Native culture the problem remains such a major problem.\n \nI didn't say 'number of husbands' I said POLYGAMY which is one husband and a number of wives - go look up the word for the opposite. You don't think that polygamy, the idea of one man and many wives is anything about abuse? \n\n \nAs I said, number of husbands or wives does not by necessity indicate their relationship.

You mean how the native American community ostracises someone (re: the article you mentioned above) for speaking out on abuse?\n And you're the one who said one shouldn't take a verse out of any holy book!\n \n So you're saying that Native Americans didn't have monogamy rules? Taboos regarding promiscuity? \n\n \nNot all Nations practiced required and homogenous monogamy.

Why are they not two separate bodies with equal abilities and responsibilities?\n\n You're kidding again? The Prime Minister of Australia is the head of government of Australia, but still has duties and is bound (in theory) by law.

And the other person you mentioned was responsible for what, three deaths? I hardly think that's comparable to the millions of deaths from the Crusades.\n\n That's not the point. He is a Native American who inspired a war. Maximus made the point that if only for the lack of technology, Native Americans would have killed more people. The Prophet was responsible for a whole war. You then tried to deny the religious-base of this movement by suggesting that it was simply a 'crusade' in name. That got a good laugh from me, anyway.\n \n Is this going somewhere? No one sane denies that the crusaders didn't do horrid things. You're the one however that's trying to link them with passages in the New Testament. \n\n \nNo, I'm not. You're continually confused on this point.\n\n No you're confused. I challenged you to back your claim regarding the Bible and the Crusades. Rather then face this, you just posted a lot of stuff on something neither of us is disputing - that the Crusades caused lots of deaths.\n I'm still waiting for these 'proofs'\n \n I still don't see your point. If you believe that texts can be interpreted any particular way, then St.Paul calling for submission is not of itself sexist, because you believe it can be interpreted differently.\n\n \nTexts can be interpreted any way, but that doesn't mean they didn't have an original intention.

You've gone on now for weeks making these attacks on Christianity based on your own interpretations of the Bible. Then when pressed to show how Christians have used the Bible to promote the Crusades - your claim, you can't. Whereas I've presented evidences of Muslims, from Muslim sites, in how they actually interpret their holy books.\n \n You seem to have this \"my way or the highway\" view of religion, which you also project onto others. There is no \"one, right\" way to be Christian, or Muslim, or whatever else.\n\n Really. You're an expert now on how to be a Christian?\n \nNot all Muslims will follow Muhammad's example and marry a nine year old, or a Christian, or a Jew. That still doesn't stop them venerating a man who did.\n\n \nSo what? As long as they don't abuse children, as long as they don't believe abusing children is okay, what's the problem? Even if Muhammad did have sex with a child, if ppl who believe he is a good man believe he didn't do that, the fact that they venerate him does no harm. Unless you believe that Satan inspired him to lead ppl astray from Christianity, of course.\n\n Well a) the UN site I posted some days ago tells me that the act is harmful\n b) the Muslim sites I posted give advice to people to do it.\n So you're happy trying to ignore the irreconcilable two.\n \n I mentioned this to you in a PM, but you have no respect for the \"Private\" notion of this.\n\n \na) How was I to know you wanted this kept secret?\n b) I don't keep track of where you say everything you say to me.\n\n What do you think 'Private' means in Private Message. Thanks for saying sorry, not! Actually there's a few people I send info to in PMs, and just you and other has breached this. Kind of speaks volumes about the level of honesty... but I put my head on the chopping-table, I guess. I just didn't think you'd be the one with the axe.\n \nOf course, you will believe I did this purposely, as part of my plot against you, and thus Christianity as a whole. Perhaps also directed by Satan? \n\n Are you saying you accidentally typed the words?\n \nRegardless of whether you or anyone else believes in a real Satan, or many evil 'forces' or whatever, need not detract from the debate that is\n a) Muhammad is viewed by Muslims as an ideal man\n and\n b) He did many horrid things.\n\n \nAnd yet, even is this were true, this would not stop people from being Muslim and being good ppl at the same time. Aren't ppl wonderful?\n\n Again and again and again you seem to miss where I said that there are many good Muslims. This is despite their religion, for they are failing to live up to their 'ideal' man.\n \nOuch. You are happy to make sweeping statements about 'the church' and the crusades, and I ask 'which church', and you just go on with a rant (above) about the cruelty of the crusades. \n\n \nYou know very well it was the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n But when you say 'the church' and make it synonymous with the Roman Catholic Church, you are making them normative of Christianity. I actually find that offensive, because it excludes us; the Orthodox - and we claim to be the original church... we are 'the church'.\n I'd still like you to find those Christiana teachings that inspired Urban II\n By the way, you know that the Crusades were not an action, but a reaction. Most of the lands they went to fight in were previously Christian, but had been taken over by Islam.\n \nIt is in fact irrelevant as far as rebuttal that I believe Satan exists.\n\n \nNot if that is your sole reason for believing Islam is bad. Especially since you dishonestly pretended that this is not the main reason you attack Islam. \n\n Ah, I was waiting for the straw-man. I think that any religion founded by a paedophile, who orders the execution of PoWs and celebrates the odd assignation of people is not one batting for God's team. Call me strange.\n \nclearly the institutions that are Native culture are not capable of properly coping with the needs of women in their communities \n\n \nYawn... \n\n Now you know how I feel when you post such sh*te about Bible quotes.\n \nIt is you who denies all fable/myth simply because it is shared in common - believing that it is only 'real' in people's minds... with no historic worth \n\n \nDo you have a string on your back which, when pulled, repeats the same tired arguments?\n\n You mean like about you and the Crusades? But yes you say that just because they're common myths doesn't mean they have any historical worth.\n \n Again, and for the last time (because anyone with half a brain can discern this from my posts anyway), I never \"denied\" fable/myth, for any reason. You brought up commonality as evidence of historicity, and I argued against this fallacy. Nowhere did I say that commonality was evidence of non-historicity. Neither is it true that a myth must be historic to be 'real', in ppl's minds or otherwise.\n\n No you argued by using commonality - in regards a fairy story, that because this fairy story is also common, it is not real. I suggested that in fact it could be, because we have modern occurrences of like stories... and by extension if like stories in the modern era, then so much in the past. Therefore your analogy fails.",

My points were to the fact that there has been a sensationalism and exaggeration of the inquisitions at times.\n \n \nI think rounding ppl up and torturing then killing them for disagreeing with the authority of the Church is pretty clearly wrong, no matter what your belief system.\n\n \n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=695 \n \n \nWhere's your evidence of pre-colonization murder and torture among First Nations? \n \n \nFirst Peoples of the land now called \"Canada\" and \"United States\".\n\n Are the First Peoples/First Nations another name collectively for all Native Americans and Native Canadians? Or are they specific tribes/nations?\n \n Did the Iroquois and Eastern Indians participate in torture of captives?\n Did they participate in cannibalism?\n \n \nNope. Just wouldn't spend valuable time developing such things. Working on democracy, feeding everyone, and other things \"Western Civilization\" has never been very skilled at, by contrast.\n\n So Natives did not develop technology for warfare?\n \n Yet Natives, when offered a rifle,did utilize that superior technology to kill others in war, right? \n \n \nIt means sacrifice them. This was the original practice of the ancient Hebrews, and many other nearby faiths.\n\n Sanctify means to make holy.\n \n Why was Isaac not sacrificed and why we can read of the lives of first-born in the Bible if the Hebrews practiced sacrifice of the first-born??\n \n If indeed the Jews practiced sacrifice, then why, in your opinion, did they have a turning point at the very beginning of their written history that changed their practice and outlawed sacrifice? \n \n \nThe Bible is contradictory- the anti-sacrifice messages are later interpolations. According to Barbara G. Walker, ancient Hebrews \"did retain a custom of human sacrifice, for special occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of influence of the Roman Empire\". Her source is Franz Cumont's Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism. \n\n The Hebrews retained a custom of sacrifice for special occasions but their most holy and influential book does not contain any evidence of it? \n \n \nEr, that only washes if you happen to believe that the Bible is literal, and there was a god Yahweh interecting with the Ancient Hebrews. \n \n I don't believe the Bible is always literal but it sometimes is. I do believe that there was a god interacting with the Hebrews.\n \n I\n think it should be obvious. Submission is giving up your own judgement in exchange for someone else's- never a good thing, IMO. Noone who is truly in love wants the one they love to literally \"submit\" to them. \n \n So if you want to watch TV and your spouse wants to watch something else it is not good, out of love, to let them watch what they want?\n \n If your spouse is sick and wants you to put a cold rag on their forehead or give them a massage to ease their pain but you are in the middle of a cool computer game and don't want to stop playing then it is bad to submit to your spouse's requests and do something kind for him/her.\n \n It is not good if you see your spouse about to be hit by a car to submit your own will of self-preservation to push them out of the way due to your love for them? (As Paul would ask a man to do for his wife).\n \n \nEspecially as he said that they were the \"heads\".\n\n Are there any Native cultures in which the men are viewed as the head of the household or tribe?\n \n Can women participate in religious/spritual ceremonies in Native culture?\n \n Have you ever heard of Kateri Tekakwitha?",

   "Terral,\n \nTerral's reply << Yes, Maximus, my mistake, you are indeed correct; neither of which are supported by Scripture. A good place to see the difference in the two RC doctrines is here:\n\n The name \"Purgatory\" is not found in scripture but it is supported by Scripture as my early posts attest. Though I sometimes tire of defending every Christian idea or practice by the Bible alone when the doctrine of sola scriptura  is one that cannot be found in scripture or supported by scripture. One cannot find a scriptural support for the idea that all doctrines must be supported by scripture.\n \n \nTerral's reply << The Apostle Paul is here speaking to the unsaved, just as he speaks to the Jews in beginning in Rom. 2:17. Scripture says, \n \n \"But because of your [Unsaved] stubbornness and unrepentant heart you [Unsaved] are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS: to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.\" Rom. 2:5-8 (Caps for Paul's OT quotes). \n \n \n \nAgain, the unsaved are the ones who \"did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.\" 2Thes. 2:10. Those souls never had a foundation to build upon like the 'saved' being addressed by Paul in 1Cor. 3:6-15. To those saved souls he wrote, \"For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.\" 1Cor. 3:9.\n \n \n \nTerral's reply << Paul is here addressing our reward at the judgment seat of Christ (2Cor. 5:10, 1Cor. 3:6-15).\n\n And what about when Paul speaks to the \"saved\" charging them to avoid giving away their salvation by sin? Romans 11:22, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 1 Corinthians 10:11-12, 2 Timothy 2:11-13? What of the writings in Hebrews that tell us that those who have been shown the truth can choose to forsake it? (Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-27)\n \n \nTerral's reply << A very good question. Look at Christ at the transfiguration. \"And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.\" Matt. 17:2. Then, imagine that each of us will stand before Him with the same white garments, before the judgment. Then read through Paul's descriptions of our judgment for rewards again. \n \n \"Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is {to be} revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.\" 1Cor. 3:12+13.\n \n The outcome of this judgment will see the members of the body of Christ placed into positions in His body like this: \"But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.\" 1Cor. 12:18. Each of us will place the works of this lifetime on the altar before the Lord. Then, fire shall rise up and consume them. Every single thing we present to others about God's Word is an offering and a sacrifice for that alter. Who has it right? And who has it wrong? \n \n Who among us is really teaching the things of the Spirit? And who is passing out the counterfeit doctrines of men? These things shall become evident to All in that day, as will all of our works in the flesh. If what remains is gold, silver and precious stones, then Christ will place that crown on our head for everyone to see throughout the 'ages to come' (Eph. 2:7). If, however, you place wood, hay and straw upon the altar, then the fire shall rise up to fill your garment with smoke, and our Lord shall place an itsy bitsy ring upon your finger. In that day we shall come to know that we would be far better off to keep our mouths shut, than to teach one of God's children in error.\n \n Those among us with great crowns filled with precious stones, and bright white garments, shall ascend to the top of the pyramid like structure, and have positions of honor near the capstone (Christ). Just one moment in the presence of one of these great souls shall leave a white glow upon the faces of all who see them, as a testament that they had indeed stood before a child of God. Those among us who have no crown at all, and dark garments shall occupy positions near the bottom of the same structure in New Jerusalem ('our mother' Gal. 4:26). And yet, \"he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.\" 1Cor. 3:15. \"As through fire\" is the smoke, but, compare that condition with those who are thrown into the fire in Rev. 20:15; big difference.\n\n So you're saying that Jesus' work is unfinished and he has more to do to purify us before we get to heaven? He doesn't simply cover us in his blood and ignore our sinfulness?",

   "They agree he slept with a nine year old. I find that repugnant. They don't.\n\n That's just not true. Some Muslims do, some don't. Some don't think it happened that way. We've been over this several times, but you're still confused about it. \n \n \nThen you need to ask yourself if you find a man approaching 50, sleeping with a nine year old, is really the sort of man to base a religion on.\n\n What difference does it make who founded the religion? If you found out St Paul was a murderer, would you abandon Christianity?\n \n \nIt was you who made the claim several days ago, \n\n I figured it would go without saying that a Pope would feel they were acting with the approval of their god.\n \n People who participated in Pope Urban II's crusade were offered complete freedom to violate any and every law, \"promised forgiveness of sins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory\". Then there was the Crusade against the Prussians by Pope Honorius. Crusaders were also promised \"blanket pardon for their sins\" by Pope Gregory IX in their attack on German peasants. When Pope Alexander III anathemized the Cathars, for among other offenses \"reading the Bible themselves\", he sent ecclesiastical judges to Catharan communities, which is where the word \"Inquisitor\" was used for the first time. Are you going to argue that these Inquisitors did not use the Bible as \"evidence\" against their victims? I can quote you Inquisition transcriptions which show that they did. (all quotes from Barbara Walker's Encyclopedia of Mythology)\n \n \nSuch as the one regarding the Crusade.\n\n Oh, that one statement I made re the Crusades. \n \n \nYes, the same one that said that because of Native culture the problem remains such a major problem.\n\n That wasn't what it said at all. Maybe you should read it a few times.\n \n \nOstracise? You mean how the native American community ostracises someone (re: the article you mentioned above) for speaking out on abuse?\n\n This is getting really pathetic.\n \n \nAnd you're the one who said one shouldn't take a verse out of any holy book!\n\n I never said that. You're not making sense.\n \n \nSo, husbands and wives, hopefully develop trust. Submission based on free will and trust is not as bad as you make it sound.\n\n It's not based on free will and trust if it's commanded.\n \n \nJust because someone is the 'head' doesn't mean that they can do whatever they want, for the husband, in Christianity is bound by love...\n\n So, you think men should rule their wives, but lovingly?\n \n \nYou left Mexico out for over-sight... \n\n I left Mexico out because none of my people live in Mexico, whereas some live in the \"US and Canada\". Besides, indigenous ppl don't stop at the Mexican border, most of Guatemala is native, as are many ppl in the rest of central and south america. However, their cultures and histories are very different from mine. So, for the sake of simplicity, and because that is where my knowledge lies, I talk about Canadian and US Native nations. \n \n \nI note your own confederacy dates only a few years (being revived from an earlier one)\n\n LOL.... I'm so embarrassed that my Confederacy isn't old enough for you! :p \n \n \nThat's not the point. He is a Native American who inspired a war. \n\n But not a Crusade.\n \n \nReally. You're an expert now on how to be a Christian?\n\n I'm not the one who claims to be.\n \n \nSo you're happy trying to ignore the irreconcilable two.\n\n Wow. Some Muslims use their religion as justification for doing bad things. That makes them.... just like Christians, and everyone else. \n \n \nAre you saying you accidentally typed the words?\n\n emoticon_rolleyes No, but I also didn't purposely \"reveal\" an obviously private piece of information. We are having this argument on several threads, as well as in PM. I really don't keep a notebook detailing when and where you say every ridiculous thing you say.\n \n \nThis is despite their religion, \n\n As you define it, not as they do.\n \n \nBut when you say 'the church' and make it synonymous with the Roman Catholic Church, you are making them normative of Christianity. I actually find that offensive, because it excludes us; the Orthodox - and we claim to be the original church... we are 'the church'.\n\n Were you 'the church' operating in Europe in the early second millenia?\n \n \nMost of the lands they went to fight in were previously Christian, but had been taken over by Islam.\n\n And before they were Christian, they were something else, but were taken over by Christianity. \n \n \nI think that any religion founded by a paedophile, who orders the execution of PoWs and celebrates the odd assignation of people\n\n Your description of Islam is overly simplistic. Besides, there are no \"teams\".\n \n \nNo you argued by using commonality - in regards a fairy story, that because this fairy story is also common, it is not real. I suggested that in fact it could be, because we have modern occurrences of like stories... and by extension if like stories in the modern era, then so much in the past.\n\n You're making absolutely no sense. Obviously I wouldn't use an example of commonality as non-historicity to argue against the idea that commonality=historicity. I used an example of commonality to show that commonality does not = historicity. The Cinderella story is common, that does not prove that the European fairy-story is historical. The Flood story is common, that does not prove that the Genesis story is historical. It's really that simple.\n \n \nShe seems however still stuck with wondering why it's a problem that he should be a real horrid person.\n\n You haven't proven that he was \"a real horrid person\". And it wouldn't make Islam bad for Muhammad to be a \"real horrid person\" unless Islam was making ppl do bad things too. Which it doesn't.\n \n \nAre the First Peoples/First Nations another name collectively for all Native Americans and Native Canadians? Or are they specific tribes/nations?\n\n They are terms used to describe Native people, usually of US/Canada, because the borders of the two countries do not correspond to our own.\n \n \nDid the Iroquois and Eastern Indians participate in torture of captives?\n Did they participate in cannibalism?\n\n Do you have convincing evidence that they did pre-Colonization?\n \n \nSo Natives did not develop technology for warfare?\n\n They developed technology in all kinds of areas, but did not concentrate on means of killing the way Europeans did/do.\n \n \nYet Natives, when offered a rifle,did utilize that superior technology to kill others in war, right?\n\n Certainly in response to the situation many did.\n \n \nWhy was Isaac not sacrificed and why we can read of the lives of first-born in the Bible if the Hebrews practiced sacrifice of the first-born??\n\n Because the stories are not written chronologically at the time they are intended to describe.\n \n \nIf indeed the Jews practiced sacrifice, then why, in your opinion, did they have a turning point at the very beginning of their written history that changed their practice and outlawed sacrifice?\n\n They didn't. Do you have evidence that they were not practicing ritual sacrifice at the beginning of their written history, or are you presuming that the present OT is from the beginning of their written history?\n \n \nThe Hebrews retained a custom of sacrifice for special occasions but their most holy and influential book does not contain any evidence of it?\n\n Because it was taken out. If you won't take mine and Walker's and Cumont's word for it, this site (http://www.come-and-hear.com/editor/br_3.html) also explains-\n \n \nHuman Sacrifice, the Talmud, and the Moloch Problem\n \n Blood Ritual: - Blood ritual is fundamental to Judaism. Some blood sanctifies, some blood defiles. Let's see what the Talmud doctrines are.\n \n Moloch was an idol worshipped by the Hebrews and some other people of the area. The priests burned a large fire within the idol, and according to a number of Biblical and Talmudic references, the Hebrews sacrificed their children to the god by throwing them - live - into the fire (the children were termed \"thy seed,\" and the act, \"pass[ing them] through the fire\" in KJV). Accounts vary in details, e.g., the god was Canaanite in origin and only intermittently adopted by the Hebrews; the children were killed before they were burned (Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. Moloch); the god was Carthaginian and the children were cast into the fire by priests, not parents (Gustave Flaubert [5]); etc.(...)\n \n No one today seriously suggests present-day Jews sacrifice children to Moloch. Moloch (sometimes spelled \"Molech\") was an Old Testament god whom the Hebrews worshipped from time to time, and to whom they sacrificed their children. The Babylonian Talmud, however, still permits Jews to sacrifice children to Moloch - under certain conditions.\n \n LORD God Accepts Human Sacrifice\n \n First, let's get perspective. Some mistakenly believe human sacrifice is forbidden in the Old Testament. Certainly, some of the prophets railed against it. But in at least one book, LORD God accepts human sacrifice. And in another book, LORD God is appeased by human sacrifice.\n \n In the following account from the Book of Judges, the Israelite warrior Jephthah is about to set off to make war on the Ammonites. In payment for victory, Jephthah promises LORD God he will sacrifice the first \"whatsoever\" that comes from his house to greet him upon his return. Unless Jephthah keeps oxen, sheep, goats, or chickens in his living room, he must expect the promised victim will be a human being. Notice that Jephthah does not promise to sacrifice \"an ox\" or \"a goat,\" etc. (7)\n\n \n \nI don't believe the Bible is always literal but it sometimes is. I do believe that there was a god interacting with the Hebrews.\n\n Well, it does your argument no good to presume that other posters on the this debate forum share your faith.\n \n \nIt is not good if you see your spouse about to be hit by a car to submit your own will of self-preservation to push them out of the way due to your love for them? (As Paul would ask a man to do for his wife).\n\n None of your examples are acts of submission. However, if a person is doing any of the above things for their spouse only because they have been told to \"submit\" to them, then yes, that is a bad thing.\n \n \nAre there any Native cultures in which the men are viewed as the head of the household or tribe?\n\n Mine is not a culture where women were viewed as possessions of their husbands in that sense, no. Also, women's political position was very different. More North American Native Nations had very powerful political positions for women, which had overriding authority in some areas.\n \n \nHave you ever heard of Kateri Tekakwitha?\n\n Yes, of course, I have friends in Kanehwake. What about her?",

   "Mizmaxx, the only thing I'm confused about is your level of honesty. Even sources you cited as proofs show that the Hadiths are well respected and these are the primary sources for our notion of what Muhammad and Aisha did.\n Further to that, we've already been over their idea that she wasn't a child, simply because they arbitrarily declare that anyone reaching puberty is an adult, so for a Muslim to say \"Muhammad didn't sleep with a child\" it has a ring of truth about it, only until you look at what they believe a 'child' is.\n You revert again here to the notion 'some' Muslims believe one thing, others don't. By this logic you can never post your stance about keeping out of Native American sweats, because not all Native Americans agree with you, so you should instead of posting your stance as the authority of a spokeswoman - which you do, you should have just stated 'this is what I personally believe'. You never did, so you are again caught by your own double-standards (see also your own advice about taking any passage of a Holy Book out of context - I mean, just how many times you've done that is incredible).\n \nThen you need to ask yourself if you find a man approaching 50, sleeping with a nine year old, is really the sort of man to base a religion on.\n\n \nWhat difference does it make who founded the religion?\n\n It matters if they hold such a man up to be the ideal man, and they do.\n \nIf you found out St Paul was a murderer, would you abandon Christianity?\n\n What a strange illogical concept. St. Paul didn't found Christianity. Christ did. You seem to forget our little PM wherein I have stated that many a Patriarch of the Orthodox Church was bad (but hey, you like selective quotes). But I don't follow him, if he's contrary to Christ. That is in fact an Orthodox notion, we don't have a supreme example of humanity in the way a Muslim does. There are many times that the people in Orthodoxy even rejected what councils declared... notably c.800 during the Iconoclastic revolution and c.1453. We acknowledge that the people in Orthodoxy, from people to Patriarch are human. We don't say \"We will follow the example of Patriarch George\". Christ is our example. Find something bad about the example, and you have a case. You're clutching at straws.\n Look at a court case where someone incites hatred. They are just as guilty as the person committing the act. I pointed out with the Nazis that some Nazis, notably Oscar Schindler didn't follow Nazi ideology to the letter - does this mean that Hitler's example is good? By your rationale, it is. What matter is it that Hitler was a horrid man when you can find people who, even though part of the Nazi Party, didn't follow through the example. Many good Muslims are bad at being Muslim because they don't follow Muhammad's example\n If you spurred on someone to commit an act, we could blame them AND you. If they don't listen to you, that still doesn't negate what you did was bad.\n There's the rub\n Islam -\n Nazism\n Both started by aggressive, horrid people. Both often proclaimed peace.\n Not all followers followed their leader to the ultimate ends.\n For one, you think this excuses the ideology, for the other, not. You apply the rule differently when both cases are so similar.\n \nIt was you who made the claim several days ago, \n\n \nI figured it would go without saying that a Pope would feel they were acting with the approval of their god.\n People who participated in Pope Urban II's crusade were offered complete freedom to violate any and every law, \"promised forgiveness of sins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory\". Then there was the Crusade against the Prussians by Pope Honorius. Crusaders were also promised \"blanket pardon for their sins\" by Pope Gregory IX in their attack on German peasants. When Pope Alexander III anesthetized the Cathars, for among other offences \"reading the Bible themselves\", he sent ecclesiastical judges to Catharan communities, which is where the word \"Inquisitor\" was used for the first time. Are you going to argue that these Inquisitors did not use the Bible as \"evidence\" against their victims? I can quote you Inquisition transcriptions which show that they did. (all quotes from Barbara Walker's Encyclopaedia of Mythology)\n\n So? I've already acknowledge the Crusades did bad things. You're still not answering the question put - show me the Bible verses that the Pope used. It was your claim that the Bible - you listed off the verses - was full of verses that could/were used to begin the Crusades. So far, your best effort has been ignoring the challenge for a few days, then after numerous reminders you say \"What was the question?\". Then you post a lot of stuff that doesn't answer the question - but shows what most people know already - the Crusaders did some bad things. Now you've got the Pope making an announcement based on what? Did he just make this up? Is he actually quoting Scripture? I expect you'll ignore this for some more days and then go \"what was the question?\"\n Since you raised it here - What passages of the Bible - concerning the reading of the Bible for oneself - is said to require punishment by Crusade? Please quote the chapter and verse, if you will.\n You're still arguing the way you accuse me otherwise :)\n \nSuch as the one regarding the Crusade.\n\n \nOh, that one statement I made re the Crusades.\n\n Yes, I asked you explicitly immediately after you made it, then you ignored it, then I reminded you, then you feign forgetfulness, then I remind you again.\n \nYes, the same one that said that because of Native culture the problem remains such a major problem.\n\n \nThat wasn't what it said at all. Maybe you should read it a few times.\n\n Indeed it was, it stated, and we agree on this, that the abuse is not natural to Native American society, but because of the kinship systems there, people can be ostracised for seeking outside help -thus there are social constraints placed on women seeking help - thus helping that abuse live.\n \"The Native American family is an extended one that includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, as well as adopted relatives. The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family. Native American families are very close. If domestic violence occurs, the family is expected to take care of the problem. If a Native American woman goes outside the family for help, she is ostracized by her family and the batterer's family.\"\n http://www.msnusers.com/WomenandAbu...ricanwomen.msnw\n also\n \"Native American spirituality can be a source of profound support, comfort, and healing for many battered women. According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition, [b]it can also serve to keep them in abusive relationships.[b] The idea of connectedness to the earth and to each other is frequently used by the batterer and other family members as a reason for the woman to remain in a violent relationship.\"(Ibid.)\n Yes, I've read it a few times. You must have missed these bits. :)\n \nAnd you're the one who said one shouldn't take a verse out of any holy book! \n\n \nI never said that. You're not making sense.\n\n Ah, you're other favourite tactic! But, for those out there who've missed it before...\n Post 111 \"Islam\" thread\n \nThe point is that if you're looking to find horrendous things in a religion, take a sentence from an ancient text- it always looks bad.\n\n So I can't wait for your re-working of this one :)\n \nBut when you say 'the church' and make it synonymous with the Roman Catholic Church, you are making them normative of Christianity. I actually find that offensive, because it excludes us; the Orthodox - and we claim to be the original church... we are 'the church'. \n\n \nWere you 'the church' operating in Europe in the early second millennia?\n\n By area, we had most of it. (I don't know about population figures of the day, so I won't make the claim of numeric superiority) Orthodoxy covered Russia, which alone was bigger than all of western Europe. The Byzantine Empire extended over the Balkans, Greece etc. Bulgaria, Serbia etc also Orthodox. How you missed them (?) is rather typical of you arguing out of ignorance... although you did post it as a question - your 'get out of trouble' card.\n So, are you claiming ignorance of eastern Europe? Even Ireland prior to the Synod of Whitby, was Orthodox - and hence all the areas of Britain influenced by them was also.\n And to that fact we're the oldest Christian Church\n Further to that I know that Orthodox never would cosider having fighting monks, like they did in the west, and any individual monk who donned the warriors vests was kicked out of his order. So, when you talk about 'the Church', you need to be careful. You'd be really annoyed if I tried to suggest that because one group of Native Americans; Aztecs believed in human sacrifice, that your tribe did too! (though I don't know that they didn't)\n \nMost of the lands they went to fight in were previously Christian, but had been taken over by Islam. \n\n \nAnd before they were Christian, they were something else, but were taken over by Christianity.\n\n And your point? Are you saying Christendom had no right to defend itself? I guess by here you are trying to sow a little more of your doubt - which would only work if you actually show that these areas were militarily conquered by Christianity in the first place. But I suspect, like your statement above, you actually know very little about the east. You see, those areas were conquerored, but by pagan Rome. Into that already established empire, Christianity spread. For 300 years through persecutions by that very empire until, filled up from within, the Empire itself became Christian. Islam burst into the Christian world and 'liberated' it. I use that term, because I've come across numerous silly notions that for instance Constantinople - when captured by the Turks, was 'liberated'. Your notions are almost as funny. It's why I still enjoy debating you of all people.\n Quote=Montalban] I think that any religion founded by a paedophile, who orders the execution of PoWs[/quote]\n \nYour description of Islam is overly simplistic.\n\n A religion that holds such a man to be the ideal, is not a good system to work under. See analogy re: Nazism. There are some ideologies which at their heart, are bad... even if people are exceptional within those systems. I'm sure there's some great North Koreans too, but I don't think there's is an ideal political system. Likewise, I've seen the film \"The Killing Fields\" and know that there were some nice members of Pol Pot's regime. You simply rely on exceptions being the rule. And cast a little doubt here and there accordingly. All because you hate Christianity - hence you don't follow your own advice when you want to debunk it, but taking verses out of context, and drawing some really thin link to the Crusades. You have posted some very simplistic 'jingoistic' arguments such as \"Crusades were bad\" therefore \"The Christian Bible can be used to kill!\"",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \nDo you have convincing evidence that they did pre-Colonization?\n\n Are you saying that the Natives could not think for themselves but followed the Colonizers as a dog on a leash?\n \n \nThey developed technology in all kinds of areas, but did not concentrate on means of killing the way Europeans did/do.\n\n Warriors concentrated on killing from their youth through adulthood but you're right they didn't use the means of killing the Europeans did.\n \n \nCertainly in response to the situation many did.\n\n So it wasn't an antipathy against killing or technology. It was a lack of technology?\n \n \nThey didn't. Do you have evidence that they were not practicing ritual sacrifice at the beginning of their written history, or are you presuming that the present OT is from the beginning of their written history?\n\n I would like to see your evidence that they were. Yes, I am presuming that the OT is the beginning of their written history but I am not well-versed in that area.\n \n \nBecause it was taken out. If you won't take mine and Walker's and Cumont's word for it, this site (http://www.come-and-hear.com/editor/br_3.html) also explains-\n\n If they were sacrificing they stopped didn't they? What made them stop?\n \n You give examples of Israelites sacrificing to Moloch but that is exactly what the Hebrew God forbid. Those sacrificing to Moloch cannot be used as an example of the Jewish faith.\n \n \nWell, it does your argument no good to presume that other posters on the this debate forum share your faith.\n\n I was not presuming anything. I was simply stating my belief in response to you asking.\n \n \nNone of your examples are acts of submission. However, if a person is doing any of the above things for their spouse only because they have been told to \"submit\" to them, then yes, that is a bad thing.\n\n What are they examples of, if not submission?\n \n \nMine is not a culture where women were viewed as possessions of their husbands in that sense, no. Also, women's political position was very different. More North American Native Nations had very powerful political positions for women, which had overriding authority in some areas.\n\n Yours is not but can one find examples of patriarchy and male domination in Native culture? Were the women allowed to do the Ghost Dance in the Lakota nation? Are women allowed to participate in sweats in your culture?\n \n \nYes, of course, I have friends in Kanehwake. What about her?\n\n She was mentioned in a Catholic newspaper I was reading last week. I was wondering if you knew anything about her and what you thought of her.",
