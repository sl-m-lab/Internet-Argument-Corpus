   "After cain killed Abel he is banished. Were did his wife come from if Adam and Eve were not present to produce any more children. Also if Cains wife is one of Adam and Eve's children that would make her Cains sister. Is incest one of those good traditional biblical values? How does this square with leviticus? Cain clearly commited a second abination, before God, worthy of death by having sex and children with his sister. Do modern evangelicals really want this type of perversion such as incest taught to children?",

Remember that Adam and Eve pranced around the garden completely nakid. Besides how would you know what goes on at a pride parade unless you have been watching one.\n \n \nNo matter how you turn it, with the theory of a single originator pair for humanity, incest inevitably comes into it with the second generation.

They will spout levitical laws, and even say that levitical moral law is still in effect, while ignoring that their creation story is full of incest which they gladly teach to their children. So if it wasn't a sin for Seth and Cain to have sex with their sisters then why is it a sin in the days of moses? Then there is Shem, Ham, and Japeths children having sex with first cousins; how is this good biblical values? Yet this is also taught to children while condemming my people.",
