You claim that this article doesn't refute that sexuality is entirely [I didn't say entirely] determined by genetics and to support this you bring up differences in epigenetic factors, which are different due to environmental factors and not genetics (twins are epigenetically indistinguishable [don't know what \"epigenetically indistinguishable\" means] during the early years of life).

The environment (ingesting pollutants) could very well be acting upon gene expression.\n\n \n \n I think we are agreeing. Just using different terms. If an environmental factor alters gene expression, the resulting phenotype has a genetic basis. That's all I am saying. If the genes cause it - it's genetic. \n \n In any event, for this reason, a single pair of twins who act differently is proof of nothing.\n \n If identical twins have different \"personalities\", which happens all the time, that doesn't mean that personality necessarily must have an environmental basis. If a great number of genetically similar people are statistcally more likely to share similar traits (like personality) than genetically dissimilar people, that strongly suggests that the trait has a genetic basis. This has been demonstrated in homosexuality. \n \n My main point it: The argument that any differences in identical twins must be environmental is not correct. \n \n Is sexual orientation genetically based? Like everything else, I think it's a both nature and nurture. I really don't care either way, but there is strong evidence that there is at least some genetic component.\n \n I am sorry to barge in here an hijack the mercury issue.
