In contrast, we now know that there were many different sub-groups within ancient Judaism, and that the early \"Jesus Movement\" was just one of many different Jewish groups. Moreover, the separation of Christianity from Judaism was not sudden, but happened gradually over several generations.\n \n Judaism at the time of Jesus was both unified and divided, much like Christianity is today. All Jews believed and practiced some core aspects of their religion (Monotheism, the Law of Moses, Circumcision, etc. -- see Covenants and Pillars of Ancient Judaism), but different Jewish groups debated and disagreed with each other about many details (expectations of the Messiah, ritual and purity laws, how to live under foreign domination, etc.). Similarly all Christians today agree on certain core items (Jesus is the Son of God, the NT has 27 books, etc.) but disagree on many details (the number of sacraments, forms of worship, role of faith and good works, etc.).\n \n To understand the separation of Christianity from Judaism, consider the analogy of parents and teenagers. Sometimes tensions within a family cause a separation; but do the parents throw the teenagers out, or do the teenagers run away from home? Sometimes it is the parents, sometimes the teens, and sometimes both! The religious situation in the first century was similar: sometimes a local group of Christians were ostracized or forced to leave Judaism; in other cases Christians chose to separate themselves from their Jewish heritage.\n \n Also, whose \"fault\" is it when parents and teenagers separate? Usually at least a little of both. Rarely do parents kick well-behaved children out of the house, and rarely do teens run away from parents who are not overly harsh or demanding. Similarly in the first century, certain factors on both sides caused those Jews who believed in Jesus as the Messiah (later called \"Christians\") to separate from the majority of Jews who thought believing in Jesus was wrong and potentially harmful to their religion.\n \n While some of the later writings of the NT show great hostility and nasty polemics between Jews and Christians, most of the arguments between Jesus and his contemporaries should be seen as inner-Jewish controversies. Not only did Jesus and his disciples disagree with and argue against various groups of other Jews, but these other groups also had major disagreements and arguments with each other on a whole variety of topics.\n \n To understand the New Testament properly, especially the life of Jesus as presented in the Gospels, one needs to learn about the wide variety of different Jewish groups that existed in the first century. Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian, describes three major Jewish groups and their \"philosophies\" or ways of life: Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. He also mentions various other political and revolutionary groups of Jews active in the first century CE, especially during the first War against Rome.\n \n Where did you get your information on the 'not many'?",

They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the LORD, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings. [b] 6 The priest is to sprinkle the blood against the altar of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 7 They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols [c] to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.'8 \"Say to them: 'Any Israelite or any alien living among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice 9 and does not bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD -that man must be cut off from his people.\n \n 11 For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life. 12 Therefore I say to the Israelites, \"None of you may eat blood, nor may an alien living among you eat blood.\"\n \n Jesus wasn't offered at the alter, he wasn't even in the city when he died which was from shock or asphyxiation.
