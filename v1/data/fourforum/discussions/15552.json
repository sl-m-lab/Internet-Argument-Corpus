   "From Scientific American ....\n \n\"It is admittedly odd to think that a progressive, humanitarian shift in attitudes toward gays and lesbians might lead, ironically, to a noticeable decline in the homosexual population. Yet this is precisely what I predict will happen over the very long course of natural selection should the societal-level normalization of adult homosexual relationships, such as is happening currently with the triumphant legalization of gay marriage in my new home state of New York, continues happily on its way. ....\n \n ....Homosexuality is often presented as an evolutionary &#8220;mystery&#8221; because of the obvious reproductive disadvantages, and thus for decades researchers have sought some adaptive function for the culturally recurrent percentage (anywhere from 1 to 10 percent of the population, depending on the measures used) of the human population that is aroused more by the same than it is by the opposite sex. Yet if we consider the historical, and perhaps even the ancestral, percentage of the homosexual population that did in fact reproduce because of societal proscriptions against adult relations with the same sex, the mystery becomes considerably less profound.\"\n\n \n More at Bering in Mind: The End of Gays: Gay Marriage and the Decline of the Homosexual Population",

Personally I would have the same reaction if a straight guy wanted to do this. Its like having your brain put into another body. Sure there is an upside, but a lot of downside also.\n \n By arguing this you pretty much concede that gays being unable to reproduce should be a factor in any discussion. By giving value to this as a way to overcome that objection you validate it as an objection needing to be overcome. It isn't, any other time that comes up it gets shot down with the simple example of straights who marry who cannot have children. Now this Sci Fi channel Science gone mad waves this in front of the eyes of gay people and all of sudden The reproduction argument is valid enough to say \"See we could have kids as well\".\n \n This will not suddenly turn their hearts and minds. This will be only one more thing to add to their list. There are much better ways than this to both have children and get the repressed peckernecks to practice some goodwill towards others. \n \n I think we have enough parent-less kids made the old fashion way. Adding to that among the many other reasons there are, makes this in my mind just a bad idea. Your contribution in winning hearts and minds is probably the most effective and far reaching, not that it was part of some long ago planned strategic plan to infiltrate the straights, but look how strong, dignified and respectable your circumstances are and then compare to what this would bring to the table",
