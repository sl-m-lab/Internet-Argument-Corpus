   "WW, while that link is encouraging, do you think biology is actually headed that direction or are we deluding ourselves that there will ever be a change in the status quo? \n\n \n **\n I have great faith in the epistemological power of the scientific method to push ideological assumptions, no matter how popular, out of the way of actual reality and our comprehension of it. Like all faiths, mine may be misplaced, but historically empirical science has usually prevailed over lies, mistakes, and wishes and fears, to eventually 'tell it like it is', at the highest level of our ability to learn and understand. \n \n WRT biology, the study of Life, it had the misfortune to makes its modern debut at the beginning of the 19th century, just when materialism/mechanism was sweeping across Europe with the industrial revolution. Lamarck drowned in that zeitgeist, but the materialist/mechanist/industrial capitalist tsunami died with the 20th century, and the the 19th century biology of darwinism and particulate, reductive, molecular, inanimate 'biology', is dead with it.\n \n All that remains is to get on with the job of real biology, as opposed to chemistry involved in biology, to concentrate our attention where it should always have been, i.e., organisms as whole, complex, autopoietic systems, and away from the chemical reactions of 'bits of stuff' at the materialist/mechanist level,-- that is, the level of chemistry, not biology.\n \n This is not about to happen--it was always there, from Lamarck and Von Baer and so on, but is was simply buried in the muddy tide of materialist darwinism.\n \n This particulate darwinism reached it's zenith when the bean-counters, Fisher, Haldane, and Wright, and their cronies, declared that evolution was not the study of how organisms, lifeforms, had changed over the course of time, but rather, how something called a 'genome' had evolved over the course of time. And that live organisms were the hapless tools of senseless molecules banging about senselessly, the passive products of 'genetic determinism'. A classic case of determining that it was the tail that wagged the dog.\n \n That stupid superstition, founded upon a faith in 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo', sometimes still cloaked in magic words like, 'emergence', could never hold water with intelligent, rational people who were were committed to empiricism and the scientific method, and soon it was shot full of holes. By this time it is now so full of intellectual holes that it should and would do the the decent thing, i.e., just blow away, if it were not so necessary to the discredited [except to Dawkins, Dennett, & crew] materialism/mechanism/positivism metaphysic;-- which in turn is vital to the religious metaphysic of atheism. So you see, darwinism persists in the face of the facts, in the face of truth, just as your creationism does, because it is somehow a psychological necessity to some people's sense of identity and security.\n \n But make no mistake-darwinism, fisherism, geneticism, whatever you want to call particulate evolution, it is already dead in the water. \n For decades organismic/systemic, developmental evolution has been fighting its way back to biological supremacy, and the organism is now accepted as the dog that wags the genetic tail. Just some old farts just can't let go of their silly mistake about evolution, i.e., confusing it for inheritance and heretibility, and we'll just have to wait until they die, so we can sweep it back under the scientific rug.\n \n \n\n To me, Big Science and Big Medicine are run much like a totalitarian-style government. They mobilize all their people and all their assets in support of their official ideological goals. They regulate, restrict and supress any and all unwelcome information. Anyone who gets out of line gets shot. Of course in this case, people probably won't die for stepping out of line , but they most certainly might lose their positions and their livelihood. I would certainly love to see biology change, but I just don't know if it will. There's simply too much at stake.\n\n \n **\n That's the way things have always been. An elite oligarchy running roughshod over those who challenge their power and prestige. It came with civilization.\n But history shows that the forces of repressive conservatism don't last any longer than the belief among the the ordinary folk that they're getting something good out of it, too. Social contract, and all that. That politic applies in the ivory towers of academe as well, and these days it is more unstable than ever, because it all boils down to money, and money boils down to corporate profit on investment, and that depends on getting it right with your product. The particulate biology of darwinism gave us pesticides, herbicides, germicides, and so on, and now our soil, air and water is poisonous to a dangerous level. It gave us genetically engineered organisms that are passing those alterations through the food chain, with effects we have not yet had time to identify. It gave us cloned organisms that simply don't work. It has gone a long way toward furthering the industrial destruction of the one and only biosphere known to exist--ours.\n \n But two things are finally happening, albeit forty years too late. One, the general public is finally waking up to what the materialist/mechanist/positivist zeitgeist, and its brand of 'biology', has done to the planet, and they are looking for something better. Two, the corporations that rule the world, the oligarchs, are starting to sense that if they want to stay on top, they had better start giving people the good stuff, the real stuff, the safe stuff, the honest, natural stuff, or see their bastilles stormed and destroyed.\n \n Thanks for the opportunity to rant and blow off steam. The sad truth is, however, that although the philosophical change is here and in motion, I don't believe we have time enough left to save ourselves from what we've done to our world, our biosphere, ourselves.\n \n I hope I am wrong.",
