The fact that this happens says much about our level of education and \"democracy,\" whatever remains of it. \n \n Broker: Kerry has challegened Bush to a myriad of debates and bush has refused to all but 2. \n \n \nKerry says he can pay for all of his new programs by repealing the tax cuts and still cut the deficit in half on the same time table as Bush.\n\n \n That is pretty vague. It doesn't account for how much funding these new programs are going to recieve, as well as programs that he may cut. If he drastically cuts back on several major programs and funds new programs minorally, with repealing the tax cuts, we still don't know the numbers. Kerry's vaguness doesn't give anyone a strong position in which to give credible numbers. \n \n \nI don't expect Bush to come close to what he's said he'll do on the deficit, but Kerry's numbers don't add up.\n\n \n We cannot add up numbers we don't have. We have a few, but not the entire equation. Therefore it is reckless and foolish to declare that his numbers don't add up when we don't know what he will do. \n \n \nThere's no way he can spend the kind of money he wants just by repealing part of the tax cut.\n\n \n Apparently you need a lesson in fiscal policy.",

   " What's more important?\n\n \n What's more important? The real question. The only question.\n \n I'm a non-conservative. Go ahead. Call me a liberal. It's not a dirty word. That's the title I have to wear as a moderate person who takes each issue as a stand alone and then weighs them, looks at the big picture and decides what's most important.\n \n GWB's only claim to fame is that he's managed to coral multiple sub-cultures - some of whom don't even like each other.\n \n So let's define the issues. At least there will be half a dozen of us who decided with clear heads.\n \n To the pro-lifers: That ship has sailed. There's no going back. Even if abortion became illegal, I submit that the morning after pill would become a street drug sold in high schools like marijuana - or simply bought on the internet. That's reality in this millenium. No longer a deciding issue.\n \n To the Reagonomicists: At least economic policies is a valid debate. Let the best man win at the polls. I don't blame anybody who chooses their candidate based on this issue.\n \n To the anti-terrorist crowd: We're all anti-terrorist. It's just that some of us aren't quite as terrorized as others. The war on terrorism will go on - no matter what. The war in Iraq will too. Since the polls ask about the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq separately, and the results are quite different, I'd like to hear both candidates speak more about the war on terrorism. Let's not separate the 2 wars or lump them together depending entirely on the point that's being made. Iraq and terrorism are different. We got Saddam. So what. They still x-rayed my luggage last week. Catching OBL won't be the answer either. Terrorism would be a valid voting issue IF it were actually an issue.\n \n Iraq supporters: There aren't any.
