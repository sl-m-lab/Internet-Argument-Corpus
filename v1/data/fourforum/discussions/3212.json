(Denounced in debate with Gore, but was fully for it when judicial activism handed him the white house.)\n \n Bush is foragainst the idea that the war on terrorism can be won.\n \n \n Bush is foragainst \"issue ads.\"\n \n \nFlip: \"I believe individual freedom to participate in elections should be expanded, not diminished; and when individual freedoms are restricted, questions arise under the First Amendment. I also have reservations about the constitutionality of the broad ban on issue advertising, which restrains the speech of a wide variety of groups on issues of public import in the months closest to an election.\"\n \n Flop: \"All of them. That means that ad, every other ad. Absolutely. I can't be more plain about it. I hope my opponent joins me in condemning these activities of the 527s (political groups that sponsor ads). I think they're bad for the system.\"\n",
