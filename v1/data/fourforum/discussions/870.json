   "The amount of nuclear weapons on the planet has dropped substancially since their peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the US has about 1/3 the amount of nukes that it had at one time and they are planning on destroying even more of them. Is this a good idea or not? The positives to having enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire world is that it helps ensure peace by making it too foolish to even go to war against a nation with nuclear weapons. However, do nuclear weapons allow some nations to boss around others such as the US did to Iraq? Could a disasterous WWIII occur where most of humanity is destroyed by nuclear weapons? Would humanity destroy itself by some other means even if all nukes were eliminated? In short, would you get rid of all nuclear weapons if you had a chance or change the amount of them that nations currently had and why would you make this decision?",

If the four major nuclear nations (Russia, China, UK, US) got together and agreed to get rid of all nuclear weapons, it would be like asking Kim Jong Il to shoot a nuke at S Korea. Since countries can now develop nuclear weapons (not legally, but possibly), the world's major nuclear powers must use the threat of nuclear warfare to keep other countries (such as N Korea) from using them.",

Nuclear weapons production in the US is alive and well.\n TVA plants in Tennessee are gearing up to make weapons grade material one more time. Security concerns have been cited by residents (obviously), but security automatically becomes quite different when the words \"weapons grade\" enter the equation. In other words, as anyone who has been by the Oak Ridge, TN facilities already knows, security will be more than adequate.\n Also, I would guess this new material is for the tactical nukes the current administration has been discussing.

Right now there is such a fear of nuclear weapons that I doubt any major country would even consider using a strategic nuclear weapon on anyone else because it would result in a complete retaliation by the other country destroying them both. If the use of tactical nukes somehow desensitizes us to this fear of nukes to even a small degree, I think it makes the likelihood of a WWIII nuclear holocaust more likely.\n \n Then again, we've already got the MOAB which is a conventional weapons that equals the power of a tactical nuke.",

The North Koreans don't exactly have the capability of making a nuclear weapon that large. They probably can't even make one that would cause as much damage as a MOAB or our fuel bombs. It is no doubt a menacing threat and I don't want to see one land here just to see how much of an impact it would make, but they are not going to be able to take out an entire city. The article I read estimated 70k dead per nuclear weapon. The population of San Francisco is about 770k.\n \n The estimate I've heard is the North Koreans are making weapons of about 10KT. A 10KT airburst would cause a great deal of damage about 1.6 miles in every direction from ground zero. The typical strategic US nuke is closer to 200KT and will do damage 4.3 miles in every direction. So our weapons cause about 7.2x as much damage. It would take 7 of their nukes to equal 1 of ours and we have 10,000 to their 7. Now that is something for them to think about.",
