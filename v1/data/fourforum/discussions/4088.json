   "AJ is reporting more sabre rattling from the Bush administration regarding strikes into Syria. It looks like aplan is actually starting to solidify. Apparently we are planning to run cross border strikes against busses bleivied to be bringing insurgents into Iraq (despite the fact that we have captured fewer than 10 syrian in Iraq). \n \n The article is here:\n \n http://www.aljazeera.com/cgi-bin/news_service/middle_east_full_story.asp?service_id=6734\n \n One part I find particularly interesting is this paragraph:\n \n \nArmitage also asked Assad to make sure that none of the Kornet AT-14 anti-tank missiles enter Iraq. In case any Korner AT-14 are found, General Casey, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq already received orders from the commander-in-chief in the White House to launch military attacks inside Syria as he sees fit and without delay. \n \n \n I don't know if the public will catch this incredible shift in rationale, but we WERE looking for Kornet missiles as proof that Iraq had violated the 1991 weapons ban (short article at http://www.jsonline.com/news/gen/mar03/128985.asp).\n \n So now, instead of existance of such missiles meaning that Iraq violated our ban, it is evidence that Syria is passing munitions to insurgents. Interesting, especially since the Kornet is widely available on the black market almost anywhere in N Africa.",

   "The US public public, as usual, is unaware that the arms business is a very lucrative business for the US and Russia. While the US specializes in selling high tech weaponry afforded by only wealthy nations or those who align themselves with our policies, Russia has long serviced anyone with the money to purchase their field equipment through intermediaries. \n \n While the US public is fed a red herring about Syria harboring Iraq resistors who commute between Syria and Iraq by the bus load and constitute a major threat to US occupation forces, which they'll swallow, Israel is relieved of any Syrian influence in the coming peace talks with Palestine? Providing America's administration yet another phantom enemy to blame for our failure in Iraq. \n \n Any expansion of the so-called war on terror now potentially encompassing any ME nation we dislike for whatever reason will serve Bin Laden well in their goal to bring us to our financial knees. As a former US senator once said, 'A billion here, a billion there, and you're soon talking about real money'. This one sounds almost as pathetic as the Gulf of Tonkin presidential directive in 1964.",

Aj never reported it.\n \n \n \n \nThe same al jazeera that barely reports insurgents killing other muslims? \n \n \n Yes, they do. There was nearly an hour long segment on today dedicated to this. They even had several muslim religous leaders to chastise tyhe insurgency for not taking pains to ensure civilian safety.\n \n \nThe same al jazeera that posts this very biased article? http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=6670\n \n (it was a mercy killing NOT a murder)\n\n \n Then why were they found guilty of .....murder. Us soldiers are not allowed to perform field mercy killings. YOU KNOW THIS. YOU WERE IN THE SERVICE. Downed civilain get a medic and evac. Under no circumstances are you allowed to shoot a wounded civilian. There isn't a soldier under the sun who doesn't know this. There is no way you are going to convince me that those guys thought that killing that kid was legitimate. That si so far outside the bounds of acceptable behavior that even I am a little outraged at the light sentences they got. Even if they DID believe they were performing a emrcy killing (whihch is illegal in any regard), it shows such incredible lack of judgement that, if that is the case, those soldiers need ot be executed to ensure that they do not pollute the gene pool with their substandard genetic stock. \n \n Those particular disgraces to the uniform should just count themselves lucky that they are US soldiers. If they were not, they would be sitting in front of the international war crimes court right now, and likely be either imprisoned for life or executed.\n \n Rev, these guy scragged a KID, in front of an entire CROWD of people, and an army doctor later said they could have saved him. Exactly how do you portray something like that so the soldiers look like anything but war criminals? You can't, becuase they very clearly are. The fact that AJ included the bit of drivel about \"mercy killing\" shows their impartialility. If I had been writing the article, I wouldn't have even bothered to include that lame excuse. \n \n You and I both know that kind of thing sometimes happens, and if you put down one of your own guys when you know there is no chance he will survive, and he is dying a horrible, painful death, it will be overlooked. When you scrag a 16 yr old kid in front of a crowd from 20 ft away, without even bothering to put on a show of checking his wounds, you are going to jail, or worse. I won't say that these guys got what they deserved, becuase they didn't. They deserved MUCH worse than what they got.",
