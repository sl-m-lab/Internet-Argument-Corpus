   "I am trying to have a debate with you, but that is impossible if I don't know what you are saying. The article is claiming that the feet in the museum display are inaccurate. I am trying to determine how we know the feet are inaccurate. Do we have examples of Lucy's feet? If not, then we have no idea that the toe bones should be longer. Do we have examples of feet from other individuals from the same species? If they are the same species, then we know what Lucy's feet looked like, and your repeated claims that Lucy's feet are missing are irrelevant to the argument.\n \n The second point is that some scientists think the toe bones are longer. How is this a significant error? The toe bones are too short? That is a conspiracy to mislead the public?

However, this is still a matter of debate among scientists studying human origins. But, again, this is irrelevant. The point is, if you look at the picture in the site that I posted, you'll notice that we have enough of the pelvis from Lucy, and other individuals of the same species, to know that when Lucy walked on the ground she walked upright. Period. That is the point of the museum display - to show there was an ancient ape that walked upright. This is indisputable. Lucy was an ape that walked upright.\n \n The examples of feet that we do have from this species show that the feet were the feet of a bipedal species. Long toe bones? How does this change the basic facts that Lucy and her species were a bipedal species?\n \n The article you cite is simply misleading.\n \n Here is a description of Lucy.

   "Earlier in this thread accusations of fraud, or at least of misrepresentation, on the part of the scientific establishment were made concerning \"Lucy\", the most famous example of Australopithecus afarensis. I tried to answer the charges as best I could. I felt I may not have succeeded, since I was never certain on what basis these accusations were made. However, no response was made to my rebuttal, and so I can only assume that my point has been made. Just in case, though, I will offer a summary of the argument. If no further response is made, I think we will be able to conclude that this topic is closed.\n \n The fossil remains of \"Lucy\" do not include the feet. There were charges that scientists were dishonest, somehow, although I could not really draw out the exact nature of dishonesty. I will make some guesses as to the point of the accuser and answer them.\n \n Perhaps the accuser felt that without the feet scientists could not know that Lucy was bipedal. However, a large portion of the pelvis was found, and the pelvis does show, unequivocally that Lucy was bipedal. The shape simply was not correct for a species that was not bipedal.\n \n Furthermore, there are several fossil remains of individuals of the same species as Lucy. These other fossils contain other evidence of bedalism: one, the feet do exist for some of these individuals, and the feet are consistent with a bipedal ape. Even more telling is the placement of the foramen maximum. This is the hole through which the spinal cord enters into the skull. In extant apes, the foramen maximum is to the rear of the skull, which makes sense considering that the apes basically move on \"all fours\", with the body sloping up to the skull. In modern humans and in A. afarensis, the foramen maximum is on the bottom of the skull, indicating that the body was directly underneath the skull, i.e. Lucy's species walked upright. So, whether or not Lucy's feet were discovered, it is known that her species was bipedal.\n \n A link to an article in a creationist magazine was provided. It provided a complaint that a certain museum display was inaccurate. Again, I wasn't too sure what the complaints were, since the \"inaccuracies\" cited seemed, to me, to be irrelevant to the importance of the discovery of A. afarensis. Before I go on, I must reiterate ungerdunn's point that scientists do not base their research and conclusions on restorations; they study the actual bones. The restorations are for the public, you and I, since most of us do not have the training to look at a bone and reach conclusions about it. It is exactly like a historical museum displaying not only the artifacts from ancient Egypt, but will also construct wax figures depicting scenes from the period. Historians, of course, do not study such artificial figures themselves, they study the actual artifacts; such reconstructions is to allow the rest of us to understand what life was like according to the current scientific understanding. The same with the museum's restoration of \"Lucy\".\n \n One complaint was that the toes in the display were not long enough. This may be a valid complaint, I don't know; maybe the toes in the display are too short. But this does not seem too relevant to the fact that the shape of the feet overall indicates that Lucy's species was bipedal. We would all like to see the greatest accuracy possible; however, in this case, even if the toes in the display are too short, it is hard to see how charges of deception are warranted. (I should point out that although A. afarensis' toes may have been longer than a modern humans, they were shorter than any extant ape's -- more evidence of the transitional nature of this species.)\n \n The other complaint in the article is that the author felt that A. afarensis should have been depicted in a tree. Again this is unwarranted; it is still an open question of how much time, if any, Lucy's species spent in trees. A. afarensis's arms were longer in proportion to the legs than modern humans, but not as long as in a modern chimpanzee. Some scientists feel that A. afarensis may have spent considerable time in the trees; others felt that A. afarensis no longer spent any significant time in the trees, and the proportions of the arms were a vestigial relic of a recent arboreal past.\n \n But the museum's display was intended to demonstrate an established fact: when A. afarensis walked on the ground, she was bipedal. She walked on erect on two legs. This is a significant fact; creating a museum display that ignored this fact would, itself, be very misleading.",

   "Some further info:\n \n Chimps, in fact, do not live in trees. They spend much time on the ground, where they are quadrapedal, knuckle walkers. They do climb trees for food and to sleep. Thus, it is not surprising that Australopithecines show some arborial characteristics. It is likely the they slept in trees, and like chimps, climbed trees for some of their food. In fact, there is even an hypothesis that food gathering may have been the activity that made bipedalism an advantage.\n \n There is other evidence that A. afarensis was more closely related to apes than are humans. The configuration of the bones in the wrist of a chimp locks the wrist when the knuckles are placed on the ground. Let me explain: get down on your hands and knees so that the middle knuckle is on the ground. That is how a chimp walks. You've all seen it so I am sure you are in the correct position. Now let your wrist flex until the heel of your hand is on the ground. A chimp can't do that. Neither could A. afarensis since the same configuration of the wrist bones show the same configuration as the locking configuration, if a bit less obvious. Some (creationists) have tried to claim that this is an indication that A. afarensis was a knuckle walker. But that isn't true. The pelvis, hip, femur, knee, spine, and foramen magnum show that A. afarensis was bipedal. The relative length of the arms may have been longer than in humans, it was much shorter than in apes. The fact that this characteristic is less marked than in modern quadrapedal apes is an indication the it may be vestegial in A. afaransis.\n \n And by the way. Did I mention that I will have the opportunity to see the actuall Lucy fossil? Keep watching at your local museum of natural science - Houston is only the first stop on a tour of the U.S. As I recall, she is going to be in the U.S. for 2 or 3 years. If each exhibition lasts 3 months, that will be 8 to 12 cities.\n \n I presume, like Ursus maritimus, that this topic is closed.",

   "I notice the Gup20 seems limited to cut & paste from creationist web sites. I wonder, Gup, have you ever actually studied science - I mean, college level, preferably upper division science?\n \n'Lucy' is the popular name given to the famous fossil skeleton found in 1974 in Ethiopia by American anthropologist Donald Johanson. To many people, Lucy is regarded as a certain link between ape-like creatures and man -- thus supposedly proving evolution. But is Lucy really a pre-human ancestor?\n\n Yes. \"Lucy\" is what the fossil (AL 288-1) has been dubbed. Yes, she was discovered by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray in 1974 in the Hadar region of the afar triangle in Ethiopia. As for being a certain link, scientists actually require more evidence than is available to support such an assertion. She certainly shows characteristics that make her a transitional species, but no claims are made that she is a direct ancestor of modern humans. And of course, scientific theories aren't proved. Proof is a consideration of math, law, and alchoholic beverages. New data may offer additional insight that allows a refinement of a scientific theory.\n \n So essentially, what AIG is doing in this article is arguing against an assertion that hasn't been made.\n \nAccording to Richard Leakey, who along with Johanson is probably the best-known fossil-anthropologist in the world, Lucy's skull is so incomplete that most of it is 'imagination made of plaster of paris'.1 Leakey even said in 1983 that no firm conclusion could be drawn about what species Lucy belonged to.\n\n Not sure where that comes from. Was Leakey talking about just AL 288-1, or was he talking about A. afarensis in general? But it actually doesn't matter. Even though the skull of the \"Lucy\" fossil is very incomplete, more material from at least 13 other individuals was discovered the following year (1975). Leakey talks as if he is unfamiliar with this find. And in 1991, a 70% complete skull of an adult male was discovered, also at Hadar. And then there is StW 573 which appear to be an almost complete skull along with many post-cranial bones, including hand and foot bones. Discovered in 1995, this specimen has yet to be described (in fact, it hasn't been completely extracted from the matrix), but it is certainly an Australopithecine and is the right age and location to be A. afarensis.\n \nIn reinforcement of the fact that Lucy is not a creature 'in between' ape and man, Dr Charles Oxnard, Professor of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia, said in 1987 of the australopithecines (the group to which Lucy is said to have belonged):\n \n 'The various australopithecines are, indeed, more different from both African apes and humans in most features than these latter are from each other. Part of the basis of this acceptance has been the fact that even opposing investigators have found these large differences as they too, used techniques and research designs that were less biased by prior notions as to what the fossils might have been'.2\n \n Oxnard's firm conclusion? 'The australopithecines are unique.'3\n\n But to say that \"Lucy\" is unique does not argue that she is not anatomically between ape and human. She is very ape-like in many regards but she was bipedal and her hands were quite human-like even if the fingers were longer a more curved. This is also true of the feet, even to the extent that tracks at Laetoli could have been made by animals like \"Lucy\" or closely related.\n \n You see, if \"Lucy\" were an example of a transitional species, she is exactly what we would expect. She would have many ape-like characteristics, but still different. She would have some human-like characteristicsw, but still different. And as Occam points out, there is no claim that she is a human ancestor, although she can't be too far from the lineage that lead to humans.\n \nNeither Lucy nor any other australopithecine is therefore intermediate between humans and African apes. Nor are they similar enough to humans to be any sort of ancestor of ours.\n\n But they are exactly intermediates. Other Australopithecines are less ape-like and more human like, or more ape-like and less human like. That's what we would expect to see over the millions of years of evolution.\n \nLucy and the australopithecines show nothing about human evolution, and should not be promoted as having any sort of 'missing link' status. The creationist alternative, that humans, apes and other creatures were created that way in the beginning, remains the only explanation consistent with all the evidence.\n\n \"Missing link\" is a term used by the popular press and creationists. It is not a scientific description of the status of anything. \"Lucy\" and her kind are transitional species. I wonder why no remains of modern humans is ever found anywhere in the same strata as Australopithecines?\n \n The article from AIG is one of their weakest articles. It just isn't even logical.",

You may need to rephrase it. \"Missing links\" do not occur between extant species, they occur between ancestral species and descendant species.\n \n And we have to be careful about what we mean by \"missing link\" -- it is unlikely to find an actual ancestor species, and probably impossible to determine whether or not it is an ancestral species even if it is found. Rather, we expect to find \"side-branches\", species closely related to the common ancestor.\n \n Even if the \"side-branch\" species isn't much closer to the actual ancestor, we may still get a lot of information about the common ancestor. People were speculating, and are still speculating, about the nature of the ancestor common to humans, chimps, and bonobos, based on the actual characteristics of these related species.\n \n On the other hand, the Australopithecines, being closer to the common ancestor, is a better subject to study in this regard than modern humans themselves. This is like when linguists try to reconstruct the ancestral Germanic language -- modern English, modern German, and modern Norwedian are not used as one of the descendant languages in this study since we have knowledge of the ancestral Anglo-Saxon, Old High German, and Old Norse, which are closer to this common ancestral language.\n \n Edited to add:\n Perhaps this is what you were asking for? This is the best evidence for a common ancestor to the apes. This is a recent pdf file of a recent paper describing this species, Morotopithecus bishopi. The claim of the paper is that, although it is still too early to determine the exact realtionship of this species with the other apes, it appears to be more closely related to the gibbons, but still with a lot of primitive characteristics.",

Some of us think that knowledge is its own justification.\n\n Looping anthropologists into the matrix, Ursus? You ought to be ashamed.\n \n You missed my point.\n \n Even though the data linking humans to gorilla and chimps has grown dramatically in the past twenty years, due to the increased use of molecular techniques, there is still no proof.\n \n Who is worried about this linking and why? It seems that those dead-set against the connection are the ones that harp on it most. That&#8217;s my point.\n \n If faith drives you, let it have the wheel. If science, same-same.\n \n I applaud scientists that work diligently to find the cure for disease, our beginnings, study our failures and successes, and sacrifice their lives to make mine better. By the same token, to those who discover that there is a life after death and how to attain it. Some say you can&#8217;t have your cake and eat it, too. I say, \"Prove it.\"",
