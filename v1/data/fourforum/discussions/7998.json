That's ridiculous.\n \n Morality doesn't have to, and shouldn't, come from the Bible. \n \n First, the Bible itself is filled with immorality, including some acts committed by God (giving Satan the thumbs up to kill Job's children, for no reason) and by Jesus (instead of having the expensive oil sold and giving the money to the poor, Jesus approved of its being poured over His head). \n \n Second, morality can come from philosophy: a simple example is the Golden Rule, which numerous different civilizations came up with hundreds of years BCE. Empathy (which this rule is based on) arises naturally: even chimps have a rudimentary form of it, and they've never read the Bible.\n \n \n **************************************\n \n Guess this is a good place to post my most-recent letter to the editor (this is one I just sent off today: it hasn't been printed yet and I don't know if it will). It deals with Christian IMmorality, in 300 words or less.\n \n \n \nIn her April 2 letter, Angelia Penton hops up on her holier-than-thou Christian high horse. Some balance is needed.\n \n One of Angelia's examples of a racist group is the KKK. Does she not know that the National Aryan Knights of the Ku Klux Klan state they are \"a fundamental, Bible believing, right wing, Conservative, Christian organization\"?\n \n Other Christian hate groups include the anti-semitic Christian Identity and the anti-gay Operation Save America.\n \n Christian immorality can be seen in the scores of Catholic priests who have sexually molested numerous young people. Then there's the Catholic Church's unethical deed of handling these vile criminal abuses itself, which, it did by simply transferring the sexual predators to other areas where they were free to begin molesting another community's children.\n \n Thousands lay seriously ill in ICUs across the country, in need of a true healing miracle, yet Benny Hinn refuses to cure them. Why? He's a charlatan.\n \n Countless poor and destitute people in our country go hungry or starve while multiple millions of dollars are funneled by Christian leaders into the construction of enormous, extravagant and vainglorious churches - and into their own pockets: Hinn, T.D. Jakes, and others like them aren't lacking much in the way of food or worldly possessions.\n \n The word limit prevents me from discussing additional recent examples (Jim Bakker, Peter Popoff, Pat Robertson, etc.), and also from going into detail about historical Christian immorality: the execution of thousands of 'witches' in Europe; the killing of millions of Native Americans during the conquest of the New World; the vast number of people tortured and killed by the Catholic Church during the Inquisitions; the thousands of innocent men, women, and children slaughtered in the Crusades; and so on.

Blinded by their own ritual and dogma. \n I've encountered many 'Christians' who quite bodly profess that they aren't part of a 'religion' yet, their form of worship has a sectarian name and their practices follow an established pattern and that were they to deviate from it, church official(s) would come down on them like a sack of bricks.\n \n It's catch 22. If you follow the bible as a loner and adhear to it's teachings, you could be a true christian and not a follower of religion. However, the bible does state that you should meet with fellow christians for several reasons...and in doing so, you often fall into the trap of 'religion'.

Often, they'll spout something that Christ has told them personally that isn't supported by correct doctrin and blatantly contradicts scripture.\n More of an 'angel of darkness appearing as one of light' if you will.\n \n From my perspective, most evangelicalls don't support Christ.\n They either; \n A) Turn people off from desiring to follow Christ with their ham handed mannerisms and beligerant attitude.\n Or,\n B) Induce people to follow a 'religious' group that doesn't follow established doctrin and scripture as established in the Holy Bible.\n But, I guess if you really believe that you're getting the 411 directly from Christ through personal revelations of the Holy Spirit, you really don't need an ancient and faulty (and hard to read) book.\n \n Either way, you entice people to burn in hell right beside yourself.

   "it is literal....I could give you the full story, but i see little point and dont want to highlight some of my more embarrasing past...for \"little point\"\n\n So long as you seem pleased with it. \n It's just some of (what I percieve through this medium) your comments seem very cliche and archetypal of an evangellical protestant bent with regards to 'seeing the Christ in person'. Most often from my experience it's no more than a story or self delusion (possibly demonic if you lean that way) one has made to impress something upon another. I note that when asked, you see 'little point' in professing the good news as how it's changed you personally other than in vague generalities. And while I am happy for your conviction, I see a loss of opprotunity for positive testimony.\n \n \n \nwhat difference does it make?\n \n the fact remains, I was blind.\n\n \n It does make a difference. If you were physically blind, you could give physical testimony as to the miracle bestowed up you. Something of an evidentary nature that sceptics whould have to disprove. \n If it's mere spirtitual blindness, you might get a golf-clap from others and a 'bully for you'. If there was a positive change in your life then others may take note. But, other than that, it's just your word that you were 'blind' and now you 'see'. Which usually means nothing and seldom convinces people.\n Personally, I could simply say you were immature and now you're not. You made foolish choices and some grain of wisdom let you know that they were self destructive. So, you grasped for what ever straw that'd give you fortitude to help yourself. For some, it's a positive affirmation. For others, an embasure of a religious belief system.\n \n But, there was no 'fact' that you were blind. Just a belief that you were. Unless, of course, you were factually 100% physically blind.\n \n \n\"What's Christ like and how did he heal you?\"\n \n Christ is like a human being with flesh like you or me.\n \n he healed me by placing his hand on my head.\n\n \n Any physical details? Like, Was he black?*\n What was he wearing, where were you at the time of the event, did he just 'magically' show up or did he walk up to you from out of a crowd, where did he go afterwards and how did he 'go?\n \n \n\"they'll spout something that Christ has told them personally\"\n \n in the instance of my healing he didnt say anything, although certain things were revealed to me, no actual words were spoken by him.\n\n \n Personal 'revelations' are a very big evangellical protestant event. Did these revelations add to or take away from established scripture and correct doctrin? Or did they illuminate something that existed that you were unaware of?\n \n \nI am not evengelical, I am latin rite catholic.\n\n \n I'm a Catholic myself. \n I just today was Deposed by my STBE's lawyer in a divorce proceeding that is 99% religion oriented. I had to specifically describe what a cult was, illustrate my grasp of Chrisitan history (including the various denominations of Christianity) discuss the wifes Word of Faith belief system and how it is heretical to established biblical doctrine and correct scripture. Discuss Pentacastalism, charismata (including charismatic catholics) and my personal beliefs on the subjects. \n It wasn't pretty. Seriously, answering under oath a question on whether I knew anything about Calvinism and it's founding date (which has nothing to do with our case) can be disconcerting. For the record, I kept it simple with \"Predestinationism and early 1800's but I may be off by a couple hundred years.\" which was true as it was early 1600's IIRC now.\n For the record also, I didn't file for divorce. My wife did even though her church has repeatedly stated that they don't believe in divorce. They certinaly know how to exploit loopholes they desire to be in the bible.\n \n \ncatholicism is the only fully authentic faith that has the fullness of authentic doctrine.\n\n Dogma and church tradition is heavily weighed in catholicism in addition to doctrine. Catholicism is a religion as it has established dogma and traditions. And rules...plenty of those. \n \n \nI test all things according to the church who is by the promise of christ guided by the holy spirit, i test all things according to the spirit... I dont need the bible, I listen to its author, god and his scribes and teachers... the church\n however the bible is good for teaching, rebuking and training purposes...but it is hard to read(understand) that is why I test all things with the church.\n\n \n Evangelicals also make the claim to be guided by the Holy Spirit and mandated by Christ to lead man back to proper biblical doctrine. They cite the Bereans and teachings of Paul on the subject. However, many believe that revelation through the Holy Spirit and Prophesy continue. Which normally shouldn't be an issue until it becomes obvious to one who refuses to divorce their intellect from theirselves that such things often contradict biblical teachings.\n \n \n I am not the only one who percieves you to have protestant style statements. No big issue as I (an countless millions others) have issue with some aspects of the Catholic Church.\n \n \n \n \n @trebor, done. It was screwing mine up too.\n @Jo, ;P Seriously, anyone who goes dipping into my coolaid deserves the response (IMHO). But, yeah, it was anoying.",

For example...\n \n 2Pet 3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\n \n Quoting the NRSV Study Bible...\n \n The best clue to the date of 2 Peter lies in 3:3-4.

Perhaps you'd like to elaborate on your reasons for assuming it means something else.\n\n I thought I already did.\n \n Try reading it in context of the whole of Matthew\n \n Here's the whole chapter...\n Matthew 5\n The Beatitudes \n 1Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, 2and he began to teach them saying: \n 3\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, \n for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n 4Blessed are those who mourn, \n for they will be comforted. \n 5Blessed are the meek, \n for they will inherit the earth. \n 6Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, \n for they will be filled. \n 7Blessed are the merciful, \n for they will be shown mercy. \n 8Blessed are the pure in heart, \n for they will see God. \n 9Blessed are the peacemakers, \n for they will be called sons of God. \n 10Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, \n for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n \n 11\"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n Salt and Light \n 13\"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. \n \n 14\"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.\n The Fulfillment of the Law \n 17\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n Murder \n 21\"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. \n \n 23\"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. \n \n 25\"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.[d]\n Adultery \n 27\"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'[e] 28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n Divorce \n 31\"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'[f] 32But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.\n Oaths \n 33\"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' 34But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n An Eye for an Eye \n 38\"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'[g] 39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 41If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\n Love for Enemies \n 43\"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor[h] and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies[i] and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n \n A clue for you, which I highlighted above is that the 'law of God' is different from the 'law of man'. The 'laws of man' were for a particular time. Jesus differentiates between what the people have practiced ('the law of man') and the law of God which He is here to state.\n \n Don't bother thanking me.",

I pray they turn to Christ.\n \n How can these people abandon the triune God, reject the divinity of christ, how can they con and manipulate millions of people into funding their extravagant lifestyles, how can suposed Christian men blatantly support homosexual marriage....how can they support the slaughter of innocent blood in the killing feilds of the abortion mills...why...how?\n \n because sola scriptura and faith alone have thrown the pearls to the swine.\n \n These Men and women believe that so long as they have faith in their own interpretaion of scripture, they are gaurenteed salvation, that is not faith in christ, that is faith in their own self made image of Christ, what is the punishment if a man makes graven images of false gods out of stone, how worse is it if he practices idolotry in his heart?\n \n There is no punishment for those who believe in Jesus Christ, the only son of god, the one true way not an interpretaion, his way, not ours.\n \n John 3:18\n \n For God did not send His Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. Anyone who believes in Him is not judged, but anyone who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the only Son of God. \n \n \n The bible is for teaching THOSE WHO BELIEVE, it is a tool to help us live the christian life, so called Christians go knocking on peoples doors with the bible in hand, they spout a few words and expect people to convert, the book has no meaning to these people, it wasnt intended for these people, they are about as much interested in the bible and convinced by what it says about as much as I am convinced we evolved from monkeys, the bible is a tool to nourish, to train the men who believe in God.\n \n 2 Tim 3:16\n \n All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. \n \n \nFalse messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect\n\n \n \n There is no mortal man alive who can convert another man, only christ, we can only be a witness by the way we live our lives, by our love for each other, by our forgivness, by our determination to live out a christian life inspite of our failings and weaknesses in other words by our devotion to\n and faith in christ.\n \n The bible can only go so far in being a witness to Christ, it may entrigue, it may inspire, but only christ can melt a frozen heart\n \n \n \n How can one argue that God exists, how can one argue he does not and for what point?\n \n all the theology and all the science in the world is not going to prove 100% either way, faith is a gift from God...not education.",

   "Calm down.\n\n I apologise if I appear angered.\n \nIf you recall, you set a rhetorical question along the lines of 'Where in Christ's teachings is there an injunction to burn witches?'.
