   "Raising a child does not require brainwashing them into your religion.\n\n \n It is the appropriate term. Raising a child to be a responsible person with character and integrity requires that they be taught those things. it must come from somewhere. Whether it comes from religion or another ideology it is what people do. It is what we must do. Children will learn if left on their own. The question becomes, from whom should they learn (the question is put to the parent not us)? If you are a parent, from whom and for what do you want your children to learn?\n \n if you have younger siblings do you want them to get into trouble the way you have? (Nothing implied by that, simply that we have all been in trouble at some point in our lives). \n \n If you care about someone you help them develop into a \"good person\". Different ideologies define that differently. It is not really brainwashing as that implies a distinct and repeated attempt to overthrow someones own ideas. \n \n Instead child rearing is the attempts to raise the child as a person with character.

   "(Before I begin I'd like to express my frustration. I had almost finished this post and then when closing another website I x'd out of this one. Now my post will be less elaborated, hurried, and not as good. Ugh.)\n emoticon_xkill \n \n Thank you...\n \n \nIt is the appropriate term. Raising a child to be a responsible person with character and integrity requires that they be taught those things. it must come from somewhere. Whether it comes from religion or another ideology it is what people do. It is what we must do. Children will learn if left on their own. The question becomes, from whom should they learn (the question is put to the parent not us)? If you are a parent, from whom and for what do you want your children to learn?\n \n \n Teaching a child religion is not necessary when teaching them morals and laws.\n \n \nif you have younger siblings do you want them to get into trouble the way you have? (Nothing implied by that, simply that we have all been in trouble at some point in our lives). \n \n \n I don't have younger siblings. No I wouldn't. Teaching religion will not insure their staying out of trouble. What is your point?\n \n \nIf you care about someone you help them develop into a \"good person\". Different ideologies define that differently. It is not really brainwashing as that implies a distinct and repeated attempt to overthrow someones own ideas. \n \n \n It is brainwashing in the fact that it imposes other ideas into children.\n \n There are many good atheists. I am for the most part a good atheist.\n \n \nInstead child rearing is the attempts to raise the child as a person with character. Many parents have no intention of doing this and instead abuse and use their children. Others refuse to instill any idea of right or wrong and instead leave the children to the teachings of their rather random surroundings.\n \n \n Every child must be taught the basics such as laws and rules to follow. This does not require the teaching of the Bible or any other religious doctrine.\n \n \nThe issue is that you will be formed from the inside out. The question is how is that to be done. it will happen you cannot stop it. It is not brainwashing it is simply making a choice about the process.\n \n \n Yes and you should be the one to decide that, not your parents.\n \n I have no problem introducing their religious ideas fairly. I do think that it should be done when he/she is old enough to think for themselves, ask question and not just take their parents word for it.\n \n Brainwashing also results in suicide bombings.",

   "I never said it leads to irrational behavior. You also never asked me to do so. You challenged my idea of brainwashing so I defended it. You have yet to offer any form of counter-argument.\n\n \n Poet,\n Here's how our interaction went:\n \n Post #3 I said: Perhaps you could be more specific in the genocide of logical thought that Christianity has brought about?\n \n Post #4 You replied: Brainwashing \n \n Post #5  I replied: Give me a break. My mind is as free as yours. The billions of Christians throughout time have all been victims of brainwashing? Doubtful. You must do better than that to demonstrate a mass genocide of logical thought. \n \n Post #6 You replied: Parents normally bring up their children from the time they are born until they are around 18 years old. The most vital learning occurs in toddler ages and until around the age of 10 or 12. \n When you bring up a child during these vital ages and tell the child that this is how it is he will in 90%+ circumstances beleive you.\n The child does not question because he trusts his parents and he becomes convinced that what his parents have told him is the way of \"truth and life\". \n \n Let us say the following families are fairly religious:\n Muslim Family - The children will be brought up as Muslims and will probably continue to be Muslims.\n Christianity Family - The children will be brought up as Christians and will probably continue to be Christians.\n Jewish Family - The children will be brought up as Jews and will probably continue to be Jews.\n \n I consider the imposing of religious ideals at such a senstivie stage in human life brainwashing.\n \n (Also the factors in brainwashing may or may not also include : Church, Sunday School, Private School, Community, Friends)\n \n Post #7 I replied: You have yet to demonstrate how this supposed brainwashing leads to irrational behavior.\n \n But I see, Poet, you are distinguishing between the implication of irrational behavior and the signature proposing illogical thought.\n Let me clarify and repeat my question of post #5, how does this supposed brainwashing lead to a mass genocide of logical thought?\n \n \nHow can you use rationality if the rationality must be based on the objective truth?\n \n \n I don't understand your question.\n \n \nLet me restate myself.\n I am not saying I find your theistic views to be illogical atleast thats not what I am speaking of in my signature. \n My opinion on Christianity being illogical is not extremely important in this argument. My quote expresses my opinion that Christianity is a mass brainwashing machine.\n\n \n But your quote does not say that Christianity is a mass brainwashing machine. It says it is a genocide of logical thought. My point is that most Christians partake of logical thought. Christianity is not devoid of logic.\n \n \n \nThe search for the origin of life is not without logic. Logic is how theories come about. Common theories include: The Big Bang and a Creator. \n These each have various forms of logic supporting them. The goal here is to find the most logical explination.\n\n \n We agree here Poet. I didn't say it was without logic. I said logic can't be applied in all instances. In my example logic can only go so far whether it be the Big Bang or the Creator. Then at a certain point one must choose on faith which he will believe or he can believe in nothing.\n \n \nUsing faith in the origin of life is like guessing.\n \n \n So, to which idea of the origin of life do you subscribe? Creator by faith, big bang by faith, or neither?\n \n \nWhy is faith required in the question of the origin of life?\n\n \n See above.\n \n More later on rational thought and complexity.",

Take the same scenario, portrayed from another view:\n \n The parent cannot explain to the child the situation of the world with Religion and the child could barely understand what \"metaphysical\" means.

This could have led me to atheism, but I thought of things logically and I accepted Jesus Christ as my Saviour. \n \n The same principle is applied when parents tell their children to \"not hit their brothers and sisters\".

   " It happens in every denomination who fills their unknowing childs head with prop[a]ganda.\n\n So brainwashing is specific to the denominations in Christianity, and not to all beliefs including atheism as you previously mentioned?\n \n You didn't answer the underlining question(s) of this point that I posited.\n A. You mention that many Christians condone brainwashing. \n I proposed two questions:\n (i) \"Do you have statistics to show that?\"\n For one to make such a claim, it must be obvious that brainwashing occurs. I have had no direct evidence of this, but I can imagine that it occurs. I have met many Christians in my life, and never have I seen something that is classified \"brainwashing\". The burden of proof lies on your shoulders to demonstrate that \"many\" Christians brainwash young kids. And why this is specific to Christianity.\n \n (ii) \"Which denomination of Christianity condones brainwashing?\"\n It would be the logical conclusion that if something is done by many Christians, that it should most certainly be a doctrine of some sort of Christianity. If the Church is against it (which it is) then they're not being consistent with their religious beliefs. Therefore, we can conclude that their alleged beliefs (Christianity) are not to blame - but the people. \n \n Now, if I skip a bit, and get back to it in a bit.\n \n Come on, we both know there is a large difference in filling a childs head with religious propoganda and telling them not to touch the obviously hot fire.\n\n \n Please. \n There is a large difference between trying to keep your child safe and telling them they must pray 5 times a day if they wish to be with Allah (sp).\n\n Argumentum ad nauseam is a logical fallacy, and it adds nothing to debate. When an example is provided, it nearly always follows that there is difference between the example and the thing that is attempted to portray. Although teaching a child to not touching something hot and teaching a child about God are very different things - the principle remains the same. Although different, the example provided is efficient for what we are trying to discuss. For you (silentpoet) to argue otherwise, more is needed than repetition, but you must demonstrate how and why the given example is not acceptable.\n \n If the child of the parent (at the right age) beings to \"question things\" and think \"of things logically\" how do they (more often than not) reach the same conclusion of their parents?\n\n You're really not in a suitable position to denounce what I say about myself, and what I think (a subjective claim). Why do the majority of Muslim parents go on to have Muslim children? There are various reasons. Here are just some:\n (i)I have noticed that Muslims do not question their religion so much. In the past, when I have asked a few Muslims questions about their religion, they consecutively answer, \"You Christians question too much\". Although being quite stereotypical, it does highlight the basic attitude that Muslims have.\n (ii) They might truly think that it is the correct Religion, and they therefore have faith in what they believe in.\n (iii) They are scared of what will happen if they turn away from Islam. From my experience, I have noticed that Muslims can be really quite violent - especially when it comes to non-Muslims. I can give you a few examples if you want, but I won't put them in now.\n \n In any case, Islam has, pretty much, nothing to do with Christianity. Your quotation and the subject of this debate directly concerns Christianity. It doesn't concern \"other religions\" as a whole, neither does it concern Islam.\n \n (Biased) : Yes, Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins...\n (Unbiased) : Some people beleive Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins.\n\n Now, this, on the face of it, might seem logical - but it is not the way to go. I've already explained why, but I'll try again.\n \n The intellectual level that a human contains at the level of a child is increasingly low. Intellect and intelligence are (generally) gained over the years. It therefore follows that children have a low intelligence in comparison to a teenager, letter lone an adult. If you want, you can try it out in practicality for yourself. Telling a child that \"Some people believe in....\" is near enough a meaningless statement. You do not say to a child, \"Some people think that self-mutilation is bad\". A child does not contain the necessary intellect to make thorough decisions or objective observations. I can't really expand, but this first requires you to qualify the difference in touching fire or self-mutilation and religious \"propaganda\". \n \n If a Christian truly believes that God exists - they should make no secret of it. What is there better for your child than to be Christian and to have eternal life? Surely, the parent won't lie and tell the child that \"God does not exist\", and it's meaningless to tell a child that \"some people think that...\"\n \n Because the mind is still filled with prop[a]ganda and is very biased and thus not able to think as logically as one who is not filled with biased and prop[a]ganda.\n\n Perhaps, but that is not necessarily the case.\n \n I use the one in the dictionary.\n\n While we both might use the same dictionary, there are normally various definitions for a single word. The word \"love\" has dozens of definitions ranging from \"God\" to the feeling that one has for his hamburger.\n \n I hope you didn't purposefully leave out the second definition:\n\n The first definition is normally the most widely accepted one. I thought that you were certainly referring to the first one, since the second one applies more to an \"advertising campaign\". \n \n As for definitions - I disagree. When one refers to \"brainwashing\" I should think it to be quite a \"forced\" experience. Cults normally rely entirely on brainwashing, and they certainly don't do it by the odd \"our cult is cool\". Those who have been brainwashed and been through the experience agree that it was rather terrifying. It normally has damaging psychological effects - especially at moments of realization. \n \n What this second definition implies is the advertising done by the media. This might well be a type of brainwashing, but it is not the one that religions (if they do) partake in. The second definition provided refers to things like adverts - where they dress up their product, speak nothing of the negative parts of it, and make it appear attractive so that people will buy their product. \n \n The first definition explicitly uses the word \"religious\" and the second one intentionally and explicitly uses the word \"advertising\".\n \n The second definition is unfit for the present circumstances. If you agree on this (which I should think that you should - it's evident) then you'll have to attempt to answer the questions I posted earlier about it.\n \n No, these statistics are not exactly deniable. They list the religious percentage for every country.\n\n Hey, thanks for the links. That's actually interesting stuff. When it got me thinking, they're probably true. It occurred to me that only the West (pretty much) has atheists - the west in their supreme intellect should be clever enough to know that there is no God! Bah!\n \n Conclusion:\n You have provided no points to specifically single out Christianity. The brainwashing example is not only irrelevant, but unspecific and not original to Christianity. You'll need to demonstrate more convincing ways of why Christianity is the mass genocide of logical reasoning. To do so, you cannot single out individuals who are inconsistent with their religion, and then think that it is a doctrine of Christianity. Christianity cannot be blamed for brainwashing since it is against it! The people to blame are humans.",

Find the younger age groups and watch the brainwashing happen.\n Of course its not the church alone that does this. Its also a reinforcement from the child's parents, friends, and community.'\n \n \n \n(ii) \"Which denomination of Christianity condones brainwashing?\"\n It would be the logical conclusion that if something is done by many Christians, that it should most certainly be a doctrine of some sort of Christianity. If the Church is against it (which it is) then they're not being consistent with their religious beliefs. Therefore, we can conclude that their alleged beliefs (Christianity) are not to blame - but the people. \n \n \n No it does not have to be a doctrine. It simply happens in religions.\n Brainwashing is not specific to any denomination. \n \n \n \nArgumentum ad nauseam is a logical fallacy, and it adds nothing to debate. When an example is provided, it nearly always follows that there is difference between the example and the thing that is attempted to portray.

Although different, the example provided is efficient for what we are trying to discuss. For you (silentpoet) to argue otherwise, more is needed than repetition, but you must demonstrate how and why the given example is not acceptable.\n\n \n Not to touch the hot stove (or fire) - Accept Jesus as personal savior\n Show why its not a valid example in what parents need to teach their children? Ok.\n \n When the parents teach their child A (not to touch hot stove) they do it for one purpose. That is the child's well being and  immediate saftey. If the parent does not tell the child not to do this then the child will (in cases) touch the stove, find out for themselves and as a result be in pain.\n Touching the stove produces an immediate result of pain. Telling the child not to touch it attempts to protect the child from obvious physical danger.\n \n The parents / church \"teaches\" the child B (Accept Jesus as personal savior). For what purpose? The child is no immediate danger. So surely the time can come when the child's mind is more independent for the parents and or church to introduce their religion.\n \n \n \nYou're really not in a suitable position to denounce what I say about myself, and what I think (a subjective claim). Why do the majority of Muslim parents go on to have Muslim children? There are various reasons. Here are just some:\n (i)I have noticed that Muslims do not question their religion so much.

I can give you a few examples if you want, but I won't put them in now.\n In any case, Islam has, pretty much, nothing to do with Christianity. Your quotation and the subject of this debate directly concerns Christianity. It doesn't concern \"other religions\" as a whole, neither does it concern Islam.\n\n \n You missed the point. I used Islam as an example earlier. \n Why do you think most children raised as a Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Atheist etc... continue to stay that religion? It would seem as if the parent's brainwashing of the child has left the child with much biased and opinionated views.\n While this is not always the case I have found this to be the case in most of my debates with those I know.\n \n As you tried to point out earlier the child might \"begin to question things\" on their own and \"think through things logically\" but this is not as it sounds. This is because when one are biased one cannot think nearly as logically due to their opinionated views.\n \n \nIf a Christian truly believes that God exists - they should make no secret of it. What is there better for your child than to be Christian and to have eternal life? Surely, the parent won't lie and tell the child that \"God does not exist\", and it's meaningless to tell a child that \"some people think that...\"\n\n \n \"I beleive in God\" (or \"I accepted Jesus as my savior). Are those statements acceptable?\n \n So after the parent has made the child aware of their views why not stop their? Is it necessary to continue to reinforce these beleifs by stressing that the child go to sunday school or pray to God before they go to bed?\n \n You brought up a point that I have come across before. You said:\n \"What is there better for your child than to be Christian and to have eternal life\"\n I'm sure there are many Christian parents who feel this same way and it could also be said that they don't want their child not to be Christian and thus (they beleive) their child go to hell.\n So in a sense they might feel as if they are protecting their child when they \"convince\" him to become a Christian. \n \n Well there you go. You have a religion (or atleast many denominations of that religion) that teaches that non-members will go to hell. As a result you have parents convincing their dependent children's minds their religion.\n Thus adding up to the statement of:\n \"Christianity is a mass genocide of logical reasoning\"\n \n \nPerhaps, but that is not necessarily the case.\n\n \n Of course it is. One filled with biased and propoganda cannot possibly think as logically than one who is not filled with biased, not filled with propoganda and one who is not opinionated.\n \n \nWhat this second definition implies is the advertising done by the media. This might well be a type of brainwashing, but it is not the one that religions (if they do) partake in. The second definition provided refers to things like adverts - where they dress up their product, speak nothing of the negative parts of it, and make it appear attractive so that people will buy their product. \n \n \n \"The application of a concentrated means of persuasion, such as an advertising campaign or repeated suggestion, in order to develop a specific belief or motivation.\"\n \n That most certainly fits what happens to children in the Sunday school classroom.\n \n \nThe first definition explicitly uses the word \"religious\" and the second one intentionally and explicitly uses the word \"advertising\".\n \n The second definition is unfit for the present circumstances. If you agree on this (which I should think that you should - it's evident) then you'll have to attempt to answer the questions I posted earlier about it.\n\n \n Yes I would agree that the second defenition usually refers more to advertising but it still fits the religious brainwashing that is done.\n \n \nConclusion:\n You have provided no points to specifically single out Christianity. The brainwashing example is not only irrelevant, but unspecific and not original to Christianity. You'll need to demonstrate more convincing ways of why Christianity is the mass genocide of logical reasoning. To do so, you cannot single out individuals who are inconsistent with their religion, and then think that it is a doctrine of Christianity. Christianity cannot be blamed for brainwashing since it is against it! The people to blame are humans.\n\n \n Thats true. Humans do the brainwashing due to their beleifs (religion). \n Christianity (as I have proved) is by far the biggest religion and thus is the biggest \"genocide of logical reasoning\". So that is why I put Christianity and not Islam or Judaism.\n \n Children are easily convinced due to their lack of mind independence. If Christianity is against brainwashing than they are against the sending of (unthinking) children to sunday school and those children being fed Christian propoganda.\n But if they were against that, many Christians might feel that it would be letting the children to go to hell and thus they condone what I have called brainwashing.",

For, they all do imply repeated suggestions and very often have applications of concentrated means of persuasion.\n\n \n The defention reachs \"means of persuasion, such as  an adverstisting campaign or...\"\n \n It merely gives an example of the type of brainwashing that the second defention is referring to. Christianity obviously applys he because of how it constantly fills dependent minds with it's propoganda.\n \n \n TV advertising focuses on an paticular age groups that are not dependent. The TV has little to nothing effect on a mind compared with the time during a child's upbringing with parents and church brainwashing them.\n \n You said: \"that not only are all forms of media and advertisements wrong, but television, radio, ....\"\n \n When did I ever say that the second definition was wrong?",

   "Children are easily convinced due to their lack of mind independence. If Christianity is against brainwashing than they are against the sending of (unthinking) children to sunday school and those children being fed Christian propoganda. But if they were against that, many Christians might feel that it would be letting the children to go to hell and thus they condone what I have called brainwashing.\n\n \n SP I believe religion, especially Sunday school is an important part of American life. I know I would not be nearly as knowledgeable about the Christian religion without that training. On the other hand, I agree that most Christians brainwash their children into believe what they believe. My father did that and it was only with traumatic emotional difficulties that I ever broke away from that religion. I sent and often attended church with my children but taught them that beliefs are just that, beliefs, and their beliefs must be determined with open minds when critical thought processes are developed later in life. I believe I succeeded in having my children educated in religion while still keeping an open mind since my daughter has accepted Christianity as her belief and my son has not. The third is still young and I am teaching her the same thing. Of course when they were very young I did not see the necessity of contradicting what they learned in Sunday School as I just thought it would cause problems. However as they got older, we discussed religion with an open mind and different views on religion.",

The \"type\" that you are \"referring to\" is the first definition - but you simply do not want to accept it. Why? Since it causes many problems for your argument. In fact, your argument does not stand with the proper definition of brainwashing.\n \nAdvertising focuses on independent minds rather than dependent minds who are far more susceptible to such propoganda as presented by parents, friends, and church in Christianity as well as other religions.\n\n That's a rather sweeping claim. Advertising focuses on those that are dependant on products, it makes the product seem attractive, and mentions none of its bad qualities. They make you think that you need more and more. You should constantly adapt to the current \"fashion\". You're already got a house, but why not work more, and get a bigger and better house? After that, you can have the luxury of the house, and then get an even bigger house.\n \nThe independent minds that this advertising focuses on are able to think for themselves and remain virturally untouched by a 30 second tv advertisement.\n\n I'm gonna have to disagree again. If people were left untouched by adverts they would be completely pointless. Obviously, adverts work. Whether adverts are succesful or not is another issue - but we all know what they set out to do.\n \n Your argument comes to a mute point for several reasons:\n -You're using the wrong definition to better suit you. The second definition is far too broad. I could tell my friend to run a mile, and tell him two more times. That would be classified brainwashing.\n -There are many unsubstantiated claims in your post. i.e. many Christians....\n -You stereotype Christians on one of your perhaps bad experience with them\n -You admit that all belief systems have some \"brainwashing\" in them. Therefore, it is not Christianity to blame for brainwashing. You say, \"Christianity is the largest, so...\" but that makes no sense. Let's take an example:\n There are ten schools, 10s, which are split into 4 groups. Group 1 has 4 schools, group 2 has 2 schools, group 2 has 2 schools and group 4 has 2 schools. Let's presuppose that all groups brainwash their students. You're statement is like saying, \"group 1 is the mass genocide of logical reasoning\". While, they all brainwash the students.

If we follow the first definition, the child from birth would have to already have a set of beliefs. However, the child doesn't have a set of beliefs. If the parents introduce this set of belies to a child, it isn't brainwashing. In fact, if we want to get technical, the child is accepting the beliefs and truly believing them without force at all. I'm sorry, but my parents didn't argue with me about the trinity when I was four. I believed in God because I was taught that, and later I learned the logic behind it. \n \n If we follow the second definition, this would involve propaganda or salesmanship. Let's look at some examples of these two things. For propaganda, look at Hitler. Do you honestly believe he was not lying? More so, do you compare these \"brainwashing\" parents to Hitler? Let's try other examples- Stalin; Lenin; Mussolini; Obregon- are you comparing the two? \n \n \n I think you have proved my point.\n Christianity sets the stage so that the parents feel compelled to teach the child Christianity so that they may go on to eternal life and not on to eternal damnation.\n Thus Christianity is a mass genocide of logical reasoning.\n\n \n Ah, but Atheism is a logical fallacy, literally. Christianity doesn't set any stage- the stage is set in all grounds. This happens in Islamic families, Pagan families, Hindu, Jewish- all sorts. If a child wants to change his religion at 13, nobody should take it seriously. Young adolescents and kids change their minds all the time about everything. Going through adolescence only changes this changing of mind to a different perspective. However, this is not the point. Nonetheless, if a family member wants to change his religion, he can have these beliefs. But for the time being he must practice the religion his parents teach him or her- be it Christianity or not.",

No where in its defintion does brainwashing state or refer to lieing as a necessary component of brainwashing.\n\n \n Brainwashing usually involves lying. The implication is in the definition, although it's not required. Nonetheless, brainwashing is much stronger a word. One could say that public schools 'brainwash' the high school freshmen into believing Algebra- a theory. One could say public schools 'brainwash' students into believing evolution, another theory. These public schools don't say 'of course, there are other theories... algebra may not be true'. The word simply isn't appropriate when talking about parents raising their children with religion. \n \n \n Very funny. I am in a family. I am an atheist. My dad is semi-Jewish. My sister is buddhist. My Grandmother spent the better part of her life as a Christian missionary in Africa and my aunt lives in Japan as a Christian missionary. \n We have never had a fight over religion. While ocassionally I debate with my father, its a civilized debate that sees no agression or anger.\n\n \n I don't see why you find this humorous- it's extremely detrimental to the family! First of all, you said your father is \"semi-Jewish\". What do you mean by this? Does he go to temple at all? Secondly, your sister is Buddhist- that's not far from atheism if you havn't noticed. In fact, Buddhism is simply a form of atheist. They are non-theists. So obviously, your family isn't big on religion, and the children have adopted their own forms of non-religion, atheism. Of course you can debate with your father- he's only a 'semi-jew' (whatever your definition is) of course the debate's going to be simple. The point is it does break up the family. I can tell you dozens of stories of family breakups because of religion. Every single time my family visits my grandparents house, the topic is always religion. It's always debated. \n \n In comparison, if your parents were devout Presbyterians and you suddenly chose to be Taoist, do you honestly believe that there will be peace? If you do, that's extremely ignorant to fact. No, there wouldn't be peace. Once again, this is unarguable. \n \n \n Maybe your family couldn't function if they weren't all Christian but that is not the way in many families.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but the vast majority of parents find it most important that their children be raised in their beliefs. It's not many- some families don't have this problem. This is also why I don't believe in mixed marriages- too many problems arise. \n \n \n Please. I'm tired of this.\n I became an atheist at around the same age and I have a great relationship with my father and step-mom.\n\n \n Because they're not religious!!! They are \"semi-jews'! \n \n  \"The application of a concentrated means of persuasion, such as an advertising campaign or repeated suggestion, in order to develop a specific belief or motivation.\"\n \n Silentpoet, please try to understand the definition. The parents aren't persuading the children. Persuasion involves argument or trials when developing the belief. Do you think the child asks 'oh yeah well according to Matthew 16:18 PETER is the leader of the church on EARTH, Christ is the ultimate leader of the entire church, but peter is the leader of the church on earth'. No! Don't be silly! \n \n \n While cases of brainwashing may generally involve brainwashing, this does not mean every case does.\n Once again the word \"lie\" or \"lieing\" is not referred to in the defintion which we are going by as found in the :\n The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition\n\n \n I'm assuming you meant 'while cases of brainwashing may involve lies'.

However, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, most Hindu sects, and most Christan sects believe that salvation is only available through their religion. However, this is completely irrelivent to the topic.\n \n \n I am aware of what you think of atheism but thats not the topic here.\n\n \n No, it has almost everything to do with the topic.

   "Parcum,\n \n \nBrainwashing usually involves lying. The implication is in the definition, although it's not required. Nonetheless, brainwashing is much stronger a word. One could say that public schools 'brainwash' the high school freshmen into believing Algebra- a theory. One could say public schools 'brainwash' students into believing evolution, another theory. These public schools don't say 'of course, there are other theories... algebra may not be true'. The word simply isn't appropriate when talking about parents raising their children with religion. \n \n \n Agreed. \n While brainwashing may usually involve lies, the statement: \n \"Brainwashing means telling lies\" is 100% false.\n \n \nI don't see why you find this humorous- it's extremely detrimental to the family! First of all, you said your father is \"semi-Jewish\". What do you mean by this? Does he go to temple at all? \n \n \n He does not attend synagouge due to his diagreements with their teachings.\n He could be called Jewish because he agrees with the majority of their ideas. He celebrates all of the Jewish holidays and also observes the Sabbath on Saturday.\n \n \nSecondly, your sister is Buddhist- that's not far from atheism if you havn't noticed. In fact, Buddhism is simply a form of atheist. \n \n \n Buddhism is not a form of atheism. Buddhism can mostly certainly include a diety.\n My sister is by no means an atheist. \n \n \nThey are non-theists. So obviously, your family isn't big on religion, and the children have adopted their own forms of non-religion, atheism. Of course you can debate with your father- he's only a 'semi-jew' (whatever your definition is) of course the debate's going to be simple. \n \n \n My father has over 8 bookcases full of religious books which he uses as resources to debate scripture meaning with Jews and Christians on the internet.\n Of course he is religious.\n \n My grandmother and aunt have dedicated their lives to being Chrisitan missionaries in Japan and Africa.\n Of course they are religious.\n \n My mom and step-dad are both Orthodox Jews who most always attend synagouge.\n Of course they are religious.\n \n You have no authority to say my family isn't religious because you simply do not know what your talking about.\n \n \nThe point is it does break up the family. I can tell you dozens of stories of family breakups because of religion. Every single time my family visits my grandparents house, the topic is always religion. It's always debated. \n \n \n Of course a difference of religion can upset narrow minded intolerant people.\n \n \n Once again, this is unarguable. \n \n \n Hmmm. With my family full of Christian missionaries and Orthodox Jews and children who are an atheist and a Buddhist we function completely ok. There is abolsutely no resentment twoards our differences in religions.\n \n So how do you explain that?\n \n \nI'm sorry, but the vast majority of parents find it most important that their children be raised in their beliefs. It's not many- some families don't have this problem. This is also why I don't believe in mixed marriages- too many problems arise. \n \n \n I disagree with you on mixed marriages but thats not to debate here.\n \n \n\n Because they're not religious!!! They are \"semi-jews'! \n \n \n If your going to try to talk about something that you no NOTHING about then just shut up.\n \n \n \nplease try to understand the definition. The parents aren't persuading the children. Persuasion involves argument or trials when developing the belief. \n \n \n Like an advertising campaign brainwashing continues to fill heads with propaganda, and the dependent minds that hear this from their church and parents, know no better than to simply accept it as fact. Thus they continue to be filled with propoganda biased.\n \n \nIn Buddhism and some Hindu sects, one can follow any religion and still be saved. However, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, most Hindu sects, and most Christan sects believe that salvation is only available through their religion. However, this is completely irrelivent to the topic.\n\n \n Whoa now. Slow down.\n Show me where in Orthodox Judaism that non-followers go to hell.\n \n No it is NOT irrelevant. Once again the reason it is not irrelevant is because it brings about the following point:\n \n Those religions set up the scenario in which parents who follow the religion feel compelled to make sure their children follow the religion so that they can \"save them from hell\"",

   " Wrong again. Our counterexamples have refuted your claim.\n\n \n No they haven't. Both claims are completely ridiculous. Firstly, if your parents (or whomever is Catholic) didn't put pressure on you, they would be committing a sin. Your claims prove nothing. It's simply an unarguable fact that it is completely possible and very likely that mixed marriages in religion lead to family problems.\n \n \n Agreed. \n While brainwashing may usually involve lies, the statement: \n \"Brainwashing means telling lies\" is 100% false.\n\n \n You're using my statement out of context. I made a list of things brainwashing is, \n \n \"Brainwashing is telling lies to the children into believing their religion, and it's also changing somebody who already has a different belief. Educating is teaching a child from an early age about Christianizing\"\n \n Further, my actual definition was after this. This was simply an informal definition of the word, and I used one example to show it. \n \n \n He does not attend synagouge due to his diagreements with their teachings.\n He could be called Jewish because he agrees with the majority of their ideas. He celebrates all of the Jewish holidays and also observes the Sabbath on Saturday.\n\n \n If he were Jewish he would know that he was in a deadly sin for not going to synagogue! Obviously, your family isn't very religious. \n \n \n Buddhism is not a form of atheism. Buddhism can mostly certainly include a diety.\n My sister is by no means an atheist. \n\n \n No, Buddhism, like Taoism, is the belief in nothingness. Although a deity can exist, that deity in their belief was created. This is not Theism. \n \n \n My father has over 8 bookcases full of religious books which he uses as resources to debate scripture meaning with Jews and Christians on the internet.\n Of course he is religious.\n\n \n Either way, since he doesn't follow a clear religion, his religious beliefs are not meant to attack you. If you're saying he does debate with atheists, then you're hypocritical. Of course you and your father have gotten into huge fights. If he hasn't gotten into fights with you over religion, then I highly doubt he debates atheists. The two things cannot coincide. It doesn't make you less likely to argue with your parents over religion because you have different beliefs, it makes it MORE likely. Once again, this is unarguable! Just because you're his son doesn't make you special in that you can get away from huge fights- it makes you special in that you will get these fights more often. \n \n I'm not proposing that you convert to 'semi-Judaism', being an atheist may work in your family. However, in most other American homes, it simply does not. \n \n \n My grandmother and aunt have dedicated their lives to being Chrisitan missionaries in Japan and Africa.\n Of course they are religious.\n \n My mom and step-dad are both Orthodox Jews who most always attend synagouge.\n Of course they are religious.\n \n You have no authority to say my family isn't religious because you simply do not know what your talking about.\n\n \n This is very different. I'm not talking about the extended family- oh boy do we have arguments! I'm talking about the actual two-parent family. Mom, Dad, kids. Once again, you're being hypocritical. I'm positive your grandmother and aunts have gotten into arguments with you about religion. I'm sure your mom and step-dad have gotten into arguments about religion. \n \n \n Hmmm. With my family full of Christian missionaries and Orthodox Jews and children who are an atheist and a Buddhist we function completely ok. There is abolsutely no resentment twoards our differences in religions.\n \n So how do you explain that?\n\n \n It is either; A) A very unusual family, B) partially true/not true. You must understand, it is either one of the other. You can't have both. The truth of the matter is, 75% of all interfaith marriages are unhappy because of religion. OF these, 66% end in divorce. Although half of all marriages end in divorce anyway, religion is still a major factor in this case. According to  The Bergen Record, 3 our of 4 interfaith marriages end in failure. \n \n Think about this logically, Silent, Crim. What does religion mean to marriage? Sex, drugs, education, politics, food, emotion, and so many other possible differences. It isn't simply comparing David to Christ- it is comparing Suleiman the Magnificent with Pope Urban II. Tell me again that families could live good lives. What if the father is an American Indian pagan, and the mother is a Quaker. The kid wants to participate in the Peyote ceremony. Do you think the mother is going to agree with that? In Quakerism, that's a huge sin to do it. In American Indian paganism, it's extremely disrespectful not to do it. \n \n The greatest wars of the world were over religion- Atheism vs. Theism in Portugal, Catholicism vs. Islam in the middle east, Protestantism vs. Catholicism in Europe, Islam vs. Hinduism in India, Atheism vs. Theism in China and Vietnam, et cetera infinitum saecula saeculorum. Religious wars aren't going to end, whether between family members or between nations. \n \n \n Like an advertising campaign brainwashing continues to fill heads with propaganda, and the dependent minds that hear this from their church and parents, know no better than to simply accept it as fact. Thus they continue to be filled with propoganda biased.\n\n \n The reason why this is sad is not because they are unknowledgeable, but because they are supposed to be knowledgeable! \n \n \n Those religions set up the scenario in which parents who follow the religion feel compelled to make sure their children follow the religion so that they can \"save them from hell\n\n \n Umm, so can Buddhism, Taoism, and many other religions. What's your point? You're showing me an example of one religion, while a dozen other religions differ.",

   "Silent Poet,\n Concerning your signature...what do you think of these two wordings of a logical approach to Christianity (or theism in general)?\n \n 1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated as a result of the perfect combination of \"miraculous\" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.\n \n 2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.\n \n Can Christianity not be taken on logic and faith?\n\n \n I've no idea why the signature is limited to Christianity. The sig comes from a phrase about religion. \n \n As per being a rational being. Humans, are not by nature, rational. While you may say you are rational, the fact is that you are not entirely rational by a very long shot. (By \"you\", it could just as well mean all people.)\n \n Regarding \"Can Christianity not be taken on logic and faith?\"... The thing to do is break down where the logic comes from. \"Faith\" is in itself not rational, \n as it unrelated to logic. \"Faith\" could best be described as an unquestioning belief. The nature of Faith is that it is based on the irrational nature of those people that need it.\n \n Given that Faith requires a belief in all sorts of things, depending upon the religion, the rational (i.e. the logic) or the reasoning of things is subsequently based on what the unquestioned belief(s) accept as truth.\n \n Getting back to \"Can Christianity not be taken on logic and faith?\" ...\n Given what is accepted as necessarily true, by a particular Faith, a rational can be constructed. As to the rational for a religion being logical... it is thought to be logical by those sharing similar Faith(s), and not thought to be logical by those not in need of Faith.",

I'm not saying that to avoid and revert back to the religious argument that we can't understand everything. I'm offering that as an actual explanation--our finite selves are not equipped to fully grasp the infinite--and in the infinite there is no beginning. Thomas Aquinas explained the First Cause not simply as God creating something out of nothing but stated that we are sustained at all times by our connection to God the Father and his life-giving force. We live because God continually gives us life. God is not simply a single, one-time First Cause, he is also a perpetual, eternal sustaining Cause. He is THE LIFE in the universe and always has been.

   "Can you prove that evolution isn't part of the Christian god's plan? It is generally accepted by the 'flock' that it isn't - but at what point does Jesus communicate this in the gospels that were actually accepted in the Bible? Perhaps those in control in the church don't want this to be an accepted idea because that would mean a part of life that the Christian god has control over. That would raise questions; these questions would lack answers; people would leave, and so would their money that keeps this faith rich and powerful.\n \n \n As a Buddhist, I've netered the life force of other living creatures, felt their feelings, saw the world through their eyes, and experienced the joy that is the ultimate combination of all life energy. As a Druid, I have communicated with spirits, summoned ethereal forces, and used astral projection. What I saw came to be, and one I loved suffered for her interferences in the order of the world beyond ours. I say this to make two points: 1) There is no mention of any of these things being possible in the Bible by normal humans, and yet I have seen them ans done them; in a world with God, these things should be impossible to the likes of you and me. And 2) To say that our minds are finite is to accept the controlling banality of the Church; our minds are capable of unimaginable things which never come to be because we believe they can't be. YOU limit yourself, and in doing so, you will NEVER see what I have. \n \n \n Yes, evolution is just as possible as Christian myhtology. I don't believe in anything; that is why I'm an agnostic.

   "Can you prove that evolution isn't part of the Christian god's plan? It is generally accepted by the 'flock' that it isn't - but at what point does Jesus communicate this in the gospels that were actually accepted in the Bible? Perhaps those in control in the church don't want this to be an accepted idea because that would mean a part of life that the Christian god has control over. That would raise questions; these questions would lack answers; people would leave, and so would their money that keeps this faith rich and powerful.\n \n As a Buddhist, I've netered the life force of other living creatures, felt their feelings, saw the world through their eyes, and experienced the joy that is the ultimate combination of all life energy. As a Druid, I have communicated with spirits, summoned ethereal forces, and used astral projection. What I saw came to be, and one I loved suffered for her interferences in the order of the world beyond ours. I say this to make two points: 1) There is no mention of any of these things being possible in the Bible by normal humans, and yet I have seen them ans done them; in a world with God, these things should be impossible to the likes of you and me. And 2) To say that our minds are finite is to accept the controlling banality of the Church; our minds are capable of unimaginable things which never come to be because we believe they can't be. YOU limit yourself, and in doing so, you will NEVER see what I have. \n \n Yes, evolution is just as possible as Christian myhtology. I don't believe in anything; that is why I'm an agnostic.

I do not believe that this is contradictory to a belief in God.\n \n I was not aware that one could be Buddhist and agnostic. Do you approach Buddhism more as a philosophy than religion? \n \n Have you been reading the DaVinci Code?",
