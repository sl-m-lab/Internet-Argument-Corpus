   "What I don't get is why anachronistic vitalists like WW and SS think that Darwinian theory is going to be troubled by epigenetics?\n \n So far, epigenetics has been involved in the mechanism of development. It's important to evo-devo, or the evolution of development. It doesn't mean epigenetic developmental mechanisms couldn't have evolved by standard Darwinian mechanisms.\n \n And even if epigenetics turns out to be a significant source of information transfer from one generation to the next, even if it turned out to be the equal of genes, I don't see how this alone refutes Darwinian theory, which only requires a means of transferring information from one generation to the next, and doesn't specify a single permissible means.\n \n WW and SS can babble on and on, but nothing they've said so far has any relevance to Darwinian theory.",

We don't know how the moon was created. Captured asteroid, knocked off in a big collision, formed from dust at the same time earth did? We're not sure. But the fact that we aren't sure of the details of how the moon was created in no way casts any doubt on the existence of the moon.\n \n We know evolution is a fact, that's certain. Some of the details we're still learning. Which forms of selection are the most important in what situation, enviromental factors influencing gene expression, the importance of cues picked up pre-nataly. These are all open questions. The fact that we have these questions in no way casts any doubts on the veracity of evolution, it just means that there's still more to learn. That's something that SS doesn't get. If answers don't come 100% complete and tied up with a pretty bow he wants nothing to do with them.",
