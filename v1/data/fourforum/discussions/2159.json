   "\"In the beginning, man dwelt in a state of Nature, until the serpent Government tempted man into Initial Coercion. \n Government is the Great Satan. All Evil comes from Government, and all Good from the Market, according to the Ayatollah Rand. \n We must worship the Horatio Alger fantasy that the meritorious few will just happen to have the lucky breaks that make them rich. Libertarians happen to be the meritorious few by ideological correctness. The rest can go hang. \n Government cannot own things because only individuals can own things. Except for corporations, partnerships, joint ownership, marriage, and anything else we except but government. \n Parrot these arguments, and you too will be a singular, creative, reasoning individualist. \n Parents cannot choose a government for their children any more than they can choose language, residence, school, or religion. \n Taxation is theft because we have a right to squat in the US and benefit from defense, infrastructure, police, courts, etc. without obligation. \n Magic incantations can overturn society and bring about libertopia. Sovereign citizenry! The 16th Amendment is invalid! States rights! \n Objectivist/Neo-Tech Advantage #69i : The true measure of fully integrated honesty is whether the sucker has opened his wallet. Thus sayeth the Profit Wallace. Zonpower Rules Nerdspace! \n The great Zen riddle of libertarianism: minimal government is necessary and unnecessary. The answer is only to be found by individuals.\"\n http://world.std.com/~mhuben/onelesson.html",

A lot of their views fall in line pretty closely with my own secret conviction that the government should be a slave to the people, not the other way around.\n\n I have a hard time distinguishing between anarchy and libertarian ideology. \n The Constitution was written to in part to establish a strong central government and guard against the dangers of anarchy. The founders had recently experienced the dangers of a government that is too weak (under the Articles of Confederation) and feared that they were heading down the path to anarchy (especially when they witnessed the Shays rebellion). You can't have an effective government and have absolute freedom at the same time.\n \n Wouldn't we be better off with a universal health care system like Canada's? Millions of Americans don't have health insurance. In Canada, every citizen is provided with health insurance by their federal government.

In Canada, every citizen is provided with health insurance by their federal government. That's a government that's really doing something good for its people.\n\n \n How about if the federal government went back to only taking 5% of the GDP like it was for 150 yrs, then people could afford our own health insurance.\n \n In the last 50 years, we have added more new laws to the books than were created in the first 178 years COMBINED. \n \n There are over 20,000 laws in this country related to guns alone. Don;t you think that is a little excessive? \n \n I don't want a nanny government. I am a grown up and cna take care of myself and my family wthout the government wtching over every detail of my life. There seems to be a large movement in America, and it seems to be focused in the liberals, to turn the govenment into our babysitters. \n \n There is a name for this, it is called \"arrested development\" by psychiatrists, and it is a mental disorder. These folks need to realise that they are all grown up. Their parents are no longer going to take care of them, nor is anybody else. I realise it is scary to feel like you are on your own, but they need to realise that being a grown up, and making grown up decisions, and ccepting responsibility for those decisions, is a natural part of life.",

   "AAHH, well, I like the political party. DO you know wqhere I can get more info on the general ideaology.\n\n \n I found this to be quite good and simple and outlines the fundament that Libertarianism rests on.\n \n http://www.mondopolitico.com/ideologies/libertarianism/whatislibertarianism.htm\n \n I would however argue that the anti-capitalistic libertarians are quite un-interesting. They have not offered any real explanations or challanged other political ideologies for decades. If you are interested in researching the capitalistic branch of libertarianism, Ludwig Von Mises institute is interesting. It also deals more heavily with economics than most other political sites.

   "That is some interesting stuff (been browsing ont he subject for a couple of days now). I think you are right about the anti-capitolist libertarians. It seems that they are something of a slim minoroty, though. IT seems like if you took an anti capitolist libertarian, mixed them with anarchist libertarian, you would have a communist. The Anarchist seem to be in a pretty slim minority as well. It does not seem that Anarcy and capitolism would go well together, at least not in this day and age, since withut control the mega corporations of the worls would end up being the new government.\n \n I rather like a lot of the libertarian ideology. I am not even opposed to the anarchist crowd. Pesonally, i think that at some time the world may be able to live under an anarcy, but it won't be for quite a while. I most definatly support a small government and a fiscal responsibility. I do not mind paying taxes, and would not mind paying higher taxes, if I could see some type of benifit from what I pay. It seems that, in the US at least, the governement has become so inefficient and theri programs are so poorly constructed, that the majoity of the money spent is on administration of programs as opposed to secureing the end result of the program.\n \n \n Right now it seems that in America, we are running our entire government without ever doing a cost/benifit analysis. It seems that in other countries there are government inefficiencies, but it seems to me that generally other countries do at least try to keep an eye on the bottom line as well as insure that there is SOME benifit to society as a result of money spent.\n \n \n I think their amoral standpoint is a little rediculous, though, especially in light of their non violence axiom. ISn't it making a moral judgement that violence is bad?",

I do not mind paying taxes, and would not mind paying higher taxes, if I could see some type of benifit from what I pay.\n \n\n \n Ipositive trhat every ideology would agree to this. I mean, even the most planned economistic ideal does not believe that a waste of resources is a good thing.\n \n \n \n I think their amoral standpoint is a little rediculous, though, especially in light of their non violence axiom. ISn't it making a moral judgement that violence is bad?\n\n \n That is a very good point. And it applies to any form of ideology to present themselves as \"objective (objetionalism) or without value. Its practicly impossible to make any type of normative argument (like any idollogy try to do) without making valuations. The fact that libertarianism (and objectivism) tries to present themselves as objective or without values is plain and simply embarrising (for them).",
