   "You don't seem to be able to understand that a fish species can have both alive and dead fish.\nAnd you don't seem to be able to understand that there are no fossil examples of either Latimeria chalumnae or L. menadoensis, the two living species coelacanth. Thus, while both of these species can have both live and dead examples, there are no fossil examples of either. On the other hand, there are no living examples of any of the fossil species of coelacanth - none. So in that case, there are no species that have both alive and dead fish; they are all dead.\n \n Let me summarize: The Order Coelacanthiformes in which all examples of coelacanths have been placed contains 9 Families with 27 genera. Of those, only 1 Family (Latimeriidae) contains a single genus (Latimeria) with 2 living species. That means that 8 Families with 26 genera exist only as fossils with no living species. The single family with any living examples contains 7 genera. Only one of those contains living species. The two extant species of coelacanth, which have never been found in the fossil record. Thus, your argument is a red herring based on your own failure to understand.",

   "If you have a fosillised fish, all you can say is that there once existed a fish if that type (or that it's a Test from God, but I'd tend to disagree). If you have a fossilised fish and you cannot find any instances of that fish living today, it's a valid assumption to make that the fish has become extinct - for reasons unknown. That's the only way that animals can be assumed to be extinct - we knew they once existed, and now can't find any of them.\n \n I don't know who started it, and I can't be bothered to go look. However, all you've got here is a fudging of semantics. To correct sickdelerium's quote from the OP:\n \nBecause the fish are alive, as you pointed out. Therefore the inference that they are extinct (because they weren't found alive) is wrong.\n\n \n Sickdelerium was entirely correct in his meaning - he just wasn't precise enough in his wording. I suspect that you knew this, and and are just being exploitative and troll-y, but that's not really my issue to deal with.\n \n Note that I didn't have to use the word 'evolution' at any point during my explanation. To relate this to the original thread (and assuming that the new fish is exactly the same as the old one, which is still contested): It was a correct observation that there were dead fish, but an incorrect inference that because we couldn't find any alive today they were extinct. At that point, the 'evolutionists' (read: scientists who accepted the most empirically supported theory) took that incorrect inferrance and used it to make another one - that because the fish was extinct, it might have died out due to over-competition.\n \n While this second inference is incorrect, this does not affect evolution's validity at all. Firstly, it doesn't matter because it was based on an incorrect inference in the first place - that the fish was extinct. Secondly, it doesn't matter because it was evolution used to explain why the fish was extinct, not the extinction being used as evidence for evolution. If a ball moves from a tabletop down to earth, I could say that this was because of 'gravity'. Even though it turns out that my friend had simply moved it with his hand, that doesn't disprove gravity in any way. And if it turns out that the ball hadn't moved from the table at all, I simply hadn't been looking at the right table, this still wouldn't disprove gravity.\n \n Evolution was used as an explanation, not to make a prediction. No case.",
