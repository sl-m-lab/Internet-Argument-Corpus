It's sort of like Bernie Madoff's Ponzi plan...only the first investors get anything back...and when the source of new money peters out, the plan collapses quickly. (Off topic, but I hope that man spends the rest of his life in prison...without caviar.)\n \n Social Security certainly cannot be depended upon for a living wage after retirement, but the basic idea behind it is quite sound...in that deductions are required. I think an improvement could be had by requiring that substantial deferred payments to be made into a personal savings account rather than a group fund to be played with by politicians.\n \n People tend to spend all of what they earn...much of that spending being unnecessary...then expect the government (the rest of us) to pay for their lives after they retire. I say we should all be forced to save for retirement, each into his/her own private account. It would be nice if the payouts would go untaxed.

Well talk about missing the point. It isn't the $70 that is the problem but that it is $40-$43 for other auto manufacturers. The comparison is what matters as they both include the same things. Toyota workers don't make $40 per hour either. This article fails to see that while the future problem may be solved for now the current problem still exists and frankly the cause still exists (UAW). \n \n The UAW and supporters want people to ignore the relevant information but the financial data provides the proof. Simply look at payroll+benefit+retirement expenses for GM vs Toyota who produce about the same amount of cars and SELL the same amount of cars. GM has well over twice this. \n \n So the article says GM will only save $800 per car if they pay like Toyota. Well, that number is probably more like $1,000+ per car but even at $800 per car that is $7.4 billion a year or twice their 2007 operating loss. \n \n Finally the article rests its case on the idea that no one is buying American made cars and trucks. He author cites his family as evidence for this. Well, his family story is very touching but doesn't pan out for the rest of America. GM and Toyota produce the same amount of cars and sell the same amount of cars. They have similar revenue (GM a little less since they charge less) and similar expenses on all other levels (minus the finance stuff keeping GM afloat). This leaves only a few things that is causing GM to sink and Toyota to succeed; Cost of Good Sold or selling expenses. Selling expenses are no par so it is COGS. The parts GM uses are roughly the same costs as Toyota so that leaves us with labor as the direct result for GM failing. \n \n What more proof do you need? Southwest Airlines - No Union - Profitable while US Airways - Union - Failing. Toyota - No (for the most part) union - profitable while GM - Union - Failing. The only union that isn't killing the industry is the railroad industry and this is merely because it is impossible to compete and frankly not that many workers exist anyway and those unions are somewhat fair.",

The comparison numbers for all manufacturers were calculated consistently. As I said before, when you pay a man $60K and his benefits cost you another $60K, your cost for that man is $120K.

The real problem is that Detroit has lost market share as a result of declining loyalty. That primarily due to marketing less reliable products.\nThere has been absolutely 0 zero evidence linking a slipping in market share to the failure of GM, Ford, and Chrysler. \n \n Furthermore, you basically just admit that labor costs are the problem. It isn't like Toyota and Honda have 0 people retiring...Toyota has been around since 1937. Ford and GM have had the insane costs of retired employees, pensions, and health care costs thanks to union contracts. The proof is in the financial statements (which led to the 70-40 number) which clearly show that Ford and GM spend more money on things that do not directly relate to building a car such as pension and labor and health care costs...aka labor costs. \n \n If you use the argument that the decline in market share is the cause of the problem than you basically are saying that the fixed costs that GM and Ford have are causing them to loss money. This is obvious because if you loss market share you produce less cars and shut down factories eliminating any variable costs. Now looking at the financial statements and notes (among other data) will clearly show that the Admin costs and other fixed costs are not that much higher than Toyota on a per car basis and certainly the minimally higher amount does not account for a 3billion a year loss. Losing market share is inevitable when another manufacturer enters the market. The problem compounds when you can't spend any money developing a better car because your labor costs are causing you to go bankrupt. So if you are going to blame a non-reliable car you have to ask yourself why they couldn't make one and you would end up looking at the money being diverted to payroll again...which I said was the problem to begin with. A lower market share is a symptom of the problem much like a sneeze is a symptom of a flu. You don't try to solve the sneeze and ignore the virus with a flu do you?\n \n GM still sells more cars than any other car company in the world. The only thing not equal is the cost to make each car for each company.

If you refer to that $800 then you misread because I was saying the cost to produce each vehicle would be $800 cheaper which is very significant in market that has low margin anyway. \n \n As for American cars being built as good as Japanese cars, for the last few years Ford has built cars that are just as good as the Japanese cars.\n Ford's trucks and truck-based SUVs, such as the Ford F-250 pick-up and Mercury Mountaineer, dragged down the company's overall performance ratings.\n \n \"Excluding those, Ford's reliability is now on par with good Japanese automakers,\" the magazine said in an announcement.\nThe article goes on to say how the Focus and Fusion are as reliable as the Prius (top ranked in terms of reliability).

I only meant Ford and GM. Actually, Chrysler's market share has been fairly stag over the last few years but you can only make a car so terrible. My apologies for getting ahead of myself.\n \n As for your comments, again, I feel like people are mistaking a symptom for a problem. When GM and Ford were the only producers of SUVs and Trucks they could charge whatever they needed to cover the incredible costs they faced. Even so, they really didn't have that high of a gross margin. \n \n Now what happens when someone comes into the market and does not have those costs like Toyota and Honda (somewhat) did? It is virtually impossible for Toyota and Honda to not sell some trucks and SUVs or they would have never entered the market so the Big 3 were going to loss market share no matter what. Furthermore, the Tundra starting around $15,000 when it came out in 2000 and if I recall correctly the 1999 F150 (year before Tundra) was around $21,000. So Toyota was known for making a better car than Ford and GM in the 1990s so Ford and GM realized they wouldn't be able to make that good of a car without charging much more than a Toyota (who had more experience anyway) so they relied on the SUV and Truck. Like you said, when Toyota entered this market the high costs of GM and Ford caught up with them and now they are where they are.\n \n So what this all means is that the problem always existed but GM and Ford were able to limp along thanks to a monopoly in certain areas. This is why I say it is a symptom. There is no way Ford or GM could achieve that monopoly again in any area so long as Toyota and Honda exist (unless the government bans them ha). \n \n Ford and GM did what they could to compete but they are out of options. The payroll costs are just too high for them to maintain a cost effective strategy. Ford, in a desperate move, has miraculously been able to match Toyota's quality over the last 2-3 years but have had to charge more for their cars and has had little to no income to show for it. This probably has led Ford to be in the best position of all the big 3 but still they are plagued by high pay costs. GM, in a desperate move, tried to position themselves with energy efficient hybrid cars and what not. This move didn't pan out because it turns out you never really recoup the extra costs of a hybrid. Again, this all comes back to the fact that GM and Ford can't compete with Toyota on a cost to cost basis. \n \n In short, market share is a symptom of the high costs problem. The high costs are all related to labor and union contacts. Take away that and we might be talking about a bailout for Toyota and Honda instead.",

Like this again is more of a symptom than an actual problem. I guess what I am saying is GM and Ford are forced to try and compete by making something Toyota doesn't thanks to labor costs. Great for innovation but at some point it will kill you. It finally caught up with GM and Ford.\n \n \nI don't know about limp. The financials for Ford and GM were actually pretty decent during the heyday of SUVs and Trucks. The question now is whether or not Ford and GM can moved away from Suvs and Trucks into the markets dominated by Toyota and Honda. \nYou are right in that they had to take over a market dominated by Toyota and Honda but this was my point above. They had no choice about which markets to get into because high labor costs forced them to make products not sold by Toyota and Honda.

Now, you can change your argument and talk about current healthcare costs to current employees (these are not legacy or retiree costs) but you still get back to the same problem of Toyota receiving the same net benefit as Ford and GM which doesn't really solve anything.",

If not, then I've misunderstood and I apologise. I'm not currently talking about pensions.\nThey have \"lifetime healthcare\" I believe as one of their benefits....I was referring to everything they got as retirement benefits or pension but sorry if that wasn't clear. My point is that it evens out in the end between Toyota and GM/Ford. \n \n In many ways Toyota has better pay for their employees thanks to bonuses and what not. This is no different than Southwest Airlines vs US Airways. The lack of a union can allow for flexibility of money which makes for more profits and, in a good company, that translates to better pay for the employees. Southwest has realized that a happy employee is better than a bitter one. They stay longer which creates efficient work behavior and less costs for recruiting and training among other things. \n \n But back to the healthcare thing. As you may know, GM is considering killing the healthcare plan and adding it to the retirement pension in normal dollars like 300 or 400. Toyota basically already does this because their workers need healthcare coverage too. So if you say we have universal health care you have a few options. Either reduce the total dollar pension amount or you don't. If you don't than GM and Toyota are in the same place. If you do, then it seems obvious both would cut and you still end up in the same place. \n \n So does it seem like I'm contradicting myself sometimes? If Toyota workers can make more money than GM than why am I saying GM labor costs are killing them? If I am saying GM retirement costs are insane than why am I saying Toyota is somewhat on par with GM? Basically it comes down to market factors. Toyota has the flexibility to hire less workers, lay off workers, hire more workers, etc much easier than GM and Ford. This allows for rapid changes in the needs of the company. Ford and GM are left slow to adapt. The efficiency has allowed Toyota to become a better company making more money with fewer costs even with paying their employees higher bonuses and sometimes with retirement packages equal to (in dollars) to GM and Ford. In an over simplified way you could say Toyota can have 1 employee do X while Ford and GM are forced to have 3 employees do X. Toyota could up it to 2 if needed while Ford and GM are lagging behind. Toyota can now afford to pay their employee more.\n \n sorry for the confusion, might have been my fault.",

   "I think the bigger problem the big 3 have is their lack of innovation. Because they have focussed on bigger and bigger trucks and not innovated, or have actively sought to crush innovation, they have become a little like Microsoft - foisting less and less efficient junk on the consumer. It's not down to the unions, it's down to laziness on the part of the employer. GM killed battery powered electric cars some years ago, and all three have been very slow in catching Toyota and others in terms of hybrids. That's nothing to do with union power, and everything to do with growing too big and arrogant to realise how vulnerable they are. A similar problem has killed off British car companies, e.g. Rover. For all the union bashing of the 80s (Britain no longer has closed shops, or a right to secondary picketing, we have mandatory notice periods for strikes, compulsory ballots) Rover failed to survive because it made expensive cars that weren't innovative or particularly good. I don't think they paid their workers any better (given that the company went bust about 3 times). It's worth remembering that German car makers, like BMW and VW are heavily unionised, but their economic culture is one where employers see unions as a partner, not as an enemy to be crushed.

   "I think the bigger problem the big 3 have is their lack of innovation.\n I addressed this with obvious child. It doesn't appear innovation was a problem. The big three could only make money with big trucks and SUVs. They couldn't compete on a cost level with cars. They went with what they had. If anything, the big 3 were the most innovative. You realize Chrysler was the key player in the \"minivan\". \n \n \nGM killed battery powered electric cars some years ago, and all three have been very slow in catching Toyota and others in terms of hybrids.\n \n Hybrids just don't sell and GM has a lot of hybrids now while Toyota has had massive problem with the hybrid Camery. Hybrids made up like 3% of total sales and have dropped something like 50% for the year last I heard. I suspect the Volt will probably flop for GM. Like I said earlier though, GM had to do something because clearly they can't compete with a normal car product.\n \n \nThat's nothing to do with union power, and everything to do with growing too big and arrogant to realise how vulnerable they are.\nWell, the evidence just isn't there for this conclusion. \n \n \nA similar problem has killed off British car companies, e.g. Rover.

They are actually idling plants right now in Germany much like Chrysler. Furthermore, it wasn't long ago when BMW was about gone thanks to crazy government costs and what not. These were changed along with some union changes and BMW did much better. Of course, Toyota hasn't been much in Europe compared to the US (if I remember right) which certainly helps them out. BMW even talks about their high labor costs form time to time. Speaking of time...here is an article on BMW I found: BMW Drives Germany - TIME\n or this one: BMW to Cut 8,000 Jobs at German Plants\n \n Despite popular belief (not by the poster I quoted here), this isn't some vast right wing thing to get rid of unions. The numbers don't lie and just putting blinders on will not change reality. Look at the financial statements, they are available on google finance I think. Look at the labor costs compared to toyota. These things just don't lie! The sales are somewhat fine for the hand they are dealt.",

Furthermore, they still are running a profit for the year. One bad half doesn't make you idle plants or have an operating loss for 4-5 years in a row. \n \n If you are barely afloat when times are good of course you are going to be bankrupt when times are bad.

A true analysis which I have been posting to various posters over a few weeks now shows that labor costs are the biggest issue at GM and Ford. The labor costs are a direct result of the union contracts. Now does this mean management had no backbone when making the contracts? Yeah, maybe...but the contracts are still the problem. These other problems that GM and Ford have are no different than what Toyota has. Everyone makes an unreliable car from time to time, everyone has a bad strategy for a few years, everyone is producing in an inefficient manner. The difference is Toyota doesn't have a weight attached to their leg which doesn't allow them to adapt. If Toyota and Honda start getting bigger operations in Europe we could see a big 3 Europe bailout.\n \n \nWe saw it here in the 80s when profitable and viable coal mines were shut down (we now import coal) to satisfy Thatcher's desire to crush union power.

I wouldn't jump to a conclusion that just because a union doesn't exists corruption exists. \n \n It costs GM and Ford over $1,000 more on average to produce a car. This may not seem like much on a $18,000 vehicle but $1,000 9.8million times certainly adds up. Cars have always been somewhat low margin.",

Maybe if they become the big 1 or 2. The problem, as I state earlier in the thread, is that the UAW has to make concessions to CURRENT pay and benefits, and I dont see them as being willing to do it. A republican president and congress would have strong armed them, but I dont think that the democrats have the political will. They will just throw more money at the automakers until they eventually collapse when we are no longer able to fund unending bailouts.",

Jaguar was bought in 1990 though which Volvo was the only one in 1998 (best year of Ford). \n \n In my opinion it is easy to point at failures of management but I could do that for every Fortune 500 company and many of them don't go bankrupt at the first recession or constantly have to work with expenses twice as high as their competitors. Toyota has made a number of terrible mistakes (see Tundra) but they are still fine. Should management have stood up to the Unions long ago? Probably, but they took the easy route out and now they are paying the price. The fault is still a large labor cost though regardless of how they got there. \n \n My main point is that it isn't like Ford and GM made \"cars\" people didn't want. For one, they were profitable when they were a truck company (SUV is a truck) and not when they are a car company. When it came time to make cars and not trucks, Ford and GM couldn't compete and they lost money and are now in financial trouble...Ford not so much because they have better management. \n \n I'm not sure holding on to that cash would have been a wise idea either. In any event, labor costs are the problem and unions helped with that.",

As you said, they did fine as truck and SUV makers, but when the time comes to sell cars they are WAY behind the curve. \n \n It is not just a matter of price competition, either. There is a real quality perception problem, plus a potential styling deficit. \n \n I thought it was funny a couple weeks ago watching the press conference where ford unveiled their new self parking towncar. It is almost like they thought we needed a reminder of why they were in such bad shape. The guy talked about how it was innovation like THAT that was going to pull them back form the brink. First, part of the PROBLEM is that people dont want big fuel swigging luxury cars anymore. Second...a self parking car is not \"innovative\". Lexus already did it and it did not go over (in fact it flopped so badly that infinity scrapped plans to offer it on their M series). Next I expect we will hear about their innovative self locking technology..just push a button on the door to lock or unlock all the doors in the car!!!",
