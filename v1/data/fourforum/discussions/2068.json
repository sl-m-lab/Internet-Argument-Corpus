   "The war looked good on paper, but there will be some unfortunate repercussions. Seems like al-Qaeda is an entity now manifested into Iraq and I see something bad brewing. However, I do think it's good we've ousted Saddam Hussein. I guess he was a despot, but I still think this war is about geopolitics. The death toll is fairly high, and I think hostilities will escalate in time. The Iraqis are getting restless, and I don't think they like the idea of Americans occupying Iraq for so long. IT's both overwhelming and paranoia-inducing, I'm sure. Aside from the billions and billions of dollars expended on this war, the civil strife and backlashes of al-Qaeda in Iraq, and the death toll, I'd say this war has been semi-successful, although I'm not sure what type of goal we've attained. I'm also a bit concerned about the new leader. I hope he's not biased in a religious manner, that's the last thing we need is a religious extremist as the person presiding over Iraq. I'd hate to see a conformist religious extremist revert to oppression of women in Iraq. That kind of **** needs to be cut out.",

The purpose of sending weapons inspectors was to look for evidence of Iraq re-initiating its WMD programs. But as they were thrown out of the country, the world was left in the dark as to whether anything was going on. Should the Coalition have waited in the hope that Hussein would let in the inspectors by the goodness of his heart? I realise that he did let the weapons inspectors search the country later on, but only after military build-up on Iraq's borders, and also years after the inspectors requested to go back in. It wouldn't be that absurd to think that he hid is weapons and programs in the time where there was no UN presence.\n \n To lend from a previous post (notice who this is said by also):\n \n \"What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad's regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs.\" -- Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002 \n \n \"I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.\" -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 \n \n Plus, there were witnesses consulted, the most notable being Chalabi. Though, it turns out that he was most likely divulging false information about the situation. And from the recent articles dmann has posted, you'd wonder why any administration would belive what he had to say without sufficient evidence to support his intel.\n \n We can go around in cirlces asking who was right, was the intel correct, who is to blame? But because the majority of the information needed to assess the situation is confidential, the general public (ie. us) is not privvy to it.\n \n As for the second part of the post, a terrorist is \"one who uses or favors terrorising methods of resisting a government, or of governing.\" Are you up to date with the recent history of Iraq?",

The world has only recently learnt of the massive scale of killings etc that occured.\n \n It's hard to look at pictures of countrymen suffering, or dead.
