Would you not say that our combination of mental and physical abilities sets us apart from all other species? Is that arrogance?\n\n \n \n \n The vast majority of the known world believes in evolution, and believes by definition, humans are Mammals. \n \n Mammals:\n 1. The first characteristic that guarantees that an animal is a mammal is that it (if it is female) can produce milk to feed its young. This milk is produced by modified sweat glands called 'mammary' glands. It is from these glands that the whole group takes its name, 'Mammals. (we do)\n \n 2. The second test is the possession of hair, something humans often have problems with but which they should respect more. No other animal has hair in the same form as mammals, and all mammals have some hair at least at the beginning of their lives - baby whales and dolphins are born with a moustache. (we do)\n \n 3. The lower jaw in mammals is a single bone on either side. In all other vertebrates there are more than one bone on each side of the jaw.\n [again...we do)\n \n 4. The mammal middle ear, and only the mammal middle ear, contains 3 bones. The Stapes or (Stirrup), Incus or (Anvil) and the Malleus or (Hammer). Once these bones were part of the lower jaw, but during the early evolution of mammals they changed jobs and became a part of our hearing apparatus instead. (yup)\n \n 5. In mammals the main artery leaving the heart curves to the left becoming the aortic arch. In birds it curves to the right and in all other vertebrates there are more than one main artery leaving the heart. ( check, yes)\n \n 6. Finally mammals have a diaphragm. A sheet of muscle and tendon that separates the body cavity into two sections. Heart and lungs before/above, liver, kidneys, stomach, intestines, etc, behind/below. No other animal has a diaphragm. (big breath....yup got that too)\n \n http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/mammal.html",

They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).\n \n \n Cheerio and thanks for the examples!

Its not hard to see how this scales up to a thinking being, we recognise traits that are linked to surivial in a very round about way like the bower bird, but passed through the more complicated system of intelligence.\n The art gallery could be seen in part as a display of wealth, with the art itself playing off random associaitations brains have ended up with whilst forming which results in a totally arbitary and apparently non-surivial linked thing being pleasing or appreciated.\n When you actually look at how the process of thinking works, its really not all that different in principle than how the ant colony is working. Just at a much faster level, to use intelligent design as something that seperates man from nature is too ignore what is actually happening during it (neurons growing and dying and reforming new links and pathways). Our self awareness is an emergant property of how the brain's networks are organised, there is nothing magical about it and it is working off the same rules as those of the ant colony (not saying the colonies think - but what we see as apparent inteligence in ants, colony building and food finding is based of a load of dumb subunits interacting on basic rules, same as neurons).",

   "There you go. Why are humans not in nature? These substances and structures are occuring in nature, right?\n\n Um, no. There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all. And, I've never seen one of those naturally occuring skyscrapers or Ford F-150's.\n \n \n \nHave you not seen animals play? Particularly at the zoo? Does that have to do with survival?\n\n YES. It teaches young animals how to get along with others and it teaches them how to fight and hunt, usually.\n \n Just like kids going to kindergarten teaches them how to get along with others (and fight). \n \n \nSo what if overriding other instincts is an instinc? (and there you go with natural again, why are human instincts not natural instincts?) Pretty much everything we do is instinctual.\n\n It depends on how broad your definition of instinct is.\n We try to separate \"rational thought\" from instinct, but then you can always say that rational thought is an instict itself.\n \n \nHuman beings are the only sentient beings. We have a concept of the future which separates us from all other creatures.\n\n I think others corrected you nicely on the future thing, but I would like to add that the only way humans are the only sentient beings is if we define sentient as something only humans are. If sentient merely means self-aware, I can't tell my cat's self-awareness from my own, so I really couldn't say who's sentient and who's not.\n \n \nUndoubtedly dogs (and other animals) have an \"emotional life\" but this has nothing to do with morality - which presupposes a self conscious/analytical mind.\n\n Well, if morality is simpy defined as:\n http://www.answers.com/morality\n mo\u00b7ral\u00b7i\u00b7ty (m&#601;-r&#259;l'&#301;-t&#275;, m\u00f4-) pronunciation\n n., pl. -ties.\n \n 1. The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct.\n 2. A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct: religious morality; Christian morality.\n 3. Virtuous conduct.\n 4. A rule or lesson in moral conduct.\n \n I would say, based on #1, that any social structure that gives rise to acceptable and unacceptable behavior is an example of a moral system.\n \n \nAs you say, morality is a human concept (can dogs have concepts ?) and we are, I think, discussing the vital differences that separate human beings from the rest of the animal kingdom - so morality, as I said earlier, comes into the picture.\n\n Who says dogs don't have concepts? What is your idea of what a concept is?\n If concepts are:\n http://www.answers.com/concept\n con\u00b7cept (k&#335;n's&#277;pt') pronunciation\n n.\n \n 1. A general idea derived or inferred from specific instances or occurrences.\n 2. Something formed in the mind; a thought or notion. See synonyms at idea.\n 3. A scheme; a plan: \"began searching for an agency to handle a new restaurant concept\" (ADWEEK).\n \n 1 and 2 both apply to animals like dogs and cats. I'd say that dogs and cats have very well-defined ideas inferred from previous instances or occurences. Surely they also have thoughts. They may not be as complicated as human thoughts or even chimp or orangutan thoughts, but they are still thoughts and notions.\n \n \nOf course behaviour based on a \"moral code\" adopted by human beings is categorically different from the instinctive or even the social behaviour of other animals. You can't follow a moral code without the self conscious and reflecting mind of a human being. \n To make this sort of claim doesn't justify an assumption of human superiority over other animals; it just draws attention to a crucial difference.\n\n \n What is so different in fundamental nature between the social structure of one species versus the social structure of another? The very fact that there is social structure at all means that there are rules to follow, a moral code. Of course you can follow a moral code without a human mind. Wolves, Lions, Parrots, all live by certain social norms, they live by certain rules. Sometimes the rules are broken and there is punishment, just like in the human social structure.\n \n I don't think anyone can accurately say how reflecting is the mind of a chimp, a gorilla, or an orangutan. My cat sits and looks out the window all day. Is he reflecting? Who can say?\n \n \n@Tastyfish\n \n Are you seriously suggesting that wolves have evolved ethical principles because (from the example you gave) they share access to their food ?\n\n Of course. Wolves and other pack animals share food. They have various ethical principles and rules about how the food is shared. \n \n \nIf you can't understand the point I've tried to make about the difference in principle between the behaviour of animals (human beings) who have a brain that has created a conscious mind capable of deliberating about moral choices and the behaviour of other animals who don't have that capacity, I don't see that I can be of any further assistance.\n\n It's not a matter of fundamental difference between humans and other animals, but one of scale (scale of capability). The human brain is capable of MORE thought about something, more reflection. There are some animals that have very little ability to sit and think about how they were treated or how they should treat others, but as you move up in overall intellegence, the capability to do that is greater. \n \n Ever had a cat hold a grudge against you? They seem to have more of an eye-for-an-eye morality. If you really get on the bad side of a cat, it will pee on things you'd rather they didn't pee on. Or later on in the day after you've scolded a cat, it will still be pouting. It won't come sit with you and if you try to pick it up it will swat at you. I'm not saying this happens with all cats all the time, but if you've ever had a cat hold a grudge against you, you've just experienced its ability to deliberate moral choices. It may not be the same moral choices you make, but not even all us super-intellegent, non-animal humans can agree on a single moral system to follow.",

   "How many times larger is New York than a human? or how about Beijing?\n \n\n How many times larger is a bee hive than a bee? That's just one structure. You could call all the flowers and other stuff the bee's \"city\".\n \n \n\n Who said anything about complexity for complexitys sake? Do you think a city or a dam is \"kind of dumb\" in its complexity?\n \n\n No I was just saying that just because we can build something more complex doesn't mean we are smarter.\n \n \n\n Yes, although sometimes we can endure far more than just mild discomfort in such a scenario.\n \n\n Where is a scenario where we have endured a lot of pain to survive? I'm not sure I understand you here.\n \n \n\n I don't quite read the meaning of your sentence, but I'll try to respond as best I can (perhaps clarify your point?)\n \n In the context of the original quote the chance of survival is irrelevant. The animal chews its leg of, and then escapes- permanently crippled if it survives at all (unlikely). Or it struggles until it is worn out and presents no threat to the trapper when they return. Its actions do nothing to stop the trapper setting more traps and bestowing the same fate on more of its kind in the future. Because the animal is operating on instinct this is all it can do- it has no comphension of how it can turn its very bad situation to its own advantage.\n\n \n You say if it survives at all it is permanently crippled. If it didn't chew its leg off, it's as good as dead. And we do the same thing (which is the smart thing by the way). Didn't you hear about the one guy who amputated his arm to escape from a boulder trapping him? Waiting for the trapper to return would not really do anything to stop the setting of more traps either.",

The issue here is objects that are actually built to a design and purpose, not just utilised because they are already there.\n \n \nYou say if it survives at all it is permanently crippled.

   "I'm just wondering why all of the other species in the world, of which most would agree we evolved from are considered \"in nature\" yet we aren't. \n\n \n The best way to survive and procreate is to play along with whatever game is at hand, and not to ask a lot of penetrating questions. Mutual admiration is useful to a species. Baboons can only mate with other baboons. It is futile for a baboon to side with chimps, when it comes to a war. It is natural that humans don't consider themselves as just another part of nature.",

What makes us so elite?\n\n \n 'Allowed'... I think it's a personal thing -- some people feel they are 'allowed' to kill other humans, some people feel they aren't 'allowed' to kill any animal at all.\n \n I could go into killing for food, or killing for defence, or indeed the 'governments' manopoly over violence and how it hypocritically threatens violence to those who attempt 'unauthorised', 'illegal' violence.\n \n \nAre we so arrogant that we assume we are the only animals capable of thought or choices?\n\n \n Yes, many people I feel are that arrogant.",
