   "Below is a survey I discovered online that I thought would be interesting for the forum regulars to take. It's a real survey that has been used by real researchers in actual scientific studies to determine the attitudes of groups of people on a certain scale. (And no, it's not the Kinsey.)\n \n It was reprinted in an on-line book that I'll link to after a certain number of people have responded with their scores, at which point I'll reveal what it's meant to measure. (You can always Google it, but I think it's more fun this way.)\n \n It may be easier for you to print it out, as the scoring is a bit tricky.\n \n \nThis survey is part of an investigation of general public opinion concerning a variety of social issues.\n \n You will probably find that you agree with some of the statements, and disagree with others, to varying extents. Please indicate your reaction to each statement on the line to the left of each item according to the following scale:\n Write down a -4 if you very strongly disagree with the statement.\n Write down a -3 if you strongly disagree with the statement.\n Write down a -2 if you moderately disagree with the statement.\n Write down a -1 if you slightly disagree with the statement.\n Write down a +1 if you slightly agree with the statement.\n Write down a +2 if you moderately agree with the statement.\n Write down a +3 if you strongly agree with the statement.\n Write down a +4 if you very strongly agree with the statement.\n If you feel exactly and precisely neutral about an item, write down a \"0.\"\n \n Important: You may find that you sometimes have different reactions to different parts of a statement. For example, you might very strongly disagree (\"-4\") with one idea in a statement, but slightly agree (\"+1\") with another idea in the same item. When this happens, please combine your reactions, and write down how you feel on balance (a \"-3\" in this case).\n \n ___ 1. The established authorities generally turn out to be right about things, while the radicals and protestors are usually just \"loud mouths\" showing off their ignorance.\n \n ___ 2. Women should have to promise to obey their husbands when they get married.\n \n ___ 3. Our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\n .\n ___ 4. Gays and lesbians are just as healthy and moral as anybody else.\n \n ___ 5. It is always better to trust the judgment of the proper authorities in government and religion than to listen to the noisy rabblerousers in our society who are trying to create doubt in people's minds.\n \n ___ 6. Atheists and others who have rebelled against the established religions are no doubt every bit as good and virtuous as those who attend church regularly.\n \n ___ 7. The only way our country can get through the crisis ahead is to get back to our traditional values, put some tough leaders in power, and silence the troublemakers spreading bad ideas.\n \n ___ 8. There is absolutely nothing wrong with nudist camps. \n \n ___ 9. Our country needs free thinkers who have the courage to defy traditional ways, even if this upsets many people.\n \n ___ 10. Our country will be destroyed someday if we do not smash the perversions eating away at our moral fiber and traditional beliefs. \n \n ___ 11. Everyone should have their own lifestyle, religious beliefs, and sexual preferences, even if it makes them different from everyone else.\n \n ___ 12. The \"old-fashioned ways\" and the \"old-fashioned values\" still show the best way to live.\n \n ___ 13. You have to admire those who challenged the law and the majority's view by protesting for women's abortion rights, for animal rights, or to abolish school prayer.\n \n ___ 14. What our country really needs is a strong, determined leader who will crush evil, and take us back to our true path. \n \n ___ 15. Some of the best people in our country are those who are challenging our government, criticizing religion, and ignoring the \"normal way things are supposed to be done.\"\n \n ___ 16. God's laws about abortion, pornography and marriage must be strictly followed before it is too late, and those who break them must be strongly punished.\n \n ___ 17. There are many radical, immoral people in our country today, who are trying to ruin it for their own godless purposes, whom the authorities should put out of action. \n \n ___ 18. A \"woman's place\" should be wherever she wants to be. The days when women are submissive to their husbands and social conventions belong strictly in the past. \n \n ___ 19. Our country will be great if we honor the ways of our forefathers, do what the authorities tell us to do, and get rid of the \"rotten apples\" who are ruining everything. \n \n ___ 20. There is no \"ONE right way\" to live life; everybody has to create their own way.\n \n ___ 21. Homosexuals and feminists should be praised for being brave enough to defy \"traditional family values. \n \n ___ 22. This country would work a lot better if certain groups of troublemakers would just shut up and accept their group's traditional place in society\n \n SCORING: \n \n Skip the first two answers--they're just warm-ups.\n \n For number Nos. 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 & 22:\n If you wrote down a \"-4\" that's scored as a 1.\n If you wrote down a \"-3\" that's scored as a 2.\n If you wrote down a \"-2\" that's scored as a 3.\n If you wrote down a \"-1\" that's scored as a 4.\n If you wrote down a \"0\" or left the item unanswered, that's scored as a 5.\n If you wrote down a \"+1\" that's scored as a 6.\n If you wrote down a \"+2\" that's scored as a 7.\n If you wrote down a \"+3\" that's scored as an 8.\n If you wrote down a \"+4\" that's scored as a 9.\n For Nos. 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20 & 21:\n If you wrote down a \"-4\" that's scored as a 9.\n If you wrote down a \"-3\" that's scored as an 8.\n If you wrote down a \"-2\" that's scored as a 7.\n If you wrote down a \"-1\" that's scored as a 6.\n If you wrote down a \"0\" or left the item unanswered, that's scored as a 5.\n If you wrote down a \"+1\" that's scored as a 4.\n If you wrote down a \"+2\" that's scored as a 3.\n If you wrote down a \"+3\" that's scored as a 2.\n If you wrote down a \"+4\" that's scored as a 1.\n(I scored a 38, btw. :-) )",

   "Well, by now I'm pretty sure that our (ahem) right-thinking participants have decided they're not going to participate--which frankly doesn't suprise me in the least, given their already amply demonstrated propensity for anonymity and paranoia.\n \n Anyway, the survey is to non-judgmentally determine Right Wing Authoritarian attitudes, and can be found in the first chapter of this highly enjoyable on-line book:\n \n http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf\n \n (The author, Bob Altemeyer, is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Manitoba, and advised John Dean in the writing of his book, Conservatives Without Conscience)\n \n HIGHLY excerpted excerpts (read the book--it's free and online!):\n \nIntroductory psychology students at my Canadian university average about 75. Their parents average about 90. Both scores are below the mid-point of the scale, which is 100, so most people in these groups are not authoritarian followers in absolute terms. Neither are most Americans, it seems. Mick McWilliams and Jeremy Keil administered the RWA scale to a reasonably representative sample of 1000 Americans in 2005 for the Libertarian Party and discovered an average score of 90.3, 4 Thus the Manitoba parent samples seem similar in overall authoritarianism to a representative American adult sample. My Manitoba students score about the same on the RWA scale as most American university students do too. \n \n Let me give you three compelling reasons why you should treat your personal score with a grain of salt. \n \n First, psychological tests make mistakes about individuals, which is what you happen to be, I&#8217;ll bet. Even the best instruments, such as the best IQ tests, get it wrong sometimes--as I think most people know. Thus the RWA scale can&#8217;t give sure-thing diagnoses of individuals. (But it can reliably identify levels of authoritarianism in groups, because too-high errors and too-low errors tend to even out in big samples. So we&#8217;ll do the group grope in this book, and not go on the individual counseling trip.) \n \n Second, how you responded to the items depended a lot on how you interpreted them. You may have writhed in agony wondering, &#8220;What does he mean by _______?&#8221; as you answered. If I failed often to get the gist of what I was saying over to you, your score will certainly be misleading. \n \n Third, you knew what the items were trying to measure, didn&#8217;t you, you rascal! The RWA scale is a personality test disguised as an attitude survey, but I&#8217;ll bet you saw right through it. In fact, you could probably take each statement apart and see how I was trying to slyly tap the various components of the RWA personality trait...\n \n So I didn&#8217;t ask you to answer the RWA scale to see if you&#8217;d find true happiness and fulfillment as a stormtrooper in some dictator&#8217;s army. It&#8217;s not a vocational test. Instead, I wanted you to experience for yourself the instrument used to identify and study authoritarian followers. Most of what I have uncovered about authoritarianism, I have dug up with this tool, and now you know what it is and how it works. \n \n Is the RWA Scale Valid?\n \n According to the High Laws of Science (you do not have to genuflect here), ideas must be repeatedly tested to see if they fail. So the next (and extremely important) question is, does the RWA scale really measure what it says it measures? Are the test scores valid? If they are, we should find that high scorers submit to established authority more than most people do, aggress more in the name of such authority, and are much more conventional. What&#8217;s the evidence?\n \n Authoritarian Submission. Everybody submits to authority to some degree. Imagine a world in which people ignored traffic laws and sped through red lights. The cost of auto insurance would shoot through the roof (although the line-ups to buy it would become much shorter). But some people go way beyond the norm and submit to authority even when it is dishonest, corrupt, unfair and evil. We would expect authoritarian followers especially to submit to corrupt authorities in their lives: to believe them when there is little reason to do so, to trust them when huge grounds for suspicion exist, and to hold them blameless when they do something wrong. We don&#8217;t expect absolutes here; people are much too complicated to completely, always, blindly submit, no matter what. But IF the RWA scale truly measures the tendency to be an authoritarian follower, those who score highly on it should tend to do these things, right? So do they?\n \n Well, they will tell you that people should submit to authority in virtually all circumstances. If you give them moral dilemmas (e.g. should one steal an absurdly expensive drug to save a life?) they&#8217;re more likely to say, &#8220;The law is the law and must be obeyed&#8221; than most people are. High RWAs also say they would bow more to show respect for their fathers, the president of companies where they worked, and so on, than most people indicate. \n \n High RWAs trusted President Nixon longer and stronger than most people did during the Watergate crisis. Some of them still believed Nixon was innocent of criminal acts even after he accepted a pardon for them... To pick a more current example, authoritarian followers believed, more than most people did, President George W. Bush&#8217;s false claims that Saddam Hussein had extensive links to al-Qaida, and that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. And they supported the invasion of Iraq, whereas less authoritarian Americans tended to doubt the wisdom of that war from the start. \n \n Caution No. 1. On the other hand, right-wing authoritarians did not support President Clinton during his impeachment and trial over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. So as I said, the support is not automatic and reflexive, but can be trumped by other concerns. In Clinton&#8217;s case his administration not only had advocated for groups anathema to authoritarians, such as homosexuals and feminists, his sexual misdeeds in the White House deeply offended many high RWAs...\n \n Caution No. 2. Can we conclude from all these findings that authoritarian followers always aggress when they think the &#8220;proper authorities&#8221; approve? No, no more than they always submit to established authority. &#8220;Always&#8221; is a lot, and such generalizations ignore the complexity of human motivation. Fear of counteraggression can freeze the authoritarian&#8217;s hand, or belief that the hostility is unlawful and will be punished...\n \n Conventionalism. By conventionalism, the third defining element of the rightwing authoritarian, I don&#8217;t just mean do you put your socks on before your shoes, and I don&#8217;t just mean following the norms and customs that you like. I mean believing that everybody should have to follow the norms and customs that your authorities have decreed. Authoritarians get a lot of their ideas about how people ought to act from their religion, and as we&#8217;ll see in chapter 4 they tend to belong to fundamentalist religions that make it crystal clear what they consider correct and what they consider wrong. For example these churches strongly advocate a traditional family structure of father-as-head, mother as subservient to her husband and caretaker of the usband&#8217;s\n begotten, and kids as subservient, period. The authoritarian followers who fill a lot of the pews in these churches strongly agree. And they want everybody&#8217;s family to be like that. (A word of advice, guys: check with your wives first.)\n \n You can also gauge the conventionalism of authoritarian followers through my &#8220;feedback-conformity experiments.&#8221; I simply tell a group who earlier had filled out a scale for me what the average response had been to each item, in the sample as a whole. For example, I would tell them that the average answer to Item 1 of the RWA scale was a &#8220;+1,&#8221; the average answer to Item 2 was a &#8220;-2,&#8221; and so on. Then I ask the sample to answer the scale again, with the average-answers-from-before staring them right in the face. The point, as you have no doubt surmised, is to see which extreme moves more toward the norm, the lows or the highs. High RWAs shift their answers toward the middle about twice as much as lows do. This even works on hard-core authoritarian beliefs such as their answers about homosexuals and religious fundamentalism. \n \n Which explains another peculiar finding. If I tell a group of former subjects most of what I&#8217;ve told you in this chapter--which I think raise some questions about how &#8220;Blessed are the authoritarians&#8221;--and then ask the sample what they personally would like their own RWA scale score to be, what do you think happens? The low RWAs say they&#8217;d like to be low RWAs. So do the middles. But the highs usually say they want to be middles, not lows. I thought this happened because highs often dislike the people who would score low on the RWA scale, and that may be part of the explanation. But I also discovered that if you ask subjects to rank the importance of various values in life, authoritarian followers place &#8220;being normal&#8221; substantially higher than most people do. It&#8217;s almost as though they want to disappear as individuals into the vast vat of Ordinaries.\n \n Caution No. 3. Once again, however, I should temper our natural tendency to overgeneralize. High RWAs would like to be rich as much as the next person would, they&#8217;d like to be smarter than average, and so on. It&#8217;s &#8220;good&#8221; to be different in some ways, it seems. And I found they would not change their opinions about abortion an inch by showing them how different they were from most others. They are quite capable of adhering to the beliefs emphasized by their in-groups when these conflict with what is held by society as a whole. Nevertheless, they do get tugged by what they think everybody else is saying and doing. For example, their attitudes toward homosexuals have become markedly more positive recently, just as the rest of society&#8217;s attitudes have changed. And thirty years ago the solid majority of high RWA students in my samples said premarital sexual intercourse was flat-out immoral. Now most say it is moral if the couple plans to get married...\n \n Summary\n \n ... You now know that the RWA scale is a reliable, a valid, and (as these things go) a rather powerful instrument for identifying the authoritarian follower personality. That&#8217;s worth knowing because most of what follows in the later chapters depends on it. The social sciences are awash with attitude scales, opinion surveys, and personality tests, and frankly most of them are not very good imho. But this one appears to be the real deal. A goodly amount of evidence has piled up showing that scores on the RWA scale really do measuretendencies toward authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism.\n \n We can therefore use it to try to understand the people who seem, so unwittingly, ready to cash in democracy, and perhaps the world.\n \nAs you can see, Altemayer has a breezy, articulate style. His whole book is worth reading, but check out Chapter 4 in particular, especially in regards to the topic of this forum.\n \n And many thanks to those who participated!!",

   "Somewhere down the lower end, got too lazy to score it.\n \n I'm pretty sure it won't meet the definition of a valid psychological construct, it's very, very difficult to convince psychologists a thing exists, especially in this case where it's a rather heterogenous set of traits bound together with correlations.\n \n If you've ever heard of Emotional Intelligence, even it can't get traction in the psychological community. The OCEAN personality scale and IQ tests are really the only things with enough rigour to fly at the moment, and even they are strongly questioned from time to time. (But have at least proven themselves useful).\n \n For this to have some evidence for even treating it as if it exists, it would have to probably satisfy at least 2 of the following characteristics;\n \n 1) Have greater predictive power than an IQ test would for the same thing. (e.g. predict that someone is more likely to \"obey authority\" with better accuracy than an IQ test would)\n \n 2) Have greater predictive power than an OCEAN personality inventory would for the same thing. (e.g. predict that someone is more likely to \"obey authority\" with better accuracy than an OCEAN test would)\n \n 3) Add incremental predictive power to a combined IQ test & OCEAN inventory. e.g. say an IQ test can predict willingness to obey with 70% accuracy. Add an OCEAN inventory as well and you can reach 80% accuracy. Adding this test should allow the prediction with say, 85% accuracy.\n \n You will note that the existence of a construct is predicated on \"usefulness\". This is because cognitive psychology isn't really a science, in the same way that electrical engineering isn't really a science.

   "It'd be nice if people READ THE BOOK as I suggested (not just my excerpts) before jumping to erroneous generalizations:\nRight-Wing and Left-Wing Authoritarian Followers \n \n Authoritarian followers usually support the established authorities in their society, such as government officials and traditional religious leaders. Such people have historically been the \"proper\" authorities in life, the time-honored, entitled, customary leaders, and that means a lot to most authoritarians. \n \n Psychologically thesefollowers have personalities featuring:1) a high degree of submission to the established, legitimate authorities in their society;\n 2) high levels of aggression in the name of their authorities; and\n 3) a high level of conventionalism.\n Because the submission occurs to traditional authority, I call these followers rightwing authoritarians. I'm using the word \"right\" in one of its earliest meanings, for in Old English \"riht\" (pronounced \"writ\") as an adjective meant lawful, proper, correct, doing what the authorities said... \n \n In North America people who submit to the established authorities to extraordinary degrees often turn out to be political conservatives, so you can call them \"right-wingers\" both in my new-fangled psychological sense and in the usual political sense as well. But someone who lived in a country long ruled by Communists and who ardently supported the Communist Party would also be one of my psychological right-wing authoritarians even though we would also say he was a political left-winger. So a right-wing authoritarian follower doesn't necessarily have conservative political views. Instead he's someone who readily submits to the established authorities in society, attacks others in their name, and is highly conventional. It's an aspect of his personality, not a description of his politics. Rightwing authoritarianism is a personality trait, like being characteristically bashful or happy or grumpy or dopey.\n \n You could have left-wing authoritarian followers as well, who support a revolutionary leader who wants to overthrow the establishment. I knew a few in the 1970s, Marxist university students who constantly spouted their chosen authorities, Lenin or Trotsky or Chairman Mao. Happily they spent most of their time fighting with each other, as lampooned in Monty Python's Life of Brian where the People's Front of Judea devotes most of its energy to battling, not the Romans, but the Judean People's Front. But the left-wing authoritarians on my campus disappeared long ago.\n \n Similarly in America \"the Weathermen\" blew away in the wind. I'm sure one can find left-wing authoritarians here and there, but they hardly exist in sufficient numbers now to threaten democracy in North America. However I have found bucketfuls of right-wing authoritarians in nearly every sample I have drawn in Canada and the United States for the past three decades. So when I speak of \"authoritarian followers\" in this book I mean right-wing authoritarian followers, as identified by the RWA scale.\nhttp://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf, pages 9-10.",

God has given humanity a complete, unfailing guide to happiness and salvation, which must be totally followed.\n \n ____ 2. No single book of religious teachings contains all the intrinsic, fundamental truths about life.\n \n ____ 3. The basic cause of evil in this world is Satan, who is still constantly and ferociously fighting against God.\n \n ____ 4. It is more important to be a good person than to believe in God and the right religion.\n \n ____ 5. There is a particular set of religious teachings in this world that are so true, you can't go any \"deeper\" because they are the basic, bedrock message that God has given humanity.\n \n ____ 6. When you get right down to it, there are basically only two kinds of people in the world: the Righteous, who will be rewarded by God, and the rest, who will not. \n \n ____ 7. Scriptures may contain general truths, but they should NOT be considered completely, literally true from beginning to end.\n \n ____ 8. To lead the best, most meaningful life, one must belong to the one, fundamentally true religion. \n \n ____ 9. \"Satan\" is just the name people give to their own bad impulses.

   "Altmeyer again, on the above: \nIntro Psychology students at my Canadian university average about 50, while their parents usually land a few points higher. A nationwide sample of some 300 members of an unnamed fundamentalist Protestant church in the United States, gathered by Ted Witzig, thumped out a 93.1--the highest group score I have yet seen.\n \n Your famous intuition probably led you to suspect this scale has something to do with religious conservatism. So you were wised up and should not view your score with much faith (or hope, or charity).\n \n Bruce Hunsberger and I called this the Religious Fundamentalism scale when we developed it some years ago. We did not mean by \"fundamentalism\" a particular set of religious beliefs, a creed. It was clear that the mind-set of fundamentalism could be found in many faiths. Instead we tried to measure a person's attitudes toward whatever beliefs she had, trying to identify the common underlying psychological elements in the thinking of people who were commonly called Christian fundamentalists, Hindu fundamentalists, Jewish fundamentalists, and Muslim fundamentalists.\n \n We thought a fundamentalist in any of these major faiths would feel that her religious beliefs contained the fundamental, basic, intrinsic, inerrant truth about humanity and the Divine--fundamentally speaking. She would also believe this essential truth is fundamentally opposed by forces of evil that must be vigorously fought, and that this truth must be followed today according to the fundamental, unchangeable practices of the past. Finally, those who follow these fundamental beliefs would have a special relationship with the deity.\n \n Research has confirmed that the Religious Fundamentalism scale has validity in all the religions named. You can find some high scorers in all of them who fit the description just given. More to the point, the scale may give us a way to study the psychology of the \"Religious Right\" in America today.\n",

   "My highly excerpted, boiled down, \"reader's digest\" version of the rest of the chapter (but again, READ THE WHOLE THING FOR YOURSELVES):\n \n \n1. Fundamentalists and Evangelicals in America \n \n &#8220;Fundamentalism&#8221; has a particular meaning in the United States. It refers to a movement that grew within Protestantism nearly a century ago in reaction to developments in the then modern world, most particularly to scholarly analyses of the Bible that cast strong doubt on its supposed divine origins. \n \n To refute these analyses a series of pamphlets called &#8220;The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth&#8221; was widely distributed. At first they dealt mainly with scriptural issues, rebutting the charges that the Bible was man-made, rewritten as time passed, and laced with myths, biases and inaccurate history. Instead, the pamphlets claimed, the Bible has no error in it whatsoever; it is the original word of God, exactly as God wanted things put. But the focus shifted by the end of the series, and essays came out against &#8220;The Decadence of Darwinism,&#8221; &#8220;Romanism,&#8221; Christian Science, Mormonism, and socialism. A Baptist editor in 1920 termed those who stood ready &#8220;to do battle royal for The Fundamentals&#8221; the &#8220;fundamentalists,&#8221; and the label stuck.\n \n Protestant fundamentalism suffered so much public ridicule after the famous &#8220;Scopes Monkey Trial&#8221; in Dayton, Tennessee in 1925 that its influence waned for many years. In the late 1940s it reappeared as (or was transformed into) the evangelical movement, with the Rev. Billy Graham its most famous leader.\n \n Evangelicals had a different &#8220;take&#8221; on the role of religion in society in some respects. In particular, they believed they had a responsibility not just to defend Christianity, but to evangelize, to preach the Gospel to others. \n \n The following seven items were developed by George Barna, an admirable evangelical pollster who closely follows religious development in the United States, to identify evangelicals.Do you believe Jesus Christ lived a sinless life?\n Do you believe eternal salvation is possible only through grace, not works?\n Do you believe Christians have a personal responsibility to share their religious beliefs about Christ with non-Christians?\n Is your faith very important to your life today?\n Do you believe Satan is a real, living entity?\n Do you believe God is the all-knowing, all-powerful, perfect deity who created\n the universe and still rules it today?\n Do you believe the Bible is totally accurate in all that it teaches?If you say yes to all seven of these questions, you would be an evangelical by Barna&#8217;s definition.\n \n The word &#8220;fundamentalists&#8221; has gotten a lot of bad press lately, so conservative Protestants today tend to say they are evangelicals. But evangelicals score highly on the Religious Fundamentalism scale you just answered. In a 2005 survey I conducted of over six hundred parents of students at my university... 7 85% of the 139 parents who answered yes to all of Barna&#8217;s seven questions were High fundamentalists (i.e. they landed in the top 25 percent of the scores on the Religious Fundamentalism scale). They racked up an average score of 86.6 on the measure--discernibly lower but still in the same ballpark as the American fundamentalists&#8217; 93.1 in Witzig&#8217;s study.\n \n Looked at the other way, 72% of the Christians who scored highly on the fundamentalism measure qualified as &#8220;Barna evangelicals.&#8221; So call them what you will, most evangelicals are fundamentalists according to our measure, and most Christian fundamentalists are evangelicals. Whether you are talking about evangelicals or talking about Christian fundamentalists, you are largely talking about the same people.\n \n Some high religious fundamentalists turn up in all the faiths represented in my samples, including Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. Within Christianity, I always find some Catholics scoring highly on the Religious Fundamentalism scale, a few Anglicans post big numbers, some Lutherans ring the bell, and so on. But in study after study the high scores pile up far more often in the conservative Protestant denominations than anywhere else, among Baptists, Mennonites, Pentecostals, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, the Alliance Church, and so on. It bears repeating that this is a generalization, and some Baptists, etcetera score quite low in fundamentalism. \n \n But if you want to make a safe wager, see what odds you can get betting that these conservative sects will score higher on the Religious Fundamentalism scale than the other major Christian groups.\n\n Continued next post...",

   "Continued from above...\n \n \n2. Fundamentalism and Right-Wing Authoritarianism \n \n The first thing you need to know about religious fundamentalists, in case you haven't inferred it already, is that they usually score very highly on the RWA scale. A solid majority of them are authoritarian followers. The two traits,\n authoritarianism and fundamentalism, go together so well that nearly everything I have said about high RWAs in the previous chapters also applies to high Religious Fundamentalists.\n \n Since authoritarianism can produce fundamentalism if one grows up submissively in a religiously conservative family, and (conversely), fundamentalism can promote authoritarianism with its emphases on submission to religious authority, dislike of out-groups, sticking to the straight and narrow, and so on, one immediately wonders which is the chicken and which is the egg.\n \n The evidence indicates authoritarianism is more basic. The RWA scale correlates better than the Religious Fundamentalism scale does with acceptance of government injustices, hostility toward homosexuals, willingness to persecute whomever the government targets, and most other things. (The big exception naturally comes when one raises distinctly religious issues.) So the problem's not so much that some people are fundamentalists, but that fundamentalists so definitely tend to be authoritarian followers. But as I just said, religious fundamentalism does promote authoritarianism in some ways. And you can certainly see the influence of right-wing authoritarianism in many things that religious fundamentalists do.\n \n 3. Fundamentalism as a Template for Prejudice\n \n Let me ask you a personal question: Who are you? What makes up your identity? How would you describe yourself?\n \n You would probably list your gender fairly quickly, your age, your nationality, marital status and your job--unless you are a student, in which case you'd say you're poor and going deeply into debt. Would you mention a religious affiliation? You almost certainly would if you are a high fundamentalist. \n \n Furthermore, except for converts, this has probably been true of fundamentalists for all of their lives. They report that their parents placed a lot of emphasis on their religious identification as they were growing up. For example, \"You are a Baptist,\" or \"We belong to the Assembly of God.\" It would have become one of the main ways they thought of themselves. By comparison, they say their gender and race were stressed much less.\n \n What's the effect of emphasizing the family's religious affiliation to a child? Well, by creating this category of what the family is, you instantly create the category of people who are not that, who are different. You're laying down an in-group versus out-group distinction. Even if you never say a nasty word about other religions, the enormous human tendency to think in ethnocentric terms will create a preference for \"people like me.\" Throw in some gratuitous nasty words about Jews, Muslims, Methodists, atheists, and so on, and you've likely sown the seeds of religious prejudice in a four-year old. Perhaps more importantly in the long run, you've given your child early training in the wonderful world of \"Us versus Them\"--training that\n may make it easier for him to acquire racial, sexual, and ethnic prejudices later on.\n \n There can be little doubt that, as adults, Christian fundamentalists harbor a pointed dislike of other religions. Here are some items from my Religious Ethnocentrism scale that fundamentalists tend to agree with: \n \n Our country should always be a Christian country, and other beliefs should be ignored in our public institutions.\n \n Nonchristian religions have a lot of weird beliefs and pagan ways that Christians should avoid having any contact with.\n \n All people may be entitled to their own religious beliefs, but I don't want to associate with people whose views are quite different from my own. \n At the same time, fundamentalists tend to disagree with:\n If there is a heaven, good people will go to it no matter what religion they belong to, if any.\n \n You can trust members of all religions equally; no one religion produces better people than any other does.\n \n People who belong to different religions are probably just as nice and moral as those who belong to mine.Yep, it's Us versus Them. Religious prejudice does not draw as much attention or produce as much hatred in North America as it does in (say) the Middle East and southern Asia, but it's still dynamite looking for a place to explode because it's so often accompanied by the self-righteousness that releases aggression. And it runs deep in Christian fundamentalists because religion is so important to them.\n \n News that they score relatively highly on racial prejudice scales often stuns white fundamentalists. They will usually reply, \"You must be mistaken. We're not prejudiced. Why, we accept black people in our church.\" And indeed, if you ask a white fundamentalist if he'd rather spend an evening with a black member of his church or a white atheist, he will almost certainly choose the former.\n \n But fundamentalists still hold more racial prejudices than most people--a fact known to social scientists for over fifty years. White churches were open to just white folks for generations in America, and many pastors found justification in the Bible for both slavery and the segregation that followed the demise of slavery. Vestiges of this remain in fundamentalist religions. Bill McCartney, the founder of the evangelical men's movement called Promise Keepers, tells the story of what happened on a nation-wide speaking tour when he finished up his stock speech with a call for racial reconciliation:\n \"There was no response--nothing...In city after city, in church after church, it was the same story--wild enthusiasm while I was being introduced, followed by a morgue-like chill as I stepped away from the microphone.\" \n Ironically, most fundamentalists say they believe in \"the brotherhood of all mankind.\" \"We are all God's children.\" \"Jesus loves you\"--whoever you are. It says so in their mental boxes. But they still like best, by a long shot, the people who are most exactly like themselves. Where did this crushing rejection of others come from?\n \n Its earliest roots appear buried in the person's religious training. \n\n To be continued...",

   "Continued from above...\n4. The Mental Life of Fundamentalists\n \n Mark Noll, an evangelical history professor at evangelical Wheaton College, begins his book, The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind, with a pithy thought: &#8220;The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind.&#8221; Noll observes that &#8220;American evangelicals are not exemplary for their thinking, and they have not been so for several generations.&#8221; He points out that evangelicals support dozens of theological seminaries, scores of colleges, and hundreds of radio stations, but not a single research university. &#8220;In the United States he writes, it is simply impossible to be, with integrity, both evangelical and intellectual.&#8221; &#8220;Modern American evangelicals have failed notably in sustaining serious intellectual life.&#8221;\n \n I have found nothing in my research that disagrees with this assessment. Indeed almost all of the findings in the last chapter about the authoritarian follower&#8217;s penchants for illogical thinking, compartmentalized minds, double standards, hypocrisy and dogmatism apply to religious fundamentalists as well. For example, David Winter at the University of Michigan recently found that fundamentalist students, when evaluating the war in Iraq, rejected a series of statements that were based on the Sermon on the Mount--which is arguably the core of Jesus&#8217; teachings.\n \n Fundamentalists may believe they follow Jesus more than anyone else does, but it turns out to depend a lot on where Jesus said we should go. And we can augment such findings by considering the thinking behind three of the fundamentalist&#8217;s favorite issues: school prayer, opposition to evolution, and the infallibility of the Bible.\n \n A. School Prayer: Majority Rights, Unless... Suppose a law were passed requiring the strenuous teaching of religion in public schools. Beginning in kindergarten, all children would be taught to believe in God, pray together in school several times each day, memorize the Ten Commandments and other parts of the Bible, learn the principles of Christian morality, and eventually be encouraged to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior. How would you react to such a law?\n \n The great majority of people in my samples who answered this question, including most of the Christians, said this would be a bad law. But most fundamentalists liked the idea, for this is exactly the kind of education they would like to see public schools give to everyone&#8217;s children. When I asked fundamentalists about the morality of imposing this learning on the children of Hindus, Jews, atheists, etcetera, they responded along the lines of, &#8220;This is a Christian country, and the majority rules. If others don&#8217;t like it, they can pay for private education or leave.&#8221; (As I said, most people do not favor this proposal, but since the days of the &#8220;Moral Majority&#8221; fundamentalists have tended to overestimate their numbers in society.)\n \n What do you think happened when I asked people to respond to this parallel scenario?\n \n Suppose you were living in a modern Arab democracy, whose constitution stated there could be NO state religion--even though the vast majority of the people were Muslims. Then a fundamentalist Islamic movement was elected to power, and passed a law requiring the strenuous teaching of religion in public schools. Beginning in kindergarten, all children would be taught to believe in Allah, pray together facing Mecca several times each day, memorize important parts of the Koran, learn the principles of Islamic morality, and eventually be encouraged to declare their allegiance to Muhammad and become a Muslim. How would you react to such a law?\n \n Again, a great majority of my samples thought this would be quite wrong, but this time so did a solid majority of Christian fundamentalists. When you asked them why, they said that obviously this would be unfair to people who help pay for public schools but who want their children raised in some other religion. If you ask them if the majority in an Arab country has a right to have its religion taught in public schools, they say no, that the minority has rights too that must be respected. Nobody&#8217;s kids should have another religion forced upon them in the classroom, they say.\n \n So do fundamentalists believe in majority rights or minority rights? The answer is, apparently, neither. They&#8217;ll pull whichever argument suits them out of its file when necessary, but basically they are unprincipled on the issue of school prayer. They have a big double standard that basically says, &#8220;Whatever I want is right.&#8221; The rest is rationalization, and as flexible and multi-directional as a reed blowing in the wind.\n \n My two contrasting scenarios slide fundamentalists under the microscope, but they do not put others to similar scrutiny, do they? What about those on the opposite extreme of the religious belief continuum, atheists? They always oppose school prayer, but wouldn&#8217;t they like to have atheism taught if they could? I thus have asked atheists to respond to the following proposal:\n \n Suppose a law were passed requiring strenuous teaching in public schools against belief in God and religion. Beginning in kindergarten, all children would be taught that belief in God is unsupported by logic and science, and that traditional religions are based on unreliable scriptures and outdated principles. All children would eventually be encouraged to become atheists or agnostics. How would you react to such a law?\n \n This would seem to be &#8220;right down the atheists&#8217; alley,&#8221; and you frequently hear fundamentalists say this is precisely what nonbelievers are ultimately trying to accomplish in their court challenges to school prayer. But 100% of a sample of Manitoba parents who were atheists said this would be a bad law; so did 70% of a sample of the active American atheists whose organizations often launch those court challenges. Atheists typically hold that religious beliefs/practice have no place in public schools, and that includes their own point of view. No double standard there.\n \n (It would be interesting to know how fundamentalists react to the news that, when put to the test, atheists showed more integrity than fundamentalists did on this matter. They often say morality cannot exist without belief in God, but the atheists seem much more principled than the fundamentalists do on this issue.\n \n B. Opposition to Evolution. If fundamentalists have added one thing to the authoritarian follower&#8217;s armor of compartmentalized thinking, double standards, rationalization, and so on, it is a preference for selective ignorance. You can see this most clearly in their rejection of evolution.\n \n Instead of learning about one of the major scientific advances of all time, with all its explanatory power and steady flow of amazing discoveries, fundamentalists embrace &#8220;creation science&#8221;or &#8220;intelligent design.&#8221; As many a court has ruled, these are &#8220;science&#8221; in name only since they lack a clear statement of propositions, make no predictions, cannot be tested, and are usually just a back-door attempt to teach the Bible as part of the public school curriculum. Still fundamentalists work tirelessly to give creation science or intelligent design &#8220;equal time&#8221; with evolution in public schools--which would mean cutting in half the time devoted to real science instruction--hoping to accomplish by zeal, clamor and pressure what is unjustified by scientific accomplishment. \n \n How does this connect to &#8220;selective ignorance&#8221;? If you ask fundamentalists about evolution, it becomes clear that they seldom understand what they are opposing. Instead they seem to be repeating things they have heard from the leaders of their ingroups, such as &#8220;Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution says that humans descended from monkeys,&#8221; and &#8220;There is a crucial &#8216;missing link&#8217; in the fossil evidence that shows humans could not have descended from apes,&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s just a theory.&#8221;\n \n They will sometimes tell you evolution violates the laws of thermodynamics, but when you ask them what those laws are, the conditions under which the featured Second Law applies, and what it has to do with evolution, they stumble all over themselves.\n \n As well, they will say most scientists today have rejected Darwin&#8217;s theory, when evolution is probably the most widely accepted explanation of things in the biological, geological, and astronomical sciences. (Debates certainly arise in science about how evolution takes place but not, anymore, whether it occurs.) They will tell you &#8220;many famous scientists&#8221; don&#8217;t believe in evolution at all, but they seldom know any names. They will give you the famous &#8220;A watch, therefore a watchmaker&#8221; argument-from-design that introductory philosophy students tear to shreds year after year. But when you point out the logical fallacy in this argument it becomes clear they never thought about it, they just stored the argument. They will tell you, mistakenly again, that evolution has never been observed happening. They know well the arguments against evolution that they have heard from their trusted sources, but they \n know almost nothing about the theory of evolution itself or the overwhelming amount of evidence from all the relevant fields that support it.\n \n As a consequence I have had fundamentalist university students in my classes who had apparently managed to avoid all instruction in genetics in their lives, and who did not know what a gene, or a mutation was. Others, almost as extreme, have heard the human genetic code &#8220;can never be broken&#8221; and so doubt the value of learning anything about it. Or else that research should be forbidden on DNA because it is the &#8220;secret of life&#8221; that humanity was not meant to have. Or else everything that science has discovered fits in perfectly with the story of the Great Flood, which is part of the explanation most fundamentalists want everybody to have to learn in school instead of biological science. Adam walked with dinosaurs, they insist. \n \n One can believe in a divinity and also believe that life appeared and developed on earth through evolution. It may look like an accident, you can say, but it&#8217;s really God&#8217;s plan. Many theists take that position, and eventually religious fundamentalists may come around to it. After all, the Catholic Church eventually came to accept the &#8220;theory&#8221; that the earth goes around the sun. \n \n But that might take centuries and in the meantime, as the rest of the world makes ever-increasing advances in knowledge, the anti-evolutionists will be busting a gut to make sure all of America&#8217;s children remain as ignorant as theirs. And one can seriously question whether evolution would get even 10% of the relevant instruction time in public schools that fundamentalists control. Remember how much authoritarians love to censor ideas? \n \n C. The Bible Is Always Right, Unless... As we saw in chapter 3, you frequently find dogmatism in religion. Still, I have been amazed at how rigid religious fundamentalists can be--even to the point of dismissing what they say is the cornerstone of their lives, the Bible. I have twice given students who insisted the Bible was both a) divinely inspired and b) free of errors, contradictions and inconsistencies, the four Gospel accounts of Easter morning, laid out side by side. You never see them that way. Most people just hear one account, in church on Easter.\n \n Those who set out to read the New Testament go through the Gospels in the order Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and may well have forgotten what Matthew said when they get to Mark&#8217;s starkly different version. Thus I suspect none of my &#8220;true believers&#8221; had ever seen the narratives printed alongside one another before. I asked them to read the (literally) Gospel accounts of this, the central, defining event in their religion. Then they read the following summary I had prepared:\n \n &#8220;There appear to be many direct contradictions in these four descriptions of the tomb scene. Who actually encountered the risen Jesus in the garden? John says it was just Mary Magdalen. Matthew says it was Mary Magdalen and &#8220;the other Mary,&#8221; and according to Mark and Luke, neither Mary Magdalen nor any other person actually saw Jesus in the garden. Did Mary Magdalen recognize Jesus when she encountered him? John says no, but Matthew says yes. Did the women tell anyone what happened in the garden? Mark explicitly says they did not; Luke and John explicitly say they told the apostles. Was it light when Mary Magdalen came to the tomb (as Mark, Matthew and Luke say), or dark (as John says)? How many &#8221;men in white&#8221;/angels were there: one (Mark and Matthew) or two (Luke and John)? \n \n Did Jesus let people hold onto him? Matthew says yes, John says no. &#8220;As well there are numerous inconsistencies. Who actually went to the tomb? (All four accounts disagree.) Which apostles went to the garden? According to Luke, only Peter went; but John says Peter and the &#8220;beloved disciple&#8221; both went; and Mark and Matthew make no mention of Peter (or any other apostle) going to the garden. Was there a great earthquake, as Matthew says? How could Mark, Luke and John all ignore &#8220;a great earthquake&#8221;? Were there Roman guards? Matthew says yes, but the others do not mention them at all.&#8221; \n \n I then offered each subject space to explain her position on the Bible under various headings. The first possibility was &#8220;There are, in fact, no contradictions or inconsistencies in the four accounts.&#8221; Other possibilities attributed the contradictions and inconsistencies to human error in translation, etcetera, or to some of the evangelists getting details wrong, or to the whole thing being a myth. \n \n Most of the fundamentalists stuck by their guns and insisted no contradictions or inconsistencies existed in the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection, no matter what one might point out. I call that dogmatism. Furthermore a curious analogy kept popping up in their defense of this seemingly indefensible stand. Many of them said the evangelists were like witnesses to an automobile accident, each of whom saw the event from a different place, and therefore gave a slightly different account of what had happened. I&#8217;m ready to bet they picked up this &#8220;analysis-by-analogy&#8221; in Sunday school, or some such place. Like the arguments against evolution, you can tell they just swallowed this &#8220;explanation&#8221; without thinking because it is, in fact, an admission that contradictions and inconsistencies do exist. The &#8220;different angles&#8221;story just explains how the contradictions got there. \n \n Ultimately the true believers were saying, &#8220;I believe so strongly that the Bible is perfect that there&#8217;s nothing, not even the Bible itself, that can change my mind.&#8221; If that seems like an enormous self-contradiction, put it on the list. We are dealing with very compartmentalized minds. They&#8217;re not really interested in coming to grips with what&#8217;s actually in the Bible so much as mounting a defense of what they want to believe about the Bible--come Hell or Noah&#8217;s high water. \n \n We shouldn&#8217;t underestimate the importance of dogmatism to the fundamentalist, even though it sometimes seems to surpass understanding. As noted in the last chapter, it takes no effort to be dogmatic, and you don&#8217;t need to know very much to insist you&#8217;re right and nothing can possibly change your mind. As well, dogmatism gives the joy and comfort of certainty, which fundamentalists cherish. \n \n Faith and Science. You will sometimes hear fundamentalists dismiss science because of its apparent uncertainty. They observe that today&#8217;s scientific explanation of something will sooner or later be replaced by a different one, so why invest anything in it? Their religion already has the Final Word, they say, the perfect explanation of everything.\n \n This view is three players short of a trio. First, it does not grasp that future theories in science will be accepted because they make superior explanations and predictions--which is progress you could not make if you insisted the old theory was perfect. As well, science energetically corrects itself. If a finding is misleading, say due to methodological error, other scientists will discover that and set things straight.\n \n Every year a new batch of scientists graduates, and many of them take dead aim--as they were trained to do--on the scientific Establishment. In religion you might get branded a heretic, or worse, for challenging dogma. In science you&#8217;ll get promoted and gather research grants as ye may if you knock an established explanation off its perch. Orthodoxy has a big bulls-eye painted on it in science. A scientist who can come up with a better account of things than evolution will become immortal.\n \n Dogmatic Christians also slide quietly around the fact that there&#8217;s no real test that what they believe is right. They simply believe it, on faith. They are the faith-full, just as dogmatic Hindus, dogmatic Jews, and dogmatic Muslims all insist they each have the real deal. Unfortunately there&#8217;s no way to determine if any of them does, which may be one of the reasons the passionately devoted sometimes resort to the sword and the car bomb instead.\n \n Once dogmatism turns out the lights, you might as well close up shop as a civilization and pull up the covers as a sentient life form. You get nowhere with unquestioning certainty. It&#8217;s thinking with your mind wide shut. But that would not faze most fundamentalists, because they know that their beliefs will get them exactly where they want to go.\n\n To be continued...(whew)...",

   "Continued from above:\n5. Happiness, Joy and Comfort\n \n Fundamentalists get their joy in life much more from standing firm and believing what they stand for than from exploring and discovering. I once asked a large sample of parents how much happiness, joy or comfort they got, in various ways, from science, and how much they got from religion. For most people, religion proved a lot more satisfying than science did. (This ought not knock us off our horses. Pure science is &#8220;head stuff,&#8221; not intended to satisfy any human want except our desire to understand.)\n \n But the religion-versus-science comparison proved especially striking among fundamentalists. They said religion brought them enormous amounts of happiness. It brought them the joy of God&#8217;s love. It showed how they could spend all eternity in heaven. It assured them they would rejoin their loved ones in the kingdom of God. It brought them closer to their loved ones on earth. It brought forgiveness of their sins.\n \n It made them feel safe in God&#8217;s protection. In contrast, they got almost no happiness from science. Notably, they said science did not enable them to work out their own beliefs and philosophy of life, it did not bring the joy of discovery, it did not provide the surest path we have to the truth, it did not make them feel safe, it did not show how to live a happy life, and it did not bring the satisfaction of knowing their beliefs were based on objective facts.\n \n We should note that fundamentalists indeed get great joy from their religion. While most people tell pollsters they are happy, highly religious people number among the happiest of us all. You can see why they would. They believe they know the meaning of life on its deepest level. They believe they are in personal touch with the all-good creator of the universe, who loves them and takes a special interest in them. They say they are certain they will enjoy an eternity of happiness after they die.\n \n In the meanwhile they have answers at their fingertips to all the problems of life that depress others, such as sickness and personal failure. And they are embraced on all sides by a supportive community. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be very happy? The real question ought to be: why do so many people, including some of the fundamentalists&#8217; own children, turn their backs on all this happiness?\n \n It&#8217;s that old Devil, isn&#8217;t it? We shall take this up shortly.\n \n Zealotry. ... [Fundamentalists] say their religion provides them with their basic outlook in life. They are especially likely to say their religion colors and shapes almost everything they experience in life, that it is the solution to all of humanity&#8217;s problems, that it is very important to them to support the leaders of their religion, that they are learning everything they can about their religion, that nothing else is as important in their life, and no other outlook could be as true and valid.\n \n No other group comes close to being as zealous. Feminists usually come in second in my studies, but way behind the religious fundamentalists, and one finds far, far fewer of them. And if you took all the zealous capitalists and socialists in my last study of over 600 parents and put them in a room to slug it out, not a punch would be thrown. You want to know who&#8217;s on fire, you want to know who&#8217;s making a commitment, you want to know who are putting their money, their time and their energy where their beliefs are, you want to know who are constantly &#8220;on call&#8221; for the cause--and in large numbers--it&#8217;s the fundamentalists.\n \n Zealotry and conversion. Fundamentalists, you may have heard, proselytize. Whether they go door to door, or just gently approach co-workers and neighbors, or pleasantly invite classmates to their youth group, fundamentalists usually believe they have an obligation to try to convert others. &#8220;Suppose a teenager came to you for advice about religion,&#8221; I have asked in several studies. &#8220;He had been raised in a nonreligious family as an atheist, but now this person is thinking about becoming much more religious, and wants your advice on what to do.&#8221; Even though fundamentalists often speak of parents&#8217; sacred right to raise their children as they see fit, the vast majority of the fundamentalists said they&#8217;d tell the teen his parents were wrong. And virtually all said they would try to persuade the teen to join their religion.\n \n One can wonder what fundamentalists would say if one of their children went to an atheist for advice on religion, and the atheist said the parents were wrong and tried to lead their child into atheism. But would such nonbelievers? I have given several groups of atheists the mirror-image scenario in which a teenager who had been raised as a strong and active Christian comes to them for advice because he is now questioning things. Very few Manitoba parent atheists said they would tell this teen that his parents were wrong, nor would they try to get him to become an atheist.\n \n Instead they almost all said they&#8217;d tell him to continue searching and then decide for himself. A sample of active American atheists was pushier. About two-thirds would have thumped the drum for atheism, loudly or softly, and about half said they would want the teen to become a nonbeliever. But far, far more of the fundamentalists, we saw, would have tried to convert an atheist&#8217;s child.\n \n I probed this apparent double standard with a large sample of Manitoba students. Half were told a troubled teenager who had been raised in a strong Christian family went to an atheist for advice. &#8220;Would it be wrong for the atheist to try to get the teen to abandon his family&#8217;s teachings?&#8221; A solid majority of both low and high RWA students (70 percent in each case) said yes, it would be wrong.\n \n The other half of the sample got the mirror image situation of a troubled teen raised an atheist who went to a Christian for advice. A solid majority (61%) of the low RWAs again said it would be wrong for the Christian to try to get the teen to abandon his family&#8217;s teachings. But only 22% of the high RWAs thought proselytizing would be wrong in this case. Instead, the great majority of them thought it would be right for a Christian to try to convert the youth. That&#8217;s a double standard big enough to drive a busload of missionaries through.\n \n Parents of university students have, we can safely surmise, raised some children, so we can inquire how much freedom of choice their kids had regarding religion. A solid majority of my samples said they wanted their children to make up their own minds about religion. But not the fundamentalist parents, who said they had made a strong effort to pass their beliefs on to their offspring--a response their children confirmed when describing how much emphasis was placed on the family religion while they were growing up. Fundamentalist parents said they did not want their children to decide about religion. Instead they wanted their progeny to believe what they believed, to keep the faith, and pass it on to the grandchildren.\n \n 6. Keeping the Faith, Not\n \n Does the religious emphasis pay off? Yes, in the sense that if parents pay no attention to religion, the children are likely to become non-practicing Catholics, Presbyterians-in-name-only, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m a Prodestent&#8221; Christians--or even unaffiliated &#8220;Nones.&#8221; But placing great emphasis on the family religion does not always produce the desired result, and may even backfire.\n \n I have inquired about the current religious affiliations of parents of students at my university for many years. I now have answers from over 6,000 moms and dads.\n \n These parents were 48 years old on the average when they served in my studies, and since I also ask what religion they were raised in, we can see if they turned out the way their parents (the grandparents) intended.\n \n Generally they did; about two-thirds of those raised in a Christian denomination still followed the path trod by their ancestors (e.g., raised a Lutheran, still a Lutheran)--although they were not necessarily active members. (Instead they were the &#8220;Stay Away Saints,&#8221; as some evangelical leaders call them.) But that means about a third of them had disconnected themselves from their home religion. Some had converted to another, but most of them had become Nones, (e.g., raised a Lutheran, now not anything), which was the category that grew the most--almost 300%!--in my studies from where it had started.\n \n The only other group besides the Nones that ended up in the black, with more members than it started out with, were the Protestant fundamentalists (Baptists, Pentecostals, etcetera), and they only gained 18%. Furthermore, they did it through conversions, because almost half of the parents who had been raised in these denominations had left them by the time they reached middle age. (It was one of the poorer &#8220;retention&#8221; records among the various religions.)\n \n The &#8220;departed&#8221; departed in all directions, but mostly they went to more liberal denominations, or (especially) they too ended up Nones. The fundamentalists who remained had to proselytize to avoid the fate of all the other denominations: i.e., an appreciable net loss. If they had not won lots of converts, they too would have shrunk, because they had a lot of trouble holding onto their own sons and daughters. Given all that childhood emphasis on the family religion, and given all the enriching rise-and-shine happiness that comes from being a fundamentalist, how come so many people raised in that environment walk away? Some may walk because active membership in those churches requires a lot of commitment. Protestant fundamentalists go to church way more often than anyone else in Canadian Christendom, they read the Bible more, they tithe more, and so on. Also, being a fundamentalist can require giving up various pleasures and life-styles that others enjoy as a matter of course. So some people may leave these demanding religions precisely because of the demands.\n \n But when Bruce Hunsberger and I interviewed university students who had very religious up-bringings but then left the family religion, and asked them why they did so, they almost never mentioned these things. Instead they mainly said they left because they just couldn&#8217;t make themselves believe their church&#8217;s teachings any more.\n \n Believing the Word. Christian fundamentalism has three great enemies in the struggle to retain its children, judging by the stories its apostates tell: weaknesses in its own teachings, science, and hypocrisy. As for the first, many a fallen-away fundamentalist told us that the Bible simply proved unbelievable on its own merits.\n \n It was inconceivable to them that, if an almighty creator of the universe had wanted to give humanity a set of teachings for guidance across the millennia, it would be the material found in the Bible. The Bible was, they said, too often inconsistent, petty, boring, appalling, self-serving, or unbelievable.\n \n Secondly, science made too much sense and had pushed traditional beliefs into a tight corner. When their church insisted that its version of creation, the story of Adam and Eve, the sundry miracles and so on had to be taken on faith, the fledgling apostates eventually found that preposterous. Faith for them was not a virtue, although they could see why their religion taught people it was. It meant surrendering rationality. From its earliest days fundamentalism has drawn a line in the sand over scripture versus science, and some of its young people eventually felt they had to step over the line, and then they kept right on going.\n \n Still the decision to leave was almost always wrenching, because it could mean becoming an outcast from one&#8217;s family and community. Also, fundamentalists are frequently taught that no one is lower, and will burn more terribly in hell, than a person who abandons their true religion. What then gnawed away so mercilessly at the apostates that they could no longer overpower doubt with faith?\n \n Their families will say it was Satan. But we thought, after interviewing dozens of &#8220;amazing apostates,&#8221; that (most ironically) their religious training had made them leave. Their church had told them it was God&#8217;s true religion. That&#8217;s what made it so right, so much better than all the others. It had the truth, it spoke the truth, it was The Truth. But that emphasis can create in some people a tremendous valuing of truth per se, especially among highly intelligent youth who have been rewarded all their lives for getting &#8220;the right answer.&#8221; So if the religion itself begins making less and less sense, it fails by the very criterion that it set up to show its superiority.\n \n Similarly, pretending to believe the unbelievable violated the integrity that had brought praise to the amazing apostates as children. Their consciences, thoroughly developed by their upbringing, made it hard for them to bear false witness. So again they were essentially trapped by their religious training. It had worked too well for them to stay in the home religion, given the problems they saw with it.\n To be continued...",

   "The end (finally!!):\n7. Shortfalls in Fundamentalists&#8217; Behavior: Hypocrisy\n \n Ronald J. Sider, a theologian at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary, recently followed up Mark Noll&#8217;s The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind with The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience. He observed that, despite Jesus&#8217; unequivocal stand on the permanence of marriage, evangelical Christians divorce as often as others do. And despite Jesus&#8217; great concern for the poor, the political agenda of prominent evangelical political movements rarely includes justice for the impoverished. The number of unmarried couples living together jumped more in the Bible Belt during the 1990s, Sider pointed out, than in the nation as a whole. \n \n Of the evangelical youth who took a &#8220;True Love Waits&#8221; pledge to abstain from intercourse until marriage, 88% broke it, he reported. Evangelicals proved more likely to object to having African-American neighbors than any other religious group. He reminded his readers that many evangelical leaders either opposed the civil rights movement or else said nothing. And &#8220;saved&#8221; men were reported just as likely to use pornography, and to physically abuse their wives, as &#8220;unsaved&#8221; men.\n \n You will note that while Sider sometimes upbraids his fellow evangelicals for being worse than others, he mainly points out that they are not better than average, when he thinks they should be. We have seen that fundamentalists do indeed think they are morally superior. But hypocrisy comes easy to compartmentalized minds.\n \n For example, Matthew&#8217;s Gospel (7:1) has Jesus saying, &#8220;Judge not, that ye be not judged,&#8221; and you will often hear fundamentalists say, &#8220;Hate sin, but love the sinner.&#8221; When I asked a sample of parents if they believed one should do this, virtually all of the fundamentalists said yes. And yet these same parents only two pages later in the survey were advocating rejection of homosexuals and discrimination against them. Some even agreed with the statement, &#8220;In many ways the AIDS disease currently killing homosexuals is just what they deserve.&#8221; Gentle pieties get shoved back into their files all too easily in fundamentalist minds when a chance to unload on some despised group pops up.\n \n The hypocrisy does not escape the notice of others. I once asked parents who had stressed the family religion less to their children than it had been stressed to them as they were growing up why they did not &#8220;pass it on.&#8221; Some said they found church too boring to want to keep going. Others said the church seem preoccupied with money. And of course some said the teachings did not make sense, etcetera. But the reason checked off most often was, &#8220;As I grew up, I saw a lot of hypocrisy in the people in my religion.&#8221; \n \n The most common examples involved a) &#8220;the holy people&#8221; looking down on others in the community, b) the people who acted like Christians only on Sunday, and c) the intolerance and prejudice found among members of the congregation, including the clergy. These things had usually been spotted many years ago, when the parent was but a teenager, but obviously the spotting had a lasting effect because these parents were now nearing 50. The &#8220;whited sepulchers&#8221; they found in church drove them away from the family religion, which consequently lost nearly all of the next generation reared by these parents as well.\n \n You can find other examples of such a backlash. Attitudes toward homosexuals have become markedly more tolerant and accepting in North America in a very short period of time. When I asked students what had affected their attitudes toward gays and lesbians, personally knowing a homosexual proved the most positive influence (as I reported in chapter 2) and the scientific evidence indicating sexual orientation may have biological determinants (as mentioned in chapter 3) finished second. But in third place came, &#8220;I have been turned off by anti-homosexual people.&#8221; Virulent opposition to homosexual causes may, in the long run, backfire and hurt the opposers and benefit their intended targets, especially when the attackers claim they are acting on moral grounds and actually &#8220;love the sinner&#8221; they are smiting.\n \n Cheap Grace. Unfortunately, fundamentalist Protestantism may directly promote hypocrisy among its members through one of its major theological principles: that if one accepts Jesus as a personal savior and asks for the forgiveness of one&#8217;s sins, one will be saved. But a lot depends on what &#8220;accepts&#8221; means. Is one&#8217;s life transformed? Do good works increase? Is the born-again person more like Jesus, holier? That would be all to the good. But because of some evangelist preachers, the interpretation has grown that all &#8220;accepts&#8221; means is a one-time verbal commitment. You say the magic words and you go to heaven, no matter what kind of life you lead afterwards. Many have thought that a pretty sweet deal. You&#8217;ve conned a free pass through the Pearly Gates from the Almighty and you can sin and debauch all you want for the rest of your life. \n \n Dietrich Bonhoeffer coined the phrase &#8220;cheap grace&#8221; to denigrate this interpretation of the New Testament, and other writers have lamented the cheap grace that seems to ooze from some evangelists who seem to keep a sharp eye on the donations that follow. Sider (p. 57) summarizes the analysis of another professor of theology, John G. Stackhouse Jr., as follows: &#8220;Many evangelicals lie, cheat, and otherwise sin against others in an &#8216;already-forgiven bliss&#8217; with an attitude of &#8216;I&#8217;m-cool-cause-Jesus-loves-me-and-so-I-don&#8217;t-owe-you-a-thing.&#8217;&#8221;\n \n Do only good little girls and boys go to heaven? Or does goodness, as the film star Mae West said many years ago, have nothing to do with it? I asked a large sample of parents to respond to the following proposition: &#8220;If we have faith in Jesus, accepting him as our personal savior and asking forgiveness of our sins, we will be saved, no matter what kind of life we live afterwards.&#8221; Forty-two percent of the Christian high fundamentalists agreed with that statement. If that indicates the attitude of fundamentalists in general, a huge number of people are swilling in cheap grace.\n \n They fully expect that when the saints go marching in, they&#8217;re gonna be in that number because they once uttered a magic spell. The lives they&#8217;ve lived since are irrelevant, they believe.\n \n Life Without Guilt. That helps explain the hypocrisy many people find among &#8220;the saved.&#8221; But it doesn&#8217;t really account for the self-righteousness. After all, you still know you&#8217;ve sinned--even if you have a &#8220;Get Out of Hell Free&#8221;card tucked up your sleeve. So why do fundamentalists think they sin so much less than everyone else?\n \n The answer may involve how they have learned to handle guilt, thanks again to their religious instruction. \n \n What do you do when you have done something morally wrong? What are you most likely to do to get over the guilt, to feel forgiven, to be at peace with yourself?\n \n Here are some possibilities:[*]I ask God for forgiveness, by prayer, going to Confession, or some other religious act. [*]I go out and do something nice for someone else, a &#8220;third party&#8221; not involved in what I did. [*]I rationalize the bad act. I tell myself it was not so bad, that I had no choice, etc. [*]I talk to someone close, such as a good friend or relative, about what I did. [*]I get very busy with some chore, assignment, or job to take my mind off what I did. [*]I discuss what I did with those who may have suffered, and make it up to them. [*]Nothing; I just forget it.\n Most Christian fundamentalists who have answered these questions in my studies said they ask God for forgiveness. And you know what, that makes them feel remarkably cleansed. Their average response on the &#8220;How completely forgiven?&#8221; question was nearly a 5. Again, it&#8217;s just a verbal thing. No admission of wrong-doing to injured parties is required, no restitution, and no change in behavior.\n \n But it works really well: Instant Guilt-Be-Gone; just add a little prayer. And why wouldn&#8217;t you sin again, since it&#8217;s so easy to erase the transgression with your Easyoff, Easy-on religious practice?\n \n Fundamentalists therefore might feel little after-effect of their wrong-doings twitching away in their psyches. They have been to the River Jordan and had all their sins washed away, often on a weekly basis just like doing the laundry. But this very likely contributes to self-righteousness, and let&#8217;s remember that self-righteousness appears to be the major releaser of authoritarian aggression. So it could come down to this: &#8220;Hello Satan!&#8221; Yum, sin! &#8220;Get thee behind me, Satan!&#8221; Whack-whackwhack!\n \n The non-fundamentalists in my samples did not have it so good. Their major ways of handling guilt were to discuss the immoral act with those who may have suffered and make it up to them (which they were twice as likely to do as fundamentalist were), or to talk with a friend about what they had done. \n \n Whatever they tried, it did not remove most of the guilt; their responses to the &#8220;How completely forgiven?&#8221; question averaged less than 3. But the residual guilt may help them avoid doing the same thing again, and when someone asks them how moral they are compared to other people, the unresolved, festering guilt may remind them that they are not as moral as they&#8217;d like to be.\n \n A Few Surprising Findings about Fundamentalists. Since fundamentalists insist the Bible is the revealed word of God and without error, you would think they&#8217;d have read it. But you&#8217;d often be wrong. I gave a listing of the sixty-six books in the King James Bible to a large sample of parents and asked them, &#8220;How many of these have you read, from beginning to end? (Example, if you have read parts of the Book of Genesis, but not all of it, that does not count.)&#8221; Nineteen percent of the Christian High fundamentalists said they had never read any of the books from beginning to end, which was neatly counterbalanced by twenty percent (but only twenty percent) who said they had read all sixty-six. (I tip my hat to anyone who put her head down and plowed through the first nine chapters of Chronicles I. Look it up.)\n \n On the average, the high fundamentalists said they had read about twenty of the books in the Bible--about a third of what&#8217;s there. So they may insist that the Bible is totally accurate in all that it teaches, but most of them have never read a lot of what they&#8217;re so sure of. They are likely, again, merely repeating something they were told while growing up, or accepted when they &#8220;got religion.&#8221; Most of them literally don&#8217;t know all that they&#8217;re talking about. (But they are Biblical scholars compared to others: Most of the non-fundamentalist parents had not read even one chapter.)...\n \n The Most Amazing Discovery of All (to me, anyway). Isn&#8217;t there something profoundly strange about the fact that so many fundamentalists have apparently skipped over so much of the Bible? Wouldn&#8217;t you read the Bible, cover to cover, over and over, until the end of your days, if you really thought this was the revealed word of God? Let&#8217;s remember who that is: GOD, damn it all, the almighty, eternal, omnipresent--not to mention all-knowing--creator of the universe. What else could you read that would be as important as God&#8217;s message, if you believed that&#8217;s what the Bible is? What could be one-zillionth as important? What on earth is going on? Don&#8217;t the fundamentalists themselves believe what they preach to everyone else...?\n \n \n Summary: So What Does All This Amount To?\n \n This chapter has presented my main research findings on religious fundamentalists. The first thing I want to emphasize, in light of the rest of this book, is that they are highly likely to be authoritarian followers. They are highly submissive to established authority, aggressive in the name of that authority, and conventional to the point of insisting everyone should behave as their authorities decide. They are fearful and self-righteous and have a lot of hostility in them that they readily direct toward various out-groups. They are easily incited, easily led, rather un-inclined to think for themselves, largely impervious to facts and reason, and rely instead on social support to maintain their beliefs. They bring strong loyalty to their in-groups, have thick-walled, highly compartmentalized minds, use a lot of double standards in their judgments, are surprisingly unprincipled at times, and are often hypocrites.\n \n But they are also Teflon-coated when it comes to guilt. They are blind to themselves, ethnocentric and prejudiced, and as closed-minded as they are narrowminded. They can be woefully uninformed about things they oppose, but they prefer ignorance and want to make others become as ignorant as they. They are also surprisingly uninformed about the things they say they believe in, and deep, deep, deep down inside many of them have secret doubts about their core belief. But they are very happy, highly giving, and quite zealous. In fact, they are about the only zealous people around nowadays in North America, which explains a lot of their success in their endless (and necessary) pursuit of converts.\n \n I want to emphasize also that all of the above is based on studies in which, if the opposite were true instead, that would have been shown. This is not just &#8220;somebody&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; It&#8217;s what the fundamentalists themselves said and did. And it adds up to a truly depressing bottom line. Read the two paragraphs above again and consider how much of it would also apply to the people who filled the stadium at the Nuremberg Rallies. I know this comparison will strike some as outrageous, and I&#8217;m NOT saying religion turns people into Nazis. But does anybody believe the ardent Nazi followers in Germany, or Mussolini&#8217;s faithful in Italy, or Franco&#8217;s legions in Spain were a bunch of atheists? Being &#8220;religious&#8221; does not automatically build a firewall against accepting totalitarianism, and when fundamentalist religions teach authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism, they help create the problem. Can we not see how easily religious fundamentalists would lift a would-be dictator aloft as part of a &#8220;great movement,&#8221; and give it their all?\n",

   "Yeah, that one was a lot easier to score.\n \n What I find fascinating, esp. in light of Altemeyer's findings (and I think the guy bends over backwards to be fair to fundies... more so than I would, anyway), is that:\n \n 1) No obvious or admitted fundamentalist poster here had the courage/pride in his beliefs/whatever to chime in on either survey, even after the rationale was explained at length\n \n 2) No obvious or admitted, etc. has questioned or attempted to disprove any of Altemeyer's findings or conclusions.\n \n 3) They did all this en masse and apparently coincidentally, which raises even more inriguing questions, especially in light of Altemeyer's conclusions about the fundamentalist/authoritarian mindset... namely: Are they all roommates? Did they privately confer, decide this was some sort of insidious, atheistic trap and weren't having any? Were they just too embarrassed by or ashamed of their previous postings, or simply unable to come up with a response to the points made in the excerpts.\n \n Well, they're not going away, guys. Cuz now that Pandora's Box has been opened on this one, I for one am going to hold your feet to the fire again and again.\n \n You don't think you're a fundie? Fine. Tell us why not.\n You don't think you're an authoritarian follower? Fine. Same thing.\n \n You agree that you are? Great. Tell us why you think that's a good thing to be.\n \n But the two correlate, and Altemeyer's book aside, there are SCORES of studies--scientific, peer-reviewed studies--correlating the two that I intend to link to. Just so's you know. \n \n Feel free to disprove them. If you can. But you'll have your work cut out for you.\n \n And on the basis of what you've come up with so far--i.e. nothing--I don't think you're up to it.",
