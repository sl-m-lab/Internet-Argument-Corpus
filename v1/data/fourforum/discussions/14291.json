   "The problem is that Palin and others are opposed to sex education and want abstinence only education.\n\n \n I think you need to get your facts straight before weighing in on them. Apparently you've been letting wingnuts who lie about candidates do your thinking for you when it comes to U.S. politics.\n Actually, Alaska schools don&#8217;t teach abstinence only, notes the Anchorage Daily News.\n The state requires that abstinence be &#8220;stressed,&#8221; but not to the exclusion of comprehensive sex education, reports the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n Wasilla High, where Bristol Palin is a student, teaches [a] soup-to-nuts course, reports Rory of Parentalcation, who lives nearby. &#8220;I called up my buddy who has a teenage daughter in school there, and asked him the question. He said they teach the same thing every school does. Don&#8217;t do it, but if you do, use birth control &#8230; risks &#8230; blah, blah, blah.&#8221;\n Furthermore, Gov. Palin appears to support that policy, reports the Los Angeles Times, though her position has either been nuanced or muddled, depending on your political sympathies.\n Running for governor of Alaska in 2006, Sarah Palin filled out a questionnaire that asked if she&#8217;d support funding for abstinence-until-marriage programs instead of &#8220;explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics and the distribution of contraceptives in schools?&#8221;\n Palin wrote, &#8220;Yes, the explicit sex-ed programs will not find my support.&#8221;\n The next month, Palin clarified &#8220;explicit,&#8221; on a radio debate. Asked if &#8220;explicit&#8221; programs include those that discuss condoms. Palin said no and called discussions of condoms &#8220;relatively benign.&#8221;\n &#8220;Explicit means explicit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m pro-contraception, and I think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues. So I am not anti-contraception. But, yeah, abstinence is another alternative that should be discussed with kids. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. That doesn&#8217;t scare me, so it&#8217;s something I would support also.&#8221; (Palin Smears Debunked: SMEAR - Sarah Palin demanded abstinence-only sex education programs in Alaska schools )\n \n Not only that, none of it justifies going after candidates' or officials' children, either way.",
