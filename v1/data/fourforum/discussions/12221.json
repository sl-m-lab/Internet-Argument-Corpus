   "Americans have made a stake at Yuschenko and they have been winners so far! The political fight between Ukrainian president and prime-minister turned Europe into the hostage of their wretched intrigues. Ukraine officials are continuing to show the utmost reluctance and incapacity for driving gas crisis provoked by USA! It's clear that Yuschenko has got order from usa state sec Rice! And of course this crisis has made great profits for Yuschenko and Timoshenko. \n I call this situation of Ukraine refusal to realize Russian gas transit to Europe as real mayhem! Moreover I think that if Europe fails to get own control over Ukraine gas transit system Americans will continue to run the show! Their attempts to dilatory Europe development have perfect result but Europeans like small sheep are awaiting inevitable death by an American sharp knife! We need to oppose Washington rather than Ukraine and Yuschenko! Only then we are going to get gas at last.",

   "I am Ukrainian and I on this forum I want to say something right into face of European and Americans. I hope they will read it. What you put as \"bringing democracy\" to my country is total XXXXXXXX! Confess, it is for favour of America and Europe that neo-fascists are in power in Ukraine! Is it not so? This is you who bring them up here because this gives you another means of influence on official Kiev! Just for an example the recent attack of Ukrainian nazists on German embassy in connection with the Nazi John Demjanjuk case. For another example, the decision of Lvov council to construct an entertainment complex at the place of Tsitadel memorial where fascist death camp Stalag-328 used to be. Now get an opportunity to pressure on Yushchenko with international sanctions and make him change his election campaign as agreed with you or give up the election campaign at all! You just make puppets of us! But you got to know that one day you will pay for that! Remember my words!",
