   "Following the arrest of the Baucus 13 (doctors, nurses and single payer advocates) at the Senate Finance Committee hearings chaired by Max Baucus, another single payer demonstration takes place in San Francisco.\n \n Mr. Baucus, you may recall, has shut out from the process the voice of the majority of Americans and medical professionals who want single payer, while having accepted close to 150,000 dollars in campaign donations from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries. Clearly, Mr. Baucus should step down from his position as having a severe conflict of interest.\n \n --------------\n \n On Friday in San Francisco, about 200 single-payer proponents held a rally in front of the Federal Building and headed in small groups to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's office to urge the speaker of the House, who was in China, to back single-payer legislation and give its supporters a seat at the table of the health reform debate. The public appeals were part of a series of demonstrations being held in more than 50 U.S. cities over the next few days to encourage lawmakers to enact a single-payer plan.\n \n Some advocates of a nationalized health plan are calling for activists to become even more militant.\n \n \"It's the only way - direct confrontation with the people who are blocking what the majority of the American people want,\" said Russell Mokhiber, the founder of the newly formed Single Payer Action.\n \n \"It's about getting in people's faces and being serious about the fact that 60 Americans are dying every day because of lack of health insurance,\" said Mokhiber, who was arrested at the May 5 hearing and arraigned earlier this week in Washington.\n \n (more at link)\n \n Health care activists lament single-payer snub\n \n -------------",
