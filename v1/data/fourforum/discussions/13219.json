   "from........ Mosheh Thezion's Exploratory Committee for U.S. Senate (R) | HEALTH CARE\n \n \n Health care : We all know the problem, and the issue of corporate for-profit interests in health care, and how they provide less care to make a profit.\n \n Proposed solutions for Health care : \n \n \n There are bascially as I see it two options, the first of which is to establish a mandate, where by all businesses must provide healthcare benefits without exception, and where the unemployed would be covered under a public option through the E.D.D. service plan I propose, found here...=< BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE : JOBS\n In this way, all would be covered, as well as provided work, and yet with this the Health insurance industry must accept various levels of government regulation, where by coverage cannot be denied, and also service cannot be denied, and that all decisions regarding the provision of care is to be decided by doctors and their patients, and in exchange certain price control limits should be imposed on the hospitals themselves whom attempt to charge as much as possible in the present for profit system, AND if both HMO's and hospitals expect to continue with a for profit model, then they must accept levels of regulation so as to reduce costs, and free up this system from its entrenched problems. (This regulation being provided by an amendment to the Constitution once it is restored as law!)\n \n The second option would be to support HR 676, and expand Medicare to provide universal health care to all, and do so, via amendment. Because while the free market should have freedom in almost all circumstances, the history shows that for profit interests are simply failing to provide the care our nations people need, and service should never be denied.. NEVER! (in both options) (Except for ASSISTED SUICIDE, and ABORTION, which does not promote and save life! And since abortion is so cheap, there is no justification for making tax payers pay for it, since that burden belongs to the father and the mother. However, tax payers could pay for the 'birth' of a child, which can be very expensive.)\n Such that, under any for profit HMO option, or E.D.D. public option, or Medicare option, the law should state clearly, that any and all care advised by a doctor, must be provided, and no limits or care determinations made by any corporate, or government agency or office be allowed whatsoever, regardless of age, illness, or risk of cost. AND IF THIS IS DONE, IT WILL END THE FEARS EXPRESSED BY MOST REPUBLICANS, and fix whats wrong with the Health care corporations.\n b) ALSO, in doing so, in any option, the freedom to choose which physician one sees should be maintained, AND YET, ALSO nothing should be able to prevent the provision of service to the poor, and as such, the number of hospitals and nurses must be increased so as to meet the existing demand of the populace, with real quality. (As mandated by regulation)\n \n \n c) The real issue and challenge is that most hospitals today, are operated as for profit businesses, with investors, and stock holders, and as such, all new hospitals constructed, should be non-profit organizations, and existing hospitals can be either bought out by the government, or, regulated to the point of establishing price controls on the service they provide, in this way, there is a limit to the charge they can make to the government for the service, yet they are as such directly encouraged to provide as much service as possible. And the service which is provided should be decided by the doctors, with no bureaucratic oversight, so as to provide the best care, with an emphasis on testing, testing, testing, as the key to prevention. As well as offering assistance systems to get the people to eat better, to exercise, and most importantly, TO LOSE WEIGHT!\n In this way a hospitals bottom line as a business increases by the provision of more and better care, specifically as testing, and that hospitals which can show records of success in healing and prevention via testing and offering services, should be given a reduced tax, as an incentive. YET ALSO, HOSPITAL STAYS, SHOULD NOT COST SO MUCH AS IT DOES TODAY!\n \n d) Some say we can not afford a Universal Health care option, and I say to them, that if you have health care now that you are paying not only for the care, but for the profit margin to the insurance corporations, and as such, the increases in taxes to Medicare, is likely to be less than what you are paying now, and as such, you would never be denied service, which occurs daily with for profit health care systems. (If this Universal option is adopted!)\n Also, if we revamp the Federal Reserve, to become a non-profit, owned by our government, that the debt payments saving of 100 billion Dollars a year, would more than pay for ALL health care, and then some. (NO NEED TO RAISE TAXES!!!!)\n See..: CURRENCY : THE MONEY SYSTEM\n \n e) And in the interest of being fair, If ever the Universal option is adopted, I would think it is acceptable for the Federal government to buy out all the HMO'S stock holders, and be done with the problem, without causing them to suffer too great a loss. (a SEMI- fair price for all their stock.)\n \n \n f) Also, by implemeting my proposals for expanding the E.D.D, Employment Development Department, the abundant workers of the HMO'S, will not be left without assistance and benefits, as their industry is taken apart. \n See...< BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE : JOBS\n \n \n This addresses the core fears of the Republicans, and assures that Obama's and the DNC's criminal proposal of cost analysis, is completely prevented, and has no effect on the care that is given, and all those decisions OF GIVING CARE are made by the patient and their doctor ONLY!!!!\n \n We spend right now, over 500 Billion Dollars a year on our military, so that they can defend our people, therefore there is no excuse for not spending 100 Billion a year to protect the lives and health of the American people which that military serves to protect.\n \n There is no excuse. And while we need not implement complete Universal Health care, we must enforce by regulation as law, that the Health insurance corporations, cannot deny service or care to anyone, regardless of age, or estmimated worth or potential length of life. And we can make that public option available as a security blanket for people who lose their jobs, via the E.D.D. as described. In this way, we fix the problem without taking away the private health care presently provided.\n \n People are what matters.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

   "Putting the burden on employers is a bad plan, taxing company profits to provide public healthcare is a better one, it means that high profit, highly automated companies don't get an unfair advantage over those who need a lot of people to do the work. Compulsory employer provided health insurance would practically double the cost of employment in low paid jobs, and undermine opportunities for part time working. You think the US has a problem with illegal migrants now? Wait till the cost of employing fruit pickers doubles. Tax the profits instead and you remove part of the incentive to employ illegal migrants.",
