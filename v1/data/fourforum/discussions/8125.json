Harvard should be forced to take these kids in as well since they didn't have good enough teachers.\n\n \n It seems that the purpose fo the exit exam is to try to give SOME meaning back to the idea of the california state high school diploma. Currently it essentially seems to be without value, isnce they are graduating a bunch of XXXXXX. Regardless of what excuses one might come up with for passing, what that diploma is supposed to convey is \"This individual has met certain minimum requirements regaridng knowledge\". Currently what it convesy is \"This individual has met certain requirements regaridng attendance\". Nobody is interested in their attendance record. They want to know what th minimum knowledge level they can expect is. \n \n To me, this kind of thing just boggles the mind. Besides being a seriously flawed argement from logical standpoint (i.e if ANY kids from that school passed the test then obviously adequate resources were provided), just the blatent stupidy inherent here is insane. It does not matter WHY the kid did not pass the test. What matters is that the kid LACKED THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO SO. They DO NOT posess the knowledge that the diploma is supposed to certify that they have acquired. Regardless of how you view this, what these kids are suing for is essentially a false certification of competency.",

Virginia has the SOL's (ironic name IMO) people seriously took them as a joke. I took a Chemistry one back when they were first testing them (you weren't required to pass at the time because they wanted to see how they went) and answered half the questions without studying at all for this exam and then making designs on the scan sheets for the second half....i passed the freakin thing. The point is, if you can't pass this then you aren't smart enough to have a diploma from anywhere but from a McDonalds drive-thru training class.\n \n Good thing California is upping their standards and noting whether a person is gay or not...I'm sure that will help things turn around in that great state.",

I guess my lack of concern comes out of the fact that most states (do any besides CA do this at all?) don't even have exit exams.\n\n \n My apologies for the cynicism, but the only current value of a high school student within and to the US public education system (private for some countries) at that level is attendance for local and national funding purposes. \n X dollars per-head is how it works everywhere in the US excepting areas designated as rural. The government is broke enough to sell public land to support rural public schooling.\n \n How many who don't pass a high school exit exam are going to be hindered by that fact in their contribution to society? Learning how to flip burgers has few failures. If a potential high school graduate is now educated to former middle school standards, I'd think current grade school standards might need some attention.\n \n Did anyone else read Doonebury's strip on graduation at a typical school of the first individual who majored in ignorance?",
