It's called utiitarianism - the greatest good for the greaest number.\n \n I am willing to live simply in order that others may simply live. I would gladly pay more in taxes if I knew it would eliminate the need for homeless shelters and food banks.\n\n And I myself, along with many other Americans, am not. I work hard for the money I make, as does my wife. Uncle Sam already has his hand so far into my pocket I'm beginning to think he was once trained as a proctologist. I have insurance because I earn it. I enjoy some luxeries in my life because I earned the money to pay for them. I fully support social programs for those that really need them, but lets look at the facts. Many who recieve welfare do not need it. Many people recieving government aid could actually go out and work for a living, but would rather suckle up to the government teet. If Hillary really was interested in providing for those who CANNOT provide for themselves, she would plan to gut welfare and apply it only to those people who really need it. Consider that I work in an urban area where the majority of the population is well below the poverty level. Nothing tugs at my heart more than the dissabled guy who can barely afford a loaf of bread, or the hardworking family who lost everything in the fire started by the crackhead next door who fell alseep on his couch with a lit cigarette. But nothing ###### me off more than the 350lb ghetto mama buying Cheetos and Ring Dings with food stamps while her 9 children run around the store. Along with recieving social assisstance needs to come some responsibility. Anyone who is already dirt poor and decides to crank out 9 children does not sound responsible to me. Anyone buying less than essential items with food stamps does not sound responsible to me either. You may laugh it off and say ohhh...that's just an extreme case...but it's not. It is everyday life here. I bet if we actually cleaned up our social programs a little, there would be no need to raise taxes on me and my middle class cohorts who work hard for our money. Why has the government refused to do so up until now? \n \n \nYou, on the other hand, seem to support the RAYgunesque, Gordon Geckoesque concept of, \"I've got mine, YOYO, sucker!\" \n\n It's more like look what I earned by my hard work. Now get your hands back...\n \n \nFreedom consists of, among other things, 1. the freedom to marry one's love interest regardless of gender, 2. the freedom of a woman to determine the future of her pregnancy, 3. the freedom to go to college and not come out burdened with a 6-figure debt.emoticon_cool\n\n \n 1. Go for it, I could care less. Gay's should have the right to be as miserable as straights. \n \n 2. Yeah, she also in most cases has the freedom to not get pregnant in the first place. Little oooppsies will happen from time to time, but for the most part...again I hate to bring this up...but a little personal responsibility goes a long way. I have no problem with abortion, my problem lies with people who view it as first line birth control and then want me to pay more taxes to support people right to use it in such manner. Like the food stamps, some abortions are really needed, but many are due to people not taking responsibility for themselves and then asking others to pay the price for it.\n \n 3. I myself, through my hard work, have been saving for my daughters education since before she was born. By educating myself a little about 529 investment plans, using little things like U-promise, and just plain old socking money away, I have built up a substantial savings for my daughters education. Couple things come to mind...\n \n -There are already grants and other free assisstance available for people cannot afford to send their children to college.\n -Not everyone needs to go to an Ivy League school to get their degree. There are many fine schools which cost significantly less and will provide the same education. \n -Academic scholarships are available for students who...again with the phrase...exercise some personal responsibility, work hard, and earn them. \n -Going to college and getting a degree to get a good paying job makes it easier to pay back those loans. Trust me...I did it. \n -You don't have to go to college at all if you don't want to. \n \n If you want something bad enough, you will be willing to work hard and sacrifice to get it. If you really need help, I am more than happy that some of my money goes to you (although if we actually cleaned up our social programs, it should not have to affect my taxes at all anyway). If you choose to just stick your hand out and refuse to do your part...you and those dependent upon you will suffer the consequences. emoticon_cool",

A bill that is being hailed as a major\n legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any\n real skills or ambition.\n \n \"Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive\n necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,\"\n said California Senator Barbara Boxer. \"We can no longer stand by and\n allow People of no ability to be ridiculed and passed over.

Rep. Pelosi\n pointed out that approximately 84 percent of postal employees exhibit no\n job skills whatsoever, making this agency the single largest U.S.\n employer of Persons of Inability.\n \n Private-sector industries with good records of nondiscrimination against\n inept and incompetent workers include retail sales (52%), the airline\n industry (48%), and home improvement \"warehouse\" stores (45%). At the\n state government level, Department of Motor Vehicles also has a great\n record of hiring persons of little or no ability (73%).\n \n Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million \"middle\n no management\" positions will be created, with important-sounding\n titles, but little real responsibility, thus reinforcing the illusory\n sense of purpose and performance.\n \n The AWNAA mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be\n given, to guarantee upward mobility for even the least gifted employees.\n The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that\n promote a significant number of Persons of Inability into\n middle-no-management positions, and gives a tax credit to small and\n medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every\n two more talented hires.\n \n Finally, the AWNAA Act contains tough new measures to make it more\n difficult to discriminate against the Non-abled by banning (for example)\n discriminatory interview questions such as \"Do you have any skills or\n experience which relate to this job?\"\n \n \"As a Non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who\n have something going for them,\" said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her\n position as a lug-nut turner at the GM plant in Flint , Michigan owing\n to her lack of any discernible job skills. \"This new law should really\n help people like me.\"\n \n With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other talent\n challenged citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n \n Said permanent Senator Ted Kennedy: \"As a Senator with no abilities, I\n believe the same privileges that we elected officials enjoy ought to be\n extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as\n lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his\n or her adequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great\n nation.\"\n \n The bill is expected to come to vote in the first session under the next\n Clinton administration. \n",
