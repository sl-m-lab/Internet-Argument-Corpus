   "Wow, this will be interesting. If the US controls the trial, the outcome will be looked upon with skepticism throughout the Middle East. It does not look like he will be tried outside Iraq. Most probably the Iraqi people will try him inside Iraq.\n \n Obviously his atrocities will be evidence in court. They will mention the gassing of the Kurds in 1988. \n \n I wonder if they will put him on the stand. If they do, what do you think he will say? I don't know for sure, but he could implicate the US in a conspiracy, whether true or not. \n \n Over the past decade, declassified documents here in the US indicate we sold Saddam weapons including Biological material, Chemicals and missile technology right up until his invasion of Kuwait in 1992. Will he claim the chemicals he used on the Kurds came from the US? Will he describe his friends or contacts at the CIA that he has known since the sixties and late fifties? \n \n It will be interesting. What do you guys think will happen in the trial? Will he take the stand?",

That was the concern when he was caught (i.e. that the Iraqi's were not prepared for such a trial).\n \n He could also be rescued by the Ba'athists. He could even be killed before he goes to trial.\n \n I expect some accident. Can you imagine him divulging names of Americans who helped him? \n \n Note: The Russians could be implicated too.",
