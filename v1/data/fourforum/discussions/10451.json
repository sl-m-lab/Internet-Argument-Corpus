   "I'd like you to show us where in the Constitution is says America is a Christian Nation??????????????\n\n \n Let me guess, you haven't read the actual interview itself, have you? Instead you went entirely on whatever report or editorial said that you pasted into the initial post, huh? McCain didn't say the constitution stated anywhere that \"America is a Christian nation.\" If you read his statements in their entirety, he was not speaking in a specific sense but in the sense of the values of the religion. Here is the full answer to the question that was given to him on this:\n \n \"I would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation. But I say that in the broadest sense. The lady that holds her lamp beside the golden door doesn't say, \"I only welcome Christians.\" We welcome the poor, the tired, the huddled masses. But when they come here they know that they are in a nation founded on Christian principles.\"\n Goodness, at least read the interview for yourself and make up your OWN mind rather than have people do your thinking for you by their pulling of single phrases from the interview. Here it is: http://www.beliefnet.com/story/220/story_22001_1.html#extndVer\n \n Now, could McCain have gotten his point across in a better and less divisive way? Absolutely. He should have just said it was founded on many of the principles that Christianity shares at it's core (life, liberty, and freedoms--i.e. John Locke Christian influence) rather than giving the implication of a state religion. As I said, the man has tact issues. But he was clearly talking about \"Christian\" in the sense of the principles involved.",
