We can feed it good energy or we can feed it bad energy. I am a believer of karma. Sometimes when bad things happen to good people and good things happen to not so good people, it's still affects karma...we just may not see it right away (it's not an instant cause and affect). So if you say, hurt someone today somehow, perhaps you won't experience the repercussions of your actions right away. As a matter of fact, repercussions will most likely occur at the most opportune time to affect change.

I think you have a point, in a way, that change (often fueled by knowledge), is inherently risky, and not always a good thing. Countless sci-fi novels have been written about how incredible knowledge can be misused to the ruin of the earth. All the good things we do with knowledge might ultimately bring all life on earth, or at least human life, to an end. That's not entirely impossible to imagine.\n \n I just think it's better to TRY than to kick back and let mother nature decide our fate...so I'm still on the \"knowledge is good side\", but I do see another side there too. While I think humans are capable of all the good you mention without the need for a diety, I do agree that things like (compasion, humility,etc.) ARE required to chaperone the knowledge.\n \n As to knowledge being bad if it moves you away from your religious diety...I can't disagree more :/ but I know you're basing it on your religion. While I think it's misplaced, at least it's on the side of \"trying to do good\". ;)\n \n -Mach",

   "I was raised a Catholic and now I am an atheist. I think that religion is something that helps people who need help. Some people paint, others play music, some read, and the rest pray. I am fascinated by religion. More than that I am fascinated by the fact people believe in it. Some of us just don't think it is the answer to life questions. The \"Word\" as you call it is rubbish to me. I love hearing the stories but I think that it is just that. Stories. I respect that others believe and I am not against religion. I am against the \"Born Again Movement\" I haven't seen anything so contradictive in my life than this born again thing. Everything the bible says about not judging others and all they do is judge!

   "My blunt answer would be that the \"force\" that steers people AWAY from religion is education. If I may dare to generalize, education is the force that, IMHO, separates most people from religion. IN GENERAL, those with higher educations and scientific backgrounds are less likely to be religious, regardless of the religion. However, IMHO, this is particularly true of Christianity and other monotheistic \"God\" based religions, especially where authority is drawn from a singular set of specified texts, ie the Bible, Qu'ran, etc... Simply put, they don't jive with our current understanding of the physical world.\n \n Religion was the \"science\" of early humans. It was used to explain what could not otherwise be explained. As humans have increased their knowledge, they have decreased their need for religion to provide the answers, and thus, IMHO, decreasing it's importance for a great many people.\n \n I tend to agree with your millionaire friend, though I try not to be too vocal, as it is offensive to those that believe, and it is a generalization.\n \n As for God's choices of who to touch/not touch, maybe he just doesn't have the power to overcome their \"free will\". \n \n Waxy\n\n \n Excellent post Waxy , and a lot of truth in your explanation, especially about education and knowledge . In your reference to the increase of knowledge reducing the \"need\" for religion has a lot of truth to it, but as all topics about religion, there is a little room left for debate. I am not educated at all, compared to some I know . The educated people that I do know, still have a thirst for a knowledge they could not get in class at the university they attended. Despite their 16 and 18 years of education, they still ended up going to church regularly. \n \n When I questioned some of them about why they went to church regularly, ( which struck me as odd too) , their most common reply was \" It just makes me feel better about myself, and life seems to go better for me when I attend church\". Hmmm, so it seems that even when the letter of the Biblical Law is not always followed as to the reason one goes to church, there is something in people that either needs religion or they dont, it doesnt seem to matter whether the person is a Harvard law professor or a factory worker.\n A mystery to me for sure, one that will be proven to me after death I am sure, as to whether I am right or wrong. all jmo",

You have re-drawn the field so that anyone who is deeply religious would be condemned by you and he as being stupid or wilfully ignorant. It ignores the great minds who are/were religious - such as Newton.\n \n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught that a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74.\n \n You have also redefined religion in materialist fashion - in a Marxist way - that religion exists to serve material needs - in this case to make people feel better. Religion exists because of the truth of religion. God exists. People are born with an instinct to search for Him. Some never do. Some ignore the evidences of witnesses, testimonies, miracles, because they want to believe that they are, all that is... in other words arrogance leads them astray.",

   "Why is it that some people go through life, never feeling the need for a relationship with any higher powers than themselves ? They seem to do great in life, and go forward with it, gaining all they need plus some, in the material world.

He says he has never needed it, and it is just for people that dont have the fortitude to get what they want out of life, without asking their \"god\" for it . He does not ridicule or put down anyone that is religous, but just looks at it like it is something people do to appease themselves. ...\n \n Does the powers above have a \"selection commitee\" that are picking the souls they feel are worth saving , and \"steering\" them to be saved ?
