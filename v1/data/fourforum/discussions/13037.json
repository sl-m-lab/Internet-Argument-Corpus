   "To all the nutty \"birthers\" out there, read it and weep:Hawaii again declares Obama birth certificate real - Yahoo! News\n \n \nState officials in Hawaii on Monday said they have once again checked and confirmed that President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen, and therefore meets a key constitutional requirement for being president.\n \n They hoped to stem a recent surge in the number of inquiries about Obama's birthplace.\n \n \"I ... have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen,\" Health Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino said in a brief statement. \"I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008 over eight months ago.\"\n \n So-called \"birthers\" &#8212; who claim Obama is ineligible to be president because, they argue, he was actually born outside the United States &#8212; have grown more vocal recently on blogs and television news shows.\n \n Fukino issued a similar press release Oct. 31, but was prompted to speak out again because of the renewed attention on Obama's beginnings. Hawaii's Health Department has been flooded in recent weeks with questions from individuals and several national TV news networks asking for proof that Obama was indeed born in Hawaii.\n \n \"They just keep asking over and over and over again,\" Health Department spokeswoman Janice Okubo said.\n \n The Constitution states that a person must be a \"natural-born citizen\" to be eligible for the presidency. Birthers contend that Obama's birth certificate is a fake, and many say he was actually born in Kenya, his father's homeland. They've challenged his citizenship in court.\n \n One widely circulated YouTube clip of a town hall meeting showed a Republican congressman getting booed for saying Obama is a citizen. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh and CNN's Lou Dobbs have also raised the issue, and 10 Republican members of Congress co-sponsored a bill that would require future presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate.\n \n However, it appears Congress has moved on and has accepted Obama's island birthplace. The U.S. House on Monday unanimously approved a resolution recognizing and celebrating the 50th anniversary of Hawaii becoming the 50th state. A clause was included that reads: \"Whereas the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961.\"\n \n State law bars the release of a certified birth certificate to anyone who does not have a tangible interest.\n \n However, Obama's birth certificate along with birth notices from the two Honolulu newspapers were brought forward even before he took office. But that's done nothing to shake the belief by many Obama critics that the president was born abroad.\n \n\n Depite this already being determined over half a year ago, the fundie nutjobs have to this day, as seen in the article, still proclaimed Obama is not a US citizen.\n \n What is it about Fundamentalist Christians that so predisposes them to unfounded conspiracy theories?",

   "No, I am not. Please learn to read. I am stating that the article is accurate in what it said - Lou Dobbs raised the issue of the birther movement. I see, from your statement here, that you would agree with me. Glad we got that out of the way.\n No. Nor did I imply that. You are being as bad as Obvious_child here.\n \n It would be pretty terrible seeing as he CANNOT PRODUCE SUCH A CERTIFICATE.  NO FREAKING HAWAIIAN-BORN CITIZEN CAN. \n \n All they CAN produce, is what the Government of Hawaii provides them with in the form of the \"short form\" Certificate of Live Birth: exactly what Obama has produced.\n \n He has nothing to hide. And he has hidden nothing. He's had his COLB on display for a year or more (IIRC he posted it July last year I think). \n \n The Director of Hawaii's Health department has TWICE come forward saying that she has seen it and it is not a fake, and that it does indeed show when he was born and that he was born in Hawaii. The FREAKIN' REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR has confirmed he was born in Hawaii.\n \n Obama has hidden nothing.\n\n \n \nObama has bloody well produced a document which proves where he was born.\n \n Only persons who have wedged their heads up into a dark crevice where they sit are unable to see and acknowledge this simple piece of reality.\n\n \n I would hate to call you two a liar, but...\n \n I notice you both completely ignored my question about his health records.  Obama Medical Records: Obama Refuses Release, Media Refuses to Ask Why - Blogger News Network\n \n And here from just a couple of days ago, we see that Brigids claim that The Director of Hawaii's Health department has TWICE come forward saying that she has seen it and it is not a fake is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. Here check it out and you can attack the source rather than refute the evidence once again. Hawaii refuses to verify president's online COLBs",

As I've said before, I believe he was born in HI and we need to fight him on the ISSUES. I would hope no one on 'my side' would hope to invalidate a legal US election, so the point is moot.
