I know LOTS of people (gay AND straight) who have changed their religion. \n \n And trying to beat someone over the head with the Bible doesn't work. All it does is make them resent you and religion in general.\n \n This is coming from someone who has been there and knows 100's who have been there too. \n \n I guess what I am trying to say, is that if the so-called \"christian\" right is trying to reach us, they are 180 degrees off on their tactics.

And, as a man of faith, I believe this to be ordaied by God because He designed it this way. For a man and woman to compliment each other with the inherent traits that make each unique.\n\n \n And you are entitled that that opinion. No one wants to take that away from you, or if they do, I will stand in their path. But I am a man of reason. And as a man of reason, I consider marriage to be between two people who love each other and want to start a family together. I am also entitled to that opinion.\n \n Our laws, however, must consider neither my opinion nor your opinion; they must be fair and equal for everyone. That means that if heterosexuals receive special benefits under the law, then homosexuals must get those benefits as well. The truth is that you deserve no more benefits than homosexuals. You are no better than they, and you are no more needy than they.\n \n It is fine for you to oppose homosexuality and have an opinion about what the word marriage means. But as soon as you start using the law to give heterosexuals benefits not granted to homosexuals, you have engaged in a selfish act. You both benefit yourself and write your own religious beliefs into law as though they are fact and as though heterosexuals deserve more. That is wrong.\n \n \nBy not flaunting their homosexuality or hitting on the other employees.\n\n \n Yet you would have no problem if heterosexuals did these things? That is unfair treatment then, is it not? What if a heterosexual hit on a homosexual? Would you fire that heterosexual? If you allow heterosexuals to do things which you do not allow homosexuals to do, then your work favors heterosexuality, and it discriminates. If a law has been passed against such discrimination in your state, then a law suit would be very appropriate. If not, then such discrimination would be legal, and a lawsuit would be inappropriate.\n \n \nSorry, but to insist that your rights have been denied is extremely disengenuous. You already have the same basic rights. What you want are \"special\" rights. You can't have your cake and eat it,too All we've heard from the homosexual lobby is \"rights\" this and \"rights\" that. That's why I included the typical scenario of the homosexual lobby suing my business because I fired an employee for causing an hostile work environment. I'd do the same if a member of the neo-nazis were in my employ and caused the same thing to happen.\n\n \n I believe I have spoken on this before, but it has not once been addressed to my satisfaction. You claim that homosexuals have not been denied rights. I want you to explain this. I want you to justify it. Allow me to present my side:\n \n Opposite-sex marriage is a right given to everyone. Same-sex marriage is a right denied to everyone. Opposite-sex marriage will be used by heterosexuals. Same-sex marriage will be used by homosexuals.\n \n Now, although it is technically true that everyone is granted the right to opposite-sex marriage and no one is granted the right to same-sex marriage, this means nothing more than \"heterosexuals will use marriage, while homosexuals will not.\"\n \n It is the exact same effect as denying marriage to homosexuals completely. What you have done is restrict all forms of marriage used by homosexuals and allow all forms of marriage used by heterosexuals. You give heterosexual marriage to everyone. And that is unfair to homosexuals.\n \n So to say that gays aren't denied a right is untrue, for everyone is denied the right to same-sex marriage. And although you might point out that straight people are also denied that right, I will point out that straight people would never use it. You also cannot say that our marriage laws are equal. Our marriage laws are most certainly designed to allow heterosexual to marry and to prevent homosexuals from marrying. We both know who the restriction on same-sex marriage prevents from marrying.\n \n So all you can say is that both homosexuals and heterosexuals have the same rights. But why does that even matter? What matters is that those rights are unfair, unequal, and unjust. What matters is that the rights you've given everyone will be used only be heterosexuals, and you've banned the version that homosexuals would use.\n \n To suggest that you support treating homosexuals equally or fairly is what is truly disengenuous here. I think you know very well that our marriage laws treat homosexuals unfairly, that they are designed in a fashion which prevents homosexuals from using them.\n \n You also know that allowing same-sex marriage would give homosexuals nothing more than the same rights you have. And it would make marriage more equal. Yet you call this \"special rights\". How do you justify that claim?",

   "And you are entitled that that opinion. No one wants to take that away from you, or if they do, I will stand in their path. But I am a man of reason. And as a man of reason, I consider marriage to be between two people who love each other and want to start a family together. I am also entitled to that opinion.\n\n There is a difference here, though. Marriage, in its proper definition also incorperates the procreation and raising of children(owing to the fact that there are adopted children in families). But the proper family structure of mom, dad, and children is still the best formula for stability. Now, since homosexuality is abnormal, and if the definition of marriage were to be altered, then that stability would be shaky, at best.\n \n \nOur laws, however, must consider neither my opinion nor your opinion; they must be fair and equal for everyone. That means that if heterosexuals receive special benefits under the law, then homosexuals must get those benefits as well. The truth is that you deserve no more benefits than homosexuals. You are no better than they, and you are no more needy than they.\n \n It is fine for you to oppose homosexuality and have an opinion about what the word marriage means. But as soon as you start using the law to give heterosexuals benefits not granted to homosexuals, you have engaged in a selfish act. You both benefit yourself and write your own religious beliefs into law as though they are fact and as though heterosexuals deserve more. That is wrong.\n\n It is not wrong when you have a clearly defined definition of marriage.\n \n \n \nYet you would have no problem if heterosexuals did these things? That is unfair treatment then, is it not? What if a heterosexual hit on a homosexual? Would you fire that heterosexual? If you allow heterosexuals to do things which you do not allow homosexuals to do, then your work favors heterosexuality, and it discriminates. If a law has been passed against such discrimination in your state, then a law suit would be very appropriate. If not, then such discrimination would be legal, and a lawsuit would be inappropriate.\n\n Yes I would have a problem with that because that type of conduct is inappropriate.\n \n \n \nI believe I have spoken on this before, but it has not once been addressed to my satisfaction. You claim that homosexuals have not been denied rights. I want you to explain this. I want you to justify it. Allow me to present my side:\n \n Opposite-sex marriage is a right given to everyone. Same-sex marriage is a right denied to everyone. Opposite-sex marriage will be used by heterosexuals. Same-sex marriage will be used by homosexuals.\n \n Now, although it is technically true that everyone is granted the right to opposite-sex marriage and no one is granted the right to same-sex marriage, this means nothing more than \"heterosexuals will use marriage, while homosexuals will not.\"\n \n It is the exact same effect as denying marriage to homosexuals completely. What you have done is restrict all forms of marriage used by homosexuals and allow all forms of marriage used by heterosexuals. You give heterosexual marriage to everyone. And that is unfair to homosexuals.\n \n So to say that gays aren't denied a right is untrue, for everyone is denied the right to same-sex marriage. And although you might point out that straight people are also denied that right, I will point out that straight people would never use it. You also cannot say that our marriage laws are equal. Our marriage laws are most certainly designed to allow heterosexual to marry and to prevent homosexuals from marrying. We both know who the restriction on same-sex marriage prevents from marrying.\n \n So all you can say is that both homosexuals and heterosexuals have the same rights. But why does that even matter? What matters is that those rights are unfair, unequal, and unjust. What matters is that the rights you've given everyone will be used only be heterosexuals, and you've banned the version that homosexuals would use.\n \n To suggest that you support treating homosexuals equally or fairly is what is truly disengenuous here. I think you know very well that our marriage laws treat homosexuals unfairly, that they are designed in a fashion which prevents homosexuals from using them.\n \n You also know that allowing same-sex marriage would give homosexuals nothing more than the same rights you have. And it would make marriage more equal. Yet you call this \"special rights\". How do you justify that claim?\n\n Marriage isn't a right and nowhere found in the constitution. Marriage is an established institution given by God, ordained by God and blessed by God. Now, when we talk of \"special rights\" we talk of legislation that favors a specific group or behavior.",

   "There is a difference here, though. Marriage, in its proper definition also incorperates the procreation and raising of children(owing to the fact that there are adopted children in families). But the proper family structure of mom, dad, and children is still the best formula for stability. Now, since homosexuality is abnormal, and if the definition of marriage were to be altered, then that stability would be shaky, at best.\n\n \n Same-sex couples can certainly raise children, and they can certainly bring children into this world via artificial insemination or surrogate parenting. Although you may not agree with those methods, your disagreement might only stem from religious reasons. I find them perfectly acceptable.\n \n Furthermore, I competely disagree that the family structure of \"mom, dad, and children\" is better than the family structure of two parents of the same gender and children. Scientific studies on the issue, for example, have come to the conclusion that same-sex parents are just as good as or better than opposite-sex parents, and have concluded that they are just as stable or more stable. And what reason is there to believe otherwise? The only arguable difference between the two sets of parents that I can think of would be that a child needs to learn certain gender roles. Yet logic suggests that teaching our children gender roles is a bad idea, for gender roles require a person to act depending on his or her gender, not depending on what is the best thing to do in the current situation.\n \n \nIt is not wrong when you have a clearly defined definition of marriage.\n\n \n Why not? If I had a clearly defined institution which benefited only white people, would that institution be okay? I could call it \"citizen's rights\", and you would get tax breaks and medical insurance for being white. It could be every bit as clearly defined as marriage. Yet wouldn't it still be wrong?\n \n A legal institution which is unfair and which discriminates against a minority is wrong. Having a clear definition of that institution does not make it right; it just makes it more clear that it is wrong.\n \n \nYes I would have a problem with that because that type of conduct is inappropriate.\n\n \n So if you're treating everyone under the same rules, why mention homosexuals alone? Is it not just as likely that a heterosexual would sue you if you fired him for hitting on a homosexual employee that a homosexual would sue you if you fired him for hitting on a heterosexual employee?\n \n \nMarriage isn't a right and nowhere found in the constitution. Marriage is an established institution given by God, ordained by God and blessed by God. Now, when we talk of \"special rights\" we talk of legislation that favors a specific group or behavior.\n\n \n Okay, let me start by explaining what a \"right\" is; it seems to me that many people misunderstand this. A \"right\" is basically anything that a person can do. Getting married is definitely a right, and same-sex marriage is definitely a right. Murder is even a right. But most of the time, when people say \"right\", they mean \"legal right\". A \"legal right\" is something that our law allows us to do. So \"murder\" isn't a legal right, while \"dancing\" is a legal right. A right that our constitution protects is just a \"right protected by our Constitution\". So when someone says something like, \"I have the right to do that,\" they're not saying that it is moral for them to be allowed to do that, they're saying that the law allows them to do it. It isn't a crime.\n \n Marriage, in the opinion of many, is an established institution given by God, as you said. But not everyone believes in God. And a large number of people believe in God, but believe that he blesses same-sex marriage. Those are all religious opinions of marriage, and they are all recognized equally under the law.\n \n But we're talking about more than just religious marriage now. People have taken marriage and put it into our laws. And as soon as that happens, all religious opinion on what \"marriage\" is must be taken out of consideration. Our laws must be equal, they must treat everyone fairly. And it doesn't matter that one man's religious opinion says gays can't marry any more than it matters that one man's religious opinion says they can. What matters is that our laws cannot favor one group over another. We can't put heterosexuals on a pedastal by designing our rights to benefit them; we must make sure our laws benefit everyone equally.\n \n A man who puts his own religious beliefs into law at the expense of some group of people is a man who elevates himself, who is selfish, and who uses the law to inject his own religion onto the lives of people who don't believe in it. It is not a moral act.\n \n Now you say that \"special rights\" are legislation that favors a certain group or behavior. You also say that same-sex marriage constitutes \"special rights for homosexuals\". I can agree with that. If we legalized nothing but same-sex marriage, that would be legislation designed specially to benefit homosexuals, and it would be unfair.\n \n But what do we have instituted right now? We have opposite-sex marriage. And in the same fashion that same-sex marriage constitutes special rights for homosexuals, opposite-sex marriage constitutes special rights for heterosexuals. As our laws stand currently, it is heterosexuals who have \"special rights\".\n \n Now I'm not aruging that we give anything special to homosexuals. I'm saying that we should expand the special rights of heterosexuals to include everyone. I'm saying that we should have one institution which is exclusive to no one, one institution that covers both heterosexuals and homosexuals. That way, there is special rights for no one; we all have the same rights. And that is the way our laws, in an equal and free nation, must be written.\n \n If we created such an institution, a legal institution for everyone, you could certainly hold onto your beliefs of what marriage is. And I'll hold onto mine. We don't even have to call this legal institution for everyone \"marriage\", we can call it whatever we want. We can call it \"civil unions\" for everyone. But so long as we create special rights for heterosexuals, we will never be fair, and our laws will not be moral.",

That's basically what you are arguing here. I could never agree with this. People should have the the freedom to participate in the process in a peaceful way, as these people have done by signing the petition.\n \n \nThe second is to allow homosexuals to see which of their neighbors are taking away their benefits and legal recognition, so that those homosexuals can try to change the minds of those neighbors or choose to disassociate themselves as appropriate.\n\n \n I would think that, as commonplace as opposition to gay issues is, dissassociation would be pretty impractical. Unless one wanted to go live in a mostly gay community. I think in most neighborhoods, if someone refused to associate with another because they signed a petitition about something not targeting a specific person, it would be a surefire way to come across to the whole neighborhood as a jerk. Remember, for most people, opposing homosexual issues is nothing personal--it's just a religious or political view as any other. And I for one would hate to think I would dissassociate myself with anyone over politics. Signing the petition is simply a way to peacefully protest something. And that's an American right. \n \n I do think your first point might be good, in that it could even encourage dialog between neighbors and increase goodwill in the long run in communities. But I doubt that would be the case as posting the addresses of petition signers was certainly done in a spirit of malevolence and revenge. I don't think there is much good that can come out of this. I suspect most people assumed that when they signed the petition that it would not result in the addresses being so easily downloaded by political extremists on the internet. As someone else used the analogy, it's very much like someone going in a \"redneck bar\" and passing out the names of gay political activists in the area, along with their addresses. It's the same sort of thing, it's just the shoe is on the other foot. There is a real ethical problem with whatever gay rights organization did this. I can't say I'm surprised, though. Matthew has tried to justify it by saying that \"the info about the addresses is publically available anyway\", but that's beside the point. Making those addresses MORE easily available and making it clear they are doing it because those people signed the petition is a clear invitation for gay people to confront the people on the list. I'd be less inclined to be outraged at this if the website he linked to had done so with the reminder that the petition signers should not be harrassed or attacked because of their taking part in their right to protest.\n \n To me this signals that some gay rights organizations are willing to provide the fuel for violence and harassment. And to pave the way for attacking or harassing someone for peaceful protest is very wrong.\n \n \nThe third might be to allow organizations to deny membership based on an individual stance in opposition to gay rights. There are organizations which deny membership to homosexuals, and with this new list, it may be possible to deny membership to opponents of gay rights.\n\n \n And there are some organizations that might welcome these people more readily by the stand they took.",

   "So you'd want them to stop participating in the political process and have their right of protest taken away by intimidation? That's basically what you are arguing here. I could never agree with this. People should have the the freedom to participate in the process in a peaceful way, as these people have done by signing the petition.\n\n \n Initiating the creation of a law is not protest. When a law is created, individuals should be allowed to know who is responsible for its creation, and in this case, it is the people signing the petition. This is why our laws mandate that this information not be kept private. This is especially important when the people creating this law are denying the rights of someone other than themselves.\n \n This does not change the fact that intimidation is being used to prevent people from creating this law, however that intimidation is nothing more than the fact that they will actually have to face the people they've harmed. That sort of intimidation is not a bad thing; if an individual supports laws that harm someone else, that someone else has a right to know, and the individual who harmed him had better be willing to face up to it.\n \n \nI would think that, as commonplace as opposition to gay issues is, dissassociation would be pretty impractical. Unless one wanted to go live in a mostly gay community. I think in most neighborhoods, if someone refused to associate with another because they signed a petitition about something not targeting a specific person, it would be a surefire way to come across to the whole neighborhood as a jerk. Remember, for most people, opposing homosexual issues is nothing personal--it's just a religious or political view as any other.\n\n \n And this is why I despise the actions of many religious people; this is why I call it evil to deny same-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriage do not care what the consequences of their actions are, they don't care about the wellbeing of other people, and they do not care that they've harmed millions. All opponents of same-sex marriage care about is getting their own religious beliefs put into law, no matter the cost.\n \n It is true that opponents of same-sex marriage aren't targetting a single person. They're not targetting me. They're targetting me and everyone like me. When an opponent of same-sex marriage tells me that he voted to strip my right to the same tax benefits that he gives himself, that he stripped my right to give my husband health insurance, that he stripped my right to call my relationship a marriage, that he stripped any right that he gives himself, but he tells me that it wasn't directed at me, what else am I supposed to think? I think that he doesn't care about me, that he doesn't care about my beliefs, and that he is willing to harm anyone, any time in order to assure that his own religious beliefs are carved into our laws.\n \n I know that opponents of same-sex marriage have good intentions. But those intentions are misdirected, and they are harming a lot of people, whether they are \"targetting\" those people or not. It is very difficult to like someone who is harming you. We all do our best, but some don't succeed. So does hating a person who has harmed you and caused you suffering make you a jerk? Or is it more likely the other way around?\n \n \nAnd I for one would hate to think I would dissassociate myself with anyone over politics. Signing the petition is simply a way to peacefully protest something. And that's an American right.\n\n \n If you would hate to dissassociate yourself from anyone over politics, then do not harm them. Do not put your own religion into law above theirs. Do not deny them the same things you give yourself. And consider their own wellbeing as much as you consider your own.\n \n Signing a petition is not a peaceful way to protest something. Protest itself is not always peaceful. When signing a petition takes away people's rights, when protesting takes away people's rights, that isn't peaceful. Real people are harmed. Real people suffer. Real people are denied the same protections that you yourself enjoy. And you call that peaceful? It is peaceful only to those who are not harmed. Whether signing that petition accomplishes nothing or accomplishes much, you go to sleep at night with the same protections and the same legal security you had the day before, the same as anyone else. You don't feel the effects of your actions.\n \n \nI do think your first point might be good, in that it could even encourage dialog between neighbors and increase goodwill in the long run in communities. But I doubt that would be the case as posting the addresses of petition signers was certainly done in a spirit of malevolence and revenge. I don't think there is much good that can come out of this.\n\n \n This website has little potential to bring good if you do not consider supporting gay rights a good thing.\n \n \nI suspect most people assumed that when they signed the petition that it would not result in the addresses being so easily downloaded by political extremists on the internet. As someone else used the analogy, it's very much like someone going in a \"redneck bar\" and passing out the names of gay political activists in the area, along with their addresses. It's the same sort of thing, it's just the shoe is on the other foot.\n\n \n This is correct. There may be a difference in that rednecks have a precedent of violence against gays, while gays do not have a history of violence against rednecks, however it would be along the same lines. Either way, I would not think that a good thing, as it would not support gay rights. On a related note, I would not be opposed to someone handed out my name and address, listing me as a gay rights activist.\n \n \nThere is a real ethical problem with whatever gay rights organization did this.\n\n \n This is admittedly not the most ethical action. But I understand the motivation. In my opinion, it is far more important to support gay rights than it is to protect the privacy of those who oppose it. Millions of people are helped by supporting gay rights, and unless some violence results from it, no one is really harmed by posting the names and addresses of gay rights opponents.\n \n \ncan't say I'm surprised, though. Matthew has tried to justify it by saying that \"the info about the addresses is publically available anyway\", but that's beside the point. Making those addresses MORE easily available and making it clear they are doing it because those people signed the petition is a clear invitation for gay people to confront the people on the list. I'd be less inclined to be outraged at this if the website he linked to had done so with the reminder that the petition signers should not be harrassed or attacked because of their taking part in their right to protest.\n\n \n That reminder would be a welcome addition in both of our opinions.\n \n \nTo me this signals that some gay rights organizations are willing to provide the fuel for violence and harassment. And to pave the way for attacking or harassing someone for peaceful protest is very wrong.\n\n \n I am willing to harass people who oppose gay rights if that leads to equality. I am willing to harass people who support gay rights if that leads to equality. I am willing to do almost anything short of harming another if it leads to equality. Far more people are helped by legalizing gay rights than those harmed by me harrassing them. If I harrassed a hundred thousand people, that would be nothing compared to the people who benefited from legalizing same-sex marriage; the benefits of same-sex marriage extend not just to the millions of gay people in the world today, but to every gay person who will be born.\n \n I do not believe the creators of that website wanted anyone to be harmed. It may not be the most ethical thing to do, but I understand their motivation. And as I said, I am currently uncertain whether it is a good idea or a bad one.\n \n \nAnd there are some organizations that might welcome these people more readily by the stand they took.\n\n \n Absolutely. But neither I nor the creators of that site likely consider that a good thing, and as such, it is probably not a reason for putting up that list. As you recall, I was listing possible reasons why that list might be a good thing.",

Yours is the same sort of logic someone might use to allow gay people to intimidate someone at the polls to vote for a certain pro-gay candidate. Or for that matter, the flip-side: someone intimidating someone at the polls to vote for an anti-gay candidate. All these cases are very wrong--people have to be free to participate in the American system without intimidation. Besides, the website you are defending did not say that at all. It simply laid out a link to the addresses, with no consideration of what might or might not happen. If it had been a call to gay people to simply voice their concerns to their neighbors, that would be different.\n \n \nThat sort of intimidation is not a bad thing; if an individual supports laws that harm someone else, that someone else has a right to know, and the individual who harmed him had better be willing to face up to it.\n\n \n The 'harm' is a matter of opinion, but even if it IS harm, people have to be free to vote, protest, and participate in the system by exercising their rights. Preventing one right to gain another is the wrong way of handling this.\n \n \nOpponents of same-sex marriage do not care what the consequences of their actions are, they don't care about the wellbeing of other people, and they do not care that they've harmed millions. All opponents of same-sex marriage care about is getting their own religious beliefs put into law, no matter the cost.\n\n \n It's not that they don't care, it's that many have weighed the two sides of this and determined that the harm is not worth the cost to our culture and society by changing marriage. But regardless of that, this is also an issue where someone could take away a person's right to privacy and protest, in order to help get a separate right (marriage). It may indeed feel very oppressive to you to not have your couples' benefits called \"marriage\", but you can't prevent people's rights in other things to get that. \n \n \nIt is true that opponents of same-sex marriage aren't targetting a single person. They're not targetting me. They're targetting me and everyone like me.\n\n \n No, they aren't targeting you at all. They don't have a target, period. They simply are trying to keep marriage from being redefined. It's marriage that's being targeted by anti-marriage people such as yourself.\n \n \nI know that opponents of same-sex marriage have good intentions. But those intentions are misdirected\n\n \n But your movement's message to these people is seldom \"you have good intentions, but they are misdirected.\" It is usually something like \"you are a bigot\" or \"you hate gay people.\" I don't think you have any idea how much harm saying things like that does to your movement by further reinforcing the views that some already have about the gay rights movement.\n \n \nSigning a petition is not a peaceful way to protest something. \n\n \n Sure it is. There was no-one arrested, no one trampled by a mob, no one even shouted at on the curb. Heck, the police didn't even have to come out and separate two groups. It was very peaceful. Using your logic that the protest is not peaceful due to what the protest is about could be used to argue ANY protest is not peaceful. (\"Cindy Shehaan, your protest is not peaceful because people in Iraq will be harmed if the troops come home right now, as you demand.\" That's the same logic you are using.) But the protest was peaceful regardless of whether or not what it supported was a peaceful thing.\n \n \nProtest itself is not always peaceful. When signing a petition takes away people's rights, when protesting takes away people's rights, that isn't peaceful.\n\n \n But that's where you are wrong.

In my opinion, it is far more important to support gay rights than it is to protect the privacy of those who oppose it. \n\n \n False dichotomy. If they are truly both rights, they should not be pitted against one another in the first place which is what this website is effectively doing.\n \n \nI am willing to harass people who oppose gay rights if that leads to equality.\n\n \n Then you are willing to prevent one right of someone else to get another.

   "The first is discouraging people from signing a petition to oppose gay rights. This might happen if an individual lives in an area which is friendly toward homosexuality or does not want his homosexuals friends to see that he has voted to harm them. It may also be that an individual is simply too shy to sign a petition when his name is going to be posted online.\n You would think you would want him to sign it then...that way you know the truth instead of having him keep lying.\n \n \nThe second is to allow homosexuals to see which of their neighbors are taking away their benefits and legal recognition, so that those homosexuals can try to change the minds of those neighbors or choose to disassociate themselves as appropriate.\n Chances are you won't change their minds, and I would suspect that if one signed the petition they are probably already disassociated with gays...and if not, why should it matter? My friends have different views then I do, I don't hate them or not associate with them because of it.\n \n \nBut do these reasons make it a good idea? Well, like I said, I'm not sure.\n I'm not sure either. It seems steering up hate is the worst way to get something accomplished and it just makes more hate but that is just me.",

   "...and if not, why should it matter? My friends have different views then I do, I don't hate them or not associate with them because of it.\n\n \n I agree. But I think part of the problem is that some gay people take this issue a lot more personally than others. Jaxian said he'd be willing to actually intimidate people for his cause. But we know for a fact that not all gay people take it so personally as some in this forum do--heck 25% of gay voters voted for Bush instead of Kerry in the last election (and the gay lobby clearly said Bush was the less gay-friendly candidate). So I think even the very idea that it's a very personal issue and one of personal harm is only one opinion out of several. When I hear someone like Jaxian say \"it's a personal matter\" or a matter of \"personal harm\" I can't just accept that at face value, given the fact that apparently many in the gay rights movement don't view it that way. It should come as no surprise that some in these forums would think that way, because people like that might be more prone to seek an outlet for their statements.\n \n So I agree with you--it's a political issue like any other, and we shouldn't disassociate with people or hold grudges over that.",

It would be much more ethical and more effective for you all to point your actions at lawmakers rather than trying to punish people who are simply being American citizens by participating in the process.\n\n \n What would targetting lawmakers accomplish? In the case of petitions, lawmakers are not involved at all. The people who sign the petitions are the lawmakers, and those are the people being targetted.\n \n I am suggesting that those who are responsible for the creation of a law which harms people be held responsible for their actions. If being held responsible for your actions constitutes punishment, then I'm all for it. Why should we allow people to create laws anonymously? We're talking about an unelected group of people getting together to put a law on the ballots. Why not let everyone know who that group of people is?\n \n And if you think being an American citizen means signing any petition, you're wrong. It is American to support freedom, equality, and happiness. It is American to support religious equality, to keep your beliefs out of our laws. Or at least those are the values that America was founded on.\n \n \nFacing them would only be the result of gay people confronting the signers of the petition, which would clearly be a case of intimidation toward people participating in their right to protest. Yours is the same sort of logic someone might use to allow gay people to intimidate someone at the polls to vote for a certain pro-gay candidate.\n\n \n Not quite. That sort of intimidation includes the fear of violence or harm coming to you. I support the use of intimidation in the form of having to look into the eyes of the people you hurt. I am allowed to engage in that sort of intimidation; I did it when I asked voters to vote down the proposal banning all recognition of same-sex partnerships and benefits in Michigan, when I stood outside the polls telling them that it was wrong.\n \n \nThe 'harm' is a matter of opinion, but even if it IS harm, people have to be free to vote, protest, and participate in the system by exercising their rights. Preventing one right to gain another is the wrong way of handling this.\n\n \n People have and should have the right to protest and participate in the system. People also have the right to create laws by passing around a petition. No right is being denied by this website. No one is prevented from doing either of those things. I have the right to ask you not to create a law, even to show you the faces of the people you are harming with that law just as much as you have the right to create it. You'll repeat it numerous times in the quotes below, but you are wrong. Or if you are right, tell me what right is denied.\n \n Furthermore, the right of the people to create laws by passing around a petition is a very bad one. It is not allowed on a federal level because our federal constitution is a good one. When we allow people to create laws with a petition then a majority vote of the people, we are giving power to the majority unchecked by anyone else. We are allowing the majority free reign, the power to do whatever it wants: the power to oppress the minority. The power of the majority should be checked by elected officials. So in my opinion, even if you were denied this right, it would be a right we probably shouldn't have in the first place.\n \n Though no right is denied.\n \n \nIt's not that they don't care, it's that many have weighed the two sides of this and determined that the harm is not worth the cost to our culture and society by changing marriage. But regardless of that, this is also an issue where someone could take away a person's right to privacy and protest, in order to help get a separate right (marriage). It may indeed feel very oppressive to you to not have your couples' benefits called \"marriage\", but you can't prevent people's rights in other things to get that.\n\n \n Yet there is no cost to our culture and our society. Not a single person in our society is harmed by legalizing same-sex marriage. And altering culture does not harm anyone either. So where is the cost? There is none. The \"cost\" you speak of is nothing more than a \"change\", and the change is nothing more than removing a restriction which discriminates against people. Haven't you said it before? Isn't the real reason you do not support same-sex marriage your religious beliefs? If so, then do you not care more about instituting your religious beliefs into law than about my union, my religion, and my wellbeing?\n \n Either way, I cannot believe you're suggesting that I would \"prevent people's rights\" in order to legalize same-sex marriage. I haven't advocated preventing anyone's rights for this cause. This website certainly doesn't deny anyone's right, anywhere. Your side is the one denying rights. The only rights being denied in this debate are the rights of gay people. Should I not be insulted that you've asked me not to deny your rights, when the truth is that I would deny none of your rights, and you would deny many of mine?\n \n \nNo, they aren't targeting you at all. They don't have a target, period. They simply are trying to keep marriage from being redefined. It's marriage that's being targeted by anti-marriage people such as yourself.\n\n \n Trying to keep marriage from being redefined is an evil cause that targets people who are denied marriage, just as trying to keep slavery from being redefined targets slaves. By trying to keep an institution from being redefined, you are harming the people who that institution harms, whether you intend to you or not.\n \n You're right that I'm targetting marriage. But I'm not targetting the good parts of marriage, I'm targetting the unfair, discriminatory ones. And because all of marriage isn't under attack, you aren't defending all of marriage, you're only defending the unfair, discriminatory parts. You're defending a restriction that denies marriage to gay people, and nothing more. Do you think that restriction does not target gay people?\n \n \nBut your movement's message to these people is seldom \"you have good intentions, but they are misdirected.\" It is usually something like \"you are a bigot\" or \"you hate gay people.\" I don't think you have any idea how much harm saying things like that does to your movement by further reinforcing the views that some already have about the gay rights movement.\n\n \n I understand the harms of those messages. I do not support those messages. The harm from those messages is the same harm that occurs when we call same-sex unions something different than opposite-sex unions. It reinforces the views that some already have about same-sex unions, that they aren't as good as opposite-sex unions.\n \n But this website does not repeat those messages that I've seen, and if it does, I would not support that.\n \n \nSure it is. There was no-one arrested, no one trampled by a mob, no one even shouted at on the curb. Heck, the police didn't even have to come out and separate two groups. It was very peaceful. Using your logic that the protest is not peaceful due to what the protest is about could be used to argue ANY protest is not peaceful. (\"Cindy Shehaan, your protest is not peaceful because people in Iraq will be harmed if the troops come home right now, as you demand.\" That's the same logic you are using.) But the protest was peaceful regardless of whether or not what it supported was a peaceful thing.\n\n \n The protesters of the Iraq war are not signing petitions which would deny someone the same rights that they give themselves. Signing such a petition is a direct attack on the group whose rights are being denied. Taken to the extreme, I ask you to imagine whether people signing a petition for the enslavement of a minority is peaceful, or whether it is a direct attack on that minority. It may not be an attack of violence, but it is an attack on a certain group of people nonetheless.\n \n \nBut that's where you are wrong. The petition didn't take away anyone's rights, nor could it. It's just a statement--a protest.\n\n \n What? Are you kidding? If enough people sign those petitions, they get put on the ballot, and if the majority votes for them, gay people are denied rights. In Michigan, people were not only prevented from having marriage, they were prevented from having civil unions, they were prevented from getting medical coverage for partners in government positions, and they were prevented from having any recognition for their partnerships at all. The petition absolutely did take away people's rights.\n \n If you think signing those petitions is harmless, you're wrong. Those petitions take away my rights, and the rights of countless others.\n \n \nFalse dichotomy. If they are truly both rights, they should not be pitted against one another in the first place as this website has done.\n\n \n I have no idea what you're trying to say here. If you want to be technical about it, \"privacy\" isn't a right, since it isn't something people are allowed to do. Privacy either involves denying someone else's rights (privacy in your home denies people the right to peep in your windows, for example), or prevents the government from achieving certain powers (such as the government not being allowed to tap your phone lines). Privacy may not be a bad ideal to hold, however. But as I said, I'm willing to sacrifice a little privacy at the moment in favor of supporting equal rights for gay people.\n \n \nThen you are willing to prevent one right of someone else to get another. That is hypocrisy.\n\n \n Harrassing people isn't a violation of their rights. It doesn't prevent them from doing anything. It isn't even illegal. And it certainly doesn't harm them in any fashion more than some hurt feelings or feelings of doubt. But I'd absolutely make a hundred thousand people feel bad if it meant that the legal protections of gay people were made equal.\n \n But even if it were a denial of someone's rights, that wouldn't be hypocrisy at all, for I wouldn't actually believe it should be denied, just that it is necessary to deny it temporarily for a few people in order to achieve more, permanent rights for an exponetially larger group of people in the end.\n \n But even if it were a denial of someone's rights and even if I did think those rights should be denied, that still wouldn't be hypocrisy. It would just mean that I think that it is good to allow one right but not another. That isn't hypocrisy. I think it's good to allow people the right to vote, but not the right to murder. That isn't even close to hypocrisy.\n \n EDIT: My response to Steeeeve right after this post may also be worth reading.",

Now imagine that you're black and they're all white, then ask the same question. That's the turmoil I feel when associating with someone who opposes same-sex marriage.\n \n If your friends held the view that you should not be allowed to get married, yet they should, perhaps that your child shouldn't get medical insurance, that you should pay more taxes, and that your union shouldn't be called a marriage, would you really call them your friends?

This is their rights we're talking about. This is their marriage, their love, their children, and their families. These is the things that matter most to them. This isn't just a difference in political opinion, this is an opinion that their families should be harmed.\n \n Surely a black person would be outraged at someone who thought white people deserve more rights, so why should we not expect that same outrage from a gay person toward a straight person who believes that straight people deserve more rights. In my opinion, gay people have shown remarkable restraint. But even I, for all my talk of judging people for their intentions, have times when I'm just so scared for the future that I want to break off all ties with my friends who oppose same-sex marriage. It takes a lot of willpower for me to remember that they have good intentions, that they don't mean to harm my friends' families, the families of so many.\n \n \nI'm not sure either. It seems steering up hate is the worst way to get something accomplished and it just makes more hate but that is just me.\n\n \n I agree completely.

Passing around a petition and getting many signatures does not create law. The only ones that can create law is the legislature. THAT is why they are the ones (I would think) you would want to target. Petition signers are not lawmakers. The signing of a petition is nothing more than a way to people to show their view. Nothing more. There is no legal power whatsoever in a petition. That is why when you intimidate people to not sign a petition, or hold a sign, or state their views in any way, it is wrong.

Or if you are right, tell me what right is denied.\n\n \n But you aren't linking to or publishing the addresses of many people of a point of view that you disagree with. That website did. You aren't essentially inviting people to go to the homes of people you disagree with and take whatever action they want. That's the difference. You're right that no right is being denied directly by the website, but it certainly invites the denial of peoples' rights by clearly suggesting their right to privacy be taken away.\n \n \nEither way, I cannot believe you're suggesting that I would \"prevent people's rights\" in order to legalize same-sex marriage. I haven't advocated preventing anyone's rights for this cause. \n\n \n If you support their right to privacy being invaded, then you certainly are advocating a right being taken away to get your own. There's no way around it. You may think it's worth it, but it's still preventing the rights of others to get your own.\n \n \nThe protesters of the Iraq war are not signing petitions which would deny someone the same rights that they give themselves.\n\n \n The petitions can't do that. Again, I think you are mistaken in your view of how these things work. It's a form of protest just like Cindy Sheehan's.\n \n \nWhat? Are you kidding? If enough people sign those petitions, they get put on the ballot, and if the majority votes for them, gay people are denied rights. \n\n \n No. I see now what the problem is here. What I don't think you understand is that a legislator does not have to go by petitions or even ballots to make laws. The legislature can do that, but not a ballot itself, and certainly not a petition.\n \n \nIf you think signing those petitions is harmless, you're wrong. Those petitions take away my rights, and the rights of countless others.\n\n \n A petition can't do that. The legislature can. They should be your target.\n \n \nI have no idea what you're trying to say here. If you want to be technical about it, \"privacy\" isn't a right, since it isn't something people are allowed to do. \n\n \n Wow. no--privacy certainly is indeed a right. At least SCOTUS thinks so.\n \n \nHarrassing people isn't a violation of their rights. It doesn't prevent them from doing anything. It isn't even illegal. \n\n \n Harassment in the true sense IS illegal. What you're talking about isn't really harassment.\n \n \nBut even if it were a denial of someone's rights, that wouldn't be hypocrisy at all, for I wouldn't actually believe it should be denied, just that it is necessary to deny it temporarily for a few people in order to achieve more, permanent rights for an exponetially larger group of people in the end.\n\n \n It would be hypocrisy, taking away the rights of others when you yourself demand rights.",

   "We must all understand that our friends might have different political viewpoints. But that's not the same as having a political viewpoint which involves taking rights away from you that they would give themselves. Imagine if your friends held the opinion that black people don't deserve the same rights as white people. Would you associate with them? Now imagine that you're black and they're all white, then ask the same question. That's the turmoil I feel when associating with someone who opposes same-sex marriage.\n \n I do have friends like this. I have black friends that support affirmative action which I believe to be denying rights to whites (equal protection actually).\n \n \nIf your friends held the view that you should not be allowed to get married, yet they should, perhaps that your child shouldn't get medical insurance, that you should pay more taxes, and that your union shouldn't be called a marriage, would you really call them your friends? Even if they thought so lowly of you?\n Thinking lowly about someone and having different views are different. I don't think gays should marry (in the marriage term that is..disscused in another thread) and having kids I am unsure about but I don't think of any person, including unborn ones, as less than me.\n \n Gotta go!!!",

   "I think you may not understand how petitions work. They don't create law. Passing around a petition and getting many signatures does not create law. The only ones that can create law is the legislature. THAT is why they are the ones (I would think) you would want to target. Petition signers are not lawmakers. The signing of a petition is nothing more than a way to people to show their view. Nothing more. There is no legal power whatsoever in a petition. That is why when you intimidate people to not sign a petition, or hold a sign, or state their views in any way, it is wrong. It is clearly you violating someone's rights to get your own. You may indeed need your own, but it's wrong to prevent the rights of others to do that\n\n \n You are absolutely wrong about this. In most states, if enough signatures are gathered on a petition, the petition becomes a ballot measure for the voters. In Massachusetts, if the petition on that website gathers 65,825 or more signatures, and 25 percent of the legislature supports it in two consecutive sessions (note that 25 percent is almost certainly achievable on any measure), then a ballot measure will be presented to Massachusettes voters, and if it passes, every married same-sex couple will be stripped of their marriage. This is true despite the fact that the legislature has voted down a bill which would convert same-sex marriages to civil unions. Petitions absolutely do hold legal weight.\n \n http://uk.gay.com/headlines/8858\n \n And this website is in no way denying anyone's right to sign that petition.\n \n \nNo, I'm right--it means being free to state your views. Freedom of protest and free speech. People in this country certainly ARE free to sign a petition if the want.\n\n \n And that website doesn't change that. No one's freedom to sign a petition is being violated. But the people harmed by that petition will know who harmed them.\n \n \nIn that case, I wouldn't call it intimidation, but whatever you call that, then I agree with you.\n\n \n Then perhaps intimidation was the wrong word.\n \n \nBut you aren't linking to or publishing the addresses of many people of a point of view that you disagree with. That website did. You aren't essentially inviting people to go to the homes of people you disagree with and take whatever action they want. That's the difference. You're right that no right is being denied directly by the website, but it certainly invites the denial of peoples' rights by clearly suggesting their right to privacy be taken away.\n\n \n Though that website is listing people's names and addresses, it isn't inviting anyone go \"take whatever action they want\". It would still be very illegal for anyone to go to someone else's house and deny that person the right to sign a petition. But it may suggest that gay people introduce themselves and their children to opponents of gay rights so that they can see the faces of those they are harming.\n \n \nIf you support their right to privacy being invaded, then you certainly are advocating a right being taken away to get your own. There's no way around it. You may think it's worth it, but it's still preventing the rights of others to get your own.\n\n \n You're wrong. Privacy isn't a right. It's just a good idea.\n \n But it's true that I would deny someone else's privacy to allow same-sex marriage. In fact, I'd deny many people's privacy to allow same-sex marriage. But I wouldn't be doing it for me. I'd be doing it because the benefits of legalizing same-sex marriage are far greater than the harms (if there are any harms at all) of lessening the privacy of those signing a petition to strip same-sex marriage.\n \n \nThe petitions can't do that. Again, I think you are mistaken in your view of how these things work. It's a form of protest just like Cindy Sheehan's.\n\n \n You are wrong.\n \n \nNo. I see now what the problem is here. What I don't think you understand is that a legislator does not have to go by petitions or even ballots to make laws. The legislature can do that, but not a ballot itself, and certainly not a petition.\n\n \n Again, you are absolutely wrong. In Michigan, Propsal 2, the state amendment that I campaigned against for a year, never met a legislature. The legislature even voted it down when it was presented as a bill, and the governor said she would veto it.\n \n In Massachusetts, if the petition gets enough signatures, only 25 percent of the legislature would need to approve it, and the governor cannot veto it. Then it gets put on the vote card to see if the majority approves.\n \n \nWow. no--privacy certainly is indeed a right. At least SCOTUS thinks so.\n\n \n SCOTUS either misuses the word \"right\", or they present it as such for simplicity's sake. Or perhaps instead of \"right\", they actually did use a different term, but it was simply coined \"right to privacy\" by someone else. Regardless, the fact that it is not a right does not mean that it is not a good idea or that people might be harmed if their privacy is denied. It also doesn't mean that the Constitution cannot protect people's privacy.\n \n However, privacy is not actually a right because denying someone's privacy doesn't deny that person's freedom.\n \n \nHarassment in the true sense IS illegal. What you're talking about isn't really harassment.\n\n \n Hmm, is there a crime called harassment? Maybe if it gets out of hand or occurs on someone's else's property. But I believe I could follow someone around the super market calling him or her names all day without actually violating the law. Well, I bet the store would kick me out, though.\n \n \nIt would be hypocrisy, taking away the rights of others when you yourself demand rights.\n\n \n Did I not just explain this? This isn't hypocrisy at all. I absolutely support taking away people's rights when there is a good reason for it. I support denying murderers the right to murder because the right to life is far more beneficial to the people. In the same fashion, if denying a few people privacy on this petition would legalize same-sex marriage, then I would support doing that, for legalizing same-sex marriage is far more beneficial to the people.\n \n \nTo some gay people. It seems not all gay people take this as seriously as you do.\n\n \n Certainly not. But I just want you to understand why some might, why some people here become so angry with you.\n \n \nAny political issue can be taken passionately--take abortion for instance, which has been a MORE passionate issue than this one, many times, for many people. The problem is not a \"yea or nea\" thing about this issue (or any), but rather the interpretation.\n\n \n And if an issue is taken passionately enough, then might a supporter of that issue choose to disassociate with an opponent? If an opponent of abortion really believes abortion to be murder, then might an opponent of abortion choose not to associate with someone who believes in abortion?\n \n I just want you to see why gay people take the issue so passionately. They are the ones harmed by it.\n \n \nI refuse to take, at face value, your view that gay people are being harmed. To me, this is an issue of the institution of marriage being assualted, so my perspective is different.\n\n \n Yes, I understand your perspective. But how can you not accept that gay people are denied the same rights granted to you, and that this constitutes a harm? Surely you do not deny that heterosexuals are legally elevated above homosexuals.\n \n \nFor you to argue that it's about \"their marriage, their love, their children, and their families\" presuposes a premise that many don't hold to and ignores the other interpretations and perspectives on the issue. It's not a matter of us wanting harm to come to gay people and \"their children, and their families,\" it's a matter of seeing the issue differently.\n\n \n That may not be your motive, but that harm is caused whether you intend to cause it or not. And you know you are causing it. I can tell you that in the eyes of a gay person trying to protect his family, you haven't even provided the first indication that there might be a logical reason for causing that harm.\n \n You say you're \"protecting marriage\". Protecting it from what? Our families? Our love? Our children? And how can marriage, which is nothing more than a set of laws, need protection? It's not a person, it can't be harmed. It can be changed, certainly, but we're not changing the good parts of marriage; we're changing the one part that is unfair.\n \n So who are you protecting? Who is better off if same-sex couples aren't allowed to marry? You say you don't want marriage to change, but if a certain change to marriage leaves everyone better off, then why shouldn't we make that change?\n \n \nJust as with abortion, one group might see the issue as \"killing babies\" and \"murder\" and therefore are very passionate about it and call it harm. But the other side isn't for harm at all toward unborn babies--they just see the issue differently: that women should be able to have choice. That's the way issues are--the issue of gay rights isn't about whether we think gay people should be harmed or not. BOTH camps would say no to that. They just disagree on what that means.\n\n \n You're right that they see the issue differently. And obviously gay rights supporters and gay rights opponents see the issue differently. However, first of all, both camps on the issue of abortion bring up good points. They address real harms, or at least harms which are debatably real. If unborn fetuses should be considered humans, then it is certainly harmful to kill them. If they shouldn't, then it is harmful to deny a woman's right to use her body and reproductive material as she sees fit. And there's no real answer to the question of whether they should or not.\n \n But with gay rights, there are simply no good reasons to deny exact equality to gay couples. Assaulting/changing marriage in the fashion I suggest doesn't harm anyone, but it helps a lot of people. Who benefits by denying same-sex marriage? Not a soul.\n \n I understand that there's a big religion out there that doesn't believe in homosexuality. But that's all it comes down to: writing the majority religion into our laws. And that's harmful; we should not allow that. We should not deny the rights of same-sex couples for no purpose other than to encourage gay people to live according to the beliefs of someone else.\n \n Gay people shouldn't be punished for living by their own religion. And neither should their families. It may not be your intention to harm them, but that is what you are doing. And so long as you do it, gay people will have no easier a time liking you than a black trying to like KKK members who seek to deny his rights based on their religion.",

I still stand by my statement though that petition signers are simply participating in the democratic process, and so to take away that through whatever means would be wrong.\n\n \n Well, I disagree, as we do not live in a democracy. A democracy is a very poor system of goverment. We live in a representative democracy, and there are very good reasons that we live in one. But that's a different debate.\n \n The real point is that no one's right to sign that petition is being taken away, all that site is doing is showing gay people who it is that created the law to take away their rights.\n \n \nIt varies, from my understanding, from state to state, and depending on the type of harassment.

And your analogy relies on the premise that gay people are truly experiencing harm in a way that would make it justifiable to take away the rights of others. I certainly don't think that's the case.\n\n \n The issue is not whether I am physically able to take away someone else's rights, the issue is whether it is moral to do so. In a government which condones murder, am I morally justified in saving a life?\n \n Since no one else's rights are being taken away, whether gays are being denied more important rights is irrelevant.\n \n However, let's compare the right to same-sex marriage with the right to sign a petition making same-sex marriage illegal:\n \n The right to same-sex marriage: benefits same-sex couples and their children enormously, supports freedom and equality. Harms no one.\n \n The right to create a law banning same-sex marriage: harms same-sex couples and their children enormously. Benefits no one.\n \n Hmm, which one do I think is more important? I think you know what my answer will be.\n \n \nWell, again, that's YOUR opinion. There's a significant number of gay people who don't seem too concerned about it--obviously they don't feel they are being harmed much at all.\n\n \n Probably because they aren't planning on getting married.\n \n I have indeed presented my opinion, but I also presented reason backing my opinion. I have explained how denying same-sex marriage harms same-sex couples. I have spent even more time explaining how denying same-sex marriage benefits no one.\n \n In the face of this reasoning, you have not presented anything which suggests that I'm wrong, that denying same-sex marriage somehow helps someone, you've merely claimed that what I've said is my opinion. Of course that's true. But my opinion seems to be the one that makes sense.\n \n \nI certainly do not know that. But even if there is harm involved, it should be taken care of in a way that doesn't redefine marriage.\n\n \n The only way there can be no harm is if both groups have the same rights under the law. We can accomplish that if the legal recognition of both unions is called \"civil unions\" under the law. We won't have redefined marriage. But you will not accept that.\n \n But I only offer the above as a compromise in hopes that it is a solution which is mutually acceptable to both of us. In reality, you've stated no good reason to keep marriage as it is, to continue denying it to same-sex couples. Not a single person's life is made worse in any fashion if we legalize same-sex marriage.\n \n \nCulture. Society at large. Just like you'd be protecting gay people if there was a movement afoot to take away the phrase \"gay pride\" and apply it to everyone, and make it have nothing to do with gay people anymore. The gay rights movement would loose a valuable ideological idea.\n\n \n Come now. How many times I have explained that this wouldn't harm gay people at all? I'll gladly give up the term \"gay pride\". Heck, we can give up every gay-related word. We can make them apply to everyone. If we need to refer to gay pride, we'll just come up with a new name for it. It isn't a big deal. Not a single gay person would be harmed by changing the meaning of the term \"gay pride.\"\n \n And certainly, the idea would not vanish. We'd just call it something else. It really isn't a big deal at all. Do you really think that if we changed the meaning of \"gay pride\", people would just stop supporting gay rights? That they'd stop being proud to be gay? That the movement would die out? That's absurd, how could it?\n \n And even if marriage is somehow different, if somehow changing the word will destroy the meaning of marriage for heterosexuals, if somehow, somewhere a Christian marriage will have been rendered meaningless because homosexuals have access to the word \"marriage\", I have the solution! Let's recognize everyone's union under a legal different name of your choosing, but let's make that legal name the same for everyone. Your religion could then decide what a marriage is.\n \n So changing the word \"marriage\" completely and utterly harmless, not only will it destroy not a single ideal, nor harm anyone. But even if it weren't, that point is completely irrelevant because I have presented a perfectly plausible method of maintaining our current definition of the word \"marriage\" while still granting everyone equal rights. So where is the harm you speak of?\n \n \nAgain, nothing more than opinion from you. I think both sides present very good points.\n\n \n Then tell me what the good points on your side are. Tell me who benefits by denying same-sex marriage, and tell me how that benefit is so great that it warrants denying the same rights to homosexuals that you would grant yourself.",
