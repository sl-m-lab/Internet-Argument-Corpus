   "At the top of the Iraq debate thread, it was asked how do we know when someone wins? To answer that, and to keep the debates coherant, I, DSAdevil, self-proclaimed master of the judge pool, hereby proclaim:\n 1) 1st person posts 5 times, 2nd person 4 times (total of nine posts). So person #1 posts first and last. This is b/c the first speaker is at a significant disadvantage, so he should get the last word (trust me on this).\n 2) Last post (5 for #1 and 4 for #2) is a brief summary for the judges of why you won the round (what points you won, what key issues your opponent didnt refute, etc.).\n 3) At conclusion, judges will post their winner and a reason for decision.\n \n Hope that helps!",
