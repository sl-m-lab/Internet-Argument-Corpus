   "\n so how is establishing a democracy, even in EVERY state in the middle east, going to\n - reduce islamic fundamentalism\n - reduce hatred for america\n - help us to anticipate and combat unconventional attacks\n - eliminate a multinational network of criminals\n ????\n\n I think the short answer to these questions is that it isn't. Even assuming that democracies (as we understand them) can be established in the Middle East, I'm skeptical that such radical changes can be effected by any outside agency no matter how well-intentioned and powerful. In other words, we must hope that eventually (but perhaps not in our lifetime) democracy will take root indigenously in Iraq, Iran etc. Meantime, America should safeguard the homeland by taking extraordinary steps to ensure the danger from Islamic extremists is minimised. My own suggestions for doing this would be inflammatory.",

   "so what are the necessary actions (or proposals) that could fix these problems?\n \n Reducing islamic fundamentalism - this is a very rigid indoctrination that non-muslims are evil, and that the earth needs to be cleansed of them. not all muslims share this view, but they generally agree with the principle and desire to see the world subjected to islam. fundamentalists, however, believe that they must violently kill non-muslims as mandated by their version of their doctrine\n \n Reducing Hatred towards Amreica - Many middle east people, be they fundamentalists or not, feel very oppressed by the american military establishments, investments and other interests that require our presence on their territory. while they squandor in poverty, partly due to our interference (as well as europe), they have a very real contempt whenever americans can make a profit that they dont get a share of\n \n Anticipating unconventional attacks - our army's primary strength comes from its numbers, bravery, and fire-power. on a battlefield, there is no other force that can compare. however, the enemy is not meeting on an open field with uniformed troops and banners, but they are attacking innocent and unsuspecting civilians when we least expect it. no massive army armed to the teeth can intercept such attacks, unless they are sabotaged ahead of time through intelligence, or counteracted by unconventional methods of our own.\n \n Eliminating a multinational network of criminals - Al qaeda is already known to have bases in at least a dozen countries, and headquartered in afghanistan before they were chased out. we have not visited any other al qaeda-occupied countries, and as far as we can estimate, they are still all operational. not only that, but al qaeda is only part of an even larger network that spans even more countries, possibly even ours - the islamic jihad. this network is truly global, yet we have not begun to infiltrate and fight against it yet\n \n first of all, can we agree that these goals must be met to eliminate terrorism?\n \n and if so, what are the actions that we need to take to meet these goals?\n \n and what role does installing democracy play in achieving these goals?",

The second issue is US intervention in Islamic nations, using threats of aggression (and, in the case of Iraq, invasion), generally threatening Islamic security. The third was US military presence in Saudi Arabia, home to the holiest Islamic city Makkah. \n \n US military presence in Saudia Arabia has been removed at the demand of the Sauds, purportedly to reduce the treat of terrorist attacks against a major source of US sweet crude oil, ironic in that the Sauds are the major source of financing for world-wide Islamic fundamentalist teachings and worship. And rumored to be a major funding source for al Qaeda and other fundamentalist extremist groups who have taken positions against US foreign policy. \n \n With virtually unlimited US support of Israel's ME policies, their economy and our presence in Iraq looking like Korea, don't look for al Qaeda to reduce their hatred of the US anytime in the near future. Their next strike against the US isn't a matter of if, but when. Considering how well we're draining ourselves in Iraq and US political focus on how well our government is 'protecting' the citizenry, any future attack could well be a totally disastrous disruption of an economy dependent on consumer and government spending.\n \n As to the US resorting to intervention in any country suspected of harboring members of 'the axis of evil' or other nationalistic or international associations responding to our foreign policy with actual retaliation or instilling paranoia through threats, good luck. We've already bitten off more than we can chew in Iraq and additional intervention would make our creditors take a much closer look at us and possibly put oil prices at a level threatening rampant world economic inflation. But who knows, Iraq certainly showed how stupid we're capable of being when it comes to international policy.",

   "i have repeated the same question in posts 1, 3, 6 and 8, and without the slightest hint of an answer\n \n how will a democracy in iraq help eliminate terrorism?\n \n i think its a simple and straightforward question. for the last year or so bush has convinced the nation that his plan is to install a democracy in iraq, and thereby help eliminate terrorism. this may suffice many of his audience, but for me i cant see how it is related, even in theory.\n does anybody that understands this idea care to explain how it works?\n\n Nobody has given a straightforward answer to your question because there isn't one. Even if it is possible to install \"democracy\" in Iraq and I don't think it is for the reasons I gave in a previous posting (the Middle East has no history of evolving any institutions that we would recognise as democratic: the \"cultural soil\" there isn't fertile enough for such ideas to take root),then I still can see no logical link between installing democracy and eliminating terrorism.\n In any case, some so-called \"democratic states\" have supported terrorism in our time.",

US media fails to show the dead babies and US body bags because that sort of reality distracts viewers from their sponsorship products and puts politicians in a bad light (Vietnam). It's much easier to sell product showing victorious Marines killing 'terrorists', especially when public mentality has been herded to a point of everything in the ME other than Israel being a threat to democracy. The effectiveness of propoganda has been magnified by the use of TV as it makes public refocus a conditioned reflex. IMO it's going to take a real economic crunch to get the publics attention on anything other than what they're being told. Read Goering's statement on how simple it is to make any war 'right' when leaders put dissenters in the position of being unpatriotic. \n \n Humanitarian is the current spin on Iraq.

   "'you can't fight city hall' covers politics all the way up the line and includes the national level. Few Americans have any real interest about what goes on at any political level unless something affects them in a personal manner. As long as Joe Sixpack has his undisturbed TV, spectator sports and fast food, US troops could be invading Saudia Arabia with the government telling him gasoline 'could' become cheaper and he'd be frothing at the mouth to kill every Saudi man, woman and child. \n \n I'm in agreement with you that a normal chain of events leading to an inevitable economic crisis due to fiscal irresponsibility means nothing in our current circumstances. IMO the danger is holding our present course until AQ again strikes us.\n \n I firmly believe the current administration took us into Iraq as a desperate measure to pump up the economy, still reeling from 9/11, with drastic economic damage from that event still haunting us with continued problems in commercial airlines, travel and related industries. \n \n IMO that administration is going to continue our present course until AQ hits us again. When that happens, they'll again wave the flag and expand our ME presence with a general draft using additional debt to again rev up the economy. That'll again pacify Joe Sixpack and speed up AQ's plan to financially break us. \n \n Unless some miracle/disaster happens between Israel/Palestine, the real bone in AQ's throat carefully glossed over by the US Government, it looks like more of the same plan ahead. $100/bbl+ oil could make our economic situation change enough to get the attention of Joe Sixpack if he could no longer afford to commute to his job.
