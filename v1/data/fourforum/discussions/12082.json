   "Think Progress reports that Joe Wurzelbacher isn't a huge fan of the man who made him famous. He told conservative radio host Glenn Beck that he felt \"dirty\" after \"being on the campaign trail and seeing some of the things that take place.\"\n \n \"I honestly felt even more dirty after I had been on the campaign trail and seen some things that take place. It was scary, man,\" Wurzelbacher said. He told Beck he asked McCain \"some pretty direct questions\" about the bailout, and wasn't pleased with the response. \"They appalled me, absolutely. You know, I was angry. In fact, I wanted to get off the bus after I talked to him.\n \n Asked why he didn't leave McCain's campaign if he was \"appalled\" by the candidate, Wurzelbacher said, \"Honestly, because the thought of Barack Obama as president scares me even more.\"\n \n While Wurzelbacher was critical of McCain, he gushed about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. \"Sarah Palin is absolutely the real deal,\" he said.\n \n You know, I only got to spend a short amount of time with her but, you know, it was been asked if I felt any presence when I was with John McCain or Barack Obama. You know, with Sarah Palin, I don't want to say I felt a presence but she definitely had energy and she definitely went to work for American people, and it disgusts me on how often they try to bash her just for her sincerity. It's just, you know, she really wants to work for America and I mean, I wish people would listen to her and let them, and let her work for us. You know, she wants to serve us. She's not looking for power.Joe the Plumber: McCain \"Appalled Me,\" Made Me Feel \"Dirty\"\n I may not agree with McCain on a lot of \"the issues\", but this assessment of McCain is bad.\n And who the heck is Joe the Plumber to judge? He's delinquent on his taxes. He misrepresented himself in his question, claiming things about himself and that business he was referencing.\n \n And his comments on Palin? The fact that he so readily embraces the partisan member of that campaign is rather telling.\n If Palin wants to \"work for America\" so much, then why does she \"pal around with secessionists\"??? emoticon_rolleyes",

Besides, why is this being brought up again? Palin has been cleared. End of story. Heck even the email messages that were hacked didn't reveal a thing! As for the clothes why is it even an issue. It's not like this money is tax payer money. That would completely be another story. These clothes and money are strictly RNC. The Democratic Party spent millions in TV-ads, why should I complain about that? It's their money.",
