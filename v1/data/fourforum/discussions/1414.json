Who would have ever thought 9-11 would happen except possibly people we made our enemy.\n \n \n These terrorists used radical Islamic ideas to justify their murder of innocent people. \n\n \n They killed 3000 innocent people.

Do you consider this a war between Christians / Jews and Muslims? My question: Did the US have to take sides?\n \n \n Over the next years (if not eternity) terrorism will continue. We will face more casulaties. \n\n \n I was hoping we could get the Chinese involved in the Iraqi invasion. Maybe then they will be targeted too.
