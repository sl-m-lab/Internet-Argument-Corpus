   "What is the role of the university within Continental Europe? How powerful are corporations within Continental Europe? Are corporations more important than the individual human within Continental Europe?\n \n What about the United Kingdom? It seems to me that powerful corporations, particularly energy corporations, have played an important role in the foreign and domestic policy of Great Britain and the United Kingdom for several centuries now, witness the situation in the present-day Middle East.",

   "money=power in the UK. Recent events have shown that you can literally buy yourself a seat in the upper house of our parliament. Sure it's the less powerful of the two but it's still corruption. One the plus side it's more difficult to bribe your way into the lower house compared to some other countries, with restrictions on political advertising and campaign spending. Both main parties have but one question when the CBI and other big business representatives say jump, and that is \"how high?\". Universities are being prised open for big business to take advantage of, peaceful protest is being criminalised so that business leaders complicit in crimes against humanity don't have to hear dissenting voices (re: the George Fox 6 at my own university, www.georgefox6.co.uk ).",
