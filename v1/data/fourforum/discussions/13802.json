   "How can what is occurring on our southern border not be considered a mass invasion when these types of attacks are so common? I always wonder what prompts these scumbags to target a particular home like this one which was occupied by just a woman and her young son. Did they case this home in advance, know her previously, or was she just randomly targeted? Not that the answer to these questions make any difference at all, I'm just curious about their motivation for picking a particular home over all of the others on that street.",
