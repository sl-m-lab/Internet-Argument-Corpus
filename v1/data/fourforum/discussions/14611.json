   "Lady Gaga's Vogue Hommes Japan Meat Suit Offends PETA - Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV\n \n Right about now, one can only imagine how ripe that meat suit Lady Gaga donned for a cover shoot by Terry Richardson for Vogue Hommes Japan is getting. But PETA thought it stunk from the very beginning.\n \n The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals slammed Gaga for her latest sartorial head turner, in which she modeled a skimpy bikini made out of steaks, with another rib eye propped on her blond tresses for good measure.\n \n \"No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal,\" PETA president Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement. \"Meat represents bloody violence and suffering, so if that's the look they were going for, they achieved it.\"\n \n Newkirk told the New York Daily News that \"Lady Gaga's job is to do outlandish things, and this certainly qualifies as outlandish because meat is something you want to avoid putting on or in your body.\"\n \n\n \n I never thought she'd impress me this much. Congratulations, Lady GaGa! emoticon_smile",
