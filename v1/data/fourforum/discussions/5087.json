   "lol\n \n Definitely I want Bush to talk about gay marriage instead of how to ensure that several nuclear devices aren't shipped through US ports and then denotnated in several major US cities resulting in 50 million or more deaths. \n At least those damn gays won't be married when America, the world suffers the greatest loss of life ever. \n \n Anyways, politicans should be discussing gay marriage instead of how to proplerly fund America's school systems. Sure, our kids won't know the difference between their right hand and their left much less how to run a expirement of recombinating DNA, but those damn gays won't be married!\n \n Furthermore, I want our politicans to talk about gay marriage instead of how to fix medicare. Sure the country will have rampant inflation as the gov't prints more money to attempt to solve the problem, I'll be taxed at a 85% rate, I won;'t have any basic services such as good roads and safe drinking water, and the for all purposes, the country will be broke, but HELL, at least those gays won't be married!",

   "Hey Pat Robertson agrees; {as heard off camera, but on mic}\n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:\n (Off Camera) But, sir, you have described this in pretty, this whole battle is pretty apocalyptic terms. You've said that Liberals are engaged in an all-out assault on Christianity, that Democrats will appoint judges who don't share our Christian values and will dismantle Christian culture, and that the out-of-control judiciary, and this was in your last book \"Courting Disaster\" is the most serious threat America has faced in nearly 400 years of history, more serious than al Qaeda, more serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, more serious than the Civil War?\n \n PAT ROBERTSON:\n \n George, I really believe that. I think they are destroying the fabric that holds our nation together. There is an assault on marriage. There's an assault on human sexuality, as Judge Scalia said, they've taken sides in the culture war and on top of that if we have a democracy, the democratic processes should be that we can elect representatives who will share our point of view and vote those things into law.",

   "According to the reasoning of opponents of same-sex marriage, I find it difficult to understand why they could feel it an important issue in any way, shape or form. But perhaps they will surprise me. Lord Tammerlain has a reason it is important, for example.\n \n Using my reasoning, same-sex marriage every bit as important as national security. Our nation is one built on freedom and equality, one built on preserving the happiness of the people, or so I hoped. But we as a nation seem so interested in protecting our nation from intruders that we've forgotten what kind of nation we're trying to protect. If our nation isn't going to preserve the freedom and equality of its people, if our nation seeks tyranny over happiness, then why is it that we are trying to perpetuate this nation in the first place? We've heard that freedom is something worth fighting for, and worth dying for. I believe that's true. But democracy is not freedom, for democracy can be as tyrannical as any other form of government, and without incredible checks and balances, it will be the most tyrannical form of government. Legalizing same-sex marriage is freedom. Allowing people to live their lives without fear of punishment by the government is freedom. And if I'm going to work to protect our nation, I'm going to make sure that it is a good and moral nation I'm protecting.\n \n \nSodom and Gemmorrah(sp), fire and brimstone.\n \n Sodomy = male homosexual relations, fire and brimstone = nuclear strike.\n \n It is all written in the old testes'ment.\n\n \n According to the Old Testament, Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism), not because of homosexuality.

Being human of flesh and bone, you are choosing to live in accordance with the Democractic standard we as a nation have put forth as our form of Government. By choosing to remain a citizen of this nation, you are making a vow to continue that form of equality. \n What we are asked to do as men/women of good standing within God's laws to the living is that we must not attempt to destroy our form of Government but to honor its fairness and extend it to all citizens. \n \n I find it ironic that folks such as Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell, not sure which actually said it, who claim \"god has removed his sheild of protection from this nation\", when infact it's because (if it's true at all) of people like him (again, not sure which said it) who are attempting to destroy our nation of equality for a nation of fundamentalism and radical theocracy. These are our national traitors. Not those of us who work for the betterment of all citizens. \n \n \n \n \nAccording to the Old Testament, Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism), not because of homosexuality.

They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.",
