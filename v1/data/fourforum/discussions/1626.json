   "Would you support the idea of presidental political campaigns being financed by public financing alone?\n \n Would not this pretty much eliminate money in politics?\n\n \n \n I think that is a point that should be seriously considered, with some qualifications. The biggest potential downside that I see to public financing is having a potentailly low spending cap, thus limiting candidates ability to get their message out. Of course, this could be remidied with free airtime, newspaper adds, etc. So, in other words, I think that because one of the biggest problems that we face in elections is lack of knowlege from the voters, one would have to be careful not to promote this trend with regualations that would restrict candidates ability to disseminate their message.\n p.s. Thanks for starting a very interesting thread...",
