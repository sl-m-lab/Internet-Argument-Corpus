   "A renowned aider and abettor of international terrorists Mairbek Taramov who used to personally meet az-Zarkaui and sheik Omar and shelters himself behind the name of a journalist, is going to settle down in your county. He had to hastily leave Azerbajan where he had been living in a status of a refugee and had close connections with Azerbajanian criminals and had been nearly arrested. Inter alia, he also assumed substantial sums of money appropriated by Arab countries to make jihad in Chechnya. According to other information, Taramov fled from persecution of moslem militants for ripping-off money paid for the blood shed by their \"brothers-in-arms\". First, Taramov was planning to stay in London under the wing of his sidekick Akhmed Zakaev. But English authorities didn't have scruples for it because of his bloody work history and unsafe connections.\n \n So will Sweden be his home? Why, Swedish authorities do allow Chechen web site Kavkaz-Tsentr function in this country and openly advocate terrorism, anti-Semitism, hatred to Western way of life, democracy, Christian Values, etc. Actually, Taramov being a journalist also had his own web site located in Azerbajan.\n \n OK, now it is rather likely Sweden will give home to Mairbek Taramov. However, before that Swedish authorities will have to assume responsibility for every single word, call for terror, abuse of Christian ethics and xenophobia retorts on Taramov's site... Along with responsibility for the eventual terroristic act that might occur in old good Sweden made by Taramov supporters and those who happen to be acceptive of his slogans.\n \n P.S. Do you remember an incident with a number of women arrested on Finnish border that were illegally transported to Europe under the image of Chechen refugees to be sold down white slavery? Taramov was personally involved into this business and had a share of profit. That's another speaking episode that well characterizes the newly Swedish subject...",

The russian aggression in the area has made the whole issue rather grey-ish.\n \n \nSo will Sweden be his home? Why, Swedish authorities do allow Chechen web site Kavkaz-Tsentr function in this country and openly advocate terrorism, anti-Semitism, hatred to Western way of life, democracy, Christian Values, etc. Actually, Taramov being a journalist also had his own web site located in Azerbajan.\n\n \n it`s called \"Freedom of speach\". Allthough I guess that is an alien concept in the old USSR.. I mean russia ;)\n \n \nOK, now it is rather likely Sweden will give home to Mairbek Taramov. However, before that Swedish authorities will have to assume responsibility for every single word, call for terror, abuse of Christian ethics and xenophobia retorts on Taramov's site... Along with responsibility for the eventual terroristic act that might occur in old good Sweden made by Taramov supporters and those who happen to be acceptive of his slogans.\n\n \n Why on earth would Swedish authorities assume responsibility for the crazed ramblings of one of it`s refugees/citizens? That`s just insane....\n \n \nP.S. Do you remember an incident with a number of women arrested on Finnish border that were illegally transported to Europe under the image of Chechen refugees to be sold down white slavery? Taramov was personally involved into this business and had a share of profit. That's another speaking episode that well characterizes the newly Swedish subject...\n\n \n Actually I don`t. But then again, trafficking of eastern european women is such a common occurance these days that a few women hardly makes frontline news anymore...",

Any form of link or evidence? Maybe evening backing the statement up?\n \n Also, the more observant user might have realised that Sweden is part of the West, although reading a map is, I suppose, a bit of a tall order sometimes.\n \n -Wez",
