I mean its hard to imagine La Toya Jackson in training doing hand to hand combat and be on the receiving end of a taser. I laugh my XXX off seeing this happen to these celebs. You can watch them on the new reality series of CBS called Armed and Famous. Have you heard about this show?",

While surfing thru a commercial break the other day, I caught about 5 seconds worth of it...all I'll ever need. I think the only thing realistic about the whole thing is that they used real bimbos and got by real cheap on the production costs.\n \n \nI have heard of it, find out of work has-beens and film them with real cops. Won't last long.\nExactly! It's just about as silly as \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"Celebrity Jeopardy\"! No stars...no celebrities...just wannabeez, has-beens and pseudo-stars.\n \n I think I'd rather watch the Atlanta School Board Meetings or an Infomercial for BowFlex!",
