   "Wei Liu: Awakening People 6-To Stop the Warlike Stance of the Communist Regime\n \n September 22, 2007 \n \n \n Now in September 2007 once more the Chinese Communist regime says it wants to attack Taiwan, running a large military maneuver in a coastal province of mainland China, for the 23 million people of Taiwan is going to hold a universal vote in March 2008 to decide whether they want to join UN, which is regarded by it as a sign of independency of Taiwan. \n \n We know that from 1949 when the Nationals withdrew to Taiwan to 1971 when its membership in UN was replaced by the Chinese Communist regime, during the 22 years Taiwan had a membership in UN and was not regarded as its independency. Obviously, the Chinese Communist regime this time just found another excuse to strike Taiwan, which has the same race of Chinese and has democracy in which the mayor and the president are elected by the universal vote of the people. \n \n Contrary to the democracy in Taiwan, none of the official at any level of the Communist regime is elected by the people there. In fact, since the Communist regime came into power in China in 1949, it constantly shows its warlike stance toward Taiwan, especially in the three big occasions during the 23 million people of Taiwan voting to express their desire including choosing their president in 1996, in 2000 and in 2008. Thus, basically such warlike stance is a strike of the dictatorship upon the democratic world, including Taiwan, Japan and America, also don't forget the 1.3 billion Chinese people in China craving for democracy and equality. \n \n The warlike stance of the Communist regime makes us common people in China, people in Taiwan live in terror, and some people in America distracted. The democratic world, including America, just lets it go like that for over fifty years, which is a shame upon the democratic world. \n \n A war normally hurts both sides. Then why does the Communist regime do not care about it? Because it does not care how many Chinese people including the soldiers will be killed or injured in the war, and the only thing it really cares is its regime or power. Since Taiwan and America says they don't have the troops for landing in mainland China even after they defeat the attack of that regime, that regime sees there is no actual threat to it even if it loses the war. That's how it can assume the warlike stance toward the democratic world so often, because in its view, it gets nothing to lose. \n \n Taiwan and America see that mainland China has an area of 9.6 million square kilometers and 1.3 billion people, which makes them dismiss the thought of any attack there. Here they still regard China as one integral entity, with at least 20% or 30% people that want the Communist regime to stay in power, which is no longer true. Today in 2007, China is actually composed with two sides. One side is the robber. They are the bureau leaders of the Communist regime holding less than 0.1% of the whole population who takes away by force people's land bestowed by God for people to live, runs the forced economy, decides people's pay and people's expenses/merchandise prices and actually collects over 80% of people's income for tax. Today the bureau leader even without taking the money from his office gets about half a million U. S. dollars a year. The other side is the 1.3 billion Chinese people whose land are taken away, and whose income and expenses/merchandise prices are decided by the Communist government, and actually pay over 80% of their income for tax to it. Their average income is about 50 U. S. dollars a month, unable to solve the basic life needs like housing, school and medical care at all, living in the houses of their grandparents perpetually. In fact, the global warming is caused by the forced economy of that regime. People don't have any resources and have to work in those factories controlled by it to make a living. \n \n The opposition between the two sides becomes more and more open. In 1993, there were about 730,000 people protesting against that regime for economic issues. In 2006, there were about 8 million people doing so. Also, by September 2007, there has been 26 million Chinese people announced their withdrawing from the Communist Party or its affiliated organizations. Now there are already one billion people detesting the Communist Party or the Communist regime. It is widely shared among people that they just lack a gun to start an uprising. \n \n Bingo. We know what we democratic world can do to stop the constant warlike stance of that regime. The thing can be done by either Taiwan or America. We spread the flyer of calling the 1.3 billion Chinese to remove that regime including by the broadcasting and by the Internet. In the flyer, we include the paragraph of the two opposed sides mentioned above and two systems that becomes effective after the pro votes outnumbers the con votes on them during the universal votes of Chinese people. One is that the mayor, the governor and the president of China be elected by the universal vote of Chinese people. The other is that deducting the area of the desert, the iced area, the office and road occupied area of China, adding the area of the floor, the one billion adults in China draw a lot at the people elected government to have the portion of land bestowed by God for him to live, including the housing area, the commercial area and the arable, with every one having a total area of over 1,000 square meters for free. The land cannot be passed down to the offspring, but for people later reaching 18 years old to draw a lot to have it. There is no property tax. Through this way, all the Chinese people now and in the future can solve the basic life needs like housing and food. Chinese people should have great interest in these systems. The flyer should be in Chinese and is within one page, suitable to post or drop from the air. \n \n Now the scenario comes. When the Communist regime attacks Taiwan and gets defeated, which should mean its air force has been defeated in the several provinces near Taiwan. Then the air force of Taiwan or America flies into those battered areas of mainland China, and drop millions of the flyers and a million pistols. Having no military experiences, most Chinese people don't know how to use more complex weapons. Ten pistols is enough for us to take over a local Communist government in the group-villages level, a level below the county. Then we announce forming a new government and send the declaration all over the world, which will have big momentum to remove the Communist regime. \n \n We are not afraid of that regime using the large scale killing weapon like the atom bomb upon us, for if it does, that will show to the world its antihuman essence. Now there are over 100 million Chinese who have the digital cameras or cell phone that can take the pictures, the videos. Also its using of those weapons will make its present large amount of foreign enterprises, foreign trade disappear. Because who would go to do business in a country where there is explosion of atom bomb or chemical shells or biological shells? And who would import merchandise from there to his countrymen? Now in 2007, the foreign economy, including foreign trade occupies about 40% of the GDP of that Communist regime. Also, its using these weapons will make more Chinese people want to remove it. \n \n Once we get the pistols from the air, grasping the chance of that regime being defeated in the war, we take over some group-villages, announcing the forming of a new government to the world, and we move on to liberate more areas and more people. We don't know whether that Communist regime can stay in power. The regiment commander, the battalion commander and the lower rank soldiers in that regime should also be on our side, because they are on the side of the robbed too, though some of them are still deceived by that regime. \n \n The Chinese Communist regime getting that one million pistols during the dropping or by crushing down our uprising will not do it any good. It does not need more pistols at all. And the manufacturing a million pistols and dropping by air force after defeating the Communist attack upon Taiwan shouldn't be a problem for Taiwan or America at all. And I would guess the casualty of the air force for the operation should be less than a hundred. That's a feasible plan. \n \n (Several more English essays of me in democratizing China are in my blog http://www.boxun.com/hero/flake/ . At the end of the page, you click the Chinese sign right below the text, and then it will go to the next page. Also, the common Chinese people like me can come to this forum, and the Chinese communists can come here too. )\n \n In short, in the past fifty years, several generals in the Communist regime constantly scare us by their warlike stance for they get nothing to lose in term of the regime if they start the war. That is very unfair for the democratic world, including the 1.3 billion Chinese people in China. Think about that. It's like a guy who always threatens you and you can do nothing about it, and sometimes he gets advantage from you by doing so. This is just ridiculous. Now we hope Chen Shuibian, the president elected by Taiwan people, and George W. Bush, the president elected by American people, declare to the world that if the Chinese Communist regime starts the war, if it wins over the democratic world, it gets the regime of Taiwan; if it loses, Taiwan or America will take the above measures to counter it, which might let it lose its regime-the thing it fears the most. \n \n In this way, the game should change from extremely unfair to us to largely fair. It just takes President Chen Shuibian or President George W. Bush five minutes to make such a speech. Then we see whether that Communist regime will make its warlike stance as often as before.",
