   "Hi zachvac and Evan,\n \n I received your heads up PM in regard to the proposed debate, and am now back from vacation. I'd be happy to moderate the debate, though Evan has little experience here at 4Forums. This has led to problems in the past with formal debates, but I'm willing to try again. \n \n It sounds as though the usual parameters are in agreement. One week time limit between posts, 5/4 structure with the affirmative beginning and ending. The resolution's wording sounds fine. \n \n As far as judging goes, the three judges setup was like herding cats, it often wasn't working. My thought is to ask daewoo to more or less become our resident debate judge. We're not going to find a more objective way of scoring any debate, as he has proved by his previous work in that capacity. I'll PM him and get his reaction to the idea. Also, let me know of any objections or conflicts with this idea. Please be patient.",

   "Billsco sent me a PM asking me to judge and I agreed to do so. I want to make clear a few things.\n \n 1. Formal debate is NOT about who is right and who is wrong. It is about who has the best and most logical argument. \n \n 2. Any debate I judge will be judged on technical merit. My personal feelings on things are not an issue, so whether I have agreed with you in the past or not, don't count on any favors.\n \n 3. I am not going to weed out logical fallacies for you when I judge the debate. I have seen a lot of judges count points against a debater in the past (not here, just in general) for using a logical fallacy. This is not strictly in keeping with the rules of most debate tournaments. If your opponent uses a logical fallacy and you point it out, you get points. If your opponent uses a logical fallacy and you miss it (go off chasing a strawman), you get no points and they loose none. \n \n 4. A little on sources.\n \n When you cite a source, please do not simply cite the whole thing if it is an enormously long document. Simply link the page and C&P the portion of the text, or give the portion of the text, which you wish to introduce to the debate. The judges are bound to read EVERY bit of a source which you provide and consider it in light of the debate. If you simply cite \"US constitution\", that means I have to read the whole thing. If, on the other hand, you cite \"US constitution Article I Section I paragraph II\", that is all that has been introduced. Reminding you of this, not to use over broad sources, can help keep you out of trouble as well, because it ensures that you do not inadvertently shoot yourself in the foot. A good example of this can be found at http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7091&page=2 (read my judgment on that debate). Not picking on you, Billsco, it is just the only on board example I personally have been involved in :) \n \n I have been re-assessing the way I handle news articles posted as sources in formal online debates. Typically I have always treated news articles similarly to other document sources. Since news articles often present, or attempt to present, two sides of the story, I am considering changing that policy and only considering the portion of the posted news article. Otherwise each article would essentially require additional posting to deal with any ambiguities in the article if it is cited in whole. \n \n I will leave that up to either Billsco or the participants in the debate. It really doesn't matter to me, it just seems like it would be simpler for the contestants and not cause any real hardship. \n \n Beyond that, my debate judging criteria is a mix of National Debate Tournament, Cross Examination Debate Association, and Sally Shipleys (my high school debate coach at shawnee mission west) debate rules. They are modified because none of them were really geared toward Internet debates. \n \n \n If you guys can live with that, get to the debating! This should be an interesting one, and a challenging one to judge. I will warn you that since this is likely to require a lot of linear logic, I will be keeping a logic chart for each of you to ensure that your arguments do not require any great leaps of faith, so stick to linear logic.",

   "(Mods, feel free to split this into a new thread if necessary, but I feel it pertains to the above conversation about judging.)\n \n I would like to weigh in on the details of debates on this discussion board.\n \n I spend some time on Internet Infidels Discussion Board and am somewhat familiar with their formal debates method. Like here, IIDB has a forum for proposals/challenges and a forum for debates. However, instead of having judges, most debates are assigned \"Peanut Gallery\" where other people can weigh in on their impressions of the debate points and techniques. Instead of having a good debate end with the wham of a gavel and a declared winner, the Peanut Gallery usually provides the feedback that a judge would give, not to mention a continuing thread where the debators can respond to additional remarks not brought up by his or her debate opponent.\n \n I think there are pros and cons of IIDB's method. On the pro side, as mentioned above, the Peanut Gallery provides a thread in which many viewpoints and interpretations can be voiced. It arguably eliminates the need for a judge or panel of judges, who sometimes (though -- fortunately -- seemingly not badly on this board) can be biased. It also may mention points not addressed or recognized by debators.\n Appropriately, the cons are precisely the opposite. I can understand some debators not wanting feedback from the Peanut Gallery while the debate is in progress. Also, some might desire to have a judge or judges so that a winner will be declared outright.\n \n (On a personal note, I like having a judge to declare a winner, but I also like the idea of the Peanut Gallery for additional hubbub surrounding a debate. I don't know whether it is feasible to ask non-debating members to refrain from starting \"unauthorized\" discussion threads if the debators ask that a concurrent Peanut Gallery thread not be opened.)\n \n Since we're doing this judging shakeup, how about some feedback on these ideas?",

I wish to maintain that tradition here. I feel good about daewoo assuming the role on a more or less pemanent basis, and feel confident that impartial decisions and high standards will be realized.\n \n I looked at the Peanut Gallery at IIDB. The immediate purpose of such threads escaped me at first. There are the usual unhelpful comments about this debater being a XXXXX, that debater being always right, etc. But there are the other posts that analyze particular points which, if the participants were taking careful notes, could help strengthen their respective positions. We could say this would be a positive development.\n \n It's true that no one can enforce a policy of no comments by non-participants during an active debate. The question is: Should the moderator openly sanction it? I would be willing to try it if in its ideal state it helps raise the quality of the debate, and generates additional interest. \n \n It would seem to me that active participants not be allowed to post on such threads though.
