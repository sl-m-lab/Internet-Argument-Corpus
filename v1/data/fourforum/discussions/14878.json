   "I know there are people who infrequently blog here who live on a hatred and envy of others. Why is it, though, that they seem to only show up when a tragic event happens. Come, Simone, when you saw this story develop was the first thing that popped in your mind \"what a wonderful opportunity this is-I must hurry up and get on the blog site to get my hate on those who had nothing to do with it\"? \n \n Why do you look upon events like this only as an opportunity to hate on people? Do you really believe that I need to hear how omnipotent you are-that the FBI and local authorities can stop their investigation now because you already possess the facts necessary to confidently assign blame to everyone who you want to be guilty? \n \n Not a hint of compassion, Simone. No, this is all about you taking advantage of the tragedy to vent your hatred. Do you realize how petty and small-minded this is? Are you so consumed by hatred of gun owners that compassion for the innocent can find no hold in your conscience?\n \n Everyone needs to slow down. The investigation will not keep pace with minds that are impatient to put the blame on others. Why can't we all just take a break from hating on each other, recognize that innocent lives have been lost, that innocent people have been injured, and that they and their families don't have the luxury to sit at a computer right now eating chips and taking advantage of someone else's pain. Have some respect people.\n \n To address Sinjin's questions:\n \n I don't know whether the alleged shooter was ever treated for mental issues. If he was, though, it would still not show up on a background check unless he was involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment (unless Arizona has a much stricter reporting law than any other state I know of). \n \n The issue of mental health and background checks involves more than just gun rights, it involves privacy issues. Mental health treatment is no less confidential doctor-patient privileged information than any other medical procedure. This issue surfaced in the wake of the Va Tech shooting, and it is still unresolved. There is a great deal of resistance to requiring reports to the government of private mental health treatment that has not been ordered by a court. \n \n Everybody take a moment and pray for those impacted by this.",

   "I do have one question I cannot answer. Maybe someone can help me out.\n \n I wonder: Since the anti's are so eager to pounce on the firearm used in tragedies such as this, how does the thought process work?\n \n Are they happy that a firearm was used so that they can use it as some kind of twisted example of false logic in order to further their cause?\n \n Because, you know damned well that if a guy stabbed a bunch of people to death with a knife, they'd be dissappointed because they'd have nothing to base their anti-gun argument on.\n \n It's almost as if they can't grasp the concept of violence from any means other than a firearm. \n \n This creates a discrepancy: Since firearms are bad = killing with firearms is bad. This makes the murders with knives, bludgeons, poisons, vehicles, garrots, and all other inanimate objects morally better than a murder with a gun, right? \n \n After all, we hear commercials on the radio from Project Safe Neighborhoods and the Ad Council lamenting the vileness of \"gun crime\". Evidently, knife crime, baseball bat crime, and bare fist crime is nowhere near reprehensible as that evil \"gun crime\".\n \n So, the thousands upon thousands of folks killed in kitchens by angry spouses with a butcher knife is more acceptable? After all guns are bad. When it is a person with a knife, the person is bad, right? After all, we don't see a \"knife control\" forum on here. Where's the \"baseball bat control\" forum?\n \n Are you trying to tell me that guns are the only object that exists with their own inherent moral property?\n \n Otherwise, why are the people who bludgeon, strangle, stab, and poison people responsible for their actions......(Oh, they're just bad people.)\n \n ......but if those same people use a gun, it becomes the gun's fault. The person is slightly absolved in a slight manner. It's a gun crime. Those high capacity magazines did this! This wouldn't have happened if he wouldn't have had access to a gun! Evil guns! Why, the crime is a little more serious now that it's a gun crime!\n \n Four years ago, some guy in the next town over from mine killed his entire family by slitting their throats as they slept. \n \n Didn't see anyone clamoring for tighter knife laws. Nobody asked, \"Where did he get the knife he used?\". Was he legally allowed to posess a knife? Just exactly how many knives did this guy posess? Were they military \"assault knives\"? They had to be more evil than a normal knife since he had sharpened them beforehand. \n \n Come on, anti's! If your logic is true for one inanimate object, it's good for them all, right? \n \n Unless you want to argue that inanimate objects posess their own morality? \n \n Killing six family members with a kife = morally superior to killing six strangers in a shopping center with a gun?\n \n Of course. Had this guy went nuts with a knife and killed six people, it would just be a story about a nutcase.\n \n But then, simone wouldn't have been able to run to the computer with a smile.\n \n So, which is it? Are anti's happy when a firearm is used in a murder? After all, they can then dance with glee that fodder for their lame argument has been provided. Do killings with other tools disappoint? It would have to. Murders with other inanimate objects would tend to show that it is people, not the inanimate object used, that are to be the focus.....\n \n ...unless you create a seperate category for the morality of a lifeless, inanimate, object.",

   "Well Jason, this is my first time having a discussion with you so this should be very interesting.\n \n \nYour not a true Democrat. If you were you'd actually use your brain instead of giving us who do a bad rep. As for myself I am for gun rights but I am also for gun responsibility.\n\n \n First and foremost, while I do support responsibility, I feel that this is a dangerous standard to try and enforce. What one person defines as responsibility, another person can easily define as totalitarian and overbearing.\n \n Case in point, let's look at the Brady Campaign's statement after the initial ruling of Parker v DC. While it doesn't talk about responsibility specifically, I feel it's a good example to illustrate the point that everyone has a different take on what something is.\n \n Parker v. District of Columbia-- Brady Campaign Blog\n \n \"The decision in Parker, if upheld, could lead to all current and proposed firearms laws being called into question. This decision is wrong on the law, wrong on the history, and substitutes decision-making by elected officials with the preferences of a slim judicial majority.\"\n \n That's quite a position to be taking. In the pre-Heller era one could get away with a statement like that. But with context applied and what we know now, the Brady Campaign's argument was that DC's total handgun ban was the only right option to be had. They're a group that continues to talk about reasonable restrictions when it comes to gun laws, so their advocacy of DC's handgun ban, by default, could only mean that they feel it to be a reasonable restriction. And since they haven't renounced that opinion it's only safe to assume that they still feel that way; they just aren't vocalizing it.\n \n The problem with trying to normalize the idea of \"gun responsibility\" lies in first trying to define it in a manner that would be considered reasonable by the majority of people who it would apply to, while at the same time being enforceable in a practical manner so it amounts to more than a simple suggestion of what might be a good idea. If it's too strong then it's an unacceptable intrusion by government. If it's too weak it's useless in nature and had no justification in being passed in the first place.\n \n \nThe NRA and other organizations should promote safe gun handling, cleaning, maintenance, etc. if your going to exercise your right to carry a weapon such judgment and proper discretion must be paramount.\n\n \n While I do agree with the idea of promoting the safe handling of guns, I stop short of the notion (supported by some) that such should first be a requirement before one can legally exercise their constitutional rights in the first place. Such a notion goes back to the unconstitutional literacy tests that were used to prevent freed blacks from being able to vote in elections, which the Supreme Court found to be unconstitutional.\n \n Suggesting that someone must first prove themselves capable before they can legally enjoy a constitutional right relegates said right to the status of a government granted privilege, which enjoys no legal protection and can be revoked with little or no reason and leave the people with no legal recourse in response. It's a very dangerous precedent to be setting.\n \n \nI would also like to see somehow tougher screening for gun owners as in the case of this tragedy in Tuscon. I dunno if there could some how be some sort of mental evaluation done by some outside group or whatnot but seeing how so many crazies are getting access it would be nice to see proactive steps being taken to see that only responsible grounded individuals can own weapons.\n\n \n Oh there is so much wrong with this. But I'll try and get to it.\n \n Firstly, I already explained to Galileo about the issue of mental health. There's no evidence that Loughner was ever committed or adjudicated as mentally deficient, meaning there was no legal documentation that carried actual weight in the manner, so there was nothing for the system to catch. Even if he had been adjudicated it wouldn't have mattered if the state was incapable of forwarding his records and making them available for the NICS background check system. And even if he did have a record and it was in the system, and he had been legally barred from buying the Glock pistol that he used, there's no reason to believe that he wouldn't have been able to bypass the system entirely by simply hiring a friend to buy the gun for him and then turn right around and give it to him in a straw purchase; something that is both hard to detect and even harder to properly define.\n \n Secondly we come to the issue of just who would be considered qualified in making the determination about one's mental stability and health, concluding who's crazy, etc. Back around the time of the Virgina Tech Shooting, where there was talk about better record keeping for mental health records, the talk eventually turned to military veterans who were barred from owning a gun because they were ruled as mentally incompetent. More discussion on this subject eventually revealed that these rulings were not made by trained medical officials who were skilled in matters of mental health and psychological well being. These veterans were ruled as mentally incompetent for the most trivial of matters even though they were able to properly function in a peace time society. Now we're trying to correct that mistake and expunge their records so they can legally enjoy their rights again without fear of imprisonment.\n \n The ease of which such a system can be abused by so-called \"mental health experts\" is quite scary. I won't go into detail about the evils of such a standard right now, that's best saved for later.\n \n The third point is something that a lot of people miss. One doesn't have to be mentally ill to become a psychotic killer or go on a shooting spree. There's unfortunately no set profile or markers to indicate who will kill and who won't. High profile examples notwithstanding, there are too many examples where somebody without any sign of serious mental illness simply went and killed others for no recognizable reason. There's nothing to prevent one who is judged as mentally well balanced from later committing criminal acts at some point possibly years or decades down the line, long after they were green stamped as safe.\n \n One could try and suggest follow up evaluations as an option so gun owners are periodically re-certified as being safe and mentally well balanced and properly grounded, but that would have the potential to open up a can of worms to civil litigation on the basis of discriminatory practices, inconsistent standards of application, unfair observation, infringement on constitutionally recognized rights, etc. It's simply an impossible standard to try and implement.",
