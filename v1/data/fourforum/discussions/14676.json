   "Alright I want to start a new thread to begin keeping track of post-Heller/McDonald cases. I have easy access to all SCOTUS cases, cases from the 4th. Circuit, and cases from the State of Virginia. I offer this for information purposes. I invite others to post here when they hear about cases in other areas of the country. \n \n Regardless of where we stand, I think we can all agree that we need to understand how the Courts are applying Heller and McDonald.\n \n Cases citing McDonald:\n \n Jamerson v. Coleman-Adams Construction, Inc., 280 Va. ___ 091685, ___ S.E.2d ___ (9/16/2010)\n \n Not a 2nd. Amendment case. In this case the dissent cites to Justice Thomas' dissent in McDonald to make a point about the judicial rule of Stare Decisis. This has no value for us other than to show someone on the Virginia Supreme Court is a fan of Thomas. \n \n This is a good example of how \"big\" cases like McDonald or Heller will sometimes be cited by future cases involving issues that have little to do with gun control. This is the only case I found citing McDonald so far in SCOTUS, the 4th. Circuit, or Virginia. Obviously, this will change with the passage of time....\n \n Cases citing Heller (other than McDonald) \n \n SCOTUS:\n \n Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. ___ 071529 (2009)\n \n 6th. Amendment right to counsel case. Not a 2nd. Amendment case. Only citation is in Breyer's dissent, in which he cites Stevens' dissent in Heller. I don't see this case having any impact on the RKBA. \n \n Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. ___ 071372, 10 (2009) \n \n Not a 2nd. Amendment case. Case deals with an appeal from Hawaii on the issue of whether a resolution passed by Congress that apologized for land seizure somehow granted private citizens the ability to sue to recover land. This case does have implications for how SCOTUS reads preambles, and in that context Heller is cited. Note that Alito wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court. The portion citing Heller:\n \n First, \"whereas\" clauses like those in the Apology Resolution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed on them. As we recently explained in a different context, \"where the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not have operative effect, such as 'whereas' clauses in federal legislation . . . , a court has no license to make it do what it was not designed to do.\" District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, ___, n. 3 (2008) (slip op., at 4, n. 3). See also Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, 132 U.S. 174, 188 (1889) (\"[A]s the preamble is no part of the act, and cannot enlarge or confer powers, nor control the words of the act, unless they are doubtful or ambiguous, the necessity of resorting to it to assist in ascertaining the true intent and meaning of the legislature is in itself fatal to the claim set up\").\n \n FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. ___ 07582 (2009) \n \n Not a 2nd. Amendment case. Only citation to Heller is in dicta within Justice Thomas' concurrence, and his citation has no impact on the RKBA. \n \n Cases within the 4th. Circuit: \n \n United States v. Caro, 597 F.3d 608 (4th Cir. 2010)\n \n 8th. Amendment case, not a 2nd. Amendment case. Dissenting judge citing Heller and argues it applies to his argument regarding the 8th. Amendment. I don't see this case having any impact on the RKBA.\n \n United States v. Holbrook, 613 F. Supp. 2d 745, 776 (W.D. Va. 2009) \n \n 2nd. Amendment case dealing with a defendant charged with possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Fact one-she possessed the firearm in her own bedroom. Fact two-she used that firearm to murder her husband in the bedroom. In addition to the murder offense she was prosecuted for the possession offense. She claimed Heller protected her firearm possession within her home. This case has a lengthy discussion of Heller:\n \n In June 2008, the Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia's ban on certain handgun possession as violative of the Second Amendment. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008). The Court ruled that \"the District's ban on handgun possession in the home . . . [and] its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense\" impermissibly burdened the defendant's personal right under the Second Amendment to bear arms. Id. at 2821-22. The Court expressly noted that the right to bear arms is \"not unlimited\" and that\n \n nothing in [the Heller] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n \n Id. at 2816-17. These \"presumptively lawful regulatory measures\" were identified \"only as examples,\" not as an exhaustive list. Id. at 2817 n. 26.\n \n In reliance on Heller, Holbrook filed an addendum to her \u00a7 2255 motion on July 18, 2008, stating that it was \"unconstitutional to prohibit [her] from possessing a firearm within her own home when she is neither a felon or deemed mentally ill.\" (Claim 10). The claim is unsupported. The Court in Heller expressly stated, in overturning the D.C. firearms ban, that other prohibitions on firearm possession by certain persons or in certain places remain \"presumptively lawful.\" Id. at 2817 n. 26. Thus, the Heller opinion itself does not \"cast doubt\" on the limitation on firearm possession set forth in \u00a7 922(g)(9), and Holbrook makes no other argument that her convictions are violative of the Second Amendment. I will deny Claim 10 accordingly.\n \n United States v. Skeens, 589 F. Supp. 2d 757, 758 (W.D. Va. 2008) \n \n Not a 2nd. Amendment case, but Heller is cited and discussed. The primary issue in this case was the appropriate sentence for a defendant who was a convicted felon and had several firearms in his home. The specific fact that involved Heller was how the court would treat his wife's firearm which she kept for home defense. The Court made a passing remark about this particular firearm, but in the end it held the sentence was supported by the other 47 firearms found in the home:\n \n In addition, of course, Mrs. Skeens kept a handgun next to their bed for personal protection, a purpose not considered under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(2). (sentencing guidelines-Bryan) Mrs. Skeens had a right protected by the Second Amendment to keep a handgun in her home for protection. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2817-19, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008). While the Second Amendment does not immunize the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, see id. at 2816-17, it does seem incongruous to sentence Mr. Skeens more harshly in part because of his wife's constitutionally-protected possession of a firearm. In light of the failure of proof that the other forty-seven firearms were possessed for collection purposes, I need not consider this handgun in determining that the defendant is not entitled to a reduced offense level.\n \n United States v. Masciandaro, 648 F. Supp. 2d 779, 786-794 (E.D. Va. 2009) \n \n 2nd. Amendment case. Defendant charged with possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle on national park property. Very lengthy discussion of Heller:\n \n \n B. Second Amendment Challenge\n \n Masciandaro next argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying his as-applied and facial Second Amendment challenges. More specifically, Masciandaro contends (i) that application of \u00a7 2.4(b) to him violates his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, as that right was announced by the Supreme Court in Heller; and (ii) that even assuming his as-applied challenge fails, \u00a7 2.4(b) is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. Where, as here, a party brings both as-applied and facial constitutional challenges, it is appropriate to determine first whether the law is constitutional as applied to the challenging party's conduct, and then only if the as-applied challenge fails, to determine whether it is necessary to consider the facial challenge. This is so \"for reasons relating both to the proper functioning of courts and to their efficiency,\" as addressing facial challenges unnecessarily \"would convert use of the overbreadth doctrine from a necessary means of vindicating the plaintiff's own right not to be bound by a statute that is unconstitutional into a means of mounting gratuitous wholesale attacks upon state and federal laws.\" Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 485, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 502-04, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985). In addition, \"the overbreadth question is ordinarily more difficult to resolve than the as-applied, since it requires . . . consideration of many more applications than those immediately before the court.\" Fox, 492 U.S. at 485, 109 S. Ct. 3028 (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)).8 Thus, Masciandaro's as-applied challenge is addressed first. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to summarize briefly Heller's narrow holding and dicta, in which the Supreme Court - for the first time - held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms in certain circumstances.\n \n (1) Heller's Holding\n \n The Second Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. II. Just over a year ago, the Supreme Court in Heller interpreted this language to \"guarantee [an] individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\" 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2797. Of course, Heller's holding was much narrower. More specifically, the Supreme Court in Heller addressed three District of Columbia weapons laws, which taken together \"totally ban[ned] handgun possession in the home\" and \"require[d] that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it [F. Supp. 2d 787] inoperable.\" Id. at 2817.9 Importantly, Heller involved an as-applied challenge to these provisions by a D.C. special police officer who sought an injunction ordering the District of Columbia to issue him a license to carry his handgun, operable and free of a trigger lock, in his home. In finding that the officer was entitled to the relief sought, the Supreme Court summarized its holding as follows:\n \n In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the District must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\n \n Id. at 2821-22 (emphasis added). Thus, Heller's narrow holding is explicitly limited to vindicating the Second Amendment \"right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" Id. at 2821 (emphasis added).\n \n Interestingly, Heller does not squarely address or decide the appropriate level of scrutiny to be applied to statutes and regulations subjected to Second Amendment challenges. Justice Scalia's majority opinion sidesteps this issue, noting that it is preferable to address it in the future on a case-by-case basis. See Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2821. Heller itself suggests that some elevated level of scrutiny - either strict scrutiny or some intermediate level of scrutiny - is appropriate, and the D.C. laws at issue in Heller failed under any such standard. Id. at 2817-18 and n. 27. Those lower courts to address Second Amendment challenges to statutes and regulations post-Heller have not been uniform in this respect; some have applied strict scrutiny,10 others have used intermediate scrutiny,11 and still others have formulated an \"undue burden\"-type approach similar to that used in the context of abortion regulations.12 In any event, it is reasonable to conclude from Heller that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when assessing the Second Amendment constitutionality of statutes and regulations.\n \n (2) Heller's Dicta\n \n Because Heller also \"represents [the Supreme] Court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment,\" Justice Scalia's majority opinion provides some guidance, in dicta, for future courts evaluating Second Amendment claims. Id. at 2821. In this regard, Heller's dicta is notable for [F. Supp. 2d 788] the degree to which it confirms the limited scope of the case's holding. For example, the majority opinion emphasizes that \"[l]ike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\" and is \"not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\" Id. at 2816. Thus, Heller recognizes (with approval) that \"the majority of 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues.\" Id. In addition, the majority opinion cautions that\n \n [a]lthough we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n \n Id. at 2816-17 (emphasis added). Moreover, Heller\"identif[ied] these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples\" that did \"not purport to be exhaustive.\" Id. at 2817 n. 26. Accordingly, although Heller does not preclude Second Amendment challenges to laws regulating firearm possession outside the home,13 Heller's dicta makes pellucidly clear that the Supreme Court's holding should not be read by lower courts as an invitation to invalidate the existing universe of public weapons regulations.14 With these as guiding principles, the analysis turns to Masciandaro's as-applied challenge.\n \n (3) As-Applied Challenge\n \n With respect to Masciandaro's as-applied challenge, the analysis properly begins with \u00a7 2.4(b)'s elements. This is so because where, as here, a defendant is convicted of a \"general\" charge that is \"framed in the words of the statute,\" a constitutional challenge to that conviction must focus on the statute's elements, as \"[c]onviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process.\" [F. Supp. 2d 789] Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 96, 60 S. Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940) (quoting De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 362, 57 S. Ct. 255, 81 L.Ed. 278 (1937)).15 Here, 2.4(b) required the government to prove essentially three elements, namely (i) that Masciandaro \"carr[ied] or possess[ed] a loaded weapon\"; (ii) that he did so \"in a motor vehicle\"; and (iii) that he did so on National Park land. \u00a7 2.4(b). Thus, the question presented is whether Masciandaro's conviction based on conduct satisfying these elements violates his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, as that right was elucidated by the Supreme Court; in Heller. Put differently, the question is whether Masciandaro has a Second Amendment right to carry a loaded firearm in his vehicle on National Park land.\n \n As a threshold matter, it is important to, observe that Heller's narrow holding does not reach or decide this issue. This is so because \u00a7 2.4(b), unlike the laws at issue in Heller, does not prohibit possession of a loaded firearm in the home; rather, \u00a7 2.4(b) prohibits carrying or possessing a loaded weapon in a motor vehicle on National Park land.16 Thus, it is necessary to determine whether \u00a7 2.4(b)'s application to Masciandaro's offense conduct withstands the appropriate level of elevated constitutional scrutiny - either strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or an \"undue burden\" analysis. In this respect, strict scrutiny requires that a statute or regulation \"be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest in order to survive\" a constitutional challenge. Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74, 91, 117 S. Ct. 1925, 138 L.Ed.2d 285 (1997). Intermediate scrutiny requires that the challenged statute or regulation \"be substantially related to an important governmental objective.\" Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S. Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988). Finally, a statute or regulation survives an \"undue burden\" analysis where it does not have the \"'purpose or effect [of] plac[ing] a substantial obstacle in the path'\" of the individual seeking to engage in constitutionally protected conduct. Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 146, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007) (quoting Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Penn. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 878, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992)).\n \n These principles, applied here, compel the conclusion that under any elevated level of constitutional scrutiny, Masciandaro's as-applied challenge must fail. First, the governmental interest furthered by \u00a7 2.4(b) - public safety in National Parks - is both important and compelling. In addition, \u00a7 2.4(b) is both narrowly tailored [F. Supp. 2d 790] and substantially related to furthering public safety in National Parks. In this respect, \u00a7 2.4(b) does not prohibit carrying or possessing a loaded firearm on National Park land outside motor vehicles, nor does \u00a7 2.4(b) prohibit carrying or possessing unloaded firearms in motor vehicles on National Park land. Rather, \u00a7 2.4(b) is limited to those individuals, like Masciandaro, who elect to carry or possess a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle, and who do so on National Park land. Moreover, given these limitations, it is clear that \u00a7 2.4(b) does not have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of Masciandaro's exercise of his Second Amendment right, as announced in Heller, \"to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2821. Accordingly, because \u00a7 2.4(b) plainly withstands any elevated level of scrutiny, Masciandaro's as-applied challenge must fail.\n \n In addition, Heller's list of \"presumptively lawful regulatory measures\" points persuasively to rejection of Masciandaro's as-applied challenge. Id. at 2817 n. 26. In this respect, Heller's dicta explicitly acknowledges that \"laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings\" do not violate the Second Amendment rights of those prosecuted under such laws. Id. at 2817 (emphasis added). Although Heller does not define \"sensitive places,\" the examples given - schools and government buildings - plainly suggest that motor vehicles on National Park land fall within any sensible definition of a \"sensitive place.\" Schools and government buildings are sensitive places because, unlike homes, they are public properties where large numbers of people, often strangers (and including children), congregate for recreational, educational, and expressive activities. Likewise, National Parks are public properties where large numbers of people, often strangers (and including children), congregate for recreational, educational, and expressive activities. Moreover, the locations within National Parks where motor vehicles travel - roads and parking lots - are even more sensitive, as roads and parking lots are extensively regulated thoroughfares frequented by large numbers of strangers, including children. Thus, unlike a home or other private property, where the \"need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute,\" the locations in National Parks where vehicles travel, like schools and government buildings, are sensitive places where the Second Amendment leaves the judgment of whether (and if so, how) to regulate firearms to the legislature, not the judiciary. Id. at 2817. Similarly, Heller's approval of concealed weapons bans provides further support for rejecting Masciandaro's as-applied challenge, as carrying a loaded weapon in a motor vehicle - an act which, by definition, is almost always outside the view of those nearby - presents the sort of compelling safety risk more adequately resolved by legislation than judicial ipse dixit.17\n \n Finally, the result reached here also finds support in the scant post-Heller case law addressing firearms regulations in \"sensitive places.\" For example, in Nordyke v. King, 563 F.3d 439 (9th Cir. 2009), a Ninth Circuit panel rejected a Second Amendment Heller challenge to a county ordinance broader than the regulation at issue in this case. More specifically, Nordyke held that an ordinance banning all possession of weapons or ammunition on [F. Supp. 2d 791] county property \"fits within the exception from the Second Amendment for 'sensitive places' that Heller recognized.\" Id. at 460. This is so, the Ninth Circuit panel explained, because county property includes many \"gathering places where high numbers of people might congregate\" and, like government building and schools, \"possessing firearms in such places risks harm to great numbers of defenseless people (e.g., children).\" Id. at 460, 459. Thus, the ordinance upheld in Nordyke did \"not meaningfully impede the ability of individuals to defend themselves in their homes with usable firearms, the core of the right as Heller analyzed it.\" Id. at 460.\n \n The same result should obtain here for essentially similar reasons. Significantly, \u00a7 2.4(b) is more narrowly framed than the ordinance at issue in Nordyke; \u00a7 2.4(b) does not prohibit all possession of firearms and ammunition on National Park land, but rather limits the prohibition at issue to carrying or possessing loaded firearms in motor vehicles. Thus, if the county ordinance at issue in Nordyke is constitutional under the Second Amendment, the constitutionality of \u00a7 2.4(b) follows a fortiori.18 Accordingly, Masciandaro's \u00a7 2.4(b) conviction, which rested on proof that he possessed a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle and on National Park land, does not violate his Second Amendment rights.19 [F. Supp. 2d 792]\n \n (4) Facial Challenge\n \n Next, although Masciandaro's as-applied challenge fails, it is necessary to address his facial challenge. This is so because a facial challenge generally permits a \"defendant to attack a statute because of its effect on conduct other than the conduct for which defendant is being punished, thus protecting the right to engage in conduct not directly before the court.\" Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 586, 109 S. Ct. 2633, 105 L.Ed.2d 493 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing Brockett, 472 U.S. at 503, 105 S. Ct. 2794). The Supreme Court has recently recognized that there are generally two types of facial challenges to a law's constitutionality. First, a party ordinarily \"can only succeed in a facial challenge by 'establish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid,' i.e., that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.\" Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987)). In addition, the Supreme Court's \"cases recognize a second type of facial challenge in the First Amendment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad because a 'substantial number' of its applications are unconstitutional, 'judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" Id. at 1190 n. 6 (quoting New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769-71, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982)).20 Thus, the analysis turns to whether Maciandaro's Second Amendment facial challenge to \u00a7 2.4(b) succeeds under either type of facial challenge.\n \n First, it is pellucidly clear that Masciandaro has not \"establish[ed] that no set of circumstances exists under which\" \u00a7 2.4(b) would be valid. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095. In this respect, it is important to observe as a threshold matter that because, as discussed supra, the Second Amendment does not grant Masciandaro an absolute right to carry a loaded weapon in his vehicle on National Park land in all circumstances, it necessarily follows that \u00a7 2.4(b) has at least some constitutional applications. And where, as here, a law has at least some constitutional applications, a facial challenge to that law ordinarily succeeds only where the challenging party demonstrates that any unconstitutional applications of the law are not \"severable\" as a matter of statutory construction. This \"severability\" inquiry \"is largely a question of legislative intent, but the presumption is in favor of severability.\" Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 653, 104 S. Ct. 3262, 82 L.Ed.2d 487 (1984). Thus, absent a clear showing that the law's enacting body \"would not have enacted those provisions [or applications] which are within its power, independently of [those] which [are] not, the invalid part[s] may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\" Id. (internal quotations omitted).21 Masciandaro has made no such showing. Notably, the only applications of \u00a7 2.4(b) raised by Masciandaro [F. Supp. 2d 793] that are even arguably unconstitutional under Heller are (i) application of \u00a7 2.4(b) to a person legitimately using a motor vehicle as a home, or (ii) application of \u00a7 2.4(b) to a person who loads a firearm in a vehicle on National Park land for immediate and articulable self-defense purposes. Yet, even assuming, arguendo, that such applications might infringe on some hypothetical individual's Second Amendment right, narrowing constructions of \u00a7 2.4(b) could easily remedy any unconstitutionality.22 Accordingly, Masciandaro has not \"establish[ed] that no set of circumstances exists under which\" \u00a7 2.4(b) would be constitutionally valid and hence has failed to satisfy the first type of facial challenge. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095.\n \n Similarly, Masciandaro has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2.4(b) must be struck down on its face as unconstitutionally overbroad. First, it is debatable whether the facial \"overbreadth\" doctrine ever extends beyond the First Amendment context and, if it does, whether it is applicable to Second Amendment challenges.23 And even assuming, arguendo, that facial overbreadth challenges are permissible in the Second Amendment context,24 it appears more [F. Supp. 2d 794] doubtful still that such challenges are appropriate with respect to firearms laws not affecting the home.25 In any event, it is unnecessary here to decide whether (and under what circumstances) a facial overbreadth challenge may succeed on Second Amendment grounds, as Masciandaro has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating \"from actual fact that a substantial number of instances exist in which\" \u00a7 2.4(b) cannot be applied constitutionally. N.Y. State Club XXX'n Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 14, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (emphasis added).26 Indeed, Masciandaro's allegations of \u00a7 2.4(b)'s overbreadth are purely hypothetical and are unsupported by any showing that the alleged overbreadth is real, let alone substantial. Accordingly, Masciandaro's facial challenges must be rejected and the Magistrate Judge's ruling in that regard affirmed.\n \n Virginia Attorney General Opinions \n \n (When legal issues are unclear questions are posed in the abstract to the Attorney General's Office which then issues opinions that are not legally binding but are often cited in Virginia as good legal argument. Many courts rely upon the research and opinions expressed in these documents absent some clearer indication of the law.)\n \n Opinion of the Attorney General 2008 Va. AG 12, 13, 08-043, ___ (2008) \n \n Issue is whether the state parks department has general authority to regulate open carry on park land absent a specific grant of power in a statute. The AG opined that the department did not have that authority, and in a footnote cited Heller and argued that the 2nd. Amendment codified a \"pre-existing\" right):\n \n [I]It is my opinion that the Department of Conservation and Recreation has only such authority to restrict the open carrying of firearms which is expressly provided by law....A 2002 opinion of the Attorney General (the \"2002 Opinion\") concluded that the Department lacked authority to regulate or prohibit the general carrying of a concealed handgun by an individual with a valid permit. Further, the common law right to openly carry a firearm long has been recognized. (fn8)\n \n (fn8) \"it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment . . . codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it 'shall not be infringed.'\" Dist. of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 5268, *37 (June 26, 2008).\n \n Opinion of the Attorney General 2010 Va. AG S-10, 10-009 (2010) \n \n Issue is whether a private organization that leases public property for an event may bar people from carrying firearms at their event. AG opined that private organizations can do so even where the government cannot. Heller is cited in footnote 5 of this clip: \n \n The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitutions of Virginia and of the United States. St. George Tucker, a Virginian who authored the first commentary on the Constitution in 1803, described the right to bear arms as \"'the true palladium of liberty.'\" (fn5) Nevertheless, \"[l]ike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\" The right is \"not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\"\n \n As a general proposition, the Constitution acts as a restraint on government, not private actors. It is well established that private actors may do certain things on government property that the government itself could not do....\n \n (fn5) District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2805 (2008) (quoting 1 Blackstone's Commentaries, app. 300, Note D, \"View of the Constitution of the United States\" (1803)).\n \n From the 2nd. Amendment related lower court cases I have found so far, it looks like the lower courts are taking a broad reading of the Heller Court's comment: \"nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions....\"",

   "presentation. \n \n I have some interesting observations that may cast some light on the hypocrisy of some of the cases and the 'magistrates' rulings just to show how an agenda can become so ridiculous as to be void on it's own face.\n \n 1) Monsanto, the chemical/seed company is the new owner of Blackwater Xe.\n \n 2) Along the Texas border (as well as others) I do not see these 'magistrates' imposing their learned opinions on the gangs that are currently invading our Republic despite a clear mandate on the Federal Government to do so; neither are they taking \"the statute\" as settled law, they are perverting it and ignoring the real threat in order to punish citizens while attempting to give powers not delegated to 501 C (3) organizations and hired caretakers who would not have the guts to face anyone but a law abiding citizen which they have no authority to do.\n \n 3) the Federal government has basically ceeded the National Parks in Arizona to the Zetas and Gulf Cartel which are composed mainly of rogue federales and corrupt politicians and police with armed confrontations with our BP (ICE) at least 70 miles inside our borders. Meanwhile, Mexican helicopters fly within our airspace, both State and National Parks are barred from civilian use and the military is also prevented from any defensive action.\n \n 4) ICE, affiliated with the AFLCIO and other unions are being put at risk of their lives by policy changes in overtime and lack of resources and denial of the ability to do their jobs with illegal aliens. Federal Magistrates are denying deportations and largely ignoring federal law. There is no action regarding armed, heavily armed and vehicles from illicit use and murder on our side of the border.\n \n They make think they are making a show of persecuting American Citizens but the facts speak for themselves; I suppose they would like to keep their heads attached to their bodies? Making a mockery of our history and laws and persecuting/prosecuting American citizens while tanks are lined up on our Southern border facing our Nation brands these hypocrite 'magistrates' with words I wouldn't attempt to factually describe them.\n \n None-the-less, great topic idea and timely. I think McDonald is more apt than Heller BUT it seems that it can be more easily bent to the machinations of liberal 'magistrates' who know where their power and money flows...I hope they don't expect any help nor protection from me and I would be glad to drop them off to visit several towns along the Texas border :)\n \n Every one of those \"judges or magistrates\" (it is more apt to call them judges because they are ruling on these matters) and they carry guns in public places and the courtroom.

San Diego is one of several cases challenging sheriff misapplication of California's concealed handgun carry licensing statute. The case features Chuck Michel as lead attorney for plaintiffs. The case does not assert that California's statute requiring a license to carry a concealed handgun for protection is unconstitutional. Rather, the argument is simply that the statute specifies that licenses should be issued to qualified applicants (training, good moral character) who have \"good cause.\" Pursuant to Heller, lawful self-defense is not only good cause, it is the best possible cause. The case has already survived a motion to dismiss.\n \n Along with Prof. John Eastman, I filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Independence Institute, Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Doctors for Responsible Gun Owners, and the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence. The arguments are:\n \n I. The case can be decided without a standard of review, because near-total prohibition of a constitutional right is never constitutional.\n II. A \"reasonable\" regulation is one that does not eliminate the exercise of a right, but instead is narrowly tailored, is based on a significant government interest, and leaves ample alternatives.\n III. The state court cases approvingly cited in Heller expressly affirm the right to carry.\n IV. Twentieth century state courts decisions affirm the general right to carry for lawful self-defense.\n V.

   "I have mentioned this case before when it was at the district court level. Now the 4th. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled on it. The case is United States v. Masciandaro, ___ F.3d ___ 094839 (4th Cir. 2011) (decided 3/24/11)\n \n \n The facts, in summary, are these:\n \n On June 5, 2008, at about 10:00 a.m., United States Park [Slip. Op. 4] Police Sergeant Ken Fornshill, who was conducting a routine patrol of Daingerfield Island, near Alexandria, Virginia, observed a Toyota hatchback parked illegally. The vehicle was parked parallel to the side of the parking lot, in violation of the sign indicating \"Front End Parking Only.\" As Sgt. Fornshill approached the vehicle, he saw Masciandaro and his girlfriend sleeping inside and awoke them by tapping on the window. He asked Masciandaro for his driver's license, which Masciandaro produced from a messenger bag located in the vehicle's rear compartment. While Masciandaro was retrieving his license, Sgt. Fornshill noticed a large \"machete-type\" knife protruding from underneath the front seat, prompting him to ask Masciandaro whether there were any other weapons in the vehicle. When Masciandaro replied that he had a loaded handgun in the same bag, Sgt. Fornshill placed Masciandaro under arrest. Following a search, Fornshill uncovered a loaded 9mm Kahr semiautomatic pistol, and at the police station, Masciandaro produced an expired Virginia concealed weapon carry permit.\n \n Daingerfield Island, where Masciandaro was arrested, is not an island but an outcropping of land extending into the Potomac River near Alexandria. The area, which is managed by the National Park Service, is used for recreational purposes and includes a restaurant, marina, biking trail, wooded areas, and other public facilities.\n \n Masciandaro was charged with \"carrying or possessing a loaded weapon in a motor vehicle\" within national park areas, in violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4(b), and failing to comply with a traffic control device (the parking sign), in violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.12.\n \n Last year this same Circuit Court dealt with United States v. Chester, 628 F.3d 673, 677 (4th Cir. 2010), in which a man was convicted of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offence. The firearms in that case were found in his home. In that case, the Court held that although the RKBA issue raised touched upon the core of the right Heller described (self-defense in the home), the defendant fell outside any strict scrutiny analysis of his RKBA claim because Heller also described the right to be of \"law abiding citizens,\" and Chester's prior conviction placed him outside of that protected class.\n \n In this case, the issue was a \"law abiding citizen\" having a firearm for self-defense outside his home, in this instance a federal park. \n \n The Circuit first conducted a tour of Heller and McDonald in which it summarized as follows:\n \n The upshot of these landmark decisions is that there now exists a clearly-defined fundamental right to possess firearms for self-defense within the home. But a considerable degree of uncertainty remains as to the scope of that right beyond the home and the standards for determining whether and how the right can be burdened by governmental regulation.\n \n The Court then dealt with, and rejected, Masciandaro's request for strict scrutiny. Instead, the Court essentially limited the \"core RKBA\" to law abiding citizens for self defense within the home. Outside the home, this court says \"intermediate scrutiny\" should apply:\n \n In the case before us, Masciandaro was a law-abiding citizen at the time of his arrest, without any criminal record, whereas in Chester, the defendant was a domestic violence misdemeanant. On the other hand, Chester was in his home, where the core Heller right applies, whereas Masciandaro was in a public park. These different contexts might call for different judicial approaches. See United States v. Yancey, 621 F.3d 681, 683 (7th Cir. 2010). Indeed, as has been the experience under the First Amendment, we might expect that courts will employ different types of scrutiny in assessing burdens on Second Amendment rights, depending on the character of the Second Amendment question presented. Under such an approach, we would take into account the nature of a person's Second Amendment interest, the extent to which those interests are burdened by government regulation, and the strength of the government's justifications for the regulation. See United States v. Skoien, 587 F.3d 803, 809 (7th Cir. 2009), vacated, 614 F.3d 638 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), pet. for cert. filed, No. 10-7005 (U.S. Oct. 12, 2010). As we stated in Chester:\n \n The Second Amendment is no more susceptible to a one-size-fits-all standard of review than any other constitutional right. Gun-control regulations impose varying degrees of burden on Second Amendment rights, and individual assertions of the right will come in many forms. A severe burden on the core [Slip. Op. 22] Second Amendment right of armed self-defense should require strong justification. But less severe burdens on the right, laws that merely regulate rather than restrict, and laws that do not implicate the central self-defense concern of the Second Amendment, may be more easily justified.\n \n Chester, 628 F.3d at 682 (quoting Skoien, 587 F.3d at 813-14).\n \n As we observe that any law regulating the content of speech is subject to strict scrutiny, see, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), we assume that any law that would burden the \"fundamental,\" core right of self-defense in the home by a law-abiding citizen would be subject to strict scrutiny. But, as we move outside the home, firearm rights have always been more limited, because public safety interests often outweigh individual interests in self-defense. See Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2816 (noting that \"the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues\"). Since historical meaning enjoys a privileged interpretative role in the Second Amendment context, see id. at 2816; Skoien, 587 F.3d at 809, this longstanding out-of-the-home/in-the-home distinction bears directly on the level of scrutiny applicable. Indeed, one of the principal cases relied upon in Heller upheld a state concealed carry ban after applying review of a decidedly less-than-strict nature. See Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243, 249 (1846) (\"But a law which is merely intended to promote personal security, and to put down lawless aggression and violence, and to this end prohibits the wearing of certain weapons in such a manner as is calculated to exert an unhappy influence upon the moral feelings of the wearer, by making him less regardful of the personal security of others, does not come in collision with the Constitution\"). [Slip. Op. 23]\n \n Were we to require strict scrutiny in circumstances such as those presented here, we would likely foreclose an extraordinary number of regulatory measures, thus handcuffing lawmakers' ability to \"prevent[ ] armed mayhem\" in public places, see Skoien, 614 F.3d at 642, and depriving them of \"a variety of tools for combating that problem,\" Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2822. While we find the application of strict scrutiny important to protect the core right of the self-defense of a law-abiding citizen in his home (\"where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute,\" Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2817), we conclude that a lesser showing is necessary with respect to laws that burden the right to keep and bear arms outside of the home. Accordingly, we hold that 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4(b) will survive Masciandaro's as-applied challenge if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny - i.e., if the government can demonstrate that \u00a7 2.4(b) is reasonably adapted to a substantial governmental interest. See Chester, 628 F.3d at 683; cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (applying intermediate scrutiny to content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on speech); Bd. of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 477 (1989) (applying intermediate scrutiny to commercial speech in light of its \"subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values\").\n \n The Government also argued that the park was a \"sensitive place\" as described in Heller, and it further argued, in effect, that the \"sensitive place\" designation meant the government could have whatever firearm regulation it wanted and there should never be any standard of constitutional review (in effect making these parks what I would call \"constitution free zones\") The Court rejected this analysis while at the same time avoiding the question of whether the park was a Heller \"sensitive place\":\n \n \n The Supreme Court in Heller did state twice that the Second Amendment's right to bear arms was \"not unlimited.\" See 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2799, 2816. For example, it stated:\n \n Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. . . . Although we do not take an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on . . . laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.\n \n Id. at 2816-17 (emphasis added). Because of the relation between the first statement and the examples, one might conclude that a law prohibiting firearms in a sensitive place would fall beyond the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore would be subject to no further analysis. But the Court added a footnote to its language, calling these regulatory [Slip. Op. 26] measures \"presumptively lawful.\" Id. at 2817 n.26 (emphasis added). The Court's use of the word \"presumptively\" suggests that the articulation of sensitive places may not be a limitation on the scope of the Second Amendment, but rather on the analysis to be conducted with respect to the burden on that right.\n \n The arguments of counsel about the meaning of the \"sensitive places\" language raise difficult questions about the scope of the Second Amendment and the scrutiny to be given to government regulations in sensitive places. In Chester, we explained the ambiguity inherent in these questions:\n \n Having acknowledged that the scope of the Second Amendment is subject to historical limitations, the Court cautioned that Heller should not be read \"to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\" such as . . . \"laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.\" [Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct.] at 2816-17. Heller described its exemplary list of \"longstanding prohibitions\" as \"presumptively lawful regulatory measures,\" id. at 2817 n.26, without alluding to any historical evidence that the right to keep and bear arms did not extend to . . . the conduct prohibited by any of the listed gun regulations. It is unclear to us whether Heller was suggesting that \"longstanding prohibitions\" such as these were historically understood to be valid limitations on the right to bear arms or did not violate the Second Amendment for some other reason.\n \n Chester, 628 F.3d at 679. In Marzzarella, the Third Circuit labored over the same ambiguity:\n \n We recognize the phrase \"presumptively lawful\" could have different meanings under newly enunciated Second Amendment doctrine. On the one hand, [Slip. Op. 27] this language could be read to suggest the identified restrictions are presumptively lawful because they regulate conduct outside the scope of the Second Amendment. On the other hand, it may suggest the restrictions are presumptively lawful because they pass muster under any standard of scrutiny.\n \n Marzzarella, 614 F.3d at 91.\n \n We need not, however, resolve the ambiguity in the \"sensitive places\" language in this case, because even if Daingerfield Island is not a sensitive place, as Masciandaro argues, 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4(b) still passes constitutional muster under the intermediate scrutiny standard.\n \n Here, finally, is the review the court conducted under \"intermediate scrutiny.\" In my opinion, it is a prime example of how \"intermediate scrutiny\" really empowers judges to act (as Scalia has complained before) like a \"nine headed Caesar, giving a collective thumbs up or thumbs down to whatever outcome suits or offends their collective fancy\": \n \n In reaching this result, we conclude first that the government has a substantial interest in providing for the safety of individuals who visit and make use of the national parks, including Daingerfield Island. Although the government's interest need not be \"compelling\" under intermediate scrutiny, cases have sometimes described the government's interest in public safety in that fashion. See Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, 519 U.S. 357, 376 (1997) (referring to the \"significant governmental interest in public safety\"); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (commenting on the \"Federal Government's compelling interests in public safety\"). The government, after all, is invested with \"plenary power\" to protect the public from danger on federal lands under the Property Clause. See U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2 (giving Congress the power to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\"); Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482 U.S. 193, 201 (1987); Camfield v. United States, 167 U.S. 518, 525 (1897); see also United States v. Dorosan, 350 Fed. App'x 874, 875 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (noting that U.S. Postal Service is authorized under the Property Clause to [Slip. Op. 28] exclude firearms from its property); Volokh, Implementing the Right for Self-Defense, 56 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. at 1529-33. As the district court noted, Daingerfield Island is a national park area where large numbers of people, including children, congregate for recreation. See Masciandaro, 648 F. Supp. 2d at 790. Such circumstances justify reasonable measures to secure public safety.\n \n We also conclude that \u00a7 2.4(b)'s narrow prohibition is reasonably adapted to that substantial governmental interest. Under \u00a7 2.4(b), national parks patrons are prohibited from possessing loaded firearms, and only then within their motor vehicles. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4(b) (\"Carrying or possessing a loaded weapon in a motor vehicle, vessel, or other mode of transportation is prohibited\"). We have no occasion in this case to address a regulation of unloaded firearms. Loaded firearms are surely more dangerous than unloaded firearms, as they could fire accidentally or be fired before a potential victim has the opportunity to flee. The Secretary could have reasonably concluded that, when concealed within a motor vehicle, a loaded weapon becomes even more dangerous. In this respect, \u00a7 2.4(b) is analogous to the litany of state concealed carry prohibitions specifically identified as valid in Heller. See 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2816-17.\n \n By permitting park patrons to carry unloaded firearms within their vehicles, \u00a7 2.4(b) leaves largely intact the right to \"possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2797. While it is true that the need to load a firearm impinges on the need for armed self-defense, see Volokh, Implementing the Right for Self-Defense, 56 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. at 1518-19, intermediate scrutiny does not require that a regulation be the least intrusive means of achieving the relevant government objective, or that there be no burden whatsoever on the individual right in question. See United States v. Baker, 45 F.3d 837, 847 (4th Cir. 1995). Moreover, because the United States Park Police patrol Daingerfield Island, the Secretary [Slip. Op. 29] could conclude that the need for armed self-defense is less acute there than in the context of one's home.\n \n Accordingly, we hold that, on Masciandaro's as-applied challenge under the Second Amendment, \u00a7 2.4(b) satisfies the intermediate scrutiny standard.\n \n And so you can see how very little protection an \"intermediate scrutiny\" analysis offers our rights. I am particularly troubled by the last comment about armed police rendering the need to armed self defense less acute. It is in my opinion a poorly worded argument. This could easily be a justification for rendering the \"need for armed self-defense less acute\" everywhere, for is there a jurisdiction anywhere you go that is not at least nominally patrolled by an armed police force? SCOTUS, for example, has already implicitly rejected a claim that you don't need the RKBA in your home because a government official has concluded that periodic police patrols on the streets in your neighborhood render the need to defend yourself in your home \"less acute.\" I do not see how a park ranger driving through the parking lot makes the need for an individual means of self defense \"less acute\" than a police officer driving by your house. Therefore, I don't see how this argument can be squared with Heller. \n \n The biggest issue by far, however, is what I see to be a hardening of federal lower court opinions concluding that the RKBA in Heller only receives fundamental individual liberty status (and strict scrutiny analysis protection) inside the home. To me this treats a right in the Bill of Rights like a vampire-something strong indoors but which becomes weak when exposed to sunlight and fresh air. In my opinion this is a foolish (and dangerous) way to look at individual liberty.\n \n Finally, in this case two concurring justices believed the Court went too far in even discussing the issue because, in their opinion, the Court should not assume any RKBA exists at all outside the home unless and until they are satisfied (by what standard they do not make clear) that SCOTUS has told them so. They criticize even the discussion of \"intermediate scrutiny\" because, in their view, the mere discussion of it implies that the RKBA exists outside the home:\n \n We have no reason to expound on where the Heller right may or may not apply outside the home because, as Judge Niemeyer ably explains, intermediate scrutiny of any burden on the alleged right would plainly lead the court to uphold the National Park Service regulation....(T)he application of intermediate scrutiny in this case assume arguendo the existence of a right....(that is, an individual RKBA outside your home-Bryan)\n \n Sometimes saying a little less, rather than a little more, is a nice way to discharge our primary responsibility to the parties before us of deciding their case. At other times, of course, the need for clarity and guidance in future cases is paramount, but in this instance we believe the most respectful course is to await that guidance from the nation's highest court. \n \n There simply is no need in this litigation to break ground that our superiors have not tread. To the degree that we push [Slip. Op. 32] the right beyond what the Supreme Court in Heller declared to be its origin, we circumscribe the scope of popular governance, move the action into court, and encourage litigation in contexts we cannot foresee. This is serious business. We do not wish to be even minutely responsible for some unspeakably tragic act of mayhem because in the peace of our judicial chambers we miscalculated as to Second Amendment rights. It is not far-fetched to think the Heller Court wished to leave open the possibility that such a danger would rise exponentially as one moved the right from the home to the public square.\n \n Thoughts anyone?",

   "Here is a recent Virginia Supreme Court opinion concerning the RKBA. \n \n The case is DiGiacinto v. Rector and Visitors of GMU, 281 Va. 127, 127, 704 S.E.2d 365, ___ (2011) \n \n \n The Constitutional issue in the case was as follows:\n \n  Rudolph DiGiacinto filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Rector and Visitors of George Mason University (collectively GMU) in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. DiGiacinto petitioned the circuit court to enjoin GMU from enforcing 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 against him. The regulation provides as follows:\n \n Possession or carrying of any weapon by any person, except a police officer, is prohibited on university property in academic buildings, administrative office buildings, student residence buildings, dining facilities, or while attending sporting, [Page 131] entertainment or educational events. Entry upon the aforementioned university property in violation of this prohibition is expressly forbidden.\n \n 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20. DiGiacinto is not a student or employee of GMU, but he visits and utilizes the university's resources, including its libraries. He desires to exercise his right to carry a firearm not only onto the GMU campus but also into the buildings and at the events enumerated in 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20. DiGiacinto argued in his complaint that 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 violates his constitutional right to carry a firearm. \n \n DiGiacinto's argument that 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 violates Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution of Virginia and the Second and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution relies upon a primarily historical analysis. Describing 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 as \"effectually a total ban\" on the right to bear arms on GMU's campus, DiGiacinto [Page 133] argues that the regulation is not narrowly tailored and violates the historic understanding of the right to bear arms.\n \n GMU responds that the right to keep and bear arms is not an absolute right. It contends that, as recognized in Heller, the Second Amendment does not prevent the government from prohibiting firearms in sensitive places, which includes GMU's university buildings and widely attended university events. GMU further argues that 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 is narrowly tailored because it allows individuals to lawfully carry firearms on the open grounds of GMU's campus.\n \n The first issue resolved was that the Virginia Constitutional RKBA provision has the same effect as the 2nd. Amendment:\n \n The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. II.\n \n Like the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Virginia also protects the right to bear arms. It states:\n \n That a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state, therefore, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 13. The interpretation of Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution of Virginia is an issue of first impression. Whereas DiGiacinto contends that Article I, \u00a7 13 contains greater protections than afforded by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, GMU argues that, as relevant to this matter, the rights are co-extensive. We agree with GMU.\n \n [3-4] As noted by Professor Howard, the Virginia General Assembly incorporated the specific language of the Second Amendment - \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\" - into the existing framework of Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution of Virginia. 1 A.E. Dick Howard, Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia 273 (1974). As a result, the language in Article [Page 134] I, \u00a7 13 concerning the right to bear arms is \"substantially identical to the rights founded in the Second Amendment.\" Id. at 274.\n \n This Court has stated that provisions of the Constitution of Virginia that are substantively similar to those in the United States Constitution will be afforded the same meaning. See, e.g., Shivaee, 270 Va. at 119, 613 S.E.2d at 574 (\"due process protections afforded under the Constitution of Virginia are co-extensive with those of the federal constitution\"); Habel v. Industrial Development Authority, 241 Va. 96, 100, 400 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1991) (federal construction of the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment \"helpful and persuasive\" in construing the analogous state constitutional provision). We hold that the protection of the right to bear arms expressed in Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution of Virginia is co-extensive with the rights provided by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, concerning all issues in the instant case. Thus, for the purposes of this opinion, we analyze DiGiacinto's state constitutional rights and his federal constitutional rights concurrently.\n \n The above analysis does not surprise me because Virginia has a long history of cases that declare the individual rights in the Virginia Constitution are exactly equal to those in the federal Bill of Rights.\n \n Here is the (surprisingly short) constitutional analysis of the ban:\n \n  [5] The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry and possess handguns in the home for self-defense. Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2821-22; see also McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3020, 3050 (2010) (plurality opinion), 3059 (Thomas, J., concurring). Individual self-defense is \"the central component of the right itself.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2801. In McDonald, the Court further held that the Second Amendment applies to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment, 561 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3050 (plurality opinion), or the Privileges and Immunities Clause, id. at 3059 (Thomas, J., concurring).\n \n [6-7] The Supreme Court clearly stated in Heller, and a plurality of the Court reiterated in McDonald, that the right to carry a firearm is not unlimited. In Heller, the Supreme Court specifically recognized that\n \n nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [Page 135]\n \n Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2816-17. The Supreme Court further explained its assertion by noting, \"[w]e identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\" Id. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2817 n.26.\n \n The Supreme Court stated in McDonald:\n \n It is important to keep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not \"a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\" We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \"prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\" \"laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\" We repeat those assurances here.\n \n 561 U.S. at ___, 130 S.Ct. at 3047 (plurality opinion) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2816-17).\n \n Neither Heller nor McDonald casts doubt on laws or regulations restricting the carrying of firearms in sensitive places, such as schools and government buildings. Indeed, such restrictions are presumptively legal. Heller, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2817 n.26. In the instant case, GMU is a public educational institution and an agency of the Commonwealth. George Mason University v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 37, 654 S.E.2d 556, 558 (2008); see also Code \u00a7 23-14 (classifying GMU as an educational institution, public body and \"governmental instrumentalit[y] for the dissemination of education\"). The Commonwealth owns GMU's real estate and personal property. Code \u00a7 23-91.25.\n \n It was stipulated at trial that GMU has 30,000 students enrolled ranging from age 16 to senior citizens, and that over 350 members of the incoming freshman class would be under the age of 18. Also approximately 50,000 elementary and high school students attend summer camps at GMU and approximately 130 children attend the child study center preschool there. All of these individuals use [Page 136] GMU's buildings and attend events on campus. The fact that GMU is a school and that its buildings are owned by the government indicates that GMU is a \"sensitive place.\"\n \n Further, the statutory structure establishing GMU is indicative of the General Assembly's recognition that it is a sensitive place, and it is also consistent with the traditional understanding of a university. Unlike a public street or park, a university traditionally has not been open to the general public, \"but instead is an institute of higher learning that is devoted to its mission of public education.\" ACLU v. Mote, 423 F.3d 438, 444 (4th Cir. 2005). Moreover, parents who send their children to a university have a reasonable expectation that the university will maintain a campus free of foreseeable harm. See Schieszler v. Ferrum College, 236 F. Supp. 2d 602, 606-10 (W.D. Va. 2002); Hartman v. Bethany College, 778 F. Supp. 286, 291 (N.D. W. Va. 1991).\n \n \n [8] GMU promulgated 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 to restrict the possession or carrying of weapons in its facilities or at university events by individuals other than police officers. The regulation does not impose a total ban of weapons on campus. Rather, the regulation is tailored, restricting weapons only in those places where people congregate and are most vulnerable - inside campus buildings and at campus events. Individuals may still carry or possess weapons on the open grounds of GMU, and in other places on campus not enumerated in the regulation. We hold that GMU is a sensitive place and that 8 VAC \u00a7 35-60-20 is constitutional and does not violate Article I, \u00a7 13 of the [Page 137] Constitution of Virginia or the Second Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n \n I must say that in my opinion this is very poorly written. The opinion says, in effect, because it is not a \"total ban\" and it is a \"sensitive place\" the regulation converts the university into a \"constitutionally free zone\" at least as far as the 2nd. Amendment and Article I Section 13 are concerned. But there is no analysis here. \n \n The one thing the Court does not do at all is discuss how Heller and McDonald are expanded outside of the home. It may be assumed that the RKBA is not a home-bound hermit and survives contact with direct sunlight (which I would strongly argue for), but I would have liked to see some analysis of the issue. \n \n Additionally, while there is significant discussion of how the university qualifies as a Heller \"sensitive place,\" there is also no analysis of how the \"sensitive place\" designation ends the reach of either constitution. SCOTUS has not said these areas are beyond the scope of the individual RKBA. Rather, it says these regulations in \"sensitive\" areas are \"presumptively lawful\"-implying that although they may have some more favored status their orbits have not entirely escaped the gravity of the Constitution. But the Va. Supreme Court here strongly implies that location alone is the issue, thereby converting \"presumptively lawful\" into \"automatically lawful.\" There is no justification offered for this analysis. \n Which is all the more surprising to me to see the \"oh and by the way\" the law is not a \"total ban\" discussion, which appears thrown in as an afterthought. If the law, because of its location, is \"presumptively lawful,\" then why care whether it is a total ban or not? The \"total ban\" discussion would only become relevant if the Court believed the Constitution did actually apply to a university campus, and therefore the regulation must pass some scrutiny (strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, etc.). The \"not a total ban\" discussion smells almost like \"even if we are wrong about the location deciding everything the law still survives review because it is not a total ban like the one in Heller.\" \n \n But this argument defies reason. The plaintiff may very well ignore campus \"keep off the grass signs\" while exercising his RKBA, but the doors of the library and other campus buildings he uses are totally banned to him so long as he exercises his constitutional right, and yet the Court pretends this is not a total location based ban like the home ban in Heller? I would have rather seen a more honest admission that this is a total ban in buildings, but it survives because of the state's compelling state interest and the ban is a least restrictive means analysis. I am not saying that I agree the ban should survive (I may very well argue the contrary), but I would have liked to see the court apply a standard of review based upon constitutional principles rather than simply looking at a map and saying, in effect, \"the ban exists within a special constitutional free zone.\"\n \n Thoughts, anyone?",

   "\"special constitutional free zone.\" I like that. emoticon_smile Consider it stolen! emoticon_smile\n \n Short sighted? That don't hardly say it! That is a very nice way of saying Constitutionally dangerous, Constitutionally irresponsible, or Constitutionally stupid! \n \n The danger of rulings like these will come into play when the courts start using Stare Decises to rule on other Constitutional protections. In other words, Say hello to my little friend. \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n   FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. \n\n Someone needs to grab judges like these and give them a good shaking! Constitutionally speaking of course. \n \n Hey, I know, lets declare all schools and all government buildings, to include courts as \"special constitutional free zone.\" After all, the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on that either. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Lefties, you have to make your minds. Do you want Constitutional protections or not? In other words, \"Reasonable regulations.\" Not all that you want, and not incessantly demanding more and more, for your special interest HATE projects.",

   "I think much of the ambiguity also arises from how the Court has always viewed the limitation placed upon its power by the Constitution.

Heller was a good test case for the supporters of the individual RKBA because the question for the Court to answer was essentially framed as \"does a man have a right to have a firearm in his home for self-defense\" as opposed to some Brady Campaign inspired question of \"whether the safety needs of society justify laws that prevent this man from having a gun in his house.\" Thus, in my opinion, picking the right case to throw at SCOTUS really made a difference.\n \n The downside of this is SCOTUS is supposed to force the discussion to only be about things that must be resolved to answer the question presented. \n The entire discussion of \"presumptively lawful\" regulations in \"sensitive places\" had nothing to do with the case.

He knew full well that dicta or not, lower courts would use it for guidance. So, we end up with a half assed ruling that says we have a right, but they are not going to tell us what the right is, but they are going to spend a bunch of time telling us that certain other laws may or may not infringe on that right. \n \n So, since they refused to do their job the first time, the NRA and others who funded the case had to spend $3.5 million to bring McDonald to the supreme court....where they are pretty much forced to rule on whether it is a fundamental right or not. \n \n Point 2 in their decision:\n \n \n(2) Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. \n\n \n So, ruling that the right is fundamental would be an advisory ruling, but the above is not??",

   "Justice Breyer said in his dissenting opinion:\n \n \"The majority says that that Amendment protects those weapons 'typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.' Ante, at 53. This definition conveniently excludes machineguns, but permits handguns, which the majority describes as 'the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home.' Ante, at 57; see also ante, at 54-55. But what sense does this approach make? According to the majority's reasoning, if Congress and the States lift restrictions on the possession and use of machineguns, and people buy machineguns to protect their homes, the Court will have to reverse course and find that the Second Amendment does, in fact, protect the individual self-defense-related right to possess a machinegun. On the majority's reasoning, if tomorrow someone invents a particularly useful, highly dangerous self defense weapon, Congress and the States had better ban it immediately, for once it becomes popular Congress will no longer possess the constitutional authority to do so. In essence, the majority determines what regulations are permissible by looking to see what existing regulations permit. There is no basis for believing that the Framers intended such circular reasoning.\"\n\n \n Rights are not subject to a majority vote, this is a Constitutional Republic and not a democracy. \n \n Show me the enumerated power in Article 1 , Section 8 that gives Congress or the Courts to ban a right or portion of a right.\n \n Again, for the slow learners and deniers: machine guns have never been illegal to own.",

   "  Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n \n Aymette. \n \n Unlike Heller, which dealt with defense of the individual, and the issue of Individual Right, sooner or later the S.C. is going to have to deal with \"the ordinary military equipment, or equipment that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" emoticon_smile\n \n Aymette dealt with a concealed Bowie Knife or an Arkansas toothpick. \n \n   Aymette vs. The State. \n2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare.\n \n 3. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed. (Tither's comment. Concealed)\n \n The plaintiff in error was convicted in the Giles circuit court, for wearing a bowie knife concealed under his clothes, under the act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which provides, \"That if any person shall wear any bowie knife, or Arkansas tooth-pick, or other knife or weapon, that shall in form, shape or size resemble a bowie knife or Arkansas tooth-pick, under his clothes, or keep the same concealed about his person, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in a sum not less than two hundred dollars, and shall be imprisoned in the county jail, not less than three months and not more than six months.\"(p.156) ...\n \n (A lot of ... then we get to this.)\n \n We think there is a manifest distinction. In the nature of things, if they were not allowed to bear arms openly, they could not bear them in their defence of the State at all. To bear arms in defence of the State, is to employ them in war, as arms are usually employed by civilized nations. The arms, consisting of swords, muskets, (p.161)rifles, &c., must necessarily be borne openly; so that a prohibition to bear them openly, would be a denial of the right altogether. &#8230;.\n \n But a prohibition to wear a spear concealed in a cane, would in no degree circumscribe the right to bear arms in the defence of the State; for this weapon could in no degree contribute to its defence, and would be worse than useless in an army. And, if, as is above suggested, the wearing arms in defence of the citizens, is taken to mean, the common defence, the same observations apply. \n\n So like Ohio's Kline v Lis, we are dealing with the right of the legislature to make laws regarding Concealed weapons.\n \n Again please note that Scalea says that there is no Constitutionally protected right to concealed carry. \n \n But Open Carry definitely is! \n \n I say that The Fat Lady hasn't sung until this issue has been dealt with, which will be far more egregious to the Antis then Heller ever was. Or, could it be that it already has! If so, No Assault Weapons ban then. No clip ban either. emoticon_smile",

While the dicta portions of opinions are interesting to read, from a legal stand point they are pretty much worthless. \n \n Like most of the other gun control laws out there, this is probably going to have to go back to the supreme court. Unlike a lot of the laws, though, the ban on newly manufactured machine guns is almost certainly going to fail, and the NFA is likely to be heavily modified. \n \n The \"common use\" logic in Scalias heller decision is completely illogical. Machine guns, silencers, and short barreled shotguns were in common use before the government effectively banned them. You could order a machine guns and a silencer out of the sears catalog. Most hardware stores carried them. Shotgun pistols (mostly .410) were pretty much the go to gun for home defense. In order for the \"common use\" argument to actually work in a case, they would have to successfully argue that since the government banned them, thus making them uncommon, that it is OK for the government to ban them. It is completely nonsensical. That would be a ruling that made Dred Scott look well reasoned and intelligent.",

That research shows that in the past you've heavily relied on the misinformation of Miller to try and justify your claims. You beat this case particularly hard in this thread and were rebuked for your dishonest approach. http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12389-new-scotus-gun-case.html\n \n Let's consider some of the important facts regarding the Miller case. To begin with the matter arose when the defendant Miller was arrested for possessing an unregistered sawed off shotgun. Or more specifically a Stevens 311 double barreled shotgun with the barrel cut down below the legal minimum of 18 inches. Keep that fact in mind, it was a double barreled shotgun, a design that dates back centuries. A design that was eclipsed in 1887 with the introduction of the first repeating shotgun offered by Winchester, followed by the first well known pump action shotgun released in 1897 and onward. After these manual repeaters came into being the double barreled shotgun fell out of favor by all those that could afford to purchase repeaters.\n \n It only makes sense that a double barreled shotgun wouldn't be part of standard military equipment by the time of the Miller matter, there were far better designs available. Remington, Winchester, Ithaca, Browning and many others were making pump action shotguns that held more rounds of ammunition and could be reloaded much quicker. Had US V Miller been over the defendant's possession of a pump action shotgun, which obviously was part of the military's standard equipment list since they were used heavily in trench warfare in World War One, then it's logical to assume that the matter would have been decided far differently once it reached the Supreme Court.\n \n Keep in mind the ruling of the Supreme Court in this matter. \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.\"\n \n This means that no evidence for the defense was supplied for the Supreme Court to consider. The defense attorneys weren't present for the case, nor was the defense because Miller had been murdered at an earlier date. This was a case that was decided after the accused was rendered incapable of assisting in their own defense. In comparison terms this is like the defendants at Gitmo being forbidden from viewing the evidence against them because it's classified in nature. Had the matter been arrived at differently, such as Miller being alive to argue his case, or being supplied with legal representation at the hearing, and able to call witnesses that could readily supply equipment manifests of military arms suitable for defending the country then US V Miller very well could have resulted in the National Firearms Act of 1934 being ruled unconstitutional and done away with. The only reason this case turned out the way it did was because of the haphazard and unprofessional way it was handled.\n \n And now Galileo it's time for you to start answering questions. And I have quite a few questions for you to answer.\n \n First we begin with the standard of \"in common use\" that you cite. Is there a litmus test for determining if something qualifies as being \"in common use\" at any given time? Are there qualifications that have to be met? Does more than a certain percentage of the American people have to own something for it to be considered in common use, or does the military have to use it as part of its standard equipment to be considered in common use? How is the measure of common use determined and do we have any say in the matter? Are sales records taken into account when determining if something qualifies as being in common use?\n \n Next we come to the subject of dangerous and unusual weapons. To start with I have never tried to suggest that guns are anything BUT dangerous. I've always readily admitted that guns are dangerous and quite deadly in nature and need to be treated as such. I've always pointed out that they're quite capable of causing serious injury and killing outright if they're used improperly. As such I find this standard to be highly questionable. Can you point to any sort of weapon that would qualify as NOT being dangerous in some fashion? Is there some sort of gun that doesn't qualify as dangerous when compared to others? Maybe something that someone could argue should be exempt from background check requirements because it's not a dangerous weapon even though it's a real gun just like any other? Is there some type of gun that felons can freely own because it couldn't be considered as dangerous in nature?\n \n Then we come to the standard of unusual weapons. What constitutes as unusual in nature? Is there a litmus test for determining something as being of unusual nature? How is this standard reached? Over the last 111 years there have been an overwhelming number of designs and innovations that would seem radical compared to designs of previous decades and centuries. New alloys, new manufacturing techniques, new calibers, etc. The gun market is continually evolving and what used to be cutting edge last year is surpassed the next years. So how exactly do you define \"unusual\" without somehow wandering into the territory of supporting sweeping gun bans that would never pass constitutional muster?\n \n I now introduce into evidence a post you made on January 10th of this year in response to the Tuscon shooting and Jared Loughner's weapon of choice.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/421845-post6.html\n \n \n\"If Loughner had gone to the Safeway carrying a regular pistol, the kind most Americans think of when they think of the right to bear arms...\"\n\n \n You never did explain what you defined as a \"regular pistol\" in that thread. I asked you to clarify and you never did. Now you have the option to answer that question here this time around. The Glock series of pistol has been on the open market for 29 years now, available for purchase by various police and military organizations, to say nothing of the millions of private owners in the civilian market. How does that not qualify as a \"regular pistol\" in your eyes and those of everyone who you support and supposedly speak for by putting forth their opinions as your own?\n \n What does this have to do with the discussion of \"dangerous or unusual weapons\"? If you chose to not recognize a nearly three decades old gun design as possibly being a regular run of the mill firearm then one can't help but wonder what you'd choose to arbitrarily label as being unusual in nature.",

   " I am still not quite buying it. In the heller case, to \"find\" that an individual right exists, but fail to define the nature of that right (whether it is fundamental or not) was ridiculous. \n\n \n I believe SCOTUS should have declared the RKBA to be fundamental in Heller. \n \n \n He knew full well that dicta or not, lower courts would use it for guidance. \n\n \n Yes. I predicted this right after Heller was announced. Let me be a little clearer about dicta. This is exactly what it is used for, and all judges do it. It has absolutely no impact on the decision of the case, and it never even has to be discussed. But it cannot be ignored. It is without a doubt an attempt to advise the lower courts how to rule on future issues&#8212;only it takes the form of vague advice as opposed to a clear and binding command. The Court&#8217;s view of the &#8220;case or controversy&#8221; jurisdiction requirement is really more about making sure there is some issue that can be resolved in the case. Once you have that narrow issue that allows them to decide something, then the court can take a limited opportunity to pontificate about possible future issues that might come before it&#8212;limited in the sense that dicta is generally expected to be about questions which might be raised by the opinion itself. For example, Heller&#8217;s dicta is limited to how it should be viewed as impacting future RKBA issues. The opinion itself has to be limited to the narrow facts and issues raised, and for that reason there are many, many times we read an opinion and say &#8220;Okay, where we now go from here?&#8221; That is exactly what dicta is intended to do&#8212;give us some advice on how to apply this new opinion to other situations as we go forward. \n \n I don&#8217;t want people to think I am saying we should ignore dicta. Again, it has no impact on the actual ruling, and it is not a ruling that officially binds the court to do anything in the future. But the justices who say these things do not say them by accident, and they do not attach their names to it without strongly implying that it will guide them in future decisions (the alternative is to be reminded of what they said before and be accused of flip-flopping if they deviate from it.) So dicta can be a very important (sometimes even the most important) part of the opinion&#8212;particularly because the dicta can reach so much farther down the road than the narrow holding of the case. This is especially true if the makeup of the Court majority is either very large or very stable, and therefore allows the dicta to become a reliable predictor of how these future issues will ultimately be decided if brought before the Court. However, the Court&#8217;s history is littered with dicta that is later discarded because a new majority with a different view takes command of the Court and says &#8220;well you know what was said in that earlier case was just dicta and does not bind us in any way.&#8221; \n \n Kinda like Sotomayor saying &#8220;what I promised the Senate to make sure I got confirmed about respecting Heller as settled law was really just &#8216;dicta&#8217; and it does not bind me.&#8221; \n \n If you don&#8217;t like the dicta, then you belittle it as an advisory opinion. This is what dissenting justices do all the time. If you do like the dicta, then you refer to it as the justices in their wisdom providing necessary guidance for the lower courts to help them find the correct path forward from the ruling. It is unfortunately how the game is played. \n \n Heller is not, and never will be, viewed as a case which breaks from this tradition. I&#8217;m not advising that anyone ignore the dicta. Scalia and the justices that signed up with what he said would never put their names on it if they didn&#8217;t mean it, and more importantly if they don&#8217;t intend to bind themselves to it in future decisions. For that reason alone it is a vital part of the opinion. But, like so many who have come before them, the justices don&#8217;t want to bind themselves too much, and so they always choose to leave these future predictions vague enough to give them future wiggle room. \n \n The problem with dicta in Heller is the law is so new and unsettled that the lower courts are left without any other guidance, and the dicta itself is vague enough that the lower courts feel free to interpret it as they see fit and start building new bridges that SCOTUS may ultimately come in and declare go nowhere. And, as I have said, my criticism of the lower courts is the &#8220;when in doubt restrict the right&#8221; trend I am seeing.\n \n \n So, we end up with a half assed ruling that says we have a right, but they are not going to tell us what the right is, but they are going to spend a bunch of time telling us that certain other laws may or may not infringe on that right. \n\n \n I wouldn&#8217;t say half-assed, but Heller is a bit like a strip tease. The RKBA has been cloaked in judicial darkness for a long time. SCOTUS showed us the bare midriff and pointedly said there is more to come&#8212;although SCOTUS did say that none of our rights run around completely naked and the RKBA will ultimately be no different. The danger I see is the lower courts might see this latter announcement and decide the RKBA must remain more fully clothed with limitations than any other fundamental right. \n \n I&#8217;m just asking that since Cinderella has finally been invited to the ball as a fundamental right she should also be allowed to wear the proper dress. \n \n \n So, since they refused to do their job the first time, the NRA and others who funded the case had to spend $3.5 million to bring McDonald to the supreme court....where they are pretty much forced to rule on whether it is a fundamental right or not. \n\n \n Not sure I&#8217;d say refusing to do their job. My criticism with the dicta is because the law is so unsettled either say it with more clarity or don&#8217;t say it at all. McDonald had to happen, though. Even if Heller had declared the RKBA to be fundamental we still needed a state case that got us a ruling incorporating the RKBA.",

   "  Shot down: D.C. residents unable to register handguns \n The ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee says the D.C. government should step in to help residents of the nation's capital make legal gun purchases &#8211;something they can't do now,  even though the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the city's ban on handguns nearly three years ago. \n \n He says it's \"absolutely wrong\" that D.C. residents currently can't buy a gun legally and bring it home.\n\n \n   Currently, New Handguns Cannot Go To DC Homes \n WASHINGTON - Despite a landmark Supreme Court ruling, D.C. residents currently have no way to legally bring a new handgun into their homes.\n \n There are two sets of rules: one for long barreled weapons, and one for handguns. (Since there are no guns stores in D.C., all purchases must be made outside the District.) For rifles and shotguns, once the paperwork is complete, a D.C. resident can bring home his or her weapon. Federal law, however, requires that handgun purchases made across a state line require shipment to a \"federal firearms licensee\" (FFL).\n \n In D.C., there is only one such company: C.S. Exchange, Ltd., which, until about a month ago, operated in a second story office at 1213 Good Hope Rd., SE. No one is currently answering the door at that company. The owner declined an interview, but told WTOP radio (which first reported this story) that he is searching for a new location.\n \n Effectively, there is currently no legal way for a D.C. resident to bring home a new handgun.\n \n Question. Does the government HAVE to obey the law? Or am I just a slime ball for bringing it up?",
