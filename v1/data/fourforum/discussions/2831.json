   "sorry, but i don't notice these things unless they stay at the top of the list, then i forget about them after a few days, (and i understand if you don't care Kronus, thanks for letting me know, it'll help me for future posts, seriously)\n \n \nI don't know that he's communist, but he is honored by the North Vietnamese...just like Jane Fonda. (Remember how she handed the NV officials the notes that the American prisoners had placed in her hand?)\n\n \n Nope, wasn't born for a few years. (that probably totally discredits me emoticon_xclown ) Did that really happen? That's amazing. I honestly don't know what our real reasons for going into vietnam were, just like I don't know the real reasons we went into iraq. Despite that, there is no excuse for endangering the lives of POWs, if that actually happened. (and there's no excuse for the death of 50,000+ americans with no clear strategy for winning a war that seemed to have no purpose or end, but i was a baby when they were pulling out, so what do I know?)\n \n \nHe's got the backing of the terrorists because they know he's an appeaser and would never do anything to actually \"take them out\". He might send Edwards over with some invitations to have a sit down dinner and talk about a truce.\n\n \n Yup, there it is. I was waiting for something like that. How do you know what \"the terrorists\" want? Is that what you heard on Fox News? \n \n Maybe \"the terrorists\" want George Bush to stay president since he gives people so many reasons to hate america and recruit more into their folds.\n \n Maybe \"the terrorists\" want George Bush to stay president because he has the majority of our troops trying to keep peace in Iraq and not hunting them.\n \n And after the \"reporting for duty\" BS, i think it's clear that we'll be singing Who songs if he is elected (\"same as the old boss\"). Kerry stupidly was trying to answer Repub criticisms of him and was trying to appear tough on terror by acting all soldier-like and parading vets around the stage (that was sickening).",
