How is it that something always was..... I finally realized there are somethings in this life that are beyond comprehension and that infinite status is one of them\n \n \n God is a sacrifical and merciful spirit and from touching him I found him to be so Holy you just want to cry- not tears of saddness but of joy \n \n He was not stressed\n He is a spirtual being that is in the past, present and future\n \n \n I also found him to be life itself; exhibit a sense of humor; unpredictable except he won't tolerate sin( a constant) \n \n \n He is also a wonderful artist who can make his art live\n \n He is compassionate, peaceful, forgiving, and with a blissful burning love unlike humans\n \n He is worthy of praise, and worship, and honor.\n \n After feeling his heart I finally understood why the twenty and four elders bow and why the Saints die for the truth",

   "Great post Epaphras, even from my point of view...but didn't jesus die on the cross? Does jesus = god?\n\n \n Yes, Jesus died on the cross. He rose again. His sacrifice was deemed acceptable. His ressurrection is what shows that the sacrifice for all was acceptable. Jesus is God. \n \n The christian viewpoint is that God is three persons but one God. God the father, God the son, and God the Holy Spirit. All God, but all separate. A tough concept as it seems paradoxical. \n \n God the father sent God the son to be a propitiation for the sins of the world. He was crucified of his own free will. The christian perspective is that man is born with a sin nature because we were all \"present in adam\" and therefore participated in the first sin. The concept is like saying that even if it was me there then I would have done the same thing that Adam did.\n \n We lost our ability to choose God at that point. Man lived in a sin nature. However, Jesus made it so that we could once again choose. The question then arises as to how was it that old testament folks chose and were declared righteous (Abraham for instance)? The explanation is that the cross works both forward and backward in time. God is God after all and is \"outside of time\" for lack of a better phrase. Not completely accurate but difficult to put into words for full accuracy given the infinite nature of God. The sacrifice of Jesus was to give a choice. God never subverts a man's free choice. He simply gave us something that we had lost. \n \n God wants our love and devotion. He does not want our right behavior. He would like that but only if it comes from love. Love that is not freely chosen is not love, it is obligation.",

For example, if you were to know the whole truth of any murderer's life, you could find some justification in there actions or at least see why they did what they did. It might be that they were beaten as a child or were corrupted at an early age or had some mental anominally but there is most likely some reason. \n \n So, if we are truly god's children and he truly knows our motives and our reasons then why would some of us be sentenced to hell for eterninity? To teach us some lesson for our short lives? It seems rediculous to me. If there truly is a god, I'm doubting that the majority of us people are hellbound. Especially if we are to except Jesus into our hearts and only a good 30% of the world is raised Christian, what's that saying to devout muslims, bhudists, and all other religions that live good lifes?\n \n I think it's XXXX. It's fun to believe, if it helps you lead a better life than so be it, but to say that I'm going to hell for my logical justified beliefs and that you are promised an eternity of splender because of your illogical justified beliefs is a straight up lie. It was a way to gain power over ignorant people in the early days and still is today. \n \n The only thing that still offers some hope is the fact that normally this power corrupts everyone. Supposedly, Jesus remained true until his death, never broke his balls for nobody. He refrained from sin and although he could have taken advantage of the power at hand, he held strong. If he had been corrupted by the power he would have been forgotten with history and would have just been another power hungry religious leader. I do repect the man, if what is said about his life is true.\n \n However, to believe all the other things is to be ignorant.\n \n Ninja",

We don't have to make up stuff(our thoughts) when his creation is all around us, and is us. Exploration/ Study of him, and personal testimony of contact.( Absolutes)\n \n \n This is what I meant by saying \"stuff that makes no sense\".

   "Wow\n \n I have seen some very thought provoking arguments posted here, as well as a lot of hogwash.\n But it seems to me, for a question posed about who or what is god, the answers have all been pretty homogenous, that is, they all seem to be referring to the abrahamic religion's (christianity, judaism, islam) version of god. Whether they claim to know for a fact such a \"being\" exists, and \"his\" nature, or to the opposite.\n Oh, wait, there was the cosmic vapor thing, lol.\n But I have not yet seen one reference to any other possible definition of god. It's as if these three religions and none are the only that ever existed.\n Well... that's what I'm here for.\n Actually, a minority of the world's people beleive in this definition. Yes, christianity is the largest religion, next is Islam. but when you place these monotheistic religions next to other belief systems, you see that indeed, more people don't believe in God (as he has been defined here) than do.\n Religions such as Hinduism claim literally hundreds of deities, each with their own traits and powers.\n And buddhism contains the word god, as one of the ten realms (which I will elaborate on if need be) Simply put, a god is just another state of being that we all experience regularly, and it is not the highest.\n \n Below are the statistics I use to make these claims... copied directly from Adherents.com, which is a collection of over 41,000 adherent statistics and religious geography citations .\n \n I hope this might preclude the notion that one person's idea of god is correct, true, definite, ultimate...etc.\n \n \n (Sizes shown are approximate estimates, and are here mainly for the purpose of ordering the groups, not providing a definitive number. This list is sociological/statistical in perspective.) \n \n Christianity: 2 billion\n Islam: 1.3 billion\n Hinduism: 900 million\n Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist: 850 million\n Buddhism: 360 million\n Chinese traditional religion: 225 million\n primal-indigenous: 150 million\n African Traditional & Diasporic: 95 million\n Sikhism: 23 million\n Juche: 19 million\n Spiritism: 14 million\n Judaism: 14 million\n Baha'i: 6 million\n Jainism: 4 million\n Shinto: 4 million\n Cao Dai: 3 million\n Tenrikyo: 2.4 million\n Neo-Paganism: 1 million\n Unitarian-Universalism: 800 thousand\n Rastafarianism: 700 thousand\n Scientology: 600 thousand\n Zoroastrianism: 150 thousand",
