What makes these girls think that they should be doing this? \n \n Two teens face child pornography charges\n \n March 29, 2006\n \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. --Two teenage girls face child pornography charges after posting sexually explicit photographs of themselves on the Internet.\n \n The pornographic pictures of Elizabeth Muller, 19, of North Smithfield, and an unidentified 16-year-old Lincoln girl were discovered on MySpace.com, a social networking Web site, said a spokesman for the attorney general's office.\n \n The photos of the two teenagers together were posted on each of their respective Web site accounts, spokesman Michael Healey said.\n \n The 16-year-old was arraigned before a Family Court judge Monday on a charge of child pornography and violating a court-ordered curfew, Healey said. The girl is being held at the Rhode Island Training School pending a probable cause hearing Friday, he said.\n \n Muller was also charged with child pornography and was arraigned in District Court in Providence.\n \n A police officer assigned to Lincoln High School, where the girl was a student, discovered the photographs while monitoring the Web site.\n \n \u00a9 Copyright 2006 Associated Press.

We're punishing someone for showing the one thing that's always hers, her body. If she was forced to, that would be a crime, but as long as she was willing why prosecute her?",

   "If the girl is 19 how is it illegal? Are the photos from when she was under 18? Anyways I think it's silly to arrest someone for exploiting themselves.\n\n Probibly because the second girl involved is 16 and they were (unless I read it wrong) together in the photo. It could also be that myspace has a rule invovling photographs of a pornographic nature. (I don't really know much about myspace so don't quote me on that unless it's to confirm or correct that.)\n Now after reading the first post of this thread, I wonder 2 things...\n \nA police officer assigned to Lincoln High School, where the girl was a student, discovered the photographs while monitoring the Web site.\n\n What was the school's police officer doing checking out a site like myspace for?\n \nThe 16-year-old was arraigned before a Family Court judge Monday on a charge of child pornography and violating a court-ordered curfew, Healey said. The girl is being held at the Rhode Island Training School pending a probable cause hearing Friday, he said.\n \n\n Has the 16 year old gotten in this kind of trouble before? What's with that curfew that was violated?",

The police man was probably looking for stuff like that, not to get off to it, but to stop it.\n \n I don't think any body should be able to put sexually explicit pictures of themselves online if they were underage in the pictures. That would still be promoting sexual activity with underage people. Even though the person might be older now, the person getting off to it would still be looking at somebody underage.",
