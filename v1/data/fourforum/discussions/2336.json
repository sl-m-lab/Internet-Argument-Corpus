What a mess.\n \n I can't see it.[/QUOTE]\n \n I still view Islamic Law and Western Style Democracy as having way too many fundamental differences to co-exist as a method of governing a population consisting of three distinct sects of Muslims that constitute 95% of Iraq's population and are all normally at each other's throats without an iron fist to govern them. While our imposed puppet Iraqi government gives lip service to Bremer & Company, it has zero support among the clerics; ie the general population. As is common in many cultures, full agreement to even impossible circumstances and tasks, such as writing a constitution for democratic governing in Iraq that's approved by the US, is a normal way of life for that appointed government. We're still at the mercy of our domestic political face saving and those jockeying for power in Iraq as militant nationalists. We face a choice of sending in the storm troopers to quell all the violence with massive force, difficult with our current deployment of resources, and incur everlasting hatred from virtually all Muslims or getting out just like we did in Vietnam while letting Iran and Turkey eventually fill the void. Using that level of force will accelerate our domestic financial problems and possibly endanger our treasury issues, while a Vietnam style exit probably won't happen while Bush is running for office on his established platform. That leaves status quo, a true no win situation we have, once again, created in yet another country. He could surprise us, but I don't think Cheney will let his (Bush) thoughts develop along those lines. \n \n And the bad news is that no matter what happens in Iraq, we're still faced with non-affiliated Islamic extremist activity, 9/11 being an example, for our support of Israel's policies.",

The enemy doesn't fear us because we are TOO concerned about the enemy. I agree with what some others have said, this was humiliation, not torture. \n \n Remember that scene in The Patriot? Gibson killing the British who killed his son and mutilates the last guy. I may be barbaric, but I'd swim with orgasmic pleasure in the blood of anyone who harms my family.

Didn't take too long to surface.

They are not considered prisoners of war - so we don't have to held to the rules of the Geneva Convention. This is exactly why policy is in place to protect the civil liberties of EVERYONE.

   "I've gone through an ordeal during my military service in Iraq and Afghanistan as officer personnel of British military contingent there. Facing the truth I should say that I've seen a lot of horrible things by my own eyes. It was a real shock not only for me but for most of my pals. There were sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses of prisoners to soften them up for interrogation. The methods included threatening men with rape, assaulting prisoners with bloom handles and fluorescent light. Our soldiers had to put detainees to tortures using high-tension current and military dogs to terrify them. Thanks to God I didn't take part in such vicious mockeries. But I can't understand our government's response to reports of Qatar's al-Jazeera TV station. These abuses of Human Rights were not isolated incidents. I've seen many photos with similar incidents all over Iraq and Afghanistan. And Arab TV channel al-Jazeera simply describes the situation as it is and tries to be objective. It shows attacks of US troops on the densely-populated areas, it shows children and women killed by our missiles. Such horrified pictures are not broadcast on our TV network. It is no surprise that such stories don't receive the same level of coverage in our media. It seems to me that our powers are simply afraid of their real face, reflecting in war glass. It's a reflection of dictator, violating human rights in other countries. I'm sure it's time to bring our troops home, if Blair doesn't want the repetition of Spanish tragedy in Great Britain, as it is swarming with terrorists.",

Let's take a Christian Fundamentalist from the teen years up to whatever age. Assume he/she was raised from birth within a confined parental environment that adhered to only that sect's moral and mythological beliefs and true belief that Jesus is the center of the universe, with life dedicated to perpetuating that belief. This includes contemporary social adaptations such as equality of women, and all the other trappings of a western style democracy. \n \n Suddenly impose Islamic Law on that individual. While the individual isn't required to dismiss his/her belief system, all social aspects of life will conform to Islamic Law, many 180-degrees from a life of pursuing the values of Christianity. \n \n How many generations would be required for complete acceptance of the 'new' way of life by those males and females past the age of puberty in an entire country? Colonization efforts by past empires have shown it often takes centuries to remove instilled cultural values with total military dominance in place and more often than not the empires declined before even a partial transformation took place. \n \n Our efforts to instill a democracy in Iraq that would coexist with Islamic Law is basically a piece in our plan to deter formation of another superpower that might present an alternative to US foreign policies. Those educated Iraqis at the political level and most Iraqi Clerics are well aware that their country is a pawn in our political game, but with a vastly superior military force occupying their country most take the road of compliance and illusionary acceptance. There are those, our country called them patriots when freeing itself from England's colonization, that refuse to accept our dominance. Our government labels them terrorists, a definition rapidly accepted by most Americans thanks to official press releases and subsequent media spin.",

You've had a chance to really listen to this tape and get a sense who might be responsible, just by deciphering, say, accents. And certainly, there in the Arab world, they're very attuned to that. And given the fact of who this may or may not be, does that have some effect on how it is being played? \n NASR: Yes, and if you listen to these voices that we're hearing on Arab networks, Iraqis are condemning this execution. And they're saying these are foreigners. These are not Iraqis. They do not represent us and so forth. \n Now, of course, the original claim was that Zarqawi is the actual man who performed this execution. Our experts listened to the accent, as you said, and they determined the accent is not Jordanian...\n O'BRIEN: He is a Jordanian who is working supposedly, allegedly, at the behest of al Qaeda in Iraq. So go ahead. \n NASR: Right, he is very close to bin Laden, and works, you're right, as an agent of al Qaeda in Iraq. Now, the accent is not Jordanian so that takes the Jordanian element out of the story immediately. \n O'BRIEN: Interesting. All right, now one final thought here. You did a very careful translation of your own, of the statement. And in it, you see no reference to al Qaeda. And yet the official U.S. government translation does. Explain how that happened. \n NASR: Oh, I find it very interesting, because out of the blue, there is a mention of al Qaeda on the U.S. government translation. It says: \"Does al Qaeda need any further excuses?\" Any speaker of the Arabic language is going to notice a difference between the word al Qaeda, which means \"the base,\" and al qaed, which means \"the one sitting, doing nothing.\" \n\n \n link",
