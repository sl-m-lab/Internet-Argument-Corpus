   "Habbit,\n \n The diffrence between the US entering Afghanistan and Iraq is a subsantial one.\n Afghanistan quickly followed 9/11 so there was little oppostion to this, and the UN if I remember correctly didn't really have anything to say about it, until later or after we drove out the taliban. \n We also were able to make substantial Al queda arrests and plenty of connections.\n \n In Iraq this was 2 years after 9/11 and the majority of Americas rage was gone. \n The war was primarily based upon Weapons of Mass Destruction although lucky for Bush he did not call it operation : American Security. (lol)\n Bush told us time and time again that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that posed a great threat to the US. Colin Powell also informed the UN security counsel that there were some Al Queda links (as did bush) in Iraq. \n \n The US defied the UN nations security counsel. \n It has yet to find WMD which there have been various excuses for (I'll go over some of them later if you bring them up)\n There have been very little Al Queda arrests (maybe none) in Iraq. \n \n Although the US was able to get rid of a horrible dictator and free the Iraqi people, Bush did not do a very good job of justifying the war. \n \n I have alot more opinion on the subject but this is what I will leave for now.\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

(Joke, Although I'm pretty confident that we are / going to steal oil from Iraq)\n It would seem to me that atleast one person not loyal to Saddam would know something about the WMD.

   "So being aginst the Iraq war automatically make someone \"Anti-American\"?emoticon_frazzled \n \n George W. Bush said that Saddam was an \"immediate\" threat to the US, and has tons of WMDs ready to attack us at any moment. All the UN was asking was to wait till June, to make sure Saddam really did have WMD. We have attacked Iraq, and guess what? No WMDs! We found places that would have them, but they were empty. The closest thing we found was parts neccessary for the construction of nukes which would take at least 3 years. \n \n So was the ******* an immediate threat? nope, Bush lied.\n \n As for the liberation issue. Powell said so himself that this war wasn't for regime change, even though that would be a far better reason to enter Iraq, to free them from Saddam Hussein. At first this may sound good but think about it, was it really worth the deaths, destruction, disease, chaos, anarchy, bombings? At least 5000 civs died, most likely way more. They have to drink water with contaminated water, which leads to disease. Its not worth it. Dont forget the 100s billion dollars spent plus the bad economy.",
