   "NYTimes:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/nyregion/04cnd-yale.html\n \n April 4, 2007\n Three Yale Students Arrested for Burning a Flag\n By JOHN HOLUSHA\n Three Yale University students were arrested early Tuesday morning for burning an American flag on a pole attached to a house in New Haven, the Yale Daily News reported today.\n \n The three men, all of foreign origin, were charged with offenses ranging from reckless endangerment to arson and were held in jail Tuesday night after a judge refused to release them without bail.\n \n According to the newspaper, the New Haven police said the men - two freshmen and a senior - first attracted police attention at about 3 a.m. Tuesday when they asked two offcers for directions back to their residence. They were identified as Said Hyder Akbar, 23, Nikolaos Angelopoulos, 19, and Farhad Anklesaria, also 19.\n \n The two officers returned to the neighborhood shortly afterward and found the flag burning in front of a house. One officer pulled down the flag to keep the fire from spreading and the other tracked down the three men. The police said the men admitted to starting the blaze, the newspaper reported.\n \n Mr. Anklesaria was identified as a British subject and Mr. Angelopoulos as a citizen of Greece. Mr. Akbar was born in Pakistan and is a naturalized American citizen, the newspaper said.\n \n Mr. Akbar is the author of a published memoir, \"Come Back to Afghanistan,\" describing his experiences over three summers spent observing reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and acting as an informal translator for American forces there.",

   "I agree that, in this situation, they burned a flag that was not their property, which should be illegal. As for burning one's own US flag, I think it should be a perfectly legal expression of free speech. \n \n I think it is important to note that it seems to me that most of the time when people burn flags, they mean the flag to represent the US government, not the nation itself. It is anger at the actions of the US government which they are protesting. I would guess that part of the reason that some conservatives get so upset at flag burning is that they view it as a desecration of the symbol of the nation and that it is the nation itself that flagburners insult. I do not believe that to be the case. They wish to insult the government to protest its actions.",
