   "I saw this poem on a gaming forum that someone posted.\n And while being a supporter of the Troops and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (I support all evil everywhere), I thought to write a quick counter poem, that was promptly removed.\n \n Anyway:\n \n\n This poem appeared in the \"Sunday Post\" (a famous Scottish Sunday paper) last week, and I thought some of you might like to read it. It is doing the rounds of the military community and is supposed to have been written by a British soldier stationed overseas.\n \n T'was the night before Christmas, he lived all alone,\n In a one-bedroom house made of plaster and stone.\n I'd come down the chimney, with presents to give,\n And to see just who in this home did live.\n I looked all about, a strange sight I did see - \n No tinsel, no presents not even a tree.\n No stockings by mantle, just boots filled with sand,\n On the wall hung pictures of far distant lands.\n With medals and badges, awards of all kinds,\n A sobering thought came into my mind.\n For this house was different, it was so dark and dreary\n I found the home of a soldier, once I saw clearly.\n The soldier lay sleeping, silent, alone,\n Curled up on the floor, in this one-bedroom home.\n The face was so gentle, the room in disorder,\n Not how I pictured a Great British soldier.\n I realised the families that I saw this fine night,\n Owed their lives to these men who were willing to fight.\n Soon round the world, the children would play,\n And grown-ups would celebrate on Christmas Day.\n They all enjoyed freedom, each month of the year,\n Because of the soldiers like the one lying hear.\n I couldn't help wonder, how many lay alone,\n On a cold Christmas Eve in a land far from home.\n The very thought brought a large tear to my eye,\n I dropped to my knees, and started to cry.\n The soldier awakened, and I heard a rough voice,\n \"Santa, don't cry, this life is my choice.\n I battle for freedom, I don't ask for more,\n My life is my God, my country, my corps.\"\n The soldier rolled over, drifted to sleep,\n I couldn't control it, I just had to weep.\n It was so hard to leave on that cold dark night,\n This guardian of honour, so willing to fight.\n Then the soldier rolled over, and with voice soft and pure,\n Whispered, \"Carry on Santa, all is secure.\"\n One look at my watch, and I knew he was right.\n \"Merry Christmas my friend, and to all a good night.\"\n\n \n and my counter (done in about 10 mins while, once again, multi-tasking at work). Probably needs a lot of polishing.\n \n T'was the night before Christmas, it lived all alone,\n In the bombed out remnants that was once its home.\n I shifted through the rubble to seek what I could give\n some more presents to the things that still lived.\n When I looked all about, a familiar sight I did see\n A mangy ole orphan with a busted old knee.\n No stockings, no shoes and but three fingers on one hand\n A forgotten byproduct of this thrice ravaged land.\n With scabs and lice and parasites of all kinds,\n A selfish thought came into my expansive old mind.\n See, this house was different, it is not like my own\n It's the home of the defeated, beaten by bomb.\n The wasted remnants hide in fear all alone\n Curled up in debris in the devastated home.\n The face was so disfigured, the room in disorder,\n Not how I pictured one who was never a soldier.\n I realised the families that I saw this fine night,\n Profited off of this wretched ones terrible plight.\n On the other side of the world, the children would play,\n And grown-ups would celebrate on Christmas Day.\n They all enjoyed freedom, each month of the year,\n Bought with the resources taken with might and with fear.\n I couldn't help but wonder, how many lay alone,\n On a cold Christmas Eve in a land not quite my own.\n The very thought brought a twinkle to my eye,\n I rose to my feet, with a resignated sigh\n and the miscreant did utter with a rough, dirt clogged voice,\n \"Santa, tell me why, this life was not my choice.\n Why did you take and then ask us for more,\n Now my country is gone and my dad is a corpse.\"\n The strain was too much for that miserable creep\n And it feel down dead in a permanent heap.\n \"These last few items you'll no longer need.\" says I\n \"It's always the unwilling who are the first ones to die.\"\n Then I rolled the corpse rolled over, and rifled through pockets,\n Finding a gift for little Suzie in the guise of a locket.\n Removing the photos and polishing it bright.\n \"Oh and remember you heathen, that Might always makes Right.\"",

   "No Archy, the initial perversion was taking a poem about Santa and Christmas eve and writing a FICTIONAL account to blindly support patriotism and militarism...all nice things I support mind you.\n \n All I did was put the sock on the other shoe, \n which is something you mustn't do\n Or so I am told\n by grouchy party poopers\n and those who are old,\n heartless stale Christians\n who's souls all all sold\n to the prince of darkness\n and in the legends so bold\n who resides in black Loch Ness\n with sunken treasures of gold.\n \n But, come on Archy, What Would Jesus Buy?\n And would He find some way to cut costs by employing sweat shop labor? Or rape the world of natural resources for it? \n Come on Archy. Did you have a consumer driven Christmas?",

   "I care very much for the lives of innocents smiley. That is why I oppose radical islam, my very own original religion which I was born into. Because the radical elements don't value life at all. I have been told to my face by moslems that if it takes killing 10,000 faithful moslems while killing 50,000 infidels, that is ok with the radicals who are doing the killing because they are just sending the 10,000 moslems to paradise. Screw their hopes, dreams and lives. The important thing is the Jihad and converting the World to Allah. \n \n My question to you is how is that an acceptable scenario to you? How can you live a secure life knowing that this element of extremists are out there planning your complete destruction if you refuse to submit to their foreign, false and cultic god who doesn't want to save your soul but enslave your body through fear and intimidation into a forced submission to it for the rest of your natural life? \n \n You pacifists claim to be so concerned for orphans and victims of war, yet you think nothing of abandoning 24 million innocent Iraqi's back under the brutal control of a radical Islamic dictator who will kill anyone who cry's out for freedom of thought or a democratically elected Government. But somehow you ignore that part of the equation. The hundreds of mass graves that have been found, and the hundreds more that haven't from saddams regime. The childrens prison he had, the rape rooms and torture chambers. \n \n You all do so well in speaking about compassion for orphans as you back out of the War Zone with your butts protected and covered, while abandoning the victims you leave behind to lives of hopeless desperation. Then back here you can sit safely over drinks and feel good about yourselves because we aren't dropping any bombs on the bad guys so their is no chance at all that any innocents will ever get caught in the crossfire, All while neglecting to understand that neither are we there to protect the innocent from the evil that is indiscriminately killing them at will anyway. Complete and total cowardice and hypocrisy. But you are blind to it as long as you can feel good about not fighting the true enemies who seek your total submission or destruction, it really doesn't matter which way it goes.",
