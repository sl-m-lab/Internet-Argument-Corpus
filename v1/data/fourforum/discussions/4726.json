   "Steve Yuhas began writing a weekly column in 1998. As a freelance writer his work has appeared in some of the most read newspapers in America. His investigative pieces have sparked contentious debates nationwide and he has appeared on national radio and television. Appearing and arguing a point of view from a uniquely conservative perspective Yuhas has debated on such notable shows as Larry King Live, Fox News Channel, the CBS Early Show, and countless other national and local television and radio programs bringing common sense to sometimes complex debates. He began his days on the radio by guest hosting the Roger Hedgecock Radio Show after Roger, who regularly fills in as guest host for Rush Limbaugh, learned that he was fired from a gay newspaper for being a conservative.\n \n He began writing an opinion column in the longest continually distributed publication geared toward the gay community in the country. His columns sparked controversy because gay publications were not ready for the backlash from liberal gay activists when it was found that they employed a conservative. So much for the myth of tolerance from the gay community.\n Ultimately Steve was fired from the publication when wrote a column that hailed Ronald Reagan as an American hero and blasted gay activists and such things as bathhouses, gay marriage and adoption, and the drug and party scene that so many gays and lesbians have adopted as normal course. \n After being fired from the paper he received hundreds of letters asking where people could read him. The publisher realized he had made a mistake by firing the man who wrote a column that advertisers requested their ads be placed next to and that drew over 80% of letters to the editor. He was asked to return, but Yuhas had other plans.\n \n Starting with a free website and 100 hits a day; Yuhas' column is now read by tens of thousands of people every day. Published on multiple websites and linked on hundreds of websites his articles find their way into the email boxes of his distribution list of over 17,000 people every week.\n Steve's work is read by people around the world. People recognize him as a voice for the silent majority of gays who believe in equality through assimilation into the American culture instead of the \"in-your-face\" tactic taken by the activist left. He also believes that if given the opportunity, gays would have greater success in realizing their goal of equality if they allowed dissenting voices to be heard in their community and in the mainstream media. \n Steve's radio program is all over southern California on KOGO AM 600 out of San Diego. The 50,000 watt station allows people in San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles, Yuma, Arizona, northern Mexico and everywhere in between to listen to his views. Listeners from across the nation listen in on the program via the Internet and his shows appear on his website within hours of broadcast. Calls from all over America made to the station during the show and email to Steve and the station confirm that Steve is making a difference and that his style of broadcasting a common sense \"uniquely conservative\" message appeals to listeners across the USA and around the world. Despite the fact that gays have worked hard to silence him, including demanding the station, advertisers and the FCC take him off the air - Steve's listenership continues to expand and his newsletter is read by thousands. The stranglehold that liberal gay activists have on the media paints all gay people with a leftist brush, but there are social conservative gay people who believe in traditional American values and supporting them publicly; it is just much more difficult to read them because access to the media is limited to gays who run lock step with the liberal gay agenda.\n Steve Yuhas is a graduate of Saint John's University and was honorably discharged from the military. An observant Jew, Yuhas believes in the value of the individual and the value of human life and his although his background suggests a predisposition to a liberal ideology he has been compared with some of the most conservative thinkers of our day\n \n http://www.steveyuhas.com/#\n \n \n If you are gay and you condemn him for his views you prove my point.",

   "If you are gay and you condemn him for his views you prove my point.\n\n \n Well, I'm not quite certain what your point is. It appears that he condemns gay people for their viewpoints, certainly. The idea that he speaks for the silent majority of gay people seems very absurd. Not only does he appear to be opposed to all forms of gay rights, he appears to view homosexuality as immoral, his articles use untrue facts and disproven prejudices to claim that same-sex relationships are inferior to heterosexual relationships, and I noticed not a single word that indicates that he thinks homosexuals are anything but evil sinners who enjoy hurting others for their own benefit. Even take a look at his gay news heading: \n \n \"Extraordinarily Fabulous Outrageous Always Gorgeous You Go Girl! No wonder people think we're nuts Gay News!\" \n \n Could that title possible be more insulting? Could it possible promote more prejudices? Could it possibly be more biased? Could it possibly portray any less truths about homosexuals? \n \n Even his news exerpts are biased:\n \n \"Gays upset at church vandalism - that's funny since gays hate religious people, but here you go\"\n \n Gays hate religious people? Certainly not; if anything it is the other way around, but I would never even claim that religious people hate gay people. It just isn't true. \n \n Steve Yuhas is very biased, and his views lack any semblance of truth, or concern for the wellbeing of others, so far as I can tell. But I don't condemn him for that; I'm certain he intends to be a good person, just as we all do, but his words are both untrue and harmful to many.\n \n What I do condemn him for, however, is his website. The thing is complete trash. New windows pop up on half my clicks! And the page reloads itself when this happens! And it reloads itself with a bookmark to nowhere in the url (that's what that # in the url is). And when I click anywhere on the text underneath \"About Steve\", a new window just opens up! The same thing happens no where else on the site, and is certainly not a well-recognized commonality across the Internet. That is a violation of the number one rule of user interface design: never do something your user isn't expecting. And he's got this huge chunk of JavaScript code that is constantly running in the background in order to update the clock at the very top of the page which no one will ever use because we all already have a clock on our computer that we are accustomed to using, but hey, who cares if his website uses system resources on your computer for nothing? And the style sheet for the webpage is just hardcoded at the top of the page instead of existing as a seperate file, which basically removes 90% of the point of even using style sheets. It does look like he got a very capable graphics designer and website layout guy, but the programmer couldn't have charged more than six dollars for the entire site; more than likely I'm guessing the programmer did it for free. Come on; people judge you by your website, so don't leave it a mess.\n \n Uh, anyhow; I guess I'm not impressed with the link.",

Is there harm if children see porn? Is there harm if people walk around public nude? Is there harm if a minor engages in sex with a smaller adult than a larger 16 year old?

Does the minority? Does the majority? Or anyoen that can articulate a harm decide a behavior is bad? What standard of harm do we set?\n\n \n Certainly the people with the political power decide what is harmful and what is not, and in America, that power is indeed partially held by the majority. That is why I do my best to try to convince people that same-sex marriage is not harmful in any way, shape, nor form, and because of this, denying same-sex marriage violates equality, freedom, and the happiness of the people, and denying it is therefore evil. It is understandable that you support this evil though, for we are all falliable, and we will misjudge things sometimes. But it is your responsibility as a good person to recognize that you support evil and to change your ways. I want to show you why same-sex marriage is not harmful; I'm not claiming that we should redistribute political power so that the majority does not wield it.\n \n \nThere are differences in beliefs of that and the question is what is the best way a free society decides? Would a vote be the most appropriate?\n\n \n Now that you mention it; a vote is not the most appropriate way to decide this by any stretch of things. In fact, it's usually the absolute worst way to decide this. Our founders specifically did not grant the people the power to do anything by a vote except to elect people more qualified than themselves at making a decision. The vote of the majority almost always tends to oppress the minority, to force the minority to do what the majority wants, to destroy freedom and impose tyranny. There are two types of tyranny: there is tyranny of big government, but there is also the tyranny of the majority.\n \n To prevent this tyranny of the majority, our founders did not give the power to make these decisions directly to the people; they gave it to elected officials. These elected officials represent countless people. If you look back at debates between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the Anti-Federalists were arguing that we have too few elected officials and that they can't possibly represent the people. But the Federalists argued back that we don't want a represtative who just holds the beliefs of a single majority group, we want a representative who appeals to a variety of groups and who will try to do what is best for everyone. Because it is more difficult for one faction to achieve a majority if an elected official represents a large number of people as opposed to a small, we can best prevent the tyranny of the majority by making a representative represent a large number of people.\n \n Well, I probably didn't explain that very well, but you can see The Federalist Papers #9, #10, and #51 for a better explanation, if you're interested. The point is, however, that the decision is not at all best left up to the majority; it is best left up to representatives who are informed on the subject and who will take the welfare of all people into consideration, not just the welfare of the majority. A simple vote is mob rule by people who are often uninformed and which results almost always in the destruction of freedom. Before America was founded, most political theorists believed that a democracy could never work because of this, that a democracy could never preserve freedom or equality.\n \n As an additional note, I would even prefer that in cases of denying freedom and equality, at least a 2/3 majority should be required in a vote across those representatives, but that is another debate.",

It assumes that because AIDS is more prominant in homosexuals, gay sex causes the spread of AIDS.\n \n This is simply not true. The vast majority of people who engage in homosexual sex are at no risk of getting AIDS because they do not engage in homosexual sex in an unsafe and promiscuous fashion. That's right, they're at no risk, zero risk, none at all. The vast majority of gay sex is completely safe. It is only when people engage in unsafe sex that AIDS becomes an risk. And in that case, AIDS is a risk whether you are engaging in homosexual sex or not. This doesn't mean that homosexual sex doesn't have a greater likelihood of spreading AIDS in the case where individuals are having unsafe sex, but it does mean that most gay sex is harmless and it cannot be understood as the cause of harm; promiscuity is the cause of the harm.\n \n Let me use an analogy: eating uncooked meat can give you salmonella. In fact, that is the number one cause of salmonella. Am I therefore justified in saying that eating meat is harmful because it causes salmonella? Certainly not; it is very simple to determine whether or not meat has been cooked or not, and it is very easy to prevent oneself from eating salmonella-infected meat. The cause of the problem is not eating meat, it is eating uncooked meat, and the solution therefore should not discourage eating meat but eating uncooked meat. In the same light, a solution to AIDS should not discourage homosexuality, it should discourage unsafe homosexuality (well, unsafe sex of all forms). The real cause is unsafe sex.\n \n If you understand that, you can realize that although denying people access to same-sex marriage may seem to discourage homosexuality, it likely will not prevent anyone who would engage in unsafe sex from doing so. In fact, because homosexuals would not have the right to marry, they are probably more likely to engage in unsafe sex. Granting marriage promotes the idea of monogamy and starting a family, and it will likely decrease the amount of unsafe sex. So if one believes AIDS is caused by homosexuality, he comes to the conclusion that we should deny same-sex marriage, he is actually making the problem worse.
