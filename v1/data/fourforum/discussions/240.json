   "Weapons bans through history have never been about public safety. They have always been about control. If the recent weapons bans in UK, Canada, and Austraila are about public saftey, then it is a recent change in motive. I don't think that humans have evolved in the last 20 years for the motive behind weapons bans have changed.\n \n Some exaples of weapons bans:\n \n 1) Dark Age Europe. Only knights and nobility can own weapons. There is a total weapon ban on common people to maintain social order and control.\n \n 2) Feudal Japan. Same as above\n \n 3) Aparthied South Africia. No black South Africians are allowed to own firearms. Do I need to say more?\n \n 4) Easter Bloc Europe and Soviet Russia. People are shot in the head and burried in a secret ditch more easier if they are unarmed.\n \n 5) Tombstone Arizona and frontier america. The Earps ban firearms in the city. They don't want any competition for the protection racquet in the city. They collect protection from saloons, hookers, and gamblers.\n \n 6) Argentinia in the 1960 70s and 80s. Same as #4\n \n 7) Communist China. If the students had rifles at Tienamen Square, would China still be communist?",

If we take our protection, and make it illegal, then the bad guys will get the guns, break into your house and you will say, \"Atleast I can protect myself with my gun. Oh, that's right, I dont have it anymore, it's illegal to have a gun! Well I wonder if the bad guy will let me call and report his wrong doings to the police.\"\n There is always ganna be an idiot with a gun out there, and I hope am able to legally have one to protect myself against him.",

   "The UK may have good reason for banning non-functional reproduction firearms. Fake guns that look like real guns can cause a lot of trouble. Toy guns can be dangerous. The police may mistake your toy gun for a real gun. Here are a few examples.\n \n \"On August 23, 1998, Michael Jones, a 16-year old boy, was shot 17 times and critically wounded by two police officers in Brooklyn, New York while riding a bicycle because he had a water gun that looked like a 9mm MP5 submachine gun.\"\n \n \"On October 28, 2000, a Los Angeles police officer responding to a loud Halloween costume party at a mansion in Beverly Hills, California, shot and killed 39-year old Anthony Dwain Lee. Lee was inside enjoying the party when he was killed. The officer that shot him thought he had a .357 magnum semi-automatic, when in fact it was a rubber toy gun.\" \n \n http://www.iranonline.com/avc/Fact_Sheet_About_Toy_Guns.html",

However, this can partially be explained by new methods for recording crime that the UK police have adopted.\n \n The British Crime Survey takes into account all crime whether or not it was reported to law enforcement officials. Therefore, many people think it's a more accurate measure of crime than just looking at data provided by the police. England's handgun ban was introduced in 1997. According to the British Crime Survey, there has been 22% decrease in crime since 1997.\n \n http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/sta_index.htm#British",
