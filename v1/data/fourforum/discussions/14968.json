   "Well at least this time you went with a different topic of argument. However just as with your previous positions I'm going to dismantle this one and leave nothing behind.\n \n \n\"Laws that prohibit the purchase of a firearm by a person subject to a domestic violence restraining order are associated with a reduction in the number of intimate partner homicides.32\"\n Legal Community Against Violence\n\n \n Let's start with the source you're citing, the one whose argument you're putting forth and basically adopting as your own. The Legal Community Against Violence. This group makes absolutely no attempts at hiding it's highly anti-gun bias nature. They were amongst the parties to file an amicus brief in District of Columbia v Heller in favor of the DC handgun ban.\n \n http://www.lcav.org/publications-briefs/amicus_briefs/D_C_v_Heller_Amicus_Brief.pdf\n \n And then let's take a look at who finances the Legal Community Against Violence. They're received 9 grants from the Joyce Foundation for a total of $5,003,000 in the name of promoting gun control legislation. Grant List: The Joyce Foundation This is the same Joyce Foundation that has give 8 grants to the Violence Policy Center totaling $4,635,000 in the name of promoting gun control legislation. Grant List: The Joyce Foundation\n \n I see absolutely no way to treat this opinion piece as anything other than biased in favor of gun control. Added to this is the fact that the thought process of the Legal Community Against Violence is incredibly simplistic and short sighted. Intimate partners engaged in domestic violence don't need a gun to kill each other, there's no way to legitimately claim that prohibited gun purchases to those under a restraining order will in any way reduce homicide rates.\n \n I feel that if someone proves to be a sufficient danger that a court will grant a restraining order, that individual has the capacity to murder with whatever tool they have on hand. We've heard of ex-husbands battering their wives, choking them, beating them, burning them, etc. it would be foolish to claim that they won't graduate to murder if they can't buy a gun.\n \n \n\"Homicide risks were found to be 50% higher for female handgun purchasers in California compared with licensed drivers matched by sex, race, and age group.12 Among the women handgun purchasers who were murdered, 45% were killed by an intimate partner using a gun. In contrast, 20% of all women murdered in California during the study period were killed with a gun by an intimate partner.13\"\n http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Firearms%20and%20Intimate%20Partner%20Violence.pdf\n\n \n According to this link the source it comes from is the Center for Disease Control. The last time I checked the Center for Disease Control was barred from carrying out any studies regarding guns as they were using their position to try and paint gun ownership as a public health menace.\n \n As such I won't go into details on the fallacy of the cited argument. The fact that congress forbade anymore studies to be carried out speaks volumes in itself regarding their validity and credibility.\n \n \nAfter reading the above information, what advice would you give to a woman who felt she was in danger and needed to protect herself?\n\n \n Let's examine the facts of the matter. A restraining order is nothing more than a piece of paper handed out by the courts, its power relying heavily on the existence and timely arrival of police officers in order to enforce it. Without the police able to show up when a disturbance is called in then the restraining order does no good.\n \n The power of a restraining order can only be invoked in a court of law. A women can't tell her stalker \"You're in violation of the restraining order\" and expect that to be enough to drive away the person they're trying to avoid. the only time this power can be effective is if the victim survives the encounter and can bring their stalker to a courtroom in a criminal suit. In the real world this power is vacant without law enforcement to back it up.\n \n A gun is a lethal weapon capable of dealing death with one pull of the trigger. I know this fact, you know this fact, the neighbor down the street knows this fact. With the exception of children and the mentally handicapped there's not a person in the world that isn't painfully aware of this simple fact of life.\n \n Any stalker, abusive ex or other such dangerous person is fully aware of the fact that if their target is armed they can easily be shot and killed on the spot in response to their actions. The smart ones will heed this fact and stay well away for fear of their own lives. The brazen will make an attempt and put their lives in jeopardy because they simply don't care or don't believe their victim will have the will to fight back. Those foolish enough to assume that their ex won't rise to the opportunity to fight back if the opportunity presents itself will be found by to coroner dead where they fell.\n \n We've seen in the past a number of shootings and massacres take place in locations where weapons are prohibited by law. Felony murder is illegal. Brandishing a weapon is illegal. None of this matters to those who simply don't care. Advising a woman that all she needs is a restraining order is foolish to the highest level. \n \n If a restraining would be enough to protect a woman from an abusive stalker, then the laws against murder would be enough to prevent murder from happening.\n \n Do you not understand the fact that there are people who will break the law for no other reason than simply not caring what the law says?",
