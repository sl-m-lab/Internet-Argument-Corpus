It is otensibly to make sure children become educated but we all know that plenty of kids will simply fail and drop out before they recieve their diplomas because they simply do not want to be in school. And we also know that some of these diplomas are suspect given the lack of educational standards in many places. Part of me thinks it would be better to simply give parents total authority over their children's education. Let them decide if their child will attend school and in what form (public, private or home).",

   "Modern education is so much more than merely teaching subject matter. The socialisation process (the transfer of social values) as well as the containment effect (youths kept off the streets and labour markets) are rather important benefits that isn`t directly related to enthusiasm and activity during class. To throw away these benefits would not be wise unless it can be compensated somehow. An apathetic pupil is better than a criminal youth roaming the streets.\n \n The problem with low quality teachers cannot be solved solely through pay raises either IMO. You need to improve the status of the proffesion. As it is now the teaching proffesion both suffer from a percieved legitimacy problem as well as a real legitimacy problem. The percieved problem revolves around the notion that anyone could teach, you just need to know the subject matter you teach (which isn`t very demanding, not even at rather advanced levels of high school or equivalent) and you need to have people skills (which can`t be taught). This is naturally flawed as the teaching proffesion rellies so heavily on pedagogical and didactic skill as well as much more advanced subject education than displayed by the students themselves. The real problem revolves around the problem of accountability and responsibility. \n \n One sollution (or rather, the best I`ve heard so far) is to tie the teachers proffesionalism together with grading. If the grading process becomes the most important responsibility of the (qualified) teacher and grades can be appealed and reviewed by peers, the teaching proffesion would gain tremendous in status. No longer can anyone teach, but only those who are ready and have the education to be accountable for the grades they level at their students.\n \n Now, granted, this is from a swedish perspective.

In general, we provide a better education to a far greater percentage of the population than we ever have before. I will agree that education has changed, and not always for the best, but that's driven by changes in the world around us - technological, economical and social.\n \n The world has changed, an education isn't a luxury anymore, it's a necessity. The most basic of trades, even labour, require basic language and math skills. The days of having a grade school education and earning a decent wage are purely in the past.\n \n I've got a lot of teachers in my family. Quite frankly, I see both sides of the argument. I think teaching is one of, if not the, most noble profession. The problem is, we don't treat teachers with that kind of respect. I know from first hand experience that despite the mega bucks being poured into education, almost every teacher and every classroom could use more, often just to supply the basics.\n \n My brother has an Education degree, I've never watched him teach, but I've heard he was very good at it, he was recruited by two or three school boards when he graduated. He's working in the oil and gas field because his starting salary, based on an unrelated degree, was greater than the salary he'd receive after 10 years of teaching, and the only limits he has in his current job are how hard he works. Your salary and lifetime schedule are determined for you that day you join the teachers union, hard work and ability are irrelevent. There's something wrong there IMHO.\n \n Waxy",

   "As a public high school teacher, I would like to weigh in on this discussion. Many issues have been raised that are pertinent to the problems facing public education.\n \n 1. There must be mandatory education. Many children come from homes where education is considered a waste of time. How can you expect a 12 or 13 year old to choose to go to school if the parents have taught them education is worthless?\n \n 2. More money is not the answer to the ills of public education. The appropriate management of educational funds is more to the point. Here is an example: textbooks are very expensive to purchase (around $50-$70/book) and students are given their books for free. At the end of each year we list who destroyed or did not turn the book assigned to them. The next year each student is given the books he/she needs for that year, again for free. Why should they respect the property of the school if there is no consequence for destroying or losing books from the previous year? The end result is that the school has to purchase more books which were designed to last 6 years in their budget. Therefore, schools are using money from another budget item to replace those books. What's wrong with holding the parents accountable for the lost/destroyed books, since the student recieved the first one for free? BTW I would love a pay raise, haven't had one in 2 years and health insurance premiums went up drastically this year, so I am making less money this year than I ded last year. I also understood going in to this profession, that the money was not going to be that great. I love teaching, so I made that choice to work for less than I could in my field outside of public education. And yes, I had job offers from other sources, so I didn't settle for teaching because I couldn't do anything else. And yes it is true that there are unqualified teachers, just like unqualified personnel in other fields.\n \n 3. I am not sure what one means by teachers not being \"experts\" in their field. I have a Master's Degree in my field. I keep up with new information in my field. Am I an \"expert\"? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure I'm as knowledgable as most in my field. Actually, content area is the least of what we need to do this job. On any given day I am parent, counselor, teacher, conflict manager, values teacher (I hate this one), someone to talk to because there is noone at home, and the list goes on and on. Somedays, I am amazed that I actually get to teach anything.\n \n 4. Accountability! Unfortunately, the only people in the school building that are held accountable are the teachers. I don't mean that it is unfortunate that teachers are held accountable, but the parents and students are not held accountable. We can only turn out students based on what the public sends us. I am always thrilled when I recieve a letter, e-mail, of phone call from a former student who gave me a hard time about the uselessness of what they were learning, thanking me for putting up with them because all along I was right. Many offer to come back to talk to my students now, but also add that the kids wouldn't listen to them any more than they listened to those who came back and talked to them when they were still in school. I can only try to teach students, they ultimately have to \"pick up what I put down\".\n \n 5. I believe in tracking students (putting academically alike students educationally together). With the exception of Special Education (what a waste of money) and AP classes, this notion has been ruled discriminatory. BTW if you are a parent or pay for public schools through your taxes, you should question why a student with a learning disability (LD) like being behind his/her grade level in reading, goes into LD classes, but never gets out. Talk about an unsuccessful program, even though per pupil spending is greater than that for the average student. Hint: parents recieve a monthly check if their child is in Sp. Ed.\n \n 6. The Ivory Tower syndrome. All the researchers in the educational field who come up with \"new teaching techniques\" and have never been in a classroom or at least not for a long time. Educational problems are a big concern for most people, so school administrators are quick to jump on any bandwagon that sounds good to appease the public. I can't count the amount of **** ideas that have been passed on to the schools from these so called \"experts\" that we have to implement, then 2 years later a new idea comes down the pike and we are forced to try it. A few years ago I quit listening to my administration and teach the way I know has helped my students be successful. I can only do this because I'm near retirement and don't care if they write me up, I teach for my students' benefit, not some hairbrained idea that's new this week.\n \n 7. The teachers that I work with have pushing for more vocational/techinical training for the students for many years. People who make these decisions simply won't listen to us. Everyone is not made for college. Think about it, how many bosses do you need and how many workers?",

   "Our system of education has changed so much in the past 100 years, and not for the better. I'm almost sick about the quality of education my children are going to receive in school today.\n\n Virginia public schools spend thousands of dollars per year per student. The private school I attend costs about one half to two thirds of the amount. The quality of the public schools is about 1/3 that of my school. The government and education freaks think that the public education system will improve by pouring more and more cash into the schools. Contrary to what they believe, school quality would increase if the hired proper teachers and showed less tolerance to the ghetto XXXXXX who disrupt every class. They assume that every good teacher must have a teaching degree, but your \"qualification\" does not make you a good teacher.\n \n \nIt seems to me that by passing legislation requiring every child to attend school until a certain age (16?), we're bringing on the educational decline we originally sought to eradicate. There are children in school who clearly do not want to be there. They are disruptive and hinder the children who wish to learn. Who is it really helping? The only ones benefitting are the schools. More federal dollars are brought in, because there are more butts in the seats, not because they are doing a better job. The test scores they live by and teach to are proving it.\n\n The fact that this law is in place contributes to the poor quality of education, in my opinion.\n \n \nIt used to be a privilege to go to school. Now it's a law, and I'm sad about it.\n\n The public/government schools offer education as good as ****, but the stupid XXX bureaucrats aka paper shufflers think that their crummy public schools are best, so they push restrictions on homeschoolers (I was homeschooled for three years).",

The former middle-class is being replaced by legislation and rapid expansion of civil service workers using public debt to maintain a false economy and educate in that manner. Hopefully, you and others who do not require acquired motivation will find it within your abilities to eventually put things back on track. The mobs of those fail could get large.",
