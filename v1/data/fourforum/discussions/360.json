   "BTW i don't believe that every creature was in the arc\n it was just a regional flood\n\n Then why would you look for the ark on top of a mountain that is about 17,000'? Any flood deep enough to park an ark up there would not be considered \"local\". But that's why the story of the flood is so ridiculous.\n \n I think Ryan & Pitman had an interesting idea about the flooding of the Black Sea. Of course, that would put the flood at about 7,500 years ago, a bit older than most YECs allow for the age of the earth.\n \n Your remarks about the government of Turkey show you to be a typical fundie biggot. Let me quote your thoughts as to why \"scientists\" don't go and find the ark.\n \nThe reason scientists don't go and prove it is because the government of the country won't let scientists in to study it.\n \n why? because it is an islamic govt.\n\n Actually, Turkey has been an ally of the United States for a long, long time. Generally, Americans (even fundy christians) are welcome there. A good friend of mine was stationed there some years ago.\n \n Perhaps you are unaware of where Ararat is. It is in a part of Turkey very close to Georgia, Armenia, Iran. There is fighting going on there from time to time. Just to the south is Kurdistan (not a country but a region that overlaps Iraq, Iran and Turkey) and Iraq. The area just to the south of Lake Van (which is just south of Mt. Ararat) is where the U.S. would like to stage troops to invade Iraq. \n \n While you are welcome in Turkey (even fundy christians are welcome), no one, not even Muslims are allowed into that part of Turkey unless they have a really, really good reason. Religious quests don't seem to be a good reason to the Turks.\n \n And wouldn't Turkey just love to make the whole area into a tourist Mecca so that they could fleese the fundy christians out of scads of money to let them look at a lava flow and insist that it is the ark. It's been done and the Turks are more than willing to call it Noah's Ark.",

   "Debater\n \n Did you not understand what I explained to you about letting tourists into that part of Turkey? (By the way, there have been no \"scientists\" searching for the ark for quite some time. Only one structure that was claimed to be the ark was publicized by Ron Wyatt. Some real scientists did go there and study the formation and found that it is a natural lava flow.) The people that you claim aren't being let into Turkey aren't scientists - they are \"creation scientists.\"\n \n You have slandered the government of Turkey and claimed that fundy christians are being excluded because Turkey has an Islamic government. Actually, it is tourists that are excluded from that area because it is dangerous. The prospect of some of those tourists being killed or kidnapped by terrorists is very real. The best way to protect the tourists in Turkey is to keep them out of that area.\n \n There have been a lot of YEC search parties and nothing has been found, even when travel in that part of Turkey was permitted. So the reason that the ark hasn't been found is because it isn't there. The story is a myth.",

   "A couple of things. First of all, the ark would not have to be enormous because it probably did not carry all of the animals that we see today. That would explain the dying out of many dinosaurs, preserving their fossils in the rocks today. Also, the sea creatures would not have to be taken aboard as well as the freshwater creatures because of the fact that the entire planet would be covered with water. For plants, only seeds would be needed.\n Also, one theory that is commonly overlooked is the creation \"evolutionist\" theory. This theory states that God created \"mutts,\" animals with the entire genetic code and no specialization (basically he created the genus or order, not the individual species except for man). Thus, two dogs could give rise to many other mutts that, when they moved or faced hard times, would like Darwin's finches weed out undesirable genetic code for the environment. All in all, it's more likely that all of the animals came from an ark than from nonliving matter.",
