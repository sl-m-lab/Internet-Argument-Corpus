I'm more worried about Al-Queda than I am about Iraq, and there was controversy that Al-Queda would not support Hussein because his purpose is secular. I think this changes a lot. Wondering what you guys thought since I don't know much about politics.",

   "The bin Laden message expresses solidarity with the Iraqi people not Saddam. It advises them to remain steadfast in the coming invasion of their country and declares that Saddam and his aides are not important. The exact words were \"It is not important if Saddam and his government disappear. This is a war against you, the Muslims, and you must take arms to defend yourselves.\"\n \n The message goes on to say the bin Laden believes Saddam to be a socialist and declares that \"socialists and communists are unbelievers,\" thereby labeling Saddam and apostate of Islam, an infidel.\n \n On the audio message vin Laden also called on the spilling of Saddam's blood: \"His blood is halal.\" This wording is used to say what is permissive or allowed for the killing of a usurper or criminal.\n \n Bin Laden does not care about Saddam, in fact he can't wait till he is removed, since bin Laden is trying to position himself as an alternative ideology. Bin Laden is calling on Muslim Iraqis to overthrow Saddam and that Saddam is irrelevant in the coming war and Iraqis should not fight for him.\n \n Also you should be aware that CNN was only showing excerpts of the entire 16 minute audio message and much was left out. To get the full picture you would have to go to news sources in Great Britian or others outside the U.S. As usual the American public is offered a half-censored, half- incorrectly- translated version of the audio tape.",
