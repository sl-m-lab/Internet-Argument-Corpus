Stone him hard...from long range with little lead stones hurled at extremely high velostiy from an unmarked metalic device bought from some guy you met downtown on the corner.\n It's the biblical thing to do...although, Jesus would probably just curse him out. ;)\n \n I wonder why they think the faith of their followers is so weak with such comments. Are the pastors not training them properly that they must run and hide from imaginary threats. Can not your wife sanctify your children and with complacent support from you, raise them in the Church or as Christians?\n \n I was a very supportive husband of my wife's and kid's faith with only the youngest not becoming indoctrinated into the system but, in time he could have.\n It wasn't a single thing I did that eventually caused most to renounce their beliefs. It was entirely the actions of their fellow Christians, their church leaders and how they eventually viewed themselves in context of their supposed bliefs that they eventually saw as hypocritical that caused most to break away from fundamentalism.",

One thing I'd try to ensure is they get a modicum of grounding in more than one religion, and not just the Western ones.\n\n \n \n I agree.\n I've actually had to speak to some counselors on this in dealing with my son.\n Had to remind them that morality and ethics aren't always found in just one book and had to illustrate object lessons I've engaged in. Such as returning 200 dollars the son found on the floor to it's rightful owner based on seeking empathy and understanding if the roles were reversed for him.\n \n My son probably has about as much understanding of other faiths (was just discussing the FLDS with him recently) that are common to the world or sensationalized in the media, as your average mono-religist has of their own faith. And he probably knows more about Christianity that most of his peers.\n \n I have stated that if we lived in an Islamic country, then those sects would be what he knew the most about.\n \n And, if he wants to embrace a religion on his own, he's fine to do so. So long as it's not excessively anti-social and criminal. Don't think I'd take kindly to the boy wanting to sacrifice virgins so he can get magical powers.\n \n I know a few children of 'athiests' and they all have different approaches.\n The ones who pretty much ignore religious issues altogether with their kids aren't much worse off than the believer who simply forces the kids to go to church on high holy days and ignores the faith the rest of the year.\n The only problems I've seen would be from the pushy evangelical kids who think they know it all and cause a commotion with their mandatory confrontations. Either there'll be friction or if the evangelical is friendly and charismatic, may lure the other kid to a church service. In the vast majority of cases, there's really not much to fear.\n A self rightious Jesus Freak can be just as annoying as a gothy-I-wear-all-black-and-am-always-moody kid.\n They'll either grow out of it or grow up and no longer be your problem.",
