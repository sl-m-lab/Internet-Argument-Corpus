   "I personally chose \"End of biologically possible mental existence\" (which corresponds to the permanent loss of cerebral cortex function) since I view that, once we no longer mentally exist, then the only thing that exists after us is our artificially sustained continued human body - a thing, not us. Even if there is enough brain function to keep the heart, lungs, or other organs going then that is not relevant to me (though it does seem to be relevant to the legal definition of death) since that is just the body as a machine / a thing - not the body with the brain function that defines a mental existence / a person or individual. \n \n If a loved one lost all cerebral brain function then, assuming that I could think rationally over the grief, I would have no choice but to choose to disconnect them from life support since I would have to accept that the person I knew was long gone and that I would only be agreeing to the death of a mere body - a thing, no matter how much that body reminded me of the person who once existed in it. \n \n All of this translates to the issue of the beginning of life of an individual since I don't view an individual as beginning life until he/she gains the mental existence that defines them. Their life as individuals then starts through newly developed mental capabilities that, according to neurologists, can exist only if a functioning cerebral cortex exists - which starts around the beginning of the third trimester of fetal development.",

For example, since I view the individuals as being defined by their mental existence then I would stay consistent at both the beginning and end of life in saying that the end of an individual's life occurs when their mental existence stops (ex. loss of cerebral cortex function) and starts when mental existence starts (around the begining of the third trimester when major cortical connections become developed). Someone who would stick to the thought of the end of an individual's life occuring at full brain death would have to stay consistent in saying that an individual's life starts at the beginning of brain function - independent of whether or not it is higher level. \n \n I think that most people have not explored this topic in its full philosophical / psychological implication and just mention when legal death happens or address when they personally would want the plug pulled.

The point of my posts was to claim that a definition of personhood has to stay consistent. If it is only life that is important, then one has to claim that any human body that is alive continues to be a person, no matter how much brain function there is. If it is mental existence that is important, as I claim, then it is critical to know when it ends. You cannot have complete loss of cerebral cortex function (i.e. destruction of the cerebral cortex) and then be able to recover that. If one only has partial loss, then other areas of the cerebral cortex can often take the place of lost function - so that there remains a mental existence but just with more limited capabilities.

   "While you are certainly entitled to have that opinion,... you should know that the law actually does recognize a mere \"living body\" as a \"person.\"\n \n Person; (noun)\n 2: the body of a human being\n\n Not surprisingly, you did not quote the other definitions and, further, you took that definition out of context. Here is the full list of definitions from your link:\n \n1: \"natural person\" \n \n 2: the body of a human being\n \n also \n : the body and clothing of a human being \n Example: had drugs on his person\n \n 3: one (as a human being or corporation) that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties \n (see also juridical person legal person personality)\n\n You will note that the first is natural person which, presumably, means the type of person most people refer to which is left unprecisely defined since society has not defined it precisely. The second, the one you quoted, only refers to the body when used in statements such as \"had drugs on his person\". Perhaps you are not familiar enough with how dictionaries work to notice the example of use they gave for that second definition - a use and context which clearly does not refer to the person as used in defining rights. That last concept - person as one with rights, is defined in the third definition and is probably intentionally left vague. \n \n Please, learn to use dictionaries properly before you quote them.\n \nb: Yes. Absolutely! Especially after the (for lack of a better word) \"miraculous\" recovery she made.\n\n That is why I used the words \"knew for certain\". By \"certain\" that she would not make a recovery, I really mean certain, not an intelligent and insuffficiently supported guess, even by a medical professional. So, I'll ask the question again. If you knew for certain that your wife's mind was gone forever and that all that was left was her artificially sustained living body, would you also consider that still her - still a person? Again, here I really mean \"for certain\" in that there was NO chance of her coming back and ever regaining any mental existence.\n \nWell there you are finally getting to the point that I was trying to make earlier.\n \n What Doctor in their right mind would \"pull the plug\" on a \"brain dead\" patient like Terri Shiavo,... if that patient had even a fraction of the prognosis for recovery and development that a typical prebirth child has?\n\n Terri Shiavo was not brain dead. She had the great majority of her cerebral cortex destroyed, as can be seen on the scans of her brain in the following link: Terri Schiavo case - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia but there were many parts still functioning . Since, to my knowledge, her cerebral cortex was not COMPLETELY destroyed but almost completely, then theoretically there could be some minimal level of thought left so this would not meet my own criteria of end of mental existence. The Terri Shiavo case was one more to do with quality of life and whether she would have wanted to die in such a case, as well as the misinterpretation of the Religious Right of what her state really was. Either way, her brain was so far gone that there was no chance of rehabilitation to anything close to her earlier function. I had mostly brought up here case to outline to you that end-of-life issues and state of mind at end of life can sometimes be just as contraversial and prominent in the media as abortion issues (since you seemed to think that such issues were not important).\n \nBiologically, a human individual's life begins at and by their conception.\n \n Learn it, love it, live with it.\n\n A human individual's life begins when a human individual (= person) begins which, according to most Americans, is NOT at conception. \n \n Learn it, love it, live with it.",

   "This was, is, and forever will remain a metaphysical question for which there is no answer except the one which each individual finds morally and ethically right for him/herself.\n\n A good honest answer. I would say the same thing. But because there is the possibility that the mind is there from the beginning, abortion can only be legal if it is proved that the mind does not exist at conception. If later on in human history somehow it is proved that humans minds are created at conception, then all of the babies aborted would have been persons and society would look down on our generation. If later on it is proved that human minds are created in the later trimesters of pregnancy, then abortion will not be as debated or even debated at all. Because of that possibility that a fetus really is a person and has a mind from conception, the morally right thing to do would be to stop abortions from occurring.\n \n \nWhy is there need for further debate on the subject, except to discuss the legal, moral, and ethical correctness of anyone trying to impose her/his views on the law.\n \n It is clear that we go their at our, and the law's, peril\n\n Debate is needed because pro-lifers believe that the mind exists from the moment of conception in some time of form (soul). Others believe that the lack of a mind cannot be proved and therefore it the possibility of a mind must be taken into account. The Christian side of me is with the first view and the secular side of me takes the second. Therefore abortion is murder and must be stopped according to pro-lifers. \n \n The pro-choice movement decides that because it cannot be proved that there is a mind, there is no mind and abortions are not murder of persons at all. They do not take into account the fact that a fetus may very well have a mind.\n The issue is not about the woman's choice, it is about whether or not a fetus has the right to life.

For fetuses it is the mind. The comparison is completely relevant. I never argued against you in that post stating that you used degrees in your argument.\n\n Since I don't view a group of cells representing the zygote or early fetus as a human being, then I am not differentiating between human beings. I am curious why you would consider a zygote a human being. If that zygote forever stayed a zygote, would you still consider it a human being? If so, why? What characteristics define a human being / person in your view?\n \n As for slavery, the slaveholders did not choose blacks as slaves ONLY because of their skin color. Their arguements supporting slavery were based on erroneous assumptions, sometimes stated and sometimes assumed, about the mental capabilities of blacks. The same trend was true in the European colonial era. There were generalized assumptions about people of color that they were inferior and, thus, justified in being kept in slavery or near-slavery. Much of that prejudice stemmed from the fact that European society was more technologically developed than most of the rest of the world, which also meant that they were more militarily powerful and could subjugate peoples. African societies, by and large, were far more primitive. At the time, Europeans and Americans tended to hold views that people from more primitive cultures were in such primitive cultures not because of their circumstances but because of inate inferiority. Similar attitudes were espoused about natives of Central and South America, which were often kept in near-slavery conditions. There were many Asian Indians of dark skin color yet they were not kept as slaves by Americans so it was not skin color itself that determined slavery. The same is true of Arabs of dark skin color. All this says is that it was not purely the skin color but the DEGREE of development of mind that was assumed about people of a particular skin color that was the basis for the justifications given for slavery. Since I make no arguement about degree of mind, just the existence of one, then that arguement is irrelevant. \n \n Either way, at some point one has to say that rights start. For that, we need to have some understanding of rights to begin with. The history of the introduction of rights largely revolves around the fact that there were negative consequences to the lack of rights - consequences that nearly always revolved around human suffering. A batch of cells of an early embryo cannot suffer. Indeed, only late term fetuses can have any sense of experience of any sort - be it suffering, emotion, etc. The arguements of the pro-life camp of zygotes deserving rights sound as absurd to us as it would be to you if someone said that unfertilized eggs also deserve rights. After all, they will also become \"us\" under the right circumstances.\n \nWhat is the difference between a brain-dead person, a fetus, and someone who has been dead for 2 days?\n\n If you are asking which one deserves rights, then I would say that the brain-dead human body, the body dead for 2 days, and early fetuses do not deserve rights since they have no mind. However, the late term fetus does deserve rights since it might have a mind.\n \n There is also a difference in that the brain dead body and body dead for 2 days has no potential whereas the early fetus, embryo, zygote and even unfertilized egg does have potential to become one of us. I do value that potential but much less than I value the right of a woman to her own body - which is a very important right in a country that claims to espouse freedom.\n \nYou are comparing two totally different rights. The mother is not going to die if she does not have an abortion. If the mother would die giving birth a life is to be lost in either option, so the mother can decide if she wants to sacrifice or save herself from death. During a normal case a mother will choose to save herself not from death but from poverty at the expense of the baby's life.\n\n As long as only one person exists - i.e. the mother - then she should be able to do whatever she wants with her body since the only thing that would be lost in an abortion is the life of a mind-less batch of cells of the early embryo that may have potential but is not YET a human being / person. In late term, I view that as changing since now the fetus has not only potential to develop further but is ALREADY a human being since it can have some level of mind. The bottom line is that I think that a woman's rights over her own body is a freedom that is far more important than the value placed on the potential of a mind-less batch of cells.\n \n Over her own body? Of course. However, the fetus is not her own body. The fetus is another body that should have equal freedoms and rights. If freedom is an important concept in this country, the child should have the freedom to be born.\n\n You may use whatever language you choose, but a batch of cells defining a zygote and early fetus has almost no resemblance to a child - the most important aspect being that it has no mind whatsoever. It cannot suffer, feel emotions, have any will or desire to live, feel any pain, or indeed experience anything at all since, at that stage, it is ONLY a biological machine that has the POTENTIAL to become more - to become a person - but is not a person YET. As such, freedom is irrelevant to it since it cannot experience any consequences of lack of freedom. The only one who experiences the consequences of lack of freedom is the mother, which is why her freedom over her body is paramount. As long as the fetus is in her body, then her freedom over her body is lost if she is forced to carry it.\n \nWhere does the mind come from? The brain is simply a physical part of the body, as a dead brain will not have a mind. Where does the mind come from?\n\n Neurologists claim that the mind as we understand it - thoughts, emotions, etc. - is defined by the function of the brain. More specifically, the cerebral cortex. Other parts of the brain can control bodily functions or other functions of the human body as purely a biological machine but it is the cerebral cortex that determines our mental selves. The cerebral cortex does not sufficiently develop until roughly the beginning of the third trimester. \n \n I know that there are religious arguements about soul, but religious arguements cannot enter into any legal standing. After all, there could exist a religion that could claim that unfertilized eggs have souls and that laws should be created to give as many as possible a chance at life. After all, how could you disprove that unfertilized eggs have souls? Laws need to be based on a knowledge base that is supported by evidence.",

I sincerely hope that you are as completely opposed to capital punishment as you are to abortion.\n\n Congratulations! You have succeeded in guessing that I am against the death penalty. I have fallen into no trap, but nice try. I am not in line with the pro-lifers who believe that only INNOCENT human beings have a right to life. I believe that all do. Although personally, I would rather die than live in a prison for life.\n \n \n \nYes, but so what? this is irrelevant to the discussion, and simply proves that the entire issue is metaphysical.\n\n It is completely relevant as your entire argument relies on the fact that abortion is justifiable because a fetus is not a person. You say that a fetus is not a person because it has no mind. Yet you cannot prove that a fetus does not actually have a mind, nor can anyone state where, how, or when the mind comes into play. Something is not made irrelevant by your inability to come up with an argument against it.\n \n \n \n \nWe don't have to prove anything at all. American law has already done it. Lokk at the 14th Amendment; look at the rules for the census. Both clearly indicate that personhood, and the rights appertaining to it, begin at birth and not before.\n\n Are you referring to this?\n \nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n All persons born in the United States are citizens. But the amendment states that all PERSONS, not citizens, have the right to life, liberty, and property. In order to use the 14th amendment as legal justice you must first prove that a fetus is not a person. In order to prove that you must determine when the mind comes into existence. So yes, you have quite a lot to prove.",

   "What if my concept of personhood did not include children who could not talk? What if I attributed the ability of personhood to vocal expression? Using your logic it would be wrong for anyone to outlaw the murder of people who could not talk because they have no right to force a law upon me when I have a different concept of personhood. Your argument is absurd and redundant.\n \n \n Since it does not include these things, this is simply a strawman argument and can be dismissed out of hand.\n \n \nThe same argument was used in favor of slavery. \n \"We have every right to do what we want with our property, and just because you believe that a slave is a person and not property does not mean you can impose your will on us and ban slavery.\"\n You say:\n \"Women have every right to do what they want with their bodies, and just because you believe that a fetus is a person and not a non-person does not mean you can impose your will on us and ban abortion.\"\n People believed that blacks were property and not persons. You believe that a fetus is a non-person and not a person. You treat a fetus like the property of the mother the same exact way blacks were treated as property by the slave holders.\n \n \n Off topic and irrelevant. If anything, the reverse is true. Those who would criminalize abortion would make the fetus master over the woman. Are you denying that the woman is a person?\n \n \n \nWhy would anything I said suggest that I hate the idea that women are sexual beings? That makes absolutely no sense. I expected better from you. Pregnancy is not a punishment. It is the natural result of the action of sex.\n \n \n Not in the world of the 21st Century. Women have the right, duty, and responsibility to choose whether or not pregnancy is an anticipated result of sexual activity and to choose further whether or not to carry that pregnancy to term. \n \n \nTaking responsibility is not the same as receiving punishment. Are you suggesting that all women who have abortions would make bad mothers? Even so adoption is an option. And you still cannot negate the truth that women do not have to have sex in the first place. If they do not want the result of pregnancy, all they have to do is not have sex with a man. Its not too difficult to understand.\n \n \n So then you are advocating lesbianism for women who wish to have sex but do not want to risk pregnancy. Of course, as is shown by the part of your quote which is bolded, your first choice is that women remain celibate. Why??\n As to adoption, just how many children have YOU adopted? If the answer is NONE, then I suggest you look more deeply inside your recommendation.\n \n \n \n \nWell, I don't believe the law should be silent. If a moral wrong exists in society, it should not be made legal.\n \n \n Why not tell us why your subjective opinion on a metaphysical question should have a preferred position in the law above all others.\n \n \n \n \nCongratulations! You have succeeded in guessing that I am against the death penalty. I have fallen into no trap, but nice try. I am not in line with the pro-lifers who believe that only INNOCENT human beings have a right to life. I believe that all do.

There may be hope for you yet.\n \n \n \n \nIt is completely relevant as your entire argument relies on the fact that abortion is justifiable because a fetus is not a person.

   "Since it does not include these things, this is simply a strawman argument and can be dismissed out of hand.\n\n Let me reword that so it isn't a strawman argument. Tell me, if somebody believes that a woman has the right to kill her one year old child because that woman believes in the concept of no personhood I made in that fallacy, why is that person not entitled to her opinion about personhood? If we use the logic you are using, any time of murder should be legal depending on how the murderer views people as a concept, however ridiculous everyone else thinks that concept is.\n \n \nOff topic and irrelevant. If anything, the reverse is true. Those who would criminalize abortion would make the fetus master over the woman. Are you denying that the woman is a person?\n\n A comparison is not off topic or irrelevant. You make me laugh. The fetus the master over the woman? Are you joking? That is completely absurd. The fetus is not the one claiming to have rights to its property. The fetus is not the one who is claiming rights to kill the mother. That is the most absurd, illogical, and quite frankly idiotic thing I have ever heard from any pro-choice advocate. The woman is a person. Just as the slave holder is a person. How would the fetus master over the woman? The woman isn't going to die giving birth.\n \n \n \n \n \nNot in the world of the 21st Century. Women have the right, duty, and responsibility to choose whether or not pregnancy is an anticipated result of sexual activity and to choose further whether or not to carry that pregnancy to term. \n\n Oh! So now that time has changed it is unnatural to have a child resulting from sex. You are being foolish. Women have the right, duty, and responsibility to choose whether or not they want a pregnancy and make the choice to have sex based on that decision.\n \n \n \n \nSo then you are advocating lesbianism for women who wish to have sex but do not want to risk pregnancy. Of course, as is shown by the part of your quote which is bolded, your first choice is that women remain celibate. Why??\n As to adoption, just how many children have YOU adopted? If the answer is NONE, then I suggest you look more deeply inside your recommendation.\n\n I take my previous comment back. THIS is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard. I am advocating abstinence, not lesbianism. If the woman wants to have sex but doesn't want a child then she shouldn't have sex. Period. She could always use protection if she was so consumed by lust for sex but she would still have to accept the responsibility of the child if the protection did not work. I do not have children, adopted or of my own. How does the fact that I do not have adopted children negate the recommendation of adoption?\n \n \nWhy not tell us why your subjective opinion on a metaphysical question should have a preferred position in the law above all others.\n\n I already have. But since you ignored some of my posts earlier...you didn't see that. Let me show you again.\n \nA good honest answer. I would say the same thing. But because there is the possibility that the mind is there from the beginning, abortion can only be legal if it is proved that the mind does not exist at conception. If later on in human history somehow it is proved that humans minds are created at conception, then all of the babies aborted would have been persons and society would look down on our generation. If later on it is proved that human minds are created in the later trimesters of pregnancy, then abortion will not be as debated or even debated at all. Because of that possibility that a fetus really is a person and has a mind from conception, the morally right thing to do would be to stop abortions from occurring.\n\n Every single law is simply an enforced opinion about how things should work. \n \n \nIn fact, that is not my point at all. My point simply is that a pregnant woman must needs have the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy. All other points are irrelevant.\n\n So you do not believe that it matters whether or not a fetus has a mind? If you do you just lied. You have a tendency to make things irrelevant that you can't debate without even explaining why. emoticon_rolleyes The woman should have made the choice before having sex. The pregnancy is completely preventable in the first place. Instead of preventing the pregnancy from continuing, if the woman doesn't want it she should prevent herself from starting it. That is what is logical.\n \n \nIn fact, that is not what 14A states at all. You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.\n\n What I displayed is in the 14th amendment. I quoted it. If you would like to quote it somewhere else and tell me why I am wrong instead of just flatly saying I am wrong, then you can actually create an argument. You cannot just keep shouting Irrelevant! Not true! Wrong! Without actually telling me why.",

The man cannot choose if his wife has an abortion. So of course the focus will be on the woman for the abortion argument. But the man has no less responsibility. Octomom shouldn't have had the kids if she couldn't support them in the first place. She is irresponsible. She did not even naturally have sex to obtain the children.
