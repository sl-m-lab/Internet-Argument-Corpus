Bush has the courage to speak out for freedom.\n \n BY NATAN SHARANSKY\n Monday, April 24, 2006 12:01 a.m.\n \n There are two distinct marks of a dissident. First, dissidents are fired by ideas and stay true to them no matter the consequences. Second, they generally believe that betraying those ideas would constitute the greatest of moral failures. Give up, they say to themselves, and evil will triumph. Stand firm, and they can give hope to others and help change the world.\n \n Political leaders make the rarest of dissidents. In a democracy, a leader's lifeline is the electorate's pulse. Failure to be in tune with public sentiment can cripple any administration and undermine any political agenda. Moreover, democratic leaders, for whom compromise is critical to effective governance, hardly ever see any issue in Manichaean terms. In their world, nearly everything is colored in shades of gray.\n \n That is why President George W. Bush is such an exception. He is a man fired by a deep belief in the universal appeal of freedom, its transformative power, and its critical connection to international peace and stability. Even the fiercest critics of these ideas would surely admit that Mr. Bush has championed them both before and after his re-election, both when he was riding high in the polls and now that his popularity has plummeted, when criticism has come from longstanding opponents and from erstwhile supporters.\n \n With a dogged determination that any dissident can appreciate, Mr. Bush, faced with overwhelming opposition, stands his ideological ground, motivated in large measure by what appears to be a refusal to countenance moral failure. \n \n I myself have not been uncritical of Mr. Bush. Like my teacher, Andrei Sakharov, I agree with the president that promoting democracy is critical for international security. But I believe that too much focus has been placed on holding quick elections, while too little attention has been paid to help build free societies by protecting those freedoms--of conscience, speech, press, religion, etc.--that lie at democracy's core.\n \n I believe that such a mistaken approach is one of the reasons why a terrorist organization such as Hamas could come to power through ostensibly democratic means in a Palestinian society long ruled by fear and intimidation. \n I also believe that not enough effort has been made to turn the policy of promoting democracy into a bipartisan effort. The enemies of freedom must know that the commitment of the world's lone superpower to help expand freedom beyond its borders will not depend on the results of the next election.\n \n Just as success in winning past global conflicts depended on forging a broad coalition that stretched across party and ideological lines, success in using the advance of democracy to win the war on terror will depend on building and maintaining a wide consensus of support.\n \n Yet despite these criticisms, I recognize that I have the luxury of criticizing Mr. Bush's democracy agenda only because there is a democracy agenda in the first place. A policy that for years had been nothing more than the esoteric subject of occasional academic debate is now the focal point of American statecraft.\n \n For decades, a \"realism\" based on a myopic perception of international stability prevailed in the policy-making debate. For a brief period during the Cold War, the realist policy of accommodating Soviet tyranny was replaced with a policy that confronted that tyranny and made democracy and human rights inside the Soviet Union a litmus test for superpower relations.\n \n The enormous success of such a policy in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end did not stop most policy makers from continuing to advocate an approach to international stability that was based on coddling \"friendly\" dictators and refusing to support the aspirations of oppressed peoples to be free.\n \n Then came Sept. 11, 2001. It seemed as though that horrific day had made it clear that the price for supporting \"friendly\" dictators throughout the Middle East was the creation of the world's largest breeding ground of terrorism. A new political course had to be charted.\n \n Today, we are in the midst of a great struggle between the forces of terror and the forces of freedom. The greatest weapon that the free world possesses in this struggle is the awesome power of its ideas.\n \n The Bush Doctrine, based on a recognition of the dangers posed by non-democratic regimes and on committing the United States to support the advance of democracy, offers hope to many dissident voices struggling to bring democracy to their own countries. The democratic earthquake it has helped unleash, even with all the dangers its tremors entail, offers the promise of a more peaceful world.\n \n Yet with each passing day, new voices are added to the chorus of that doctrine's opponents, and the circle of its supporters grows ever smaller.\n Critics rail against every step on the new and difficult road on which the United States has embarked. Yet in pointing out the many pitfalls which have not been avoided and those which still can be, those critics would be wise to remember that the alternative road leads to the continued oppression of hundreds of millions of people and the continued festering of the pathologies that led to 9/11.\n \n Now that President Bush is increasingly alone in pushing for freedom, I can only hope that his dissident spirit will continue to persevere. For should that spirit break, evil will indeed triumph, and the consequences for our world would be disastrous.\n \n Mr. Sharansky spent nine years as a political prisoner in the Soviet Gulag. A former deputy prime minister of Israel and currently a member of the Knesset, he is co-author, with Ron Dermer, of \"The Case For Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror\" (PublicAffairs, 2004).

All Rights Reserved. \n \n \n This should remind us of some great men who have preceded us...such as...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\" Theodore Roosevelt",

I do, however, believe that during a war effort, everyone should want the enemy defeated.\n\n \n The problem here is that, despite your belief that he sitcks to his guns, Bush has been redefining \"enemy\" as fits his political needs. At first it was al_queda, but they're tough to track down. So then it was terrorism in general. A good enemy in that you can never beat them, so you can always call yourself a wartime president and go around claiming special powers. But a bad enemy in that it's really hard to point to victories, and you have to have victories. So then the enemy became Saddam, someone concrete and beatable. And we all know how that turned out. Now we seem to be segueing back towards terrorism for the moment, but who knows how long that will last? \n \n I really don't think Bush cares about seeing the enemy defeated, per se. He doesn't want to win, he wants to fight. He likes dressing up as a \"wartime president\", he likes pretending he's allowed to do anything he likes while we're at \"war\". These enemies he keeps coming up with are the only thing keeping his popularity as high as 32%, and he knows it. Bush is more than willing to say, \"Enemy? Ah, yeah, there's an enemy over there!\" and send our troops off to die as long as it suits his politcal needs.",

Moreover, democratic leaders, for whom compromise is critical to effective governance, hardly ever see any issue in Manichaean terms. In their world, nearly everything is colored in shades of gray.\n\n \n Another way of looking at it, considering the importance of public sentiment, is that political leaders see everything in black and white: what will, according to the polls, win them votes, and what will not.\n \n \nThat is why President George W. Bush is such an exception. He is a man fired by a deep belief in the universal appeal of freedom, its transformative power, and its critical connection to international peace and stability. Even the fiercest critics of these ideas would surely admit that Mr. Bush has championed them both before and after his re-election, both when he was riding high in the polls and now that his popularity has plummeted, when criticism has come from longstanding opponents and from erstwhile supporters.\n\n \n He may have championed freedom in his speeches, but his actions have not so far supported his words. The Patriot Act, if you actually read it, seems to have been left deliberately vague, and I can think of no logical reason for this except that it can be abused and applied in all manner of circumstances. As I have said before, you would think that the most important security document for decades would be very precise in its wording and intentions, but the Patriot Act is anything but.\n \n The invasion of Iraq and the occupational strategy were simply obviously not designed with Bush's spoken idealism in mind; if you look at the chronology of coalition actions in the days and weeks following the fall of Baghdad there is no way to see it but as being economically and geostrategically motivated.\n \n \nWith a dogged determination that any dissident can appreciate, Mr. Bush, faced with overwhelming opposition, stands his ideological ground, motivated in large measure by what appears to be a refusal to countenance moral failure.\n\n \n A refusal not to fulfill the wishlists of his backers and cronies? Admittedly, he is standing his ideological ground, the ideology of the Project for the New American Century and free-market neoconservatism. PNAC unashamedly states that it is \"dedicated to a few fundamental propositions: that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; and that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle.\" So far we have seen little diplomacy and little moral prinicple, but plenty of military strength.\n \n The idea that any world leader, particularly the leader of the sole superpower, is motivated by high morality is just laughably naive. US foreign policy is, and has always been, motivated by special interests and the need to maintain a dominant position, militarily and economically. Unfortunately for the US, the neoconservatives' extension of foreign policy to non-clandestine regime change which necessitates public support and a lot of money, is ironically dragging the country down in both spheres of influence.\n \n \nI myself have not been uncritical of Mr. Bush. Like my teacher, Andrei Sakharov, I agree with the president that promoting democracy is critical for international security. But I believe that too much focus has been placed on holding quick elections, while too little attention has been paid to help build free societies by protecting those freedoms--of conscience, speech, press, religion, etc.--that lie at democracy's core.\n\n \n And this is the central, blindingly obvious fact that disproves any moral, high-minded intent on the part of the administration! Quick elections are a PR stunt, so that Bush can say \"Iraq is a sovereign state once more, and now free\" or something, when the reality on the ground shows these words to mean absolutely nothing. Iraq is fragmenting as we speak along tribal and religious grounds, and dislike of the coalition just keeps getting stronger, as evidenced by the trend of larger numbers of monthly attacks on troops ever since March 2003.\n \n \nI believe that such a mistaken approach is one of the reasons why a terrorist organization such as Hamas could come to power through ostensibly democratic means in a Palestinian society long ruled by fear and intimidation.\n\n \n Well, 10 out of 10 for insight! Hamas were democratically elected (as was the terrorist Israeli Likud party), and if Iraq becomes, democratically, closer and closer to Iran and the Ayatollahs, it (1) will be unsurprising anyway given the secular oppression of the Sunni by SH, and (2) will have been accelerated by the woefully incompetent occupational strategy which has fostered more hatred of the West in 3 years than Saddam did in 3 decades!\n \n \nI also believe that not enough effort has been made to turn the policy of promoting democracy into a bipartisan effort.\n\n \n Indeed, and having a rich Iraqi ex-pat as a US-backed candidate was really in the spirit of democracy wasn't it? You know what would have been a good idea? NOT having a US-backed candidate. Crazy, off-the-wall idea I know, but it might have been something to give the Iraqis a bit more faith in us.\n \n \nThe enemies of freedom must know that the commitment of the world's lone superpower to help expand freedom beyond its borders will not depend on the results of the next election.\n\n \n I'll just rephrase this for accuracy: \"The resistance against US global imperialism know that the commitment of the world's lone superpower to maintain its dominant status will not depend on the results of the next election.\"\n \n \nJust as success in winning past global conflicts depended on forging a broad coalition that stretched across party and ideological lines, success in using the advance of democracy to win the war on terror will depend on building and maintaining a wide consensus of support.\n\n \n It's a bit late for that though isn't it? Unless the US wants to eat some humble pie before the UN General Assembly and stop using its veto every five minutes.\n \n \nYet despite these criticisms, I recognize that I have the luxury of criticizing Mr. Bush's democracy agenda only because there is a democracy agenda in the first place. A policy that for years had been nothing more than the esoteric subject of occasional academic debate is now the focal point of American.......\n\n \n .......rhetoric! And not reality!\n \n \nFor decades, a \"realism\" based on a myopic perception of international stability prevailed in the policy-making debate. For a brief period during the Cold War, the realist policy of accommodating Soviet tyranny was replaced with a policy that confronted that tyranny and made democracy and human rights inside the Soviet Union a litmus test for superpower relations.\n\n \n Absolute rubbish. The US used the arms race and Afghanistan to bankrupt the Soviet Union just as al-Qaeda is using cell-based terrorism to bankrupt the US. Russia is only fractionally more democratic now than it was under Stalin.\n \n \nThe enormous success of such a policy in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end did not stop most policy makers from continuing to advocate an approach to international stability that was based on coddling \"friendly\" dictators and refusing to support the aspirations of oppressed peoples to be free.\n\n \n I nearly fell off my chair. This is an accurate representation of historical fact.\n \n \nThen came Sept. 11, 2001. It seemed as though that horrific day had made it clear that the price for supporting \"friendly\" dictators throughout the Middle East was the creation of the world's largest breeding ground of terrorism. A new political course had to be charted.\n\n \n Unfortunately it wasn't charted. There is barely any difference in US foreign policy now compared to before 9/11, except that it has become even more unilateral and has now openly conducted two invasions using the army, rather than doing it clandestinely through Special Ops, the CIA and support of militias within the target country.\n \n \nToday, we are in the midst of a great struggle between the forces of terror and the forces of freedom.

   "Sorry, Steeeeeve, it was a 5-4 decision:\n \n http://quest.cjonline.com/stories/121300/sup_1213007378.shtml\n \n Supreme Court hands Bush a victory \n The Associated Press \n WASHINGTON -- A bitterly divided U.S. Supreme Court refused to allow a recount of Florida presidential election votes, ruling 5-4 that there wasn't enough time to resolve problems with varying standards used for hand-counting votes. \n \n Dissenters, decrying a decision that all but seals George W. Bush's presidential victory, said the ruling could undermine the nation's confidence in the court. \n \n \"We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed,\" the justices declared in an extraordinary late-night decision Tuesday. \n \n Because of Tuesday's deadline for choosing presidential electors, the court's majority said that ordering a new recount with proper vote-counting standards \"could not be part of an appropriate order\" as Al Gore wanted. \n \n The dissenters warned of harm to the court's standing. \n \n \"The appearance of a split decision runs the risk of undermining the public's confidence in the court itself. ... We do risk a self-inflicted wound -- a wound that may harm not just the court, but the nation,\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote. \n \n Without a recount, the certification of Bush as the narrow winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes -- and thus the presidency -- stands. \n \n The justices said the Florida Supreme Court allowed uneven treatment of hand-counted votes, adding that a proper recount could not be conducted without \"substantial additional work.\" \n \n Ruling in the majority were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Breyer. \n \n It was the same 5-4 lineup that on Saturday halted the recount ordered by the Florida court a day earlier, and the same lineup that has decided some of the most contentious cases before the nation's highest court in recent years. \n \n The names of two justices thought to be pivotal, Kennedy and O'Connor, did not appear atop the majority opinion, nor anywhere else in the 65 pages of overlapping opinions and dissents. \n \n Stevens' blistering dissent, joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, said the majority \"effectively orders the disenfranchisement of an unknown number of voters.\" \n \n \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear,\" Stevens said. \"It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\" \n \n Gore lawyer Laurence Tribe told NBC-TV he disagreed with the decision, but \"I think the courts' place in our lives is such that we all should rally around even if we disagree with the results.\" \n \n The ruling, five weeks to the day after the presidential election, said the recount process allowed by the Florida Supreme Court \"is inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to protect the fundamental right of each voter.\" \n \n The justices said the Florida court \"ratified\" uneven handling of recounts in various counties. The standards \"might vary not only from county to county but indeed within a single county from one recount team to another,\" the court said. \n \n But the majority said that because Florida lawmakers intended in effect to complete the choosing of electors by Dec. 12 to shield them from challenge in Congress, an order allowing a new recount \"could not be part of an appropriate\" remedy. \n \n The court issued its main ruling in an unsigned opinion. Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas went further in a separate opinion, saying the Florida Supreme Court also violated the Constitution and federal law in ordering the recount. \n \n O'Connor and Kennedy -- usually the court's two swing votes -- were recorded as voting in the majority even though they did not sign the main opinion. \n \n Souter and Breyer joined the majority for a 7-2 vote that the differing standards for conducting the recount created an equal-protection problem. But the remedy, those two justices said, was to conduct a new recount with proper standards. \n \n Rehnquist's opinion noted that after the Florida controversy, \"it is likely legislative bodies nationwide will examine ways to improve the mechanisms and machinery for voting.\" \n \n It explained that the court ultimately decided that under the Constitution, the Legislature had final say, not the courts. \"This inquiry does not imply a disrespect for state courts but rather a respect for the constitutionally prescribed role of state legislatures,\" he wrote. \n \n But Breyer argued that the decision undermined the state court. \"The court was wrong to take this case. It was wrong to grant a stay,\" he wrote. \"It should now vacate that stay and permit the Florida Supreme Court to decide whether the recount should resume.\"",
