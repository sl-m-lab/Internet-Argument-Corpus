He still hasn't fully explained this view.\n \n \nI take the affirmative.\n -------------------------------------------\n Normally I think one would argue purely about the resolution, but in this case it is intertwined with many other subjects and to avoid creating multiple threads I am going to try to tie them together with this resolution by stating it's premises and the conclusions I draw from it.\n \n I. Premises and Conclusions \n I take this resolution to require the following premises:[*]Ideal means a standard of perfection or excellence, or what is most good.\n \n [*]Good and Evil exist and are given definition by a person's standard of value.\n \n [*]Anyone who has values has two things, a axiomatic value (a value that is based on no other values) and personal judgment.\n \n [*]Anyone who has personal judgment on what is good or not and what is true or not implies that it is good and proper for him to make decisions and choose values. The only way for this person to remain logically consistent is to cede that it is good and proper for others to make decisions and choose values.\n \n [*]Anyone who seeks to remove choice and judgments from another has only one route to take: force. Therefore the only objectively bad or improper in human interaction is this precise situation: One human uses force to take away the personal judgment of another, to take away their power to choose what they value and what they will do.\n \n [*]Man has natural rights proceeding from his nature (see above) that can be stated most abstractly as a right to liberty from unwanted interaction/interference by others.\n \n [*]In the social sphere that which is good (moral) can be objectively defined by the rights of each individual, that the integration of this concept from the individual to the collective can produce a universal concept of morality consistent with historical observations and general emotional reactions.\n \n [*]Anyone who takes the standard of good to be human life and all that entails have no logical alternative but to conclude that the best society is the one that comes closest to the ideal; which is the violation of no rights; which is to say every human social interaction is voluntary.\n I take this resolution to have these further conclusions:\n [*]A volitional society holds the threat of force against only those who have already accepted it (those who used force first, and violated someone's rights).\n \n [*]A volitional society holds that nothing can substitute for a person's consent, and that a person's consent is the only key to their life and product.\n \n [*]Therefore the ideal society has no legal forceful removal of wealth, forceful relocation, forceful anything applying to an innocent person (those who have not used force first, and have not violated anyone's rights.)\n \n [*]A volitional society does not have taxes (wealth removed on the authority of the collective not consent)\n\n \n I consent to pay those taxes of my own volition.\n \n \n \n[*]A volitional society does not have laws that do not relate to universal morality (such laws must be based of premises that are incompatible with the ones that formed a volitional society).\n\n \n I hope you can sleep after stepping over the dead children who have died homeless and hungey.\n \n \n[*]Since a volitional society is one in which no interaction is non-consensual the only moral economic activity is trade and charity, therefore a volitional society has no public entity with any rights save the impossible occasion of complete consensus.\n\n \n I consent to pay taxes so that old people will not have to die in the streets.\n see Mark 12:31\n \n[*]Since there is no public entity all entities with wealth are private and therefore a volitional society is a capitalist society.\n\n \n I consent to pay taxes to the fire department and the police department.\n \n[\n #Note: The term public/private is used in the sense of the original ownership. Clearly someone can make something public by stating it is so. Meaning that the only truly public property is always a gift save for the impossibility of complete consensus.\n \n To those who take the negative, please choose one of the following options:\n [*]Those premises are insufficient to conclude the resolution. (invalid)[*]Those conclusions do not follow from the resolution. (invalid)[*]One (or more) of those premises are wrong -< so the resolution and/or the conclusions are wrong. (unsound)\n\n \n Hence to me taxes are moral and further and I pay them of my own volition.\n See Mark 12:31",

Lets call those people Mayors, Representative, Governors, Council Members and Supervisors similar to what currently exists now. \n \n I assume these people will have a certain degree of latitude to perform their duties and address issues as they arise without having to go to the people every time something happens. I also assume that they will have people to assist them as some of these projects can be large and take a very long time to complete again similar to what currently exists.\n \n So far the two have more in common than they do different, but lets look at the money. Where it comes from on the one hand is from everybody regardless of whether they use all of the things that it is used to build or maintain. This is due to the belief that the cost will be less and the benefits will be greater and makes for a more streamlined process. The alternative is only things that people want at the time are implemented and only by those who want them. That will make everything more expensive and take longer to implement. It is unclear how the use will be restricted to those who paid or how people who move into an area or move out of an area will be effected. Does their interest become something that can be willed or sold? Can someone buy interest others own (if they do) and thereby earn a profit of that interest? \n \n Will the costs to market a proposed project, including answering questions and drumming up support, setting up a way to vote, counting and certifying the vote etc included in the cost? What if it doesn't pass do donors lose that money? \n \n Back to the apartments. We have argued this before but I am still of the opinion that your acceptance of citizenship is by choice and with that comes certain obligations. One of which is taxes. You are free to go to any other country who will accept you just as you can go to any apartment within a city. The landlord or government says this is what I charge and these are the rules take it or leave it.\n \n Your problem is not with taxes since you acknowledge the population does have to pay for these things it uses. Your problem is that someone somewhere is telling you what you will pay for and how much you are going to pay for it. In other words you probably have a problem with authority in almost any form. A volitional society is not going to make that go away. There will still need to be people in charge and they are still going to make stupid choices that negatively impact a large number of people. \n \n The solution is to make government more accountable and for people to participate in their government like it was important. That includes being aware of what their Representative are doing and how it will effect them. The government we have works great on paper and if we can make it closer to that model in real life things would be much more to everybody's liking.",

Lets call those people Mayors, Representative, Governors, Council Members and Supervisors similar to what currently exists now. \n\n I described by implication (partially explicit) what I think an efficient yet moral government would look like in here. I refer to the branch of government which implements government action bills the executive branch. They are a group of elected officials with no power to initiate programs or actions, or to fund them; but with the responsibility of carrying them out. This completely isolates them from the kind of corruption that is possible now, although nothing will solve fraudulent behavior entirely the need for the much lauded check and balance is non-existent here.\n \n \nI assume these people will have a certain degree of latitude to perform their duties and address issues as they arise without having to go to the people every time something happens.\n\n Any latitude they have will be in the context of the authority granted them by the charter of specific bills. Further as a template the executive branch should be establishing organizations and assuring that they accomplish their mandates, which is not the same as running them by far. i.e. a government action bill (public vote and funding) can establish the EPA, give any degree of latitude to some internal EPA hierarchy or give the executive branch wide power over it (the former is more proper to the system) in either case the authority could not exceed the scope of the bills authority. Any government action is primarily limited by it's funding, issues about regulation and such would be a matter of rights and thus should be addressed as laws not government actions.\n \n \nI also assume that they will have people to assist them as some of these projects can be large and take a very long time to complete again similar to what currently exists.\n\n They are the 'assistants' (of the people), and I remind readers that by the people I do not mean a platitude but an efficient computerized public voting system.\n \n The internal flow of the executive branch should be fluid for the most part. i.e. positions should be created as needed as an internal matter, but yes there will be a difference between elected leaders of the executive branch and the non-elected employees of the executive branch. Namely the buck stops at the former.\n \n \nSo far the two have more in common than they do different, but lets look at the money. Where it comes from on the one hand is from everybody regardless of whether they use all of the things that it is used to build or maintain. This is due to the belief that the cost will be less and the benefits will be greater and makes for a more streamlined process.\n\n I assume this option refers to our current predicament. If the bolded belief is truly there then there is no need to maintain by military force such a circumstance, and it will stabilize to such a state even with the freedom to do otherwise.\n \n My comment on the actual difference in efficiency is that there is none, I don't believe the source of the funds has anything to do with how efficiently they are used. I think if Microsoft paid for the LA police department it would work just as well with those funds as if they were paid with tax money.\n \n My comment on the 'streamline-ness' of the process is that while book keeping would be a more serious practical issue in times before this, with modern relational databases that is a mute point. Further that even if the technology didn't exist the scale and accuracy of non-computerized record keeping is sufficient, consider the complexity and magnitude of the IRS; a seemingly endless tax code which thousands of agents ponder the whole year around and try to enforce on 300,000,000 people. If this can be done, recording who has promised to pay what can be done, perhaps easier.\n \n \n \nThe alternative is only things that people want at the time are implemented and only by those who want them.\n\n I would like to point out that the former is a supposed premise of any democracy, and that anyone who would contrast that with the current system is only pointing out how the current system fails to be democratic.\n \n The latter is novel, and the crucial element in making a system moral.\n \n \nThat will make everything more expensive and take longer to implement.\n\n Why? Sure if people are fickle it could lead to the failure of a project, but that is why a project should project it's costs and secure them before starting.\n \n A contractor is not going to build slower because everyone paying for the work did so volitionally, if anything since such a system would necessarily raise awareness of government activities people will be much more keen on the progress of specific actions, and thus oversight will be greater.\n \n \nIt is unclear how the use will be restricted to those who paid or how people who move into an area or move out of an area will be effected.\n\n Whether or not the actions benefits are public will depend (again) on the bill that establishes it. What it is not possible or reasonable to restrict should not be, but what is should be.\n \n A road can be tolled, but a police department cannot only protect 85% of the population, a criminal is a danger to all and by protecting one man they protect all.\n \n If a person leaves an area for another they lose the investment they made to that place and gain from the work that others in their new home have already done. This is the way of free movement and hardly particular to a volitional society.\n \n \nDoes their interest become something that can be willed or sold? Can someone buy interest others own (if they do) and thereby earn a profit of that interest? \n\n Could you clarify, what do you mean interest?\n \n \nWill the costs to market a proposed project, including answering questions and drumming up support, setting up a way to vote, counting and certifying the vote etc included in the cost? \n\n One at a time:\n \nmarket a proposed project\n\n The computer system will have a UI to find and propose bills. I can't tell you who will propose most bills, but I can tell you anyone who has paid for the system has a right to. I predict that among the passed bills the majority will originate from organizations designed to keep up with whats needed. i.e. the EPA proposes a bill to clean an oil spill, or a transportation administration proposes a new highway. Users of the system will no doubt be able to subscribe to certain proposition fronts much like in this very website one can subscribe to a thread, they could be alerted when that organization wants their funding on a bill or they could even have the system automatically accept such requests within a range. Thus if the system is engineered correctly marketing won't be 'necessary' to get something done.\n \n For an individual his only chance of getting real support is word of mouth and in the system searchers finding the idea excellent. The system could easily provide a website front which mirrors the data in the system and thus make all proposals available to online search engines, and makes them linkable.\n \n All that said, if someone or something (a company not a slimy monster :p) wants to propose a bill and wants to advertise for it because it's important to them they would of course have every right to do that.\n \n \nincluding answering questions and drumming up support\n\n The answering of questions and indeed the very quality of the proposal will be as varied as those who can propose them (extremely). If john doe in suburbia proposes a bill, he is unlikely to be able to answer twenty thousand questions; the food and drug administration would be able to.\n \n As an idea gains momentum in the system and in society it could be expanded and modified; certainly with expert advice and projections being added. Again this barrier is only one of proper UI to make a popular variation of the bill known.\n \n I do believe the system would benefit greatly from registering the expertise of users, with verification of credentials the system could collect and display demographics on expert opinions on a bill as opposed to just blind public support.\n \n \nsetting up a way to vote, counting and certifying the vote etc\n\n The way to vote (at least in my ideal volitional society) is as mentioned a computer system which does not need any extra attention to handle the voting for a bill or counting and verifying the vote. The only way to cheat the system would be to provide false biometrics and passwords. Since the system includes the ability to commit funds it would need to be as secure at least as other funding methods such as credit cards.\n \n \nincluded in the cost?\n\n What a bill pays for is specified by the bill, it could explicitly note that it is paying for marketing and answering questions or it could just say the funds are being used by such and such organization to accomplish such and such goal, the only legally binding part would be the such and such goal.\n \n Analysis by experts would be a necessity for most every bill, that would have to be paid for before the bill passes by an auxiliary 'research into bill X' bill, or a general organization with subscribed payments in the executive branch could be responsible for researching bills that gain a certain level of support, although this opens the door to corruption if you are too loose about what should deserve attention and what shouldn't.\n \n \nWhat if it doesn't pass do donors lose that money? \n\n Donors lose what money has been spent by equal shares per dollar (I can't see how it should be otherwise). Money that has not been spent is returned (or never collected).\n \n When someone pledges support to a bill their money is not taken until the bill passes, but they do have a legal obligation to pay what they pledged. Much like a credit card payment does not actually remove the money when you use it, but simply checks to see if the payment could be made.\n \n \nBack to the apartments. We have argued this before but I am still of the opinion that your acceptance of citizenship is by choice and with that comes certain obligations. One of which is taxes. You are free to go to any other country who will accept you just as you can go to any apartment within a city. The landlord or government says this is what I charge and these are the rules take it or leave it.\n\n I remember the old argument, and forgive me but I will just repeat myself. The premise that living in a place is a choice between submission to the powers that be there and leaving is based on an unjustified and outdated feudal concept of sovereignty.\n \n A nation is not like an apartment because a government does not own the nation, it may have built and maintained the society but it is it's own responsibility to keep those benefits away from 'outsiders'. If you want to continue the residence analogy it is like a landlord building a giant tent over a square kilometer, even while admitting that the houses under that tent do not belong to him. While simultaneously claiming that the houses being protected are not his property he begins to charge rent. Surely no one can deny that the tent prevents water damage and so benefits the houses below, but the residents below have every right to challenge the bill they are being sent because they never agreed to it.\n \n When you try to get a room in an apartment building you sign your agreement to pay rent and follow the apartment rules, since the apartment was built by the apartment owner he has the right to keep you out until he promises to let you stay (the contract). Similarly a society, through it's government has the right to keep you from using it's constructs, or going on it's property; but it does not have the right to force you to leave anywhere it claims to protect nor does it have the right to force you not to interact with those who live around you.\n \n I have said before and I stand by the statement that land is not property like a building or car can be property. It is not a human product but a human claim. A claim whose nature is easily seen by the absurdity of claiming other planets and stars. Or how France, England, and Spain claimed vast tracks of land which they had never explored and proceeded in some cases to sell that which they had never seen.\n \n For example, to me, it is not the field that gives the farmer rights over it; but the crops on the field; the product of his effort.\n \n One of the functions of government should be to establish a reasonable system of claims, but on a valid premise such as the one above.\n \n I will use another imaginary scenario, we see in the US that some people think the idea of states under one federal government is a good idea because if one state 'goes bad' people will just move to a better state. Thus they imply that the states are competing for citizens, and that this will keep them good. To some extent this is true, but the unit of a state is arbitrary and as a moral standard unacceptable (it cannot be true that what is moral in this area is immoral in another). The truth is that this supposed mobility between states is just an excuse, if you live in California, and California begins to screw your life up and violate your rights; it is not all 'OK' because you can move to another state. They did not have a right to do what they did.\n \n Let us imagine one state, a united earth. Suppose you didn't want to pay for some of the things that the rest of earth did. Suppose that for whatever reason the majority of earth's people think that everyone should pay 50% of their property and income every year for three hundred years until a thirty mile pyramid dedicated to all the major religions is completed at the fork of the Tigris and Euphrates.\n \n Is citizen ship (which is essentially being a human without space travel) a choice now? Is it true that these pyramid building majority members own the earth itself to declare who may live on it and who may not?\n \n I say no, it is not. It is a planet which they nor their ancestors nor anyone but the living embodiment of gravity has the right to claim as property.\n \n Let's take one step down, there are two states on earth. You happened to be born in pyramid building land, is it true that they have a right to your income and property until you pack up for the other place?\n \n Can you not see how arbitrary and weak this excuse is?\n \n This claim of all land is without any basis but 'might makes right'. How would you respond if I said \"I claim this planet as my country, anyone who does not want to live by my rules get out\"? You would of course reject the notion, but what reason would you give? I would answer (to myself) \"It is not us that need give the reason, by what right do you claim it?\".\n \n So that is what I want to ask you, by what right does your hypothetical closed society claim a vast track of the earth's surface? (I say hypothetical because we must never forget that these issues have never been put to a public vote, instead people have always been asked to vote for a representative to an existing system).\n \n \nYour problem is not with taxes since you acknowledge the population does have to pay for these things it uses.\n\n Yes my problem is with taxes, because a tax is not merely a populations attempt to pay for something. It is the removal by force (if necessary) of wealth irregardless of consent.\n \n To morality all the rest of that about society, the greater good, populations, government; it's all just blurry and irrelavant. To morality the 'irregardless of consent' damns it as evil.\n \n Thus to me, my problem has never been and will never be paying for a government or a society; just theft.\n \n \nYour problem is that someone somewhere is telling you what you will pay for and how much you are going to pay for it.\n\n Your problem with a mugger is that someone somewhere is using your money to pay for what they want.\n \n \nIn other words you probably have a problem with authority in almost any form.\n\n You're right I do. A person is an authority over themselves and their product, everything else is the utilization of nature or a privilege granted of the volition of others.\n \n I do not believe in a being higher than the human mind and the human mind is a property of the individual.\n \n Thus all that can be in honesty called authority is and only can be the extension of individual human minds. The authority of a government is merely the sum of the authorities of the citizens, and no citizen has a right to violate the rights of others. Therefore the government has no right to violate the rights of others. A sum of zeros is zero.\n \n \nA volitional society is not going to make that go away.\n\n You're most correct; it's because of what I believe now that I know a volitional society is the only moral one, it's existence will hardly reverse my beliefs then.\n \n \nThere will still need to be people in charge and they are still going to make stupid choices that negatively impact a large number of people. \n\n Of course, but a mistake; or even outright stupidity is not a moral problem. Theft is.\n \n If you are robbed, the problem is not that the robber bought drugs instead of decent clothes so he could get a job. It's that you were robbed.\n \n \nThe solution is to make government more accountable and for people to participate in their government like it was important.\n\n The solution to the problem of no one feeling responsible for what a society is doing. Not a solution to the problem of a society violating the rights of human beings.\n \n I have talked about a 'good' solution to the former above, the people system. It often my fear that by intermingling the solutions to these two separate problems in my responses, that I somehow link the problems, even imply they are one.\n \n That is why I have tried desperately to argue about ethics, philosophy, and rights separately, without polluting that reasoning with my thoughts on good government. So that people could see that it is greater and fully independent of our possible solutions.\n \n As a final analogy it is like saying that the law of gravitation exists independent of our ability to utilize it in rocket travel. If we cannot utilize it (form a moral society) then we fail, it does not disappear.\n \n \nThat includes being aware of what their Representative are doing and how it will effect them.\n\n What better way to do that then representing yourself?\n \n \nThe government we have works great on paper and if we can make it closer to that model in real life things would be much more to everybody's liking.\n\n There we must disagree again. I think the U.S. government has worked as well as it could given it's constraints and founding documents. Indeed compared to other nations it has proven itself strong, but that does not mean it cannot be improved upon, or even like the parliament of great britain and the magna carta provide a starting point for a new vision of government.\n \n While it is possible that it could be modified to create a volitional society, it shall never have been designed from the start with that in mind. Don't get me wrong, this does not mean we can't have a peaceful transition between government types as their are provisions for changing the constitution.\n \n I am just saying that by the time that it is a government dedicated to moral integrity and not just neutral to the same most would agree that it has basicaly been 'rewritten'.\n \n \nIn order for Utopian Paradise to work every single human within that society would have to be cut from the same \"moral\" cloth, so to speak. Everyone would have to agree with the ridiculous claim that taxes are Immoral.\n\n Perhaps in order for utopian paradise to exist, but not for a volitonal society.\n \n In our society not everyone agrees that it is wrong to murder, steal, rape, and defraud others. That does not mean the society accepts these beleifs as valid. These people are called criminals. In a volitional society some may believe they have the right to steal for a greater good (tax), but if they ever acted on their beliefs they would be criminals.\n \n \nEveryone would have to agree to Pay something or risk being left out of this society.\n\n You may have the caveman insticnt to throw anyone who doesn't help you pay for everything you want to pay for out of your society; I do not.\n \n I do not have a right to force someone out of society, nor do I have the inclination just because they value different things than me.\n \n Everyone would not have to pay for everything, that is the fallacy which you to date have not established yet continue to rely on. Only enough people to pay for something need to pay for it for it to operate. You yourself have mentioned the fact that in the U.S.A many people do not pay taxes. If this is true (it is) then by your own admission everyone does not have to pay for societies laws or actions for them to 'work', voluntarily or otherwise.\n \n \nTaxes are a necessary part of existing within a society which is overseen by an elected governing body. \n\n Prove it.\n \n \nTaxes are not Immoral...\n\n \nTaxation is immoral, this is why.\n \n If you do not wish to argue, don't respond.
