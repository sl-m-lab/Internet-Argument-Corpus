Once they phoned the police saying their dad had just been shot and was dead and the men were coming after them it took the police 9 HOURS TO RESPOND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n \n 9 HOURS, Not minutes HOURS!

   "The only honorable thing for Australia to do now is bow out of the \"other developed nations\" club.\n \n They disallow the use of private firearms for defensive purposes, forcing the people to rely on the police for protection. And when the report called in mentions a violent murder having just taken place, it takes the police nine hours to finally arrive.\n \n What would the response time be for somebody trying to forcibly enter the house, 37 hours?\n \n Doesn't sound like much of a developed nation to me. Excessively slow police response times, when the police are your only protection, is a sign of backwater status. This is what you'd expect from countries like Africa or Mexico.",
