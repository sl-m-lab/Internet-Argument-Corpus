My absolute favorite band is Cannibal Corpse (though I think the name's kind of repulsive). Other ones I like are Nile, Six Feet Under, Carcass, and I heard a few songs by Exhumed that I liked. I hate the lyrical content, but other than that, Deicide is pretty good.\n \n Though I seriosly think Chris Barnes should leave Six Feet Under. If you listen to their newer songs, you'll see that his vocals are getting pretty weak because his throat is wearing. I'm not a doctor, but he'll probably damage his throat if he keeps singing.",
