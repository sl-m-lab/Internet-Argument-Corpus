   "When I read the naive views of the left here and elsewhere regarding terrorism and Iraq I am reminded of the lull preceding WWII. Here is some history of that time. They say that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Evidently the left has learned nothing. But then they never do. But I'll be damned if I am going to ignore it. \n ===================================\n \n \"The Phony War\" October 1939 - April 1940\n \n After the initial terror of the Polish campaign, everyone expected heavy combat, like the summer of 1914. The British Expeditionary Force landed in France, British children were sent to Canada or the countryside; At various times, neutral Belgium and Holland braced for invasion.\n \n The heavy combat in France did not immediately materialize. Instead, the warring nations settled into a lull in fighting. The British press dubbed it the \"sitzkrieg\" - the expected terror of Total War had not yet emerged. Overlooked was the hot war in the Atlantic. British merchantmen were fighting for their lives to keep Britain supplied with resources.\n \n What was happening was futile attempts by both sides to negotiate an end to the war that would not embarrass either side. Germany reached out to the Allies through Holland. Since the British held that Germany should recall her forces from Poland, there was not much leeway for either side to get out with a favorable position to both sides.\n \n Underscoring the U-boat menace was the swift and silent entry into Scapa Flow of U-47, commanded by G\u00fcnther Prien on October 14, 1939. Prien slipped past sunken ships and chains that were used as antisubmarine nets, and sank the HMS Royal Oak with heavy loss of life. Hitler personally decorated Prien.\n \n The only other notable confrontation took place in December 1939 off the coast of Uruguay. The German Pocket Battleship Admiral Graf Spee, a heavy cruiser armed with 15\" guns, was chased into Montevideo by three British cruisers. Much to Hitler's dismay, the captain landed his crew, scuttled the ship, and killed himself. The Allies, desperate for victories, made a bigger deal of the Battle of the River Plate than its actual military significance. It did end a surface threat to the merchant lifeline to the United States and the Dominions. The U-boats were taking a fearful toll that was not generally reported.\n \n In the meantime, many opportunities were lost. The French did not fortify their border with Belgium, although a French officer had proved it was vulnerable during war games in 1938. The troops in the Maginot Line did not move - they did not conduct maneuvers at all, precluding the possibility that they might be needed somewhere else, like to invade Germany. The French Army had gone to ground, a bad mentality to have in fluid, mobile warfare.\n \n The Phony War did lull many French and British citizens into a false sense of complacency, thinking the Germans would not prove to have the mettle to invade the vaunted Maginot Line.\n \n Also, the weather in the Winter of 1939 precluded blitzkrieg. In April 1940, the Allies and Germany came to blows over Norway. On May 10, 1940, the \"Phony War\" came to a swift and terrible end with the invasion of France and the low countries. The Germans went around the Maginot Line, counting on its garrison to remain in place. The Phony War was over; Total War had arrived.\n \n http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/phonywar.htm",

   "When I read the naive views of the left here and elsewhere regarding terrorism and Iraq I am reminded of the lull preceding WWII. Here is some history of that time. They say that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Evidently the left has learned nothing. But then they never do. But I'll be damned if I am going to ignore it. \n ===================================\n \n \"The Phony War\" October 1939 - April 1940\n \n After the initial terror of the Polish campaign, everyone expected heavy combat, like the summer of 1914. The British Expeditionary Force landed in France, British children were sent to Canada or the countryside; At various times, neutral Belgium and Holland braced for invasion.\n \n The heavy combat in France did not immediately materialize. Instead, the warring nations settled into a lull in fighting. The British press dubbed it the \"sitzkrieg\" - the expected terror of Total War had not yet emerged. Overlooked was the hot war in the Atlantic. British merchantmen were fighting for their lives to keep Britain supplied with resources.\n \n What was happening was futile attempts by both sides to negotiate an end to the war that would not embarrass either side. Germany reached out to the Allies through Holland. Since the British held that Germany should recall her forces from Poland, there was not much leeway for either side to get out with a favorable position to both sides.\n \n Underscoring the U-boat menace was the swift and silent entry into Scapa Flow of U-47, commanded by G\u00fcnther Prien on October 14, 1939. Prien slipped past sunken ships and chains that were used as antisubmarine nets, and sank the HMS Royal Oak with heavy loss of life. Hitler personally decorated Prien.\n \n The only other notable confrontation took place in December 1939 off the coast of Uruguay. The German Pocket Battleship Admiral Graf Spee, a heavy cruiser armed with 15\" guns, was chased into Montevideo by three British cruisers. Much to Hitler's dismay, the captain landed his crew, scuttled the ship, and killed himself. The Allies, desperate for victories, made a bigger deal of the Battle of the River Plate than its actual military significance. It did end a surface threat to the merchant lifeline to the United States and the Dominions. The U-boats were taking a fearful toll that was not generally reported.\n \n In the meantime, many opportunities were lost. The French did not fortify their border with Belgium, although a French officer had proved it was vulnerable during war games in 1938. The troops in the Maginot Line did not move - they did not conduct maneuvers at all, precluding the possibility that they might be needed somewhere else, like to invade Germany. The French Army had gone to ground, a bad mentality to have in fluid, mobile warfare.\n \n The Phony War did lull many French and British citizens into a false sense of complacency, thinking the Germans would not prove to have the mettle to invade the vaunted Maginot Line.\n \n Also, the weather in the Winter of 1939 precluded blitzkrieg. In April 1940, the Allies and Germany came to blows over Norway. On May 10, 1940, the \"Phony War\" came to a swift and terrible end with the invasion of France and the low countries. The Germans went around the Maginot Line, counting on its garrison to remain in place. The Phony War was over; Total War had arrived.\n \n http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/phonywar.htm\n\n Hi Lol,\n You have really done a great job by collecting so much information about phony war. Till today i have only a little idea in this topic. As i have read some where that after declaration of world war2 there is no reall fighting for almost 2-3 months. This period in the history is known as phony war. Present situation in the world is alarming and if america does not change their policy the world will face once again a devasting battle so called world war3.\n ----------------------------------------\n Patrick\n We learn only one thing from history that we donot learn any thing from hiostory.",
