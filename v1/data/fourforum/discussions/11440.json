The last 7 years of Republican rule has resulted in so much red ink that our solvency as a country is in question. This tax cut alone was likely paid for entirely with borrowed money that will have to be paid back at some point with interest. That is by definition a loan. All tax cuts that are not meant with a decrease in spending are nothing more then mortgaging the future to pay for today. There is a clear reason why Reagan and Bush Jr. have presided over the two largest increases in debt in US history. \n \n Neither candidate is the deficit hawk/fiscal conservative we need to get back into the black.",

Until the US becomes a price setter, which is technically impossible given how little we have, we will be dependent on foreign oil. XXXXXX across this country have some idiotic notion that pumping more here frees us from the commodity trading framework that spans the globe. That pumping oil off the coast of California will somehow mean cheaper oil here that is not priced based on a variety of factors, most of which we have no control over. Unless we can pump millions of barrels in the next few years daily, prices won't change at all. Last I checked, estimated production off the coast of Florida is only expected to be around 900,000 barrels a day. Saudi Arabia threw its 800,000 spare capacity at the world volume and priced did not move.\n \n Pickens is correct, We cannot drill ourselves out of this problem. \n \n Frankly, I'd rather save that oil for more important things, such as fertilizer. We can eventually power our lives on alternative. Good luck trying to power our agriculture without oil based fertilizers. One of the most important, if not important discoveries on all Mankind was how to fix nitrogen. We frankly need our oil for food. Not transportation.",

That neither side is hellbent to reduce spending? That many government \"employees\" do not actually work? You can take one look at our congressmen's records and see that some of them do no work. You can watch five men on a government maintenance crew standing around watching two men work and conclude that their paycheck is a dole. There are more people on the government payrolls at the national, state and local levels than are required to do the work. That means that some of them at any one time are on the dole. What more evidence do you need rather than to look around you? Government is the most inefficient method we have of accomplishing some worthy goals...and some of the goals that governments attempt to accomplish are not worth the money spent doing it. Our governement entities are often worse than labor unions replete with featherbedding free-loaders, employed by some friend that got elected to a job that has hiring powers attached. There are many people in government positions simply for the money only. They don't really have to produce...so they don't. It's these people I would cut from the dole.\n \n I noticed you did not quote my first two sentences. Does that mean you need no evidence of that point?",
