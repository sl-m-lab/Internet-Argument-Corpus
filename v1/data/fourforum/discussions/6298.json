   "Firstly, this is probably the wrong forum, but the correct forum (law/society I guess), is a bit lifeless, so the thread can reside here for a bit.\n \n What do you think of laws 'forcing' equality? For example men and women:\n \n A man and a woman both apply for a job. They are identical in terms of personality and qualifications. Logically, the employer should employ the man, as the man can't get pregnant. As such it makes sense to employ the man over the woman. Is this fair? Or would a law disallowing employers to choose employees based on sexuality be sensible?\n \n On the flipside, men, on average, commit more crime than women. As such, should they pay more tax that goes to law enforcement? Is this fair? They're being disadvantaged based purely on their gender?\n \n Comments?\n \n -Wez",

   "It would be OK if we were at point zero, with all factors reevaluated. However, we are not. Our decisions are already bundled with so much prejudice it is not possible to achieve neutral fact evaluation, meaning that the only way to achieve balance is to force it.\n \n Essentially, there is so much rust on one side of the scale, that we need to add a few weights to the other side to make it balance. (rust was chosen for the allegory intentionally - it can't be removed, too much of the iron making up the scale is already oxidized)",
