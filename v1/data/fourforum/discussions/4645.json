   "Testimony in Support of h-5660 \n Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee\n April 12, 2005\n Presented by:\n Joe Brummer\n \n Good Evening Chairman Flaherty and members of the House Judiciary Committee. My name is XXXXXXX and I am here today to request your support on bill H-5660, which would expand the definition of marriage to include same sex couples in Rhode Island. I am not here to give you the story of how same sex marriage would benefit just me and my partner, but also to explain how this legislation is also in the best interest of the State of Rhode Island. Others will come to you today and talk of how same sex marriage is a moral, equal, civil right to extend to those loving couples regardless of gender. I fully support those arguments, but want to go a step further, understanding, you may feel the Ocean State is not ready for this legislation, but really it is a concept whose time has come. \n \n In a recent episode of the cartoon show \"The Simpson's\", the cartoon state legalize same sex marriage to gain on the financial benefits from increased sales tax on weddings, tourism, and those who would choose to move there because it had become gay friendly. As entertaining as that show may have been, it is not that far from the reality of today's world. Art was reflecting life. Economists at the university of Massachusetts estimate the state of Connecticut stands to gain 3 million dollars in revenues should same sex marriages become legal in that state. The majority of those monies would be gained in sales taxes on wedding ceremonies, increased tourism and those who may move to the state based on the gay friendly atmosphere. San Francisco had 4,000 same sex couples in a short time come to marry, with their checkbooks in hand. In Oregon 2,968 couples showed with their check books in hand. \n \n Imagine for yourself, the thousands of couples who raced to Massachusetts, San Francisco, New Mexico, Oregon and New Patlz when gay marriages became legal in those places, if even for a short time. Imagine the money spent on hotels, flowers, wedding dresses (regardless of who was wearing them). Imagine the money spent in restaurants and other activities while in those places. Imagine all that money coming into a state where the economy could use the increase tourism and revenues. Imagine that is The State Rhode Island. All in one motion, this state could solve financial difficulty and spread equality for its citizens and others wishing to marry and are willing to come to the Ocean State. \n \n Equality is not just a word used to describe same sex marriage; it is a word that has other moral, historical and legal value. Those values could also equal something that benefits the Ocean State. \n \n ________________________________________\n any suggestions would help! Please stick with the angle I am aiming for.",
