Is it to do with guns too?\n\n \n I can't speak for every American but personally I respect anyone who has been in the military because they perform a dangerous and necessary function for our country. For the president it is an even bigger issue because he is going to be given the highest authority in the most powerful country in the entire world and of course part of what the US does is to help police the world. Major military action is not that uncommon in a 4 year period for the US military so it isn't a bad thing to have some experience in the military when you are the commander-in-chief.\n \n If they have the guts to say that they want to become our president then I'm always glad to see that they also had the guts to risk their lives for this country.",

Wow!)\n G W Bush - Air Force Reserves (he never reported for duty to his Louisiana reserve unit when he moved to Louisiana, and never reported back to his Texas unit when he came back.)\n \n You should remember that almost every generation has had some war and that military service was mandatory after WWII for all physically able males until 1973. Virtually every male that I have ever known of my age is a veteran and served somewhere.\n \nAnother trend amonst US Presidents is that they are all Protestant, except for one, and he was shot to death.\n\n Actually, that's not true. Washington = Deist, Adams = Unitarian, Jefferson = Deist, Madison = Deist, Monroe = Deist, Adams = Unitarian. Don't know after that but Lincoln's wife decried the fact that he was an atheist.\n \nSo, does that mean that in order to be President, you need to be a white, male, Protestant with a miliatary background?\n\n Not by law. You need only be born a US Citizen, never been convicted of a felony, and be of proper age. However, recently fundamentalist christianity has had some influence on elections and they have in effect, hijacked conservatism and the Republican party. Isn't it ironic that Reagan used to consult with the Moral Majority while his wife consulted astrologers. When it came time for a decision, Reagen listened to his wife.",
