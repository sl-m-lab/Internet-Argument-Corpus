   "I believe we in the US are well aware of our federal government's successful move to eliminate constitutional rights of assembly and free speech with legislation that now restricts those rights to defined, policed areas well removed from federal offices and public appearances of federal officials.\n \n In Oregon a new form of protest restriction has been introduced by the feds in closing roads leading to logging operations of timber sales of old growth on federal land. These logging operations are currently being protested by lawsuits based on roadless wilderness legislation being bypassed by the US Forest Service selling timber in wilderness areas to be harvested by winning bidders.\n \n The US forest Service has closed to the public all roads facilitating these logging operations to eliminate protests by individuals or groups. Local law enforcement agencies have been instructed to arrest any and all protesters using those roads under a federal law defined as interfering with an agricultural operation. \n \n Wake up America, before you have zero rights.",
