   "One day a florist goes to a barber for a haircut. After the cut he asked about his bill and the barber replies: \"I'm sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I'm doing community service this week\"\n \n \n \n The florist is pleased and leaves the shop. Next morning when the barber goes to open there is a thank you card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door.\n \n \n Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he goes to pay his bill the barber again replies: \"I'm sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I'm doing community service this week.\"\n \n The cop is happy and leaves the shop. Next morning when the barber goes to open up there is a thank you card and a dozen donuts waiting for him at his door.\n \n Later a Republican comes in for a haircut, and when he goes to pay his bill the barber again replies: \"I'm sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I'm doing community service this week.\"\n \n The Republican is very happy and leaves the shop. Next morning when the barber goes to open, there is a thank you card and a dozen different books such as \"How to improve your business and Becoming more successful\".\n \n Then a Democrat comes in for a haircut, and when he goes to pay his bill the barber again replies: \"I'm sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I'm doing community service this week.\" The Democrat is very happy and leaves the shop.\n \n The next morning when the barber goes to open up, there are a dozen Democrats lined up waiting for a free haircut.",
