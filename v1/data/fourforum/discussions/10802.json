They just present their respective brands of statism in different ways. In the Democratic Party, big-government liberalism is alive, well, robust, and vibrant. \n \n Hillary might resume \"third way\" Clintonian politics if she wins the nomination, but for now, she's bragging that her healthcare plan is more Marxist than Barack's. \n \n But for Republicans, there's a fierce intramural debate not just over how conservative the party should be but also over the very definition of conservatism. \n \n This debate wouldn't be as significant if it were limited to the candidates alone, but a growing number of conservative intellectuals have also surrendered to the oxymoronic notion that conservatism must adapt to survive as a powerful political force in this nation. \n \n Former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum is an example. In his new book, \"Comeback, Conservatism That Can Win Again,\" he argues that Republicans need a new approach because they can no longer win elections on the conservative ideas that catapulted them to power in the 1980s. \n\n \n =snip=",

Fairly large parts of the Constitution are vague, not specifically noting this or that but giving an general notion of what we should or should not do, yet on the other hand, it makes it damn clear about many issues. It seems, at least IMO, that the Founders realized that life in 150 years (assuming we made it that far and they had doubts) was going to the same, and that new issues would need to be interpreted, yet they knew that they needed to make several issues of utmost importance clear to future generations. You're an accountant yeah? The Constitution is like GAAS with some GAAP.\n \n For instance, the Constitution clearly states what powers the office of the Presidency has. Obviously Bush has disregarded that entirely. Imperial Presidents have almost always been bad news and the precedents they create are even worse.

Will the same happen to the USA?\n\n \n But before Reagan became the puppet, he wanted to dominate the Middle East. He wanted the oil, the wealth, the world superiority, and an independence of The American Nation for centuries to come. His administration showed uncanny loyalty and devotion to his ideals. He was to be the great american king. \n \n Even George H.W. Bush was passable for a Reagan successor. He was clear and decisive in his middle east policy. The action on Iraq was justified and respectable. No nation has the right to invade it's neighbor anymore. It was clear, it was decisive, it was effective. \n \n Then Clinton interupts, but still does a decent enough job watching the kingdom. Great economic guy, but hey...the only hunting for terrorists this guy did was checking his interns and secretaries for implanted listening devices. His greatest contribution may have been don't ask...don't tell, and keeping us from recession for a few extra years. \n \n Then along comes this lovable little duffus. Sorry folks, not the best choice within the great pool of successors. The Republicans could have certainly picked a better guy than our very own Captain Ahab. He has damaged the reputation, respect and authority that Reagans administration had built, and Clinton had somehow managed not to destroy. The ideal that we did not go picking fights...we simply monitored and dealt with current threats. We ran a passive but readily mobile and deadly military. We acted decisively and with purpose...we had the respect and support of our allies...We weilded our power judiciously. We were still the economic driving source of the middle east. \n \n Bush dropped the ball. Plain and simple...oops. \n \n What now frightens me more and more every day is the fact that nobody with any good ideas is even involved in politics anymore. There are a few, but they never seem to float to the surface. While still not earning my vote, Ron Paul has some damn good ideas. He is the last of a dying breed. \n \n However I fear American politics will suffer for years to come after this election. We have taken the terms liberal and conservative to extremes to describe basically one entire class of Americans. They have all become crooks and thieves, corporate whores with desire for power and wealth. I fear regardless of the outcome of this election, America is going to take a turn. I'm guessing it will be a turn for the worse. Given our choices at this point, we are in trouble. I see no miracle workers among the current crop. \n \n Strap in folks, and pull your belts tight.",

   "But before Reagan became the puppet, he wanted to dominate the Middle East. He wanted the oil, the wealth, the world superiority, and an independence of The American Nation for centuries to come. His administration showed uncanny loyalty and devotion to his ideals. He was to be the great american king. \n \n Even George H.W. Bush was passable for a Reagan successor. He was clear and decisive in his middle east policy. The action on Iraq was justified and respectable. No nation has the right to invade it's neighbor anymore. It was clear, it was decisive, it was effective. \n \n Then Clinton interupts, but still does a decent enough job watching the kingdom. Great economic guy, but hey...the only hunting for terrorists this guy did was checking his interns and secretaries for implanted listening devices. His greatest contribution may have been don't ask...don't tell, and keeping us from recession for a few extra years. \n \n Then along comes this lovable little duffus. Sorry folks, not the best choice within the great pool of successors. The Republicans could have certainly picked a better guy than our very own Captain Ahab. He has damaged the reputation, respect and authority that Reagans administration had built, and Clinton had somehow managed not to destroy. The ideal that we did not go picking fights...we simply monitored and dealt with current threats. We ran a passive but readily mobile and deadly military. We acted decisively and with purpose...we had the respect and support of our allies...We weilded our power judiciously. We were still the economic driving source of the middle east. \n \n Bush dropped the ball. Plain and simple...oops.\n\n \n I would agree, to a point. I think all that has to be understood in the context that 9/11 was sort of sea change historically for this country. I suspect most any president in the post-9/11 political climate would have done a number of things Bush did and is being blamed for--note that many of the Democrats initially supported the action in Iraq. That's not to condone Bush's actions; I do think he went too far on a number of things. But I think part of that is simply that our country and it's govt. didn't have a good sense of how to react after such an event as a major terrorist attack on our soil. I think any number of people in Bush's position might have made some of the same decisions in regard to homeland security and foreign policy. I think Bush's has been way too slow to change back to a more acceptable approach though.",

They favor spending policies that promote huge debts and deficits? They favor unbalanced budgets with absolutely no realistic hope of making ends meet without going further into debt? They favor more government that gets into our lives on an personal level? Your group bashes tax and spend people, yet their proposals of matching expenditures with income is far more balanced then saddling the future generations with debt. So economics Conservatives literally ignore every deficit and debt Hawk in the party for 7 years, leaving them out of spending committees, discussions on spending bills and giving them treatment similar to the Democrats? What kind of economic Conservative votes to increase the debt level?",
