   "And people in the U.S. are bellyaching with $2.25 a gallon gas. (I'm paying about $2.08 where I live.) Meet the Norwegians; supposedly the world's wealthiest people. Yeah, sure.\n ========================\n \n The $6.66-a-Gallon Solution\n By SIMON ROMERO\n \n Published: April 30, 2005\n \n OSLO, April 23 - Car owners in the United States may grumble as the price of gasoline hovers around $2.25 a gallon. Here in Norway, home to perhaps the world's most expensive gasoline, drivers greeted higher pump prices of $6.66 a gallon with little more than a shrug...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Gasoline, of course, is not the only expensive commodity in Norway, a traditionally frugal and highly taxed nation. At a pub in Oslo, for instance, a pint of beer might cost the equivalent of $12 and an individual frozen pizza $16. But expensive gasoline is rare among large oil-producing countries that often subsidize fuel for their citizens. Gasoline prices in Norway - with a currency, the krone, strong in comparison with the dollar - have climbed 30 percent since 1998, outpacing a 15 percent increase in the consumer price index in that period, the national statistics bureau said.\n \n Having the world's highest gasoline prices is just one strategy to combat greenhouse gases in this redoubt of welfare capitalism and strict environmental laws. Overall energy consumption, especially of electricity, is quite high, however, with Norway blessed with not just oil but ample hydropower resources.\n \n Norway not only taxes its gasoline. Norwegians also pay automobile taxes as high as $395 a year for each vehicle, and in Oslo there is even a \"studded-tire\" fee of about $160 for vehicles with all-terrain tires that tear up asphalt more quickly in the winter...\n \n (Snip)\n \n \"Our government has been grateful to use the automobile as a supreme tax object,\" Mr. Eriksen said. \"The car is its milking cow.\"\n \n Perhaps as a result of such policies, Norway has lower levels of car ownership than other European countries, with 427 cars per 1,000 people in 2003 compared with more than 500 cars per 1,000 people in both France and Germany, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The United States has more than 700 cars per 1,000 people.\n \n The average age of a passenger car in Norway is 18 years when it is scrapped,\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/business/worldbusiness/30norway.html",
