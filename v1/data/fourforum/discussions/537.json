   "Firstly, the 'religion' I call into question here is that of dogmatic belief; the adherence to religious beliefs and customs simply because a religious text states them, generally found in people who have been raised to be religious by their elders. Importantly, the belief that their particular beliefs are correct, and that they have no doubt whatsoever of this. \n Now, we must ask, what does it mean to be human? Although we are no more than animals, it is obvious that there is something that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Many people call this consciousness, but this doesn't answer the question, it only raises new ones.\n Some people would claim that to be 'conscious' is to be aware of our surroundings. However, animals are clearly aware of their surroundings, just as we are. They are also constantly offered multiple choices of action and must decide which is the best course to take. Perhaps to be human is to have a sense of self - \"cogito ergo sum\"? Yet it is bizarre to propose that animals do no 'know' they are alive. Many of the more advanced life-forms display a clear perception of their role in a community, the distribution of authority and display characteristics which distinguish them from their fellows, a kind of 'personality'. \n We can also observe that animals do not like change, and in general do not adapt well to it if it is sudden. This is why very few species are capable of living under all conditions, and why many go extinct.\n We can reason that animals do not advance (or at any rate advance only as fast as evolution allows, and no more) because of a kind of inbuilt attitude, which could be attributed to brain size. A bird does not 'question' why a nest is built a certain way; it simply accepts that it is. Animals do not question anything; they accept that things are the way they are because they are; they have no concept of 'to question'. The way they do things is just the way it is. \n But what of the crows that crack open nuts by dropping them in front of cars? This can be explained by the Skinner box (whereby chickens were put in a box which had button in it, and every time they button is pressed, food is delivered - they quickly learned to peck the button in order to get food). It shows that animals can establish a relationship between cause and effect. They remember past examples and use these examples to help them make decisions. The crows know that dropping a nut in front of a car (presumably this happened by accident at first) once resulted in the nut being cracked open. It presumably does not understand why, but thanks to the Skinner box we can understand why they keep on doing it.\n So, we can see that this does not constitute a 'technology' or a genuine advance. The same goes for some apes use of 'tools' to obtain grubs and so on. They have not actually reasoned why the tools should be used, to them they use the tools (sticks) because they get food that way. Why do the tools work? They just do; the apes do not question this or anything else. This attitude would explain the lack of true animal 'technology' for all the millions of years life has existed.\n Now we can see what sets humans apart. They do not simply accept things, they question them. Why do things work, how do they work, how can we make them better? This leads to advancement and understanding. Nothing is the way it is because 'it just is' - what are the reasons behind it? Even if there are 'brute facts' of this nature, even if the laws of the universe work because 'they just do', humans will never be content with this, and will always seek to understand more. \n But this is the very opposite of religious belief as described in my first paragraph. \n How do you know the Bible is right?\n \"It is the word of God.\"\n How do you know?\n \"It says it is.\"\n How do you know it is telling the truth about this?\n \"I just know.\"\n \n That is what this sort of religious belief comes down to, in the end. Some people claim to have more justification for 'knowing' their God is the real one, but behind all the fallacies and contrived logic, it comes down to some variation of \"It just is true.\"\n At this point in time, it seems as if humans evolved, that we have a past in which our ancestors were at one point no more than animals. And so, perhaps it is in some people's nature to have a disposition to cling on to such basic thinking. Perhaps people want to believe that some things 'just are', because at one point everyone thought like that. It is part of our make up. \n That is my hypothesis that religions are the remnants of our animal past. \n \n *I orginally posted this on the old forum but upon seeing this new one assumed that no-one goes to the old one any more*",

It is part of our make up. \n That is my hypothesis that religions are the remnants of our animal past. \n\n \n It is interesting that the statement has been made that religion is a regression back into animalistic behavior. If there has been a regression this implies a progression. But how has this human species progressed? Paradigm shift cannot answer this, as you will note he says, \"Although we are no more than animals, it is obvious that there is something that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.\" Then he goes on to say, \"it seems as if humans evolved, that we have a past in which our ancestors were at one point no more than animals.\" Seeming contradictions...we are only animals but something seperates us  from the animal kingdom...and we have a past in which our ancestors were nothing more than animals. If we are currently simple animals then why must we look to the past to see our ancestors that were \"nothing more than animals.\" We can look in the mirror. And if we are more than animal, then necessarily we cannot be \"only animals.\" \n \n Perhaps, we have remained animals but simply progressed to a superior level in the animal kingdom. But how do we as simply superior animals judge ourselves to be better than the other animal groups? We don't simply dominate other animals, we also judge ourselves superior to them. From whence comes judgment? Does the King of the Jungle judge himself to be king or is he king due to his might with total lack of awareness of this kingship? To elaborate, if we are acting in the realm of the animal kingdom then how do we possess something outside of the realm of every other animal that allows insight and judgment? (P. shift wrote on some of this) \n \n To the idea of dogma. It is interesting that dogma is proposed as a regression to animalistic behavior when it is the very thing that proposes a higher being than animalism. How can this be so? How can an animal, regressing to animalistic behavior be proposing something higher than the order of animals? \n \n And what are we to say of the atheist? The dogmatic human has progressed to its humanity then regressed to his animal behavior. But he has progressed as the regression implies. In regard to atheism there are several possibilities to consider:\n \n 1. The atheist has progressed to humanhood (superior to animals) but held his position because he has not allowed himself to regress with dogma.  But how does an atheist progress past the animal kingdom if he does not believe in something outside of the animal kingdom? Something superior to the animal? A higher power? Can evolution explain?Unfortunately, evolution will not take us past the animal kingdom either. So one remains with the dogs, dolphins, and lions.\n \n 2. The atheist has never progressed to a higher level than the other animals. He is not able to regress with dogma because he has made no progression from which to regress. Is there room for regression? \n \n 3. The atheist has progressed to humanhood and then regressed by embracing a different dogma than that of religion. The atheist has regressed by embracing the dogma of materialistic determination.The atheist has progressed past the animal into humanhood. But if he has progressed to humanhood does he not refute himself being that he believes only in the animal and nothing more?? And if he has regressed with his materialist dogma than he is on the same level as the religious regressor.\n \n Make note of the fact that the atheist also \"importantly, believes that their particular beliefs are correct, and that they have no doubt whatsoever of this.\" (paraphrased from paradigm shift). If the atheist had doubt than he could consider spiritualism. But if he does than he ceases to be atheist. (As a side not...Would I believe something that I thought was incorrect? If so, then why believe it? Thus the religious believe their beliefs are correct. Secondly, if I believe the dogma of one religion to be correct must I exclude the other religion as incorrect? Of course (saying nothing on the idea of tolerance--just belief)).\n \n To see an elaboratation of this assertion in more eloquent terms, see the quote in my next post...\"A Christian is only restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted. He cannot think Christianity false and continue to be a Christian; and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be an atheist.\" G.K. Chesterton in Orthodoxy \n \n Now, paradigm shift and others, I addressed the original post considering atheism versus theism (particularly Christianity). Perhaps you prefer spirituality without dogma to spirituality with dogma. But if this is the case then the animal theory is also obliterated. For what animal thinks of the spiritual?\n \n You seem to paint religion as lacking intellect and very repressive and boxed. I see it just the opposite. Personally, I prefer the romantic dogma of theism to the monotone fatalistic dogma of theism/materialism.\n \n Peace.",

   "Here is the quote I spoke of in my previous post by G.K. Chesterton in his book Orthodoxy: \"For we must remember that the materialist philosophy (whether true or not) is certainly much more limiting than any religion. In one sense, of course, all intelligent ideas are narrow. They cannot be broader than themselves. A Christian is only restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted. He cannot think Christianity false and continue to be a Christian; and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be an atheist.  But as it happens, there is a very special sense in which materialism has more restrictions than spiritualism. Mr. McCabe thinks me a slave because I am not allowed to believe in determinism. I think Mr. McCabe a slave because he is not allowed to believe in fairies. But if we examine the two vetoes we shall see that his is really much more of a pure veto than mine. The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe. But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracles. Poor Mr. McCabe is not allowed to retain even the tiniest imp, though it might be hiding in a pimpernel. The Christian admits that the universe is manifold and even miscellaneous, just as a sane man knows that he is complex.The sane man knows that he has a touch of the beast, a touch of the devil, a touch of the saint, a touch of the citizen. Nay, the really sane man knows that he has a touch of the madman. But the materialist's world is quite simple and solid, just as the madman is quite sure he is sane. The materialist is sure that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation, just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that he is simply and solely a chicken. Materialists and madmen never have doubts.\n \n Spiritual doctrines do not actually limit the mind as do materialistic denials.  Even if I believe in immortality I need not think about it. But if I disbelieve in immortality I must not think about it. In the first case the road is open and I can go as far as I like; in the second the road is shut...Now it is the charge against the main deductions of the materialist that, right or wrong, they gradually destroy his humanity; I do not mean only kindness, I mean hope, courage, poetry, initiative, all that is human. For instance, when materialism leads men to complete fatalism (as it generally does), it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense a liberating force. It is absurd to say that you are especially advancing freedom when you only use free thought to destroy free will.  The determinists come to bind, not to loose. They may well call their law the 'chain' of causation. It is the worst chain that ever fettered a human being. You may use the language of liberty, if you like, about materialistic teaching, but it is obvious that this is just as inapplicable to it as a whole as the same language when applied to a man locked up in a mad house. You may say, if you like, that the man is free to think himself a poached egg. But it is surely a more massive and important fact that if he is a poached egg he is not free to eat, drink, sleep, walk, or smoke a cigarette. Similarly you may say, if you like, that the bold determinist speculator is free to disbelieve in the reality of the will. But it is a much more massive and important fact that he is not free to raise, to curse, to thank, to justify, to urge, to punish, to resist temptations, to incite mobs, to make New Year resolutions, to pardon sinners, to rebuke tyrants, or even to say 'thank you' for the mustard...\"",

   "No. Religion isn't a regression to animalistic behaviour, it is a step above.\n \n A dog that I had was deathly afraid of thunder (and fireworks). She cowered and wouldn't leave my side. If I sat down, she jumped in my lap and buried her head under my arm. She made no attempt to appease the storm, she only clung to me with the apparent belief that I would protect her from the noise. Her faith was rewarded. In every case, by huddling in my arms, she was preserved from harm. She became so confident of my powers to protect her that after several years she no longer cowered, but was content to lay quietly in my lap, as long as I carressed her.\n \n That dog was an animal and she behaved as one when frightened. I don't see religion as a regression to that state. Religion is a step up. It is an effort to appease the thunder and lightening. It is a recognition that in every case that certain rituals intended to appease the gods were performed, the frightening thunder and lightening passed.\n \n There are only a few examples of ritual burials of Neandertals, but there are many such burials of Cro-Magnons. And such burials indicate a belief in some sort of afterlife. And still, the rituals to appease or to please the unseen, supernatural powers continued. Rituals for a good hunt, ritualistic paintings on cave walls in order to bring game for the hunt.\n \n So religion is a step above animal behavior.

Sometimes scientists have differing opinions as to which of two valid theories is actually correct. Science is an attempt to learn about the universe and how it works, religion isn&#8217;t.\n \nFurthermore, with all of the modern science studying lightning and thunder one might think that no human would be struck again.\n\n Are you nuts?\n \nI would guess that if we could get an accurate historical record that as many people get struck by lightning today as they did in the past. It seems that religion may be as powerful as science in protecting us, for even the scientifically devout are sometimes struck by lightning.\n\n Fruit loops! Just like the proverbial bolt from the blue, that bit of irrelevant nonsense came from no where. Tell you what. Why don&#8217;t you PROVE (since you seem to like demands like that) that your prayers actually can protect you from lightning.",

   "Lurch,\n \n I apologize if I have attributed to you anything that you did not intend. \n \n Would you please clarify your beliefs? Are you an atheist, agnostic, mystic, animist, or a self-effacing follower of an organized religion? If I am not invading your privacy then please comment so that I may better know where you're coming from.\n \n I agree with you that Christianity is a front for big business in some sects. I agree with you that some Christians deny the hard evidence of science. I am sorry that you have had bad experiences with Christianity. But do you only see fear, pacification, threats, greed and big business? Have you ever seen a Christian or other religious person act with charity, compassion, love??? (For an more accurate view of the Christian's relationship with God, see Romans 8:14-17, \"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry, 'Abba! Father!' it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children then fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\" And when Jesus taught how to pray, he started with \"Our Father.\" It is also surprising to me that you doggedly portray religion as fear when some of the most fearless people who have graced the planet were Christian martyrs who died cruel, painful, horrible deaths because of their rejection of fear.)\n \n Are you being completely honest when you state that you were not talking about the propagation of religion into modern times? After all, you wrote, \"Religious people still  believe that there is a power that can be pacified by ritual and from whom favor can be won by begging...Religion isn't a regression. It is a state beyond which primative minds are unable to progress.\" Correct me if I am wrong (I see that you are not bashful in this regard) but you make the statement that people still   believe that religion is for pacification and that it is a state beyond which the primitive mind cannot progress. It seems as though you were not speaking of the origin of religion in primitive mankind but rather that you were speaking of religion in the modern day man. You seem to speak of the evolution of the mind. But if the mind is capable of evolving then what, in your opinion, allows one to evolve and what keeps the other in its primitive state? Are the religious exposed to the same environmental variables that the scientifically minded are? Are they resistant to natural selection? How does a religious person in one lifetime make the quantum evolutionary leap to atheism? Or vice-versa, how does an atheist revert so quickly to theism?\n \n Furthermore, I would be interested in your opinion on the existence of the \"vestigial expression of self awareness\" of religion existing side by side with an inclination toward science. As I mentioned many of the greatest minds in science were believers. What do you think of this coexistence? Do you think the two capacities or motivations compete, work in concert, or remain indifferent to the other? Can the person be a step above as a scientist and yet remain on the primitive level of religion simultaneously?\n \n I cannot prove that my prayers can protect me from anything. I cannot prove that there is a god. But my point in constantly demanding proof is to assert that ultimately science has the burden of proving everything while religion has to prove nothing. (Perhaps we are both making this point). In science, opinion and belief must eventually be molded into fact and theory. But from whence comes the opinion, the belief? When one says, \"I believe that religion is a vestigial remnant of a primitive mind.\" He cannot yet prove it with science. So if I say, \"There is a God and I believe God created the universe,\" then I am making a similar statement. I cannot yet prove it with science. But it seems that you look down on the second belief as lower, less intelligent, absurd. I must point out that science has not been any more successful in disproving God than it has been in proving God.\n \n Now faith is named so for a reason. At some point I must resort to dogma. But one cannot assume that because one embraces dogma on a certain issue that he is totally devoid of intellect. One cannot lump all of religion into a hostile entity against science. Hostility against science is a distortion of the Christian faith. Faith and reason can co-exist. Take a look at Fides et Ratio for further elucidation of this and also see the pope's comments on evolution. \n \n P.S. I am not nuts, I simply suffer from periodic bouts of temporary insanity occasionally, sometimes, often.",
