   "New York Times has a fascinating series of articles about new developments in the science of how genes, gene expression and evolution are related. It ranges from recent human evolution to recent developments in Evo-Devo and epigenetic control of gene expression.\n \n Humans Have Spread Globally, and Evolved Locally\n \n This article explores how the global human population can be classified into 5 basic genetic clusters (or ancestry groups) corresponding roughly to geographical continents, and how individuals can be assigned partial memberships in each cluster. (Genetic clusters being analogous but not identical to the traditional concept of race.) \n \n It also looks at evidence for how various alleles in subpopulations have been under strong and recent selective influence, possibly selection by dietetic or climatical factors.\n \n Then we have an essay on how Darwinian theory might be evolving to accommodate recent advances in epigenetics and development:\n \n Darwin Still Rules, but Some Biologists Dream of a Paradigm Shift\n \n It's been obviously to biologists for many years (at least ever since Darwin) that natural selection alone cannot account for every aspect of the evolution of new species. The process of evolution itself locks it into certain developmental pathways and blocks others, through developmental constraints. There are also structural constraints in that not every conceivable structure is going to be a viable biological one.\n \n But this isn't going to overturn the neo-Darwinian synthesis. It will make it part of a larger picture.\n \n This longer feature is about recent developments in the molecular understanding of evo-devo:\n \n From a Few Genes, Life's Myriad Shapes\n \n Yes, the same sets of toolkit or control genes are used in the development of many different kinds of species, and many of the basic control or structural genes aren't necessarily changed from species to species. However, developmental differences depend in part on the arrangement of the genome, which controls how and when these genes are expressed. Evo-devo doesn't remove the need for DNA sequence mutations; it provides us with an understanding on how a few genes and their expression can control many different developmental pathways. Fruitflies and humans have homologous toolkit genes, but they differ significantly in number and arrangement, a difference that could only have been arrived at by alteration and rearrangement, i.e. mutation, of the ancestral DNA sequence.\n \n Finally, we have this article on the evolution of bacteria by natural selection:\n \n Fast-Reproducing Microbes Provide a Window on Natural Selection\n \n This is one by Carl Zimmer which looks by introduction at the work of Richard Lenski on the evolution of new enzymatic abilities in bacteria under selection regimes. The need for genetic mutation is demonstrated, because new genes that did not exist in ancestral populations can be identified and characterised.\n \n There's a particularly interesting experiment from one group which looked at the evolution of cooperativity in a line of non-cooperative bacteria:\n During this experiment, one of Dr. Velicer's colleagues, Francesca Fiegna of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, discovered something strange. She had just transferred a population of cheaters to a dish, expecting them to die out. But the cheaters were making seven times as many spores as their normal ancestors. \"It just made no sense,\" Dr. Velicer said. \"I asked her I don't know how many times, 'Are you sure you marked the plates correctly?' \"\n \n She had. It turned out that a single Myxococcus cheater had mutated into a cooperator. In fact, it had evolved into a cooperator far superior to its cooperative ancestors. Dr. Velicer and his colleagues sequenced the genome of the new cooperator and discovered a single mutation. The new mutation did not simply reverse the mutation that had originally turned the microbe's ancestors into cheaters. Instead, it struck a new part of the genome.\n \n But Dr. Velicer has no idea at the moment how the mutation brought about the remarkable transformation in behavior. The mutated segment of DNA actually lies near, but not inside, a gene. It is possible that proteins latch on to this region and switch the nearby gene on or off. But no one actually knows what the gene normally does.\n Darwinian theory is going to become richer with our understanding of evo-devo, but alas for our creationists and assorted vitalists, Darwinian theory is far from passe. It remains as central to biology as it was.",

And doesn't such a genetic contradiction cause you to ask why that is ? \n\n \n I don't know how wide a range of African DNA types they sampled, so I can't tell you whether their studies would distinguish specifically between those African subtypes. In any case, gene flow between populations within much of Africa is likely to be greater than between most of Africa and elsewhere. And as someone else has pointed out, not all of Africa has a single climate. \n \n Further, I have no idea what you mean by \"weaker genetic strain\". Weaker compared to what? The point was that local populations have accumulated local genetic mutations, and the question to be answered is whether these are due to adaptations to local conditions, such as climate or food sources, followed by restricted gene flow between regions, or have some other cause.\n \n So I'm afraid I see no \"genetic contradiction\" at all. I see a prediction of evolutionary theory, that once populations separate, they will begin to diversify genetically.

Some of it is suited to various kinds of agriculture. What we are talking about here is five basic genomic clusters. Within each, one would expect further clustering of local populations, and this granularity would continue all the way down to families, only accounting for less and less DNA at each level. \n \n And then there will be lots of hybrid individuals at the boundaries of such clusters, and because of the increased global mobility of populations in the last couple of hundred years.\n \n \nBy the way, your links are useless as they require a password and registration to view the articles.

   "No, it's a pity that you have no consistency in either your science or your arguments. Your argument about dwarves and giants determined by a single protein works on an individual level fine but in determining a whole Race within the same genome group, not so fine.\n\n \n First of all, \"race\" is an obsolete and useless concept, anthropologically speaking. Genetic ancestry or membership of a gene cluster is much more useful biologically and medically. Thus someone can have partial membership of more than one cluster.\n \n And no, no-one would dream of suggesting that a single gene somehow determines someone's membership of a gene cluster. What we are discussing is the statistical probability of finding certain genes clustering together in a population compared to some other population. Molecular geneticists think they've identified five such clusters, for the genetic markers they used.\n \n That doesn't mean that every genetic marker is unique to any one cluster, but that it is more likely to appear together with certain other genes in one cluster than another. Most genes and their various alleles are probably found in most clusters, though the frequency may vary. If you used different markers or different numbers of markers, you might either get less resolution (i.e. find fewer than 5 basic clusters), or more resolution (i.e. be able to resolve more clusters).\n \n \nYou're darn right science doesn't have all the answers, it doesn't have any of them regarding evo. only suppositions and assumptions.\n\n \n Nope. Science has a lot of evidence that confirms evolution. Your problem is that on the few occasions you read it, you don't understand it.\n \n \nAnd all of those based on preconceived notions ? Do you think that the study that so confidently claims that  5 basic genetic clusters (or ancestry groups) corresponding roughly to geographical continents even checked the tremendous differences that exist between pygmies and the Hutu's in that one genetic cluster ?\n\n \n I have no idea, based on the NYT article, whether they selected individuals from those specific groups, and in any case, it doesn't follow that the genetic differences between pymies and Hutus should be enormous, given that we know small genetic changes can result in major anatomical differences. One would certainly expect some, but whether they would fall within or outside the 5 clusters detected in such studies I don't know. \n \n You know, the five clusters you see depend very much on the ability to resolve genetic differences. If you use a coarse grain focus -- i.e. fewer markers -- you would only see one cluster for all of humanity, and you would see it in relationship to clusters for other species. For example, we would be in a cluster of great apes, which itself would be part of a bigger group of primates, which would group with mammals, then vertebrates, and so on and so forth.\n \n The finer grained the focus -- i.e. the more markers you consider -- the more finely you can resolve sub-groupings within a larger grouping. So if we use few markers, we'd only identify humanity as a single cluster. If we use more, we can progressively identify finer and finer subdivisions of that cluster, with each of the five basic ones (at that level) subdivided into smaller ones, then even smaller ones, until we're all the way down to tribes, families and individuals.\n \n We are basically looking at family trees here. The smallest particle is the individual. The next would be the close family, then the extended family, then on through tribe, ethnic group, continental cluster, all the way to the entire human species. What we are looking at in living members of the human species, in effect, is the tips of the twigs on the family tree, then extrapolating those through their genetic relationships down through all the forks, branches, boughs and limbs, all the way back to the trunk, when the first members of our species lived. And no, they weren't Adam and Eve, though even if they were, it wouldn't change the argument!\n \n I think it makes a much more credible tale than Genesis and all the other Creation myths put together!",

It is said that we had an atmosphere of hydrogen, some sulphuric acid, some chlorine and some other toxic chemicals that in no way sustain or make up life as we know it. And then there were rocks and earth.\n\n \n First you need to study the chronology a bit more. At 14 billion years back there was no earth or sun or solar system or milky way galaxy for that matter. You would be looking at a universe shortly before or shortly after the BB. You gotta come foward about 9.5 billion years. Its a small error, but it does indicate you are not paying attention. \n \n \nFrom this mixture of primordial ooze and rocks, according to the teachings of Abiogenesis came the very first single celled organisms on Earth. So life not only came from rocks, but sulfuric acid and chlorine too. Forgive me for leaving those two important ingredients out but it doesn't do a lot for your credibility anyway. \n\n \n You seem to be overllooking the role of primodial ooze in your scenario. PO is powerful stuff you know all kinds of small molecules in there, colliding and sharing electrons in the outer shells, maiking and breakig bonds. And the acid and that chlorine are essential tools of the organic chemist in building complex molecules. And of course the rocks - particulary alumino-silicates and such (ie clay minerals) provide some dandy possibilities for whats called templating. Wow and those neat nitrogen compounds (you forgot the N2 and carbon, and oxygen (though not much of it), by the way! and the water - no ooze without that you know. CHONS are the basics to make life from along with a bit of iron, magnesium, selenium, copper, zinc, and molybdenum and a few other elements- from rocks of course).\n \n \nSo TQ, when I say that according to your beliefs all life on Earth came from ROCKS through spontaneous generation, I'm not mis-speaking at all because before there was any life on Planet Earth according to your beliefs, only rocks and some very harsh atmospheric chemicals existed here, and from that chaos, life spontaneously generated as it implies that life also springs from inorganic matter which combines with other forms of inorganic matter resulting in organic matter as such. Which 14 plus billion years later resulted in us along with the incredibly diverse chain of life that just couldn't have come about by intelligent design because your way sound so much better. \n \n\n \n Again your timeline is way the heck off. But aside from that you don't apparently understand how complex organic chemicals can and are made. They are made from inorganic precursors often under considerably harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, acidity, and in the presense of reactive elements like chlorine and energy sources like UV and electrical discharge! Sounds like a pretty good place to make a whole library of coplex aromatic and heteroaromatics along with aliphatics. Amino acids, nucleotides, sugars even polymers like peptides and polynucleotides! Wow that puts us pretty close to life. Now consider AA that some peptides are in fact self-replicating. Gee whiz once you have imprefect self-replicating molecules you have life and life which is capable of evolving. \n \n \nOr are you saying that we were seeded from outer space so even though we evolved here according to your teachings, we are in fact aliens on our own planet. Is that it TQ ?\n\n \n No need for that but its not impossible, but of course since the universe was once lifeless and now contains life its pretty obvious that life did arise from non-life else there would be no life at all. And life is observable now is it not. Where do you AA think it originally came from?",

   "Klown already pointed out what the neccessary ingredients were. Let me point out a couple other things:\n \n \nyou pseudo intellectuals\n\n Name calling doesn't help your cause any. In fact, it highlights the inferiority complex you suffer from\n \n \nabout 14 and a half billion years ago. Before any life at all existed on Earth.\n\n Chemist has pointed this out, but it's important to highlight the fact that you don't even know the subject matter you're arguing against.\n \n \nhydrogen, some sulphuric acid, some chlorine and some other toxic chemicals that in no way sustain or make up life as we know it.\n\n You're right. Google \"banded iron formations\". Before oxygen, there were a bunch of little critters that just loved these \"toxic\" chemicals. They metabolised them, one of the byproducts of such metabolism being Oxygen. Toxic in large amounts (it's an oxidizer), but great for our type of life. If you think that the idea of microbes living in such hellish environments with poisonous gases surrounding them is absurd, also google \"black smoker\".\n Chemist has done a better job of explaining the chemistry behind this than I could, but it's pretty basic university level chem (101-210 level if I remember right)\n \n \naccording to the teachings of Abiogenesis\n\n Which, has been explained to you innumerable times, has nothing to do with evolution.\n \n \nSo TQ, when I say that according to your beliefs all life on Earth came from ROCKS through spontaneous generation, I'm not mis-speaking at all because before there was any life on Planet Earth according to your beliefs, only rocks and some very harsh atmospheric chemicals existed here,\n\n Right, chemicals and minerals, not rocks. What is all life made up of? Chemicals and minerals...\n \n \nfrom that chaos, life spontaneously generated as it implies that life also springs from inorganic matter which combines with other forms of inorganic matter resulting in organic matter as such.\n\n Well, in your own bumbling, stumbling way, you're describing biochemistry, so I suppose you can be considered almost right.\n \n \nWhich 14 plus billion years later\n\n In case anyone missed it the first time.\n \n [uote]incredibly diverse chain of life that just couldn't have come about by intelligent design because your way sound so much better.[/Quote]\n I think my way does sound much better than \"the invisible man in the took a handful of dust and breathed on it.\", but that's just me and all those wacky scientists and non-religously blinded people.\n \n \nOr are you saying that we were seeded from outer space so even though we evolved here according to your teachings, we are in fact aliens on our own planet. Is that it TQ ?\n\n It's possible that the first precursors of life were from off planet. Google for organic molecules in combination with comets/meteorites. See what you find. As I stated before, it's been explained to you countless times that it doesn't matter when or where life originated, evolution occurs after life is here.\n \n Now, how about answering my questions? \"Please point out to me on a map where the garden of eden is. After all, it was never destroyed, right? We were just banned from it. So point it out. Explain to me how koalas (need fresh eucalyptus leaves to survive) trekked to the middle east from Australia, hopped on a boat, and went for a year long cruise. EXPLAIN THIS WITHOUT SAYING \"POOF!

Origin of life (based on oldest known microfossils): Roughly 3.8 billion years old.\n \n I only make this point because to me, it is striking, again and again and again, in every argument I have with creationists, how little information they have actually absorbed over the course of their life. As I have said before, this is not an insult, it's a fact. If you are going to debate scientific topics, at least learn the basics or you come across as laughable. I would not try to attempt to debate, for example, scriptural inconsistencies, because I am not familiar enough with any of the literature. \n \n Secondly, the atmosphere (and oceans, the chemical make-up of which is far more important) then would indeed be toxic to most (but not all) organisms today, but some elements of the theory suggest that that atmosphere was necessary for the formation of the first replicators, and in fact today's atmosphere and oceans, if transplanted back in time to that era, would not have the requisite constituents to do the job.\n \n The chemical composition of the modern atmos/hydrosphere came about as a result of the chemical reactions produced by organisms; it has 'evolved' along with life, influencing the course of evolution and being influenced in turn. One pertinent example is the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere which gives most animals their energy; this is produced by plants and took a long time to reach current levels.\n \n \n \nFrom this mixture of primordial ooze and rocks, according to the teachings of Abiogenesis came the very first single celled organisms on Earth. So life not only came from rocks, but sulfuric acid and chlorine too. Forgive me for leaving those two important ingredients out but it doesn't do a lot for your credibility anyway. \n \n So TQ, when I say that according to your beliefs all life on Earth came from ROCKS through spontaneous generation, I'm not mis-speaking at all because before there was any life on Planet Earth according to your beliefs, only rocks and some very harsh atmospheric chemicals existed here, and from that chaos, life spontaneously generated as it implies that life also springs from inorganic matter which combines with other forms of inorganic matter resulting in organic matter as such. \n\n \n 1. Life did not come from rocks. Nothing, in fact, lived on the land until about 500 million years ago, which means 3 billion years of ocean-bound evolution. Some early organisms almost definitely 'ate' minerals either free-floating or directly from the sea bed, but the 'rocks' (as opposed to the chemically complex silt which formed on the sea bed over time, as a result of oceanic erosion and the deaths of billions of tiny critters) almost definitely had no part in the origin of life. Some theories suggest that the early replicators formed by utilising the structure of clay or crystals, but without amino acids, which did not come from rocks, life could not have happened.\n \n 2. You say 'harsh chemicals'. They are harsh to us, but you can find (if you do some research) bacteria and other organisms that live in pretty much any environment you care to think of. In fact the famous Miller-Urey experiments used these very same 'harsh chemicals' and managed to create amino acids, which cannot be done if you repeat the experiment using the chemicals found in the modern atmos/hydrosphere. Hence my point in my second paragraph, above.\n \n 3. Your final sentence in the above quote: \"inorganic matter which combines with other forms of inorganic matter resulting in organic matter as such.\" Why is this so hard to accept? The Miller-Urey experiment proves this conclusively. We haven't been able to create life, but we have, unambiguously, been able to create organic matter (amino acids) from inorganic matter. This experiment is a micro-scale version of the one that took place in the world's vast oceans for at least two hundred million years. The most surprising result of the experiment in fact, was just how easily the ingredients polymerised to form amino acids. \n \n \nWhich 14 plus billion years later resulted in us along with the incredibly diverse chain of life that just couldn't have come about by intelligent design because your way sound so much better.\n\n \n Not 14, roughly 3.8.\n \n And of course it could have come about by intelligent design, but that's the problem with ID isn't it. That is all that the ID hypothesis can tell us: \"It could have been an intelligence\". That's all well and good, but it doesn't answer any other questions, it doesn't help in any area of study, and in my opinion it in fact only leads to a certain percentage of people thinking \"Oh, OK, it was God, I don't need any more answers thank you.\" What is the point of thinking like that? I've said similar things to the followng statement before, but what the hell, I'll say it again:\n \n Even if God revealed himself to humanity and said 'Yep, I did it', thus vindicating ID, it would in no way falsify ANY of evolution. All it would do is tell us that God caused evolution.",

I would not try to attempt to debate, for example, scriptural inconsistencies, because I am not familiar enough with any of the literature.\n \n \n It's because my/our attention in life is focused on reality and not these ridiculous man made myths. What you people do in throwing around numbers like 4.5 billion, 14.5 billion and 3.8 billion year ages is like taking 1 grain of sand worth of information and determining these incredible events taking place. And you speak of them as if only a XXXXX wouldn't believe them as a standard matter of fact. It takes more faith to accept your religion than it does to accept mine. And let's face it, mine is secure enough in itself not to change every month, yours is as fluid as water.\n \n \nSecondly, the atmosphere (and oceans, the chemical make-up of which is far more important) then would indeed be toxic to most (but not all) organisms today, but some elements of the theory suggest that that atmosphere was necessary for the formation of the first replicators, and in fact today's atmosphere and oceans, if transplanted back in time to that era, would not have the requisite constituents to do the job.\n\n \n Note the bolded: And yet that contradiction in what we know to be possible in current science as irrational scientific conclusions that lead no less to believing these impossible chemical combinations were the seeds for the creation of all future life on Planet Earth, and yet no scientist would deny that given the same harsh chemicals that made up our atmosphere and primordial soup that existed on Earth 3.8 Billion years ago in a lab, that he would be very hard pressed to create any life from it. Getting past the sulfuric acid being a major stumbling block.\n \n So what makes this theory rational if it can't be tested and duplicated in a lab to prove it was even possible the first time it's assumed it happened ? \n \n \nThe chemical composition of the modern atmos/hydrosphere came about as a result of the chemical reactions produced by organisms; it has 'evolved' along with life, influencing the course of evolution and being influenced in turn. One pertinent example is the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere which gives most animals their energy; this is produced by plants and took a long time to reach current levels.\n\n \n But this was inorganic matter, not living matter in the beginning. You must accept that according to your beliefs life spontaneously generated from non living matter originally. and that is the crux of the problem creationists have with your theories. And they are theories and nothing more so I resent being called ignorant for not placing my faith in them. \n \n \n1. Life did not come from rocks.

And doesn't this paragraph by extension directly imply that all life came from the Sea ? Which means that mammals were originally Sea Bound Creatures that evolved lungs from gills and legs from fins as they moved from the Sea to Land ? This means inter-species transformations from fish to amphibian to reptile to mammal, to bird ? Can you point to any modern interspecies evolution of a reptile to a mammal for example that the average layman can relate to and clearly appreciate ? On a side note, how did we get from a sulfuric acid atmosphere to an H2O Ocean that's capable of sustaining life that covered the Earth ? \n \n \n2. You say 'harsh chemicals'. They are harsh to us, but you can find (if you do some research) bacteria and other organisms that live in pretty much any environment you care to think of. In fact the famous Miller-Urey experiments used these very same 'harsh chemicals' and managed to create amino acids, which cannot be done if you repeat the experiment using the chemicals found in the modern atmos/hydrosphere. Hence my point in my second paragraph, above.\n\n \n And I'll give you that amino acids are building blocks of life, but how do we jump from them to the formation of the optic nerve, the complexity of the brain, the pain receptors and the diverse yet symbiotically connected physical bodies that make up the well balanced chain of life on Earth today ? Your science believes this all happened by accident, by a fluke of random mutation which according to all odds given would range in the area of 100 trillion to 1 that such a vast accident of nature could result in such an incredibly complex and creative creature such as man, that is so far above the next highest form of life that the percentages are incalculable. These are the incredible leaps of faith that must be made in order to accept both abiogenesis and evo. And please don't be disingenuous like TQ by implying that one science isn't the accepted next stage of the other.\n \n \n3. Your final sentence in the above quote: \"inorganic matter which combines with other forms of inorganic matter resulting in organic matter as such.\" Why is this so hard to accept? The Miller-Urey experiment proves this conclusively. We haven't been able to create life, but we have, unambiguously, been able to create organic matter (amino acids) from inorganic matter. This experiment is a micro-scale version of the one that took place in the world's vast oceans for at least two hundred million years. The most surprising result of the experiment in fact, was just how easily the ingredients polymerised to form amino acids.\n \n \n But amino acids are a long way from a thinking animal, whether it be mammal, fish or reptile Liminus. I don't care how much time passes, you are actually endorsing the proposition that intelligent life evolved from nothing more than inorganic chemicals that have no more life in them, nor the potential of life within them than a ROCK or any other dead mineral you want to use. \n \n \nAnd of course it could have come about by intelligent design, but that's the problem with ID isn't it. That is all that the ID hypothesis can tell us: \"It could have been an intelligence\". That's all well and good, but it doesn't answer any other questions, it doesn't help in any area of study, and in my opinion it in fact only leads to a certain percentage of people thinking \"Oh, OK, it was God, I don't need any more answers thank you.\" What is the point of thinking like that? I've said similar things to the followng statement before, but what the hell, I'll say it again:\n\n \n As you can see, your theory also raises an untold number of questions. And also has no reasonable answers for these questions. It takes an equal amount od faith to believe your ever changing science that completely contradicts today what it believed only 50 years ago. And in 50 years from now will completely contradict what you assume to be true today. That isn't to say stop seeking answers, but only that you have no right to hold your current beliefs up as true in any way because they are as fluid as the Ocean you believe life came from.\n \n \nEven if God revealed himself to humanity and said 'Yep, I did it', thus vindicating ID, it would in no way falsify ANY of evolution. All it would do is tell us that God caused evolution.\n\n \n This I totally disagree with. I have no problem believing the Creation account because I know my God is capable of anything. And as you stumble about the appearance of the Earths Age if God did create it in our more recent past not matching what scientific studies reveal, I point to Adams creation not as an infant but as a mature man who had the wisdom and knowledge to name all the animals. If true, this is evidence that God can create new life with the appearance of Age and Maturity. Of course I admit my faith in God. I wish that evos could admit their irrational faith in science that leaves so many unanswered questions.\n \n \nNow, how about answering my questions? \n (1)\"Please point out to me on a map where the garden of eden is. After all, it was never destroyed, right? We were just banned from it. So point it out. \n \n (2)Explain to me how koalas (need fresh eucalyptus leaves to survive) trekked to the middle east from Australia, hopped on a boat, and went for a year long cruise. EXPLAIN THIS WITHOUT SAYING \"POOF! GODDIDIT\". That is not evidence.\"\n\n \n 1) Because the Tree of Life existed in the Garden, which would have given anyone who ate of it eternal life in the flesh, God took it away. But He doesn't say when and how, only that at the end of this AGE, the World will once again be restored to its original beauty. But we'll all have to wait to find out the specifics because the bible doesn't answer that question. But you already knew that didn't you ?\n \n 2) Do you know for certain that eucalyptus plants, or koalas for that matter didn't flourish in the Middle East 5000 years ago ? And how do you know that only one pregnant female koala didn't make the trip, have the cub on the Ark and breast feed it for the duration requiring only a small amount of the plant for mom. Obviously i don't know for certain as I wasn't there but what I do know is that my God is capable of planning for the slighted details.",

Getting past the sulfuric acid being a major stumbling block.\n\n \n Well I happen to have a bit of chemistry under my belt and the chemical combinations are not only NOT impossible but are regulary used in the lab to make complex organic compounds. If you take drugs, wear shoes, or drive a car then you encounter things made with those combinations on a daily basis. The earth then and now was of course NOT homogenous with regard to composition. Life could well have started once only and in a a spot with unusual composition. And by the way getting past the sulfuriic acid is not all that difficult. Indeed sulfur bacteria are pretty much at home in and around it. Sulfur is after all essential to living organisms and serves as the active site for many enzymes! If you think the description of earths atmosphere is harsh you should see the witches brew that chemists use to make stuff. Chlorine and sulfuric acid are the least of it!\n \n \nSo what makes this theory rational if it can't be tested and duplicated in a lab to prove it was even possible the first time it's assumed it happened ?\n\n \n Note well that evolution per se does not require abiogenesis it only requires that life be mutable, be subject to differential selection, and exhibit inheritance. As to abiogenesis you still have not answered my question. Life is observable, if we assume that life does have origins then it must have originated from non-living matter one way or another. Even if GOD created it life arose by abiogenesis - indeed genesis so indicates. Creationist or evolutionist you are stuck with abiogenesis of some sort.",

It takes more faith to accept your religion than it does to accept mine. And let's face it, mine is secure enough in itself not to change every month, yours is as fluid as water.\n\n \n Archie, dear, scientific theories change as new facts are discovered. Your religious mythology never changes despite contrary facts being discovered. It's fossilised. I'd rather have a good working theory that's useful but wrong in parts, than a myth that's rotten all the way through.\n \n \nAnd yet that contradiction in what we know to be possible in current science as irrational scientific conclusions that lead no less to believing these impossible chemical combinations were the seeds for the creation of all future life on Planet Earth, and yet no scientist would deny that given the same harsh chemicals that made up our atmosphere and primordial soup that existed on Earth 3.8 Billion years ago in a lab, that he would be very hard pressed to create any life from it. Getting past the sulfuric acid being a major stumbling block.\n\n \n Sorry, but what is \"impossible\" about these chemical combinations? And actually, sulphuric acid was but one component of a primordial atmosphere. The earth was never like Venus is now, so far as we can tell from its geology. \n \n \nSo what makes this theory rational if it can't be tested and duplicated in a lab to prove it was even possible the first time it's assumed it happened ? \n\n \n Oh dear... science can't replicate hundreds of millions of years of chemical evolution in an afternoon in the lab, therefore they are impossible! This is the sort of shoddy reasoning Creationists are justly reviled for.\n \n \nBut this was inorganic matter, not living matter in the beginning. You must accept that according to your beliefs life spontaneously generated from non living matter originally. and that is the crux of the problem creationists have with your theories.\n\n \n Yet Creationists have no problem swallowing whole the myth of a spontaneously created deity! Marvellous. Their credulity is greater by far than any scientist's. It's true that biologists see an unbroken continuum between non-living and living matter, but that's because they have an understanding of some if not all of the chemistry involved. You don't even know a fraction of it.\n \n \n And they are theories and nothing more so I resent being called ignorant for not placing my faith in them. \n\n \n You are called ignorant not because you don't place any faith in them, but because you don't know them well enough to describe them in the first place!\n \n \nAre not rocks considered minerals ? And doesn't this paragraph by extension directly imply that all life came from the Sea ?\n\n \n The sea is where the great Cambrian diversification occurred. I don't know where life originated, though. It might have been deep within the earth's crust.\n \n \nWhich means that mammals were originally Sea Bound Creatures that evolved lungs from gills and legs from fins as they moved from the Sea to Land ? This means inter-species transformations from fish to amphibian to reptile to mammal, to bird ?\n\n \n The fossil record demonstrates this.\n \n \nCan you point to any modern interspecies evolution of a reptile to a mammal for example that the average layman can relate to and clearly appreciate ?\n\n \n Why do you people insist that an evolution we know to have happened over tens of millions of years be crammed into an afternoon or even a year in the lab? It's ridiculous. The fossil record speaks to this evolution. Your bible certainly is incapable of explaining it.\n \n \nOn a side note, how did we get from a sulfuric acid atmosphere to an H2O Ocean that's capable of sustaining life that covered the Earth ? \n\n \n Because there was always more to the atmosphere than sulphuric acid. There was water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, ammonia, methane, and many other gases. Also there were plenty of bases around to neutralise the acidity. Why do you folk always oversimplify to the point of absurdity?\n \n \nAnd I'll give you that amino acids are building blocks of life, but how do we jump from them to the formation of the optic nerve, the complexity of the brain, the pain receptors and the diverse yet symbiotically connected physical bodies that make up the well balanced chain of life on Earth today ?\n\n \n No biologist argues we jumped immediately from an amino acid soup to fully formed eyes and brains. That's an absurdity, and if you knew any biology, you would realise it's an absurdity. \n \n \nYour science believes this all happened by accident, by a fluke of random mutation which according to all odds given would range in the area of 100 trillion to 1 that such a vast accident of nature could result in such an incredibly complex and creative creature such as man, that is so far above the next highest form of life that the percentages are incalculable.\n\n \n Now you are playing childish games of probability that have no relevance. Again, science doesn't argue that human beings spontaneously sprang fully formed from the dust. That's YOUR claim. Science argues that life gradually evolved from the simple to the complex by cumulative addition. No organism ever sprang into being fully formed from random chemicals. What happens is that life always builds on what went before, and retains any additional information.\n \n \nThese are the incredible leaps of faith that must be made in order to accept both abiogenesis and evo. And please don't be disingenuous like TQ by implying that one science isn't the accepted next stage of the other.\n\n \n Nope, these are reasonable inference from the data, data, I might add, that you know little or nothing about.\n \n \nBut amino acids are a long way from a thinking animal, whether it be mammal, fish or reptile Liminus. I don't care how much time passes, you are actually endorsing the proposition that intelligent life evolved from nothing more than inorganic chemicals that have no more life in them, nor the potential of life within them than a ROCK or any other dead mineral you want to use. \n\n \n That's a lot more plausible than thinking some superbeing waved a magic wand and zapped it into existence from nothing at all! You'd have to be really gullible to believe that crock.\n \n \nAs you can see, your theory also raises an untold number of questions.\n\n \n Excellent! That's what keeps scientists in employment. Your theory, alas, not only doesn't raise new questions, it never answers any!\n \n \nAnd also has no reasonable answers for these questions.\n\n \n It has plenty of reasonable answers, it's just that Creationists don't use reason.\n \n \nI have no problem believing the Creation account because I know my God is capable of anything.\n\n \n Apparently, your god is incapable of using evolution. Why do you folk keep telling your god what he can and can't do? \n \n \nDo you know for certain that eucalyptus plants, or koalas for that matter didn't flourish in the Middle East 5000 years ago ?\n\n \n Damn sure. No fossils, you see. If they'd been there, we'd have found them. Marsupials appear to have originated in South America, then migrated through Antarctica to Australasia. They never existed as indigenous species in the Middle East, Europe or Africa, certainly not 5,000 years ago!\n \n \n And how do you know that only one pregnant female koala didn't make the trip, have the cub on the Ark and breast feed it for the duration requiring only a small amount of the plant for mom. Obviously i don't know for certain as I wasn't there but what I do know is that my God is capable of planning for the slighted details.\n\n \n Yeah... I can just see this female koala waving a fond farewell to Noah, then setting out on a grand transcontinental expedition of several thousand miles, over mountain and valley, river and marsh, sea and desert, braving sun, storm and predator, finding eucalyptus wherever she roamed, then popping out twins who created the whole koala race together. Koalas do this sort of thing all the time. Gee... that's so plausible! emoticon_rolleyes",

Obviously i don't know for certain as I wasn't there but what I do know is that my God is capable of planning for the slighted details.\n\n \n Or it could be a completely false little fairytale, which would seem to make perfect sense and need no ridiculous explanations. \n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Archie, you have already lost this debate because you put everything you believe into a fictional book while showing no interest in debating. You merely explain to us your beliefs, ask basic questions about the theory of evolution and completely ignore conflicting information about your beliefs. You cannot accurately debate these topics because you have pre-concluded answers provided VIA the Bible and if all else fails you have the childlike mentality to say \"I don't need an answer, Goddidit\". All you do is give futile attempts to disprove evolution and attempt to fill the gaps of your primitive ideology. As of yet you haven't had any success with either, and the simple answer is because the theory of evolution is correct. \n \n Open your eyes and realize that you aren't a Christian you are merely someone who succumbs to every word of the Bible, far detached from what a modern Christian should strive to be. The Bible was written thousands of years ago by a much more primitive a people who had a lesser understanding of the natural functions of the world. Its time for you to grow up and realize this.",

   "It's because my/our attention in life is focused on reality and not these ridiculous man made myths. What you people do in throwing around numbers like 4.5 billion, 14.5 billion and 3.8 billion year ages is like taking 1 grain of sand worth of information and determining these incredible events taking place. And you speak of them as if only a XXXXX wouldn't believe them as a standard matter of fact. It takes more faith to accept your religion than it does to accept mine. \n\n \n I will not get into an argument about dating methods; it is very easy to find and understand information on the various methods, and they all correlate very well. If you dispute this, I cannot help you except by posting links. That said, the oldest microfossils (of bacteria) date to around 3.8 bya, hence that date. The oldest rocks (using meteorite fragments for dating) are 4.5 bya, hence that date. The date for the universe is based principally on redshift measurements, which are extremely accurate and the science underpinning this method is actually quite simple and very reliable. These are all very good pieces of evidence.\n \n \nAnd let's face it, mine is secure enough in itself not to change every month, yours is as fluid as water.\n\n \n But that is precisely why science is a superior source of knowledge, that is its great strength, its best feature. I don't want or need a dogmatic, unchanging, unchangeable basis for my knowledge, for two principal reasons:\n \n 1. Reality is incredibly complex and takes a lot of hard work to understand. The ancient Greeks were on the right track but then, due to the sociopolitical upheaval (and, it has to be said, the establishment of widespread dogmatic monotheism) of the 1st millenium, it took us centuries before people like Galileo and Newton started properly investigating reality again. An authority that claims to have all the answers is, in my book, mistaken in principle due to the fact that further investigation always reveals not only new pieces of the puzzle, but whole extra areas of puzzle that we were previously unaware of. \n \n 2. Therefore I believe, based on the history of scientific discovery which always creates more new questions than it answers, that the acquisition of knowledge will be a never-ending (or at least unimaginably long-term) process. As such, it is necessary to have a self-questioning, self-correcting system for that acquisition, and emphatically not one that will not question itself and cannot change. \n \n I suspect you will be thinking about now something along the lines of \"but evolution is just as unquestioned and unchangeable\" but I will come to that later, as it is more specifically relevant to a later portion of your post.\n \n \nNote the bolded: And yet that contradiction in what we know to be possible in current science as irrational scientific conclusions that lead no less to believing these impossible chemical combinations were the seeds for the creation of all future life on Planet Earth, and yet no scientist would deny that given the same harsh chemicals that made up our atmosphere and primordial soup that existed on Earth 3.8 Billion years ago in a lab, that he would be very hard pressed to create any life from it. Getting past the sulfuric acid being a major stumbling block.\n \n So what makes this theory rational if it can't be tested and duplicated in a lab to prove it was even possible the first time it's assumed it happened ?\n\n \n I'm not really sure what you're on about here. You say \"impossible chemical combinations\" which is meaningless, either as a stand-alone concept or when applied to amino acid formation, as Miller-Urey conclusively shows. Amino acids quite simply DO form in these conditions. End of (that part of the) story. And, for what it's worth as you seem so hung up on it, sulfuric acid would have been neither a large part of the atmosphere, nor is it automatically inimical to life. See earlier posts by Chemist. \n \n So, in answer to the question, one part of the process HAS been duplicated. The steps from amino acid to 'protocell' are many and varied, but virtually all of the underlying chemistry is understood. The only problem is that there are several viable hypotheses which on paper, describe the steps involved, but we don't know which one (if any) are correct. A major experimental barrier is the fact that we do not have a spare oceanic planet lying around coupled with the ability to speed up time by a factor of tens of millions. Hence the relatively slow progress in this field even in the 21st century, however I suspect that several generations of computers down the line we will begin to be able to simulate these kinds of extremely complex scenarios.\n \n \nBut this was inorganic matter, not living matter in the beginning. You must accept that according to your beliefs life spontaneously generated from non living matter originally. and that is the crux of the problem creationists have with your theories. And they are theories and nothing more so I resent being called ignorant for not placing my faith in them.\n\n \n 1. 'Spontaneous' is, I believe, as mistaken a use of word as the oft-encountered 'improbable'. Suffice to say that nothing in chemistry or physics happens spontaneously, even in quantum physics (this is a misunderstanding based on a simplistic explanation of quantum reality). \n \n 2. I will not again repeat a rebuttal of the \"it's 'just' a theory\" argument.\n \n 3. You do not need to place any faith in a theory. You either accept it, or you do not, based upon your own examination of the literature, and of the evidence directly if you are able to. Faith is precisely the opposite, accepting something for which there is no evidence. Personal revelation does not cut the mustard as it is not objectively verifiable.\n \n \nAre not rocks considered minerals ? And doesn't this paragraph by extension directly imply that all life came from the Sea ? Which means that mammals were originally Sea Bound Creatures that evolved lungs from gills and legs from fins as they moved from the Sea to Land ? This means inter-species transformations from fish to amphibian to reptile to mammal, to bird ? Can you point to any modern interspecies evolution of a reptile to a mammal for example that the average layman can relate to and clearly appreciate ? On a side note, how did we get from a sulfuric acid atmosphere to an H2O Ocean that's capable of sustaining life that covered the Earth ?\n\n \n 1. Yes, life originated in the sea, but this does not mean that new forms of life always come from the sea, obviously. Once life exists on land, new forms of life evolve on the land, obviously. Some fish evolved into amphibians via several intermediate forms; some amphibians....etc etc. Reptiles got to mammals by way of the therapsids, which you can google or wiki. \n \n 2. We did not \"get from a sulfuric acid atmosphere to an H2O Ocean\". Do you not see how this does not make sense? To be precise, we got from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidising atmosphere, and the oceans were always mostly H2O, at least since the earth cooled enough for water to condense. Again, google and wikipedia are your friends here, as are public libraries, online science journals, etc etc \n \n \nAnd I'll give you that amino acids are building blocks of life, but how do we jump from them to the formation of the optic nerve, the complexity of the brain, the pain receptors and the diverse yet symbiotically connected physical bodies that make up the well balanced chain of life on Earth today ?\n\n \n By trillions upon trillions of teeny tiny jumps. Try Climbing Mount Improbable and The Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins. I know his name is probably anathema to you, but ignore his atheism if you like and concentrate on the facts which are (and I will not debate this) INDEPENDENT of his philosophy.\n \n \nYour science believes this all happened by accident, by a fluke of random mutation which according to all odds given would range in the area of 100 trillion to 1 that such a vast accident of nature could result in such an incredibly complex and creative creature such as man, that is so far above the next highest form of life that the percentages are incalculable. These are the incredible leaps of faith that must be made in order to accept both abiogenesis and evo. And please don't be disingenuous like TQ by implying that one science isn't the accepted next stage of the other.\n\n \n 1. For the umpteenth time, the \"odds against\" argument DOES NOT F*****G WORK precisely because of the way evolution works. Trillions of small, imperceptible, incremental changes evolve chemicals to replicators, to protocells, to archaea and bacteria etc. It took roughy 2.5 billion years (out of 3.8) before we even got multicellular life! And then another 6 or 700 million years for plants to get onto land, followed by animals over 100 million years later! \n \n 2. The reasons the theories are separate are: \n \n 1. Evolution works WITHOUT abiogenesis. Replace abiogenesis with a heavenly miracle 3.8 billion years ago and every single element of evolution still stands firm.\n \n 2. Abiogenesis is just extremely complex chemistry. Evolution is extremely complex chemistry PLUS an understanding of environmental pressures and behavioural dynamics once life already exists.\n \n 3. It is even conceivable to have abiogenesis without evolution; if the environment remained homogeneous and static across the globe following the advent of the first replicators, there would be no natural selection, hence no differential reproduction rates, hence no evolution.\n \n \nBut amino acids are a long way from a thinking animal, whether it be mammal, fish or reptile Liminus. I don't care how much time passes, you are actually endorsing the proposition that intelligent life evolved from nothing more than inorganic chemicals that have no more life in them, nor the potential of life within them than a ROCK or any other dead mineral you want to use.\n\n \n With 3.8 billion years, 1.37 billion cubic km of oceans, and 5.7 billion square km of land, the \"long way\" you mention is very much in evidence.\n \n \nAs you can see, your theory also raises an untold number of questions. And also has no reasonable answers for these questions. It takes an equal amount od faith to believe your ever changing science that completely contradicts today what it believed only 50 years ago. And in 50 years from now will completely contradict what you assume to be true today. That isn't to say stop seeking answers, but only that you have no right to hold your current beliefs up as true in any way because they are as fluid as the Ocean you believe life came from.\n\n \n I have already talked about science's ability to examine, question and change itself as its great epistemological strength, but your assertion of \"complete contradiction\" is somewhat innacurate. Due to those aforementioned qualities, what actually happens as science evolves (pun intended) is that while the stuff at the frontiers switches wildly to and fro, the foundations become more and more reliable. \n \n I like to think of it as a building, the final shape of which no one knows, but with each crazy new architectural innovation at the top, the lower sections are strengthened to support it. Often the new top is deconstructed before it is even finished, but the additions to the foundations that would have helped support the now defunct addition remain in place, ensuring that even wilder structural additions are possible, and that the edifice as a whole grows stronger. \n \n This is in reference to what I said at the beginning; evolution is adhered to so strongly because it forms a major part of the foundations of the \"Science Building\". Remember what I said in another thread about consilience? The foundations all interconnect with each other and support each other, even when the multiple additions at the top threaten to destabilise each other. The basics of evolution are highly consilient with many other sciences, so we do not question them; to do so would call into question many other extremely reliable areas of study, and vice versa. \n \n The fact is, science WORKS. The only reason evo is controversial is because it calls into question one, and only one (in terms of controversy) assertion of monotheism; that humanity was created specially and is, in some unquantifiable way, 'above' the rest of life. To me, this is just obviously an amusingly and predictably anthropocentric, psychological crutch connected to rationalising the unalterable fact of inevitable death. \n \n (I apologise for omitting your final 3 paragraphs but I believe I would only repeat myself if I responded to them.)",

   "Frankly the account in Genesis of creation is no better than the Chinese account which follows:\n =================================\n \n Chinese Myth - Creation\n \n In the beginning, the universe was a black egg where heaven and earth were mixed together, and in this egg was contained Pangu. He felt suffocated, so he cracked the egg with a broadax, and the light, clear part of the egg floated up to form Heaven while the cold, heavy part stayed down and formed Earth. Pangu stood in the middle, and he and the egg's two parts grew and grew until he was nine million li in height.\n \n When Pangu died, his breath became the wind and clouds, his voice the rolling thunder, and his eyes the sun and the moon. His hair and beard became the stars in the sky, the flowers and trees from his skin, the marrow in his bones became jade and pearls, and his sweat the good rain that nurtured the Earth.\n \n There are several versions of the Pangu legend, but one that is common in southern China is that of King Fang and King Gao Xin. Pangu was King Gao Xin's dog, and King Gao Xin had a great enmity with King Fang. He proclaimed, \"Anyone who can bring me King Fang's head will have my daughter's hand in marriage,\" but no one would try because of King Fang's fearsome army.\n \n One day Pangu slipped away and went to King Fang's court. King Fang was happy to see that he had deserted King Gao Xin, and welcomed him with a banquet. However, that night, Pangu sneaked into the king's chambers and bit off his head, returning back to King Gao Xin with it.\n \n King Gao Xin was overjoyed to see that Pangu had brought King Fang's head, but did not think to marry his daughter to a dog. Pangu would not eat for three days, and the king asked, \"Why do you not eat? Are you angry that I would not marry my daughter to you?\"\n \n Pangu said, \"No, just cover me with your golden bell for seven days and I'll turn into a man.\" The king did so, but the princess peeked under on the sixth day. She found that Pangu already had man's body but retained a dog's head. However, once the bell had been raised the magic change stopped, and he remained a man with a dog's head. The princess married him and the settled in southern China, where they had four children, who became the ancestors of mankind.",

   "http://www.aldokkan.com/religion/creation.htm\n \n Summarizes the Egyptian Creation Myths. You will find some resemblance to the genesis account.\n \n And this one will be rather more familiar:\n .In one Egyptian creation myth, the sun god Ra takes the form of Khepri, the scarab god who was usually credited as the great creative force of the universe. Khepri tells us,\"Heaven and earth did not exist. And the things of the earth did not yet exist. I raised them out of Nu, from their stagnant state. I have made things out of that which I have already made, and they came from my mouth.\" It seems that Khepri is telling us that in the beginning there is nothing. He made the watery abyss known as Nu, from which he later draws the materials needed for the creation of everything.\n \n . . . . .He goes on to say, \"I found no place to stand. I cast a spell with my own heart to lay a foundation in Maat. I made everything . I was alone. I had not yet breathed the god Shu, and I had not yet spit up the goddess Tefnut. I worked alone.\" We learn that by the use of magic Khepri creates land with its foundation in Maat (law, order, and stability). We also learn that from this foundation many things came into being. At this point in time Khepri is alone. The sun, which was called the eye of Nu, was hidden by the children of Nu. It was a long time before these two deities, Shu and Tefnut were raised out of the watery chaos of their father, Nu. They brought with them their fathers eye, the sun. Khepri then wept profusely, and from his tears sprang men and women. The gods then made another eye, which probably represents the moon. After this Khepri created plants and herbs, animals, reptiles and crawling things. In the mean time Shu and Tefnut gave birth to Geb and Nut, who in turn gave birth to Osiris and Isis, Seth, Nephthys.",
