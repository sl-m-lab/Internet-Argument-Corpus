As I've debated earlier today, I think human life does not being until the being has the ability to think. \"I think therefore I am\" really brings about this point of view. Some debate it is as soon as the sperm enters the egg. I say that may be life, but it is not human life until it can think. If this is the definition of human life, then abortion can be accomplished before real human life begins and therefore there can be in interpretation of murder here. It is not morally the same as pulling the plug on a brain dead adult, but it is the same in the case of how we judge what murder is based on how we define human life.\n \n Concerning a senerio you brought up in your previous post about not performing an abortion even if the baby threatens the life of a living human, do you feel the life of an unborn baby who may either lead a good life or a bad one is more important to the mother who theoretically is already living a good life and plays an influential role in other good peoples lives? Most of the time when this type of decision has to be made, I would say that the baby is probably to the point where it is human life. How would the father treat this baby if it killed its mother at birth and how would he live with himself for being against an abortion?\n \n As for my opinion on this topic, I believe one problem with debating abortion is how easy it is to just say let life take its course without actually adding in any logical thought into the problem people are faced with. Saying that it is Gods will is one way of justifying throwing out logical considerations while still feeling like one has made the right decision. Prehaps it is easy for some people to live with this sort of decision making as well. I have trouble with it and because I realize that there are different ways of viewing life and so many possible situations in which people can find themselves, I believe that abortion should not be done away with. There are cases where abortion is the better of two options. However I also believe it is done more often than it should be. To debate that it should be made more difficult to have abortions is a good cause in my opinion, but to say do away with the whole idea is far too drastic and doesn't sit well with me.",

Well fine, then abortions beyond six weeks can be considered killing a living thing but before that it isn't killing anything. Are you fine with that? If not, then why did you even bring this up? If so, then why do you say my statements are unconvincing? Also I didn't address whether it's wrong to kill animals because we are talking human intellegence here. Animals cannot possess that.\n \n \nA scenerio like this is so far out there it is not even a convincing argument. I do not no the numbers in which a child being born has a chance of killing its mother, but I can tell you this: Dr. Diane Irving, who owned two abortion agencies and directed four, reported that her agencies \"killed or maimed 1 OUT OF EVERY 500.\" (caps mine).\n \n AMD-your arguments are unconvincing\n\n \n Why didn't you at least answer my question? I'll conceed that it is an unlikely scenario but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be addressed. As for the killed or maimed statement, I'm assuming your speaking of the people who had the abortions. Of course these people know the risks and get to make this decision. In the case of my scenario, they know the risks and should get to make a decision although your against that. You want both to be disallowed and I want both to be allowed. My scenario and your example show basically the same thing only in different context.\n \n So you are not convinced by my arguments? I'm not surprised. I don't intend to convince you by debating you about this. I want to make you think just as I want you to make me think about this issue so we can better understand our own positions. The part of abortion that I agree with is that it allows a living person the right to choose. You want to completely take that right away without exception, correct? Even in the case of rape? Even in the case where the mother is in danger? Even in the case that the baby will be born to a family who won't care for it and wishes to abort it instead? Once again, I conceed all of these are unlikely. But it is the unlikely scenarios that are the ones that worry me the most when it comes to completely abolishing abortion. At least when people have a choice options are open to all scenarios.\n \n Although I wanted to end on that note, I think it is key that I tell you that I support stricter rules on abortions. I want abortion levels to drop like a rock and the only abortions that should take place are in those rare situations where it makes sense.",

Abortions are legal because the child in question has no rights. You would have to do a lot of talking to convince the US government to give rights to someone who is not a US citizen or to recognize an unborn as a US citizen. Then the question would appear whether you need to name your child before it is born and at what point you can safely say the baby will not be at a risk of a miscarriage and should be registered as a US citizen. Anytime before that miscarriage time period what could you do to legally give it rights?\n \n Not only do I see a lot of legal issues in this, but if you actually put all this into place then how will anyone be able to prove an abortion took place assuming that within the near future pills will commonly be used to perform them. What will you do to people who specifically go to other countries to get abortions done? Clearly they would be convicted of committing murder correct?\n \n I'm in a rush right now so I'm not sure I laid out everything right, but it just seems like a lot of legal questions to me. Allowing the living to be protected by laws is easy to do and has been the standard in the past.

As I've debated earlier today, I think human life does not being until the being has the ability to think. \"I think therefore I am\" really brings about this point of view. Some debate it is as soon as the sperm enters the egg. I say that may be life, but it is not human life until it can think.

It is not morally the same as pulling the plug on a brain dead adult, but it is the same in the case of how we judge what murder is based on how we define human life.\n\n \n Now i would like to disagree on your statement of what makes a human being would be the thinking process. The main thing that all living forms within our planet have in common is NEED. Every living thing from plants to animals to humans all need nurishment etc. From the time the sperm enters the egg it has needs for survival.This is the scientific view of looking at it. Now weather you want to look at it differently you cant argue with the fact that we all have needs and are dependent on factors in our life.\n \n The major factor of abortion is every living product deserves a chance to live. A 14 year old girl has sex with her 17 year old bf and gets pregnant what to do? abortion seems to be an answer to all of peoples responsibiltys. Both teenagers made the decision to have sex so why not act like an adult and take the resposibility of bringing the baby into the world. Now i do understand you statement on there are situations which are not healthy but that my friend is why there are adoption agencys. MAny people in this world are looking for new born babys to take care of and treat as a member of their family.\n \n Another case but this 17 year old girl was raped. Tragic as it is she should still give the baby life and give it up for adoption.Just because she was abused doesnt mean she now has the right to decide what should be living or not.(weak argument i know i was looking for the quote from lord of the rings where it says \"maybe he doesnt deserve to live but who are u to decide who lives and who doesnt\"\n \n Now onto the mother dieing if giving birth this is juss my opinion and belief if iwas the mother i would have first married a husband who would raise the kid up right after i died. Also i would know that i have lived some odd years and know its my turn to allow another to live. For i have had a full life and the baby deserves a chance.\n \n \n LASTLY ID LIKE TO SAY\n WHY DONT WE STOP AND ASK THE ABORTED BABIES WHAT THEY THINK ON ABORTION...... hmm we cant",

Now weather you want to look at it differently you cant argue with the fact that we all have needs and are dependent on factors in our life.\n\n \n Fire has needs from when it is born, yet it isn't alive. Why isn't it alive? It obviously isn't because it cannot think. It breathes, it eats, it moves, it grows, it needs. Why shouldn't we consider it to be a living thing?\n \n Sperm needs as well. Why isn't it human life? Why when it enters the egg is it human life? What needs change? The need to survive sure doesn't change.\n \n An interesting thing to argue, but I wouldn't call it a scientific view. A scientific view would be to focus on DNA.\n \n \nThe major factor of abortion is every living product deserves a chance to live.

MAny people in this world are looking for new born babys to take care of and treat as a member of their family.\n\n \n OK, shifting gears, I'd say it is their choice to make. I'd debate that no life exists anyways, only the potential for life. It doesn't care because it cannot think to care. It doesn't know it is dying anymore than a sperm knows it is dying. Until it has the ability to think it could care less what happens to it. The same is true for a dead person. That dead person could care less what you do to it. It doesn't have the ability to care. Neither does the baby.\n \n \nAnother case but this 17 year old girl was raped. Tragic as it is she should still give the baby life and give it up for adoption.Just because she was abused doesnt mean she now has the right to decide what should be living or not.(weak argument i know i was looking for the quote from lord of the rings where it says \"maybe he doesnt deserve to live but who are u to decide who lives and who doesnt\"\n\n \n Quoting LotR in a debate? The problem I have with this is that the girl is giving birth to a child of the man she probably hates the most. First of all I doubt you will find a lot of rape victims that will give up their babies. They will grow attached to them even if they hate how they came to be. Unfortunately she now has to live her younger years as a mother and miss out on her childhood while raising a child that only brings back horrible memories for her. Perhaps it ruins her life. Perhaps she seen this coming from the moment she found out she was pregnant. Perhaps she should have had an abortion and her life wouldn't be this way. I'm not fighting for every third baby to be aborted, I'm fighting for the right of people like this to have the choice.\n \n \nNow onto the mother dieing if giving birth this is juss my opinion and belief if iwas the mother i would have first married a husband who would raise the kid up right after i died. Also i would know that i have lived some odd years and know its my turn to allow another to live. For i have had a full life and the baby deserves a chance.\n\n \n Oh how wonderful for you. You can say something like this so easily without having to consider anything but what someone else would have to do. Are you a man or woman? As a man you would never have to live by the advice your giving but would you so willingly follow your advice if your wife had to make the choice? How about your mom? How about your sister? How about your child? For a woman it is slightly different as you may have to follow through with this yourself. How would you explain this to your parents? How about your kids? How could you die knowing your husband would have to raise your killer? Wouldn't you wonder? As a husband what would be the affects of knowing your kid killed your loved one?\n \n In a vacuum where only one life is affected I guess I could agree with you. However, hundreds of lives are affected. And lets not forget, I'm the one debating that people should be given a choice here while your trying to force them into a choice. Your the one who is saying this specific suffering has to occur while I'm saying make your own decision and pick the suffering you deem the least of the two horrible options.\n \n \nLASTLY ID LIKE TO SAY\n WHY DONT WE STOP AND ASK THE ABORTED BABIES WHAT THEY THINK ON ABORTION...... hmm we cant\n\n \n I think therefore I am, I don't think therefore I am not. You cannot say something like 'Lets ask the baby what it thinks'. That is like asking a brain dead person what he thinks. The brain dead person isn't there. He doesn't exist in our world. His body is there, but he isn't. That is assuming you place emphasis on the mind making us what we are like I do. You could debate this though although it is legal to pull the plug on the brain dead person.\n \n I've never actually felt so deeply about this topic as I do now after you mentioned the wife dying for the kid to live. It makes me sick even thinking about how you would have her so easily accept her death. Perhaps you feel the same way about how easily I accept the death of an unborn. However, I want you to put yourself in some situations where either you or your wife or daughter or son or mother and father will have to deal with this type of situation. I don't want you to just answer with no real feeling and just do it for the sake of debating my point of view. Take it to heart and actually think it over. I can't believe you cannot find a single case where you would wish to have the choice or wish for someone else to have the choice.",

   "AMD-\"abortions beyond six weeks can be considered killing a living thing but before that it isn't killing anything. Are you fine with that?\"\n \n No, I don't agree with you that something doesn't have rights just because it can't think. Human vegetables can't think, I don't think that they then lose their human rights. Same goes for many times when people are in comas. There has to be a point where you draw a line for humans to have rights, and you can't say it at a certain week that its been in the mother's stomach. When the sperm reaches the egg, new DNA is formed. The fetus is no longer \"just cells\", it is alive. Fetus is just another stage of human life: fetus, birth, infancy, ect.\n \n AMD-\"As for the killed or maimed statement, I'm assuming your speaking of the people who had the abortions. Of course these people know the risks and get to make this decision.\"\n \n \n Actually, you'll find that most of the time they don't know:\n \n Former abortion counselor, Debra Henry, says, \"We were told to find the woman's weakness and work on it. The women were never given any alternatives. They were told how much trouble it was to have a baby.\"\n \n Former abortionist, Joseph Randall, M.D., says, \"The picture of the baby on the ultrasound bothered me more than anything else. The staff couldn't take it. Women who were having abortions were never allowed to see the ultrasound.\"\n \n Former abortion counselor,Kathy Sparks, says, \"The counselor at our clinic could cry with the girls at the drop of a pin. She would find out what was driving them to want to abort that child and she would magnify it.\"\n \n \"Every woman has these same two questions: First, \"Is it a baby?\" \"No,\" \n the counselor assures her. \"it is a product of conception (or blood clot or piece of tissue).\" Even though these counselors see 6 week babies daily, less than an inch long, with arms, legs, and eyes that are closed like newborn puppies, they lie to the women. How many women would actually have an abortion if they told them the truth?\" -Carol Everett, former owner of two abortion clinics and director of four, \"A Walk Through an Abortion Clinic\" \n \n \n AMD-\"The part of abortion that I agree with is that it allows a living person the right to choose.\"\n \n \n That doesn't change the fact that abortion is the killing of another human life. There is mounds of scientific evidence showing this. Don't want to go look at it? No problem. Here it is:\n \n In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings\n on the very question before us here: When does human life begin? \n Appearing to speak on behalf of the scientific community was a group \n of internationally-known geneticists and biologists who had the same \n story to tell, namely, that human life begins at conception - and \n they told their story with a profound absence of opposing testimony.\n \n Dr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth, Harvard medical School, gave \n confirming testimony, supported by references from over 20 embryology\n and other medical textbooks that human life began at conception.\n \n \"Father of Modern Genetics\" Dr. Jerome Lejeune told the lawmakers: \n \"To accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new\n human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion \n ... it is plain experimental evidence.\"\n \n Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman, Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic\n added: \"By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is \n present from the moment of conception.\"\n \n Dr. McCarthy de Mere, medical doctor and law professor, University \n of Tennessee, testified: \"The exact moment of the beginning of \n personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception.\"\n \n Dr. Alfred Bongiovanni, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,\n concluded, \"I am no more prepared to say that these early stages \n represent an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the\n child prior to the dramatic effects of puberty ... is not a \n human being.\"\n \n Dr. Richard V. Jaynes: \"To say that the beginning of human life cannot\n be determined scientifically is utterly ridiculous.\"\n \n Dr. Landrum Shettles, sometimes called the \"Father of In Vitro \n Fertilization\" notes, \"Conception confers life and makes that life one\n of a kind.\" And on the Supreme Court ruling _Roe v. Wade_, \"To deny a\n truth [about when life begins] should not be made a basis for \n legalizing abortion.\"\n \n Professor Eugene Diamond: \"...either the justices were fed a backwoods \n biology or they were pretending ignorance about a scientific certainty.\"\n \n \". . .when life begins - is no longer a question for theological or \n philosophical dispute. . .it is an established fact. . .that all life, \n including human life, begins at the moment of conception.\" (Dr. Hymie Gordon, professor of Medical Genetics, Mayo Clinic; quoted by Public Affairs Council pamphlet \"The Abortion Choice,\" POB 98292 Tacoma, WA 98498)\n \n \"When Hitler determined to exterminate the Jews, some German humanists objected on the basis of the sanctity of life and of natural justice, Hitler simply defined the Jews as less than fully human, and his critics were anesthetized. If the Jews were not human, then they did not have human rights. What a simple solution to an otherwise perplexing problem! The arument for rights...becomes capricious and merely a matter of definition of terms by whoever has the power to make his definition stick...When abortion opponents object that in doing so they destroy other persons - unborn children - and deprive them of all their rights, the prochoice party simply resorts to having the competent power - the Supreme Court - declare that unborn children are not persons and hence have no rights to interfere with a woman's freedom of choice.\" (JW Whitehead, The Second American Revolution, \n pp. 118, 1982, David C.

Since we have the right to pull the plug on them that means that humans who cannot think yet have human rights can legally be killed.\n \n A miscarriage is the death of a living human, should there be an autopsy? Should there be a burial? Should there be an investigation into the death to make sure it wasn't an abortion? It is unlikely that you will get any of this to happen because the death of an unborn will not be treated like the death of a living person who actually is a US citizen. This further shows the fact that a fetus isn't considered on the same level as a person who is already born.\n \n I'm fine with your definition that human life even begins at conception. It is a very strange theory to me but you can have your opinion just as my strange theory is my opinion. I've been over this enough to know that there isn't enough proof for either of us to actually make a dent in the other persons idea so I'm not going to debate you on this.\n \n \n\"How many women would actually have an abortion if they told them the truth?\"\n\n \n So your essentially debating that you want women to be told the truth in this statement and that which accompanied it. I'll agree with you again then. Lets tell them the truth.\n \n \nThat doesn't change the fact that abortion is the killing of another human life. There is mounds of scientific evidence showing this. Don't want to go look at it? No problem. Here it is:\n\n \n That doesn't change the fact that pro-choice still allows living people to have a choice. Your scientific evidence is scientific opinion and obvious logic at the same time. The question \"When does human life begin\" can be interpreted in many ways, two of which I'll spell out here. How I would interpret it would be \"When does an organism begin to show it is human by gaining species traits?\". Another way to interpret it would be \"What is the first thing that has to occur for human life to be possible?\". Hence when does human life begin. Human life beginning may just be the first step in a development process before an unborn actually becomes a human life form. I don't know the entire context of what was said in the quotes below so I can't be sure what interpretation they were using. Should I have the drive to actually trying to debate this topic further I'm sure I could find support for my point of view.\n \n \n\"When Hitler determined to exterminate the Jews, some German humanists objected on the basis of the sanctity of life and of natural justice, Hitler simply defined the Jews as less than fully human, and his critics were anesthetized.

   "\"America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v. Wade has deformed a great nation. The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. It has aggravated the derogation of the father's role in an increasingly fatherless society. It has portrayed the greatest of gifts -- a child -- as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters\" \n And, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners.

I guess I could come up with a debate to it but you've convinced me so there is no reason for me to debate it. In the modern society of the US it probably part of societies role to defend even the unborn. To what extent now is the only question.\n \n For born children we still allow parents to spank their children and punish them in physical ways although not to the point where they are visibly injured or psychologically hurt. Society seems to be pushing towards removing this type of use of physical force against children but it hasn't been accomplished yet. So there are some limitations to what the society allows to happen and not to happen in the case of using physical force against a child.

I've debated that there should always be at least an option for abortion even if only for the most extreme cases, so I think there should be. What do you think?\n\n \n 1st, I don't actually think there will ever NOT be the option. I think it will always exist. Even were it made totally illegal then people would seek the abortion in dirty filthy hidden environments. That is the way it was in either the 50s or 60s when abortion was illegal. (Ever see Dirty Dancing?)\n \n 2nd, perhaps the solution is to have child advocates at all hospitals (most already have that or a similar position). The law requires that the Doctor making the medical decision of an extreme case consult with a legal counselor on the legal position. Additional if the parent ot be is under age then the parents of the underage parent to be are notified unless there is a danger as determined by the advocate and the doctor and then CPS is called.\n \n 3rd, it would have to be medically certified to be an extreme danger to the life of the parent to be. Not simply a danger of disability but to life.\n \n 4th, We need to do away with abortion clinics. They are far to easy and abortions come quickly and with few safeguards for anyone. All abortions would be done in a hospital with a doctor sworn to protect life of mother and child at all costs as opposed to those sworn to do abortions if that is what is asked for. \n \n Now, you are getting my opinions. I think this policy is a good one although I recognize a few kinks in the hose. The thing I am most adamant about are that Underage children having children needs more protection. Their parents need to be held responsible. And that abortion clinics have one purpose and one purpose only, to make abortion easy so that having children is simply a matter of convenience.\n \n We live in a new society where technology has outpaced our own morality, ethics, charma or what have you. We are a world of convenience, nowhere more than in America. Children really are the future. We have traded that distinction for one of convenience. Having worked with the developmentally disabled, I have worked with mothers that were 17 and had a 3year old child with Cerebral Palsy. The statement she made to me was startling. She said, (and this is a true story), \"If I had thought I had a chance of a baby with this kind of disability I would have stayed celeibate.\" \n \n We don't think before we leap. There is someting on the order of a 10% chance that any given infant will be born with a disability. I don't particularly like those odds. Abstinenece is where our tax dollars should go, not abortion.\n \n Thanks for the opportunity to present a view point. I would love to hear debate on the proposed policy and possible alternatives",

I'm sure even if all illegal options in this country were taken away people could go to China or any other country where abortions are something that get done every day and no one really even wonders whether they should be legal or not.\n \n \n2nd, perhaps the solution is to have child advocates at all hospitals (most already have that or a similar position). The law requires that the Doctor making the medical decision of an extreme case consult with a legal counselor on the legal position. Additional if the parent ot be is under age then the parents of the underage parent to be are notified unless there is a danger as determined by the advocate and the doctor and then CPS is called.\n\n \n Sounds like a good thing to me.\n \n \n3rd, it would have to be medically certified to be an extreme danger to the life of the parent to be. Not simply a danger of disability but to life.\n\n \n I would take it further than this. I would also include it in the case where the parents are in no state to take care of the child or if the mother was raped and doesn't wish to have the child. I think these are two other realistic reason to have abortions. \n \n \n4th, We need to do away with abortion clinics. They are far to easy and abortions come quickly and with few safeguards for anyone. All abortions would be done in a hospital with a doctor sworn to protect life of mother and child at all costs as opposed to those sworn to do abortions if that is what is asked for. \n\n \n I agree with this as well but this wouldn't be something that could happen overnight. It would have to be progressively put into effect.\n \n \nNow, you are getting my opinions. I think this policy is a good one although I recognize a few kinks in the hose. The thing I am most adamant about are that Underage children having children needs more protection. Their parents need to be held responsible. And that abortion clinics have one purpose and one purpose only, to make abortion easy so that having children is simply a matter of convenience. \n\n \n The parents of both families or just the parents of the girl? How would you hold them responsible? Legally I don't think you can hold them responsible for this as long as the child is 16 or over. Any less than that and they will have to probably deal with it. The unfortunate part may be that they can put it up for adoption against their child's (the parent of the newborn) will.\n \n \nWe live in a new society where technology has outpaced our own morality, ethics, charma or what have you. We are a world of convenience, nowhere more than in America. Children really are the future. We have traded that distinction for one of convenience. Having worked with the developmentally disabled, I have worked with mothers that were 17 and had a 3year old child with Cerebral Palsy. The statement she made to me was startling. She said, (and this is a true story), \"If I had thought I had a chance of a baby with this kind of disability I would have stayed celeibate.\"\n \n We don't think before we leap. There is someting on the order of a 10% chance that any given infant will be born with a disability. I don't particularly like those odds. Abstinenece is where our tax dollars should go, not abortion.\n \n Thanks for the opportunity to present a view point. I would love to hear debate on the proposed policy and possible alternatives\n\n \n I think it will be very hard to enforce abstinence even on a family to family basis, much less a cultural basis. I would tend to believe that the better the upbringing of a child, the better chance that they will avoid having a baby at a young age. But how do we deal with the fact that some parents are simply unfit to be parents and will raise kids which are not going to have a good upbringing? How do we deal with kids brought up in bad neighborhoods and have a poor education? I would wager to guess that even with the best upbringing and best education and neighborhood to grow up in, the friends and peers of a person can sway their actions against what they know to be right. It would be a difficult task.",

Would a forced adoption hurt a 15 year old worse than an abortion? I think the situation should help dictate the decision. \n\n \n It is a good question to ask if forcing a 15 year old to have the child is going to hurt them more that having an abortion. It's my opinion that abortions are far more damaging than having a baby you don't want. I think it would have an incredible effect on someone to go through something as horrible as rape, feel guilt and shame, discover that they're pregnant, and then choose to have the baby although it will change their life. She could see the child as something good coming out of something awful. How many times have you heard of parents speaking about birth as something special and joyful? She would know that she had given someone a chance at life. I think it would be a beautifully unselfish thing for her to do, and I don't think its bad to be unselfish. I certainly agree that it would have a great effect on her life. I think it would be so empowering. About adoption, I think it was said earlier that there are 1.5 million adoptive couples waiting. I don't know what it costs though. Still, I think money is not an important factor here.\n \n Speaking about either rape or not... Will their reputation be ruined? They were raped, but still carried the child? They got pregnant with their boyfriend, but didn't take the easy way out? They cared enough to carry the child that would utterly change their life? I have nothing but respect for someone who would do that. Their reputation might be ruined with narrow-minded people who see that 'that girl had sex before marriage' but it doesn't occur to them that she didn't have an abortion, even though it would have been easy, that she took responsobility for her actions. \n I am speaking an opinion here, but I think it is well-founded.\n \n \"Your plan takes away options while mine leaves them open. Your plan will make people feel helpless and without options while mine may leave them feeling depressed if they choose an abortion when they later decide they didn't want to.\"\n \n I think 'may leave them feeling depressed' is an understatement. Have you considered what it would be like to beleive you had killed a life?\n \n Quote from Boundless webzine regarding Post Abortive Stress Syndrome...\n \n \"The trauma in PASS comes from the pressure to abort from boyfriends or family, the anxiety over choosing the abortion, the physical pain of the procedure (despite anesthesia!) and, most obviously, guilt once the abortion has been performed. Some women have even said that an abortion feels like rape - a sexual violation performed by a complete stranger causing extraordinary pain. PASS is particularly virulent in women who have had chemical abortions, because these abortions produce a complete, perfect and dead child.\n \n One study found that at least 19 percent of women who have had abortions suffer from some form of PASS. In all likelihood, the rate is actually higher, because these studies have high drop-out rates - and generally from the women who suffer the most intensely. Dr. Wanda Franz, testifying before a congressional hearing on the impact of abortion in March of 1989, summarized the syndrome by saying that women \"report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts and of blood ... they re-experienced it [the abortion] with terrible psychological pain ... they feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities - the role of being a mother.\"\n \n It doesn't stop there. There are reports of sexual dysfunction, both of extreme revulsion to sex and extreme promiscuity. Many women contemplate suicide and a fair number of those attempt it; studies in England and Finland identify a definite link between abortion and suicide. Smoking, drinking and drug use all increase after abortions, as do eating disorders. Post-abortive women are more prone to divorce and chronic relationship problems; they find it difficult to bond with their children born after the abortion and many simply continue the pattern - by now, 45 percent of all abortions are repeat abortions. All these expressions of PASS can show up from minutes after the abortion to decades later. Often it takes five to ten years of denial before the memories and emotions begin to surface uncontrollably.\n \n The turmoil of PASS is probably best seen in the dreams of those suffering from it. The site afterabortion.org catalogs a number of these dreams. Here's a fairly representative one:\n \n My dream has been repeated so many times over the years ... I can wake myself up now. The dream starts in an old three-story house. Sometimes I'm in the back of the house, sometimes I'm just driving up, sometimes I am already in the house. Big, white, clean, hardwood floors, beautifully decorated. I always think that it is a good dream. Then I start up the beautiful winding stairs. I am apprehensive but I still go up the stairs. I finally make it to the room on the third floor. The room is completely empty. There is only a white box under the window across the room. I walk into the room. I am never alone, someone is always with me. That part is ironic considering the complete feelings of isolation I have had all these years. Anyway, I walk to the box. Sometimes I hear a baby crying and I quickly open the box only to find it empty. Other times I have opened the box to find baby clothes. Other times I have found a dead baby. Other times I have found my old bloody clothes. I stand over the box crying and the intensity wakes me up. \"\n \n That quote is probably the biggest reason I oppose abortion, besides my beleif that the unborn is human.\n \n And finally, regardless of this post, wouldn't it be wrong to kill a human being to prevent another from losing their reputation, or living a very hard life?",

That is a debate I used to use to support pro-choice but I now see that there are flaws in that idea.

I've seen you mention the fact that it is legal to have an abortion before and thought it was one of your main arguements.",

   "Well you just made the ultimate mistake. Trying to justify things based on your belief in God skews your views and doesn't allow you to make a logical decision anyways. This has basically just become a religious debate instead of one on abortion and I think if you want to find the answer to this question you will need to debate on the Religion board.\n \n Also if everything that occurs is Gods will, then isn't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur?\n \n I won't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born, but this is a rare event. I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events. What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so? That is a rare case as well. I'm sure you will say this doesn't justify abortion and I'll agree with you because both our points about low probability instances are so rare that they shouldn't matter in this debate anyways.\n\n \n God always makes you think logically. All the real truth in the universe comes from him. Anna is right in her thinking.",
