   "Prove that there is no human person present in those 5 month old developing human twins Ao. Can you do that? You say it as if it's an accepted fact but you produce no evidence at all. And the reason for that is because it's just your opinion. \n\n From http://www.2think.org/science_abortion.shtml (page 4):\n Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted \"gray matter\" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. \n \n By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. \n Of course, the evidence I am presenting here is once piece of evidence showing the stage in pregnancy where fetuses could potentially start having mental existence, which is a criteria I and others set for a fetus being a human person with rights. As for evidence for what defines a person, that is irrelevant since different people have different definitions, where there is no standard definition accepted by all. We simply present the reasons behind our defining person in a particular way and, hopefully, any readers who may be undecided end up being swayed by the most sound arguement.\n \nBut my evidence that it is a PERSON JUST AS VALUABLE AS YOU ARE, is that you yourself were once in exactly the same position and condition as an unborn child is now, and look at what you have become. And 5+ billion other people who are alive today have the same exact origin, and they too are sentient human beings just as YOU are. So by what authority do you deny these developing human beings their right to grow into themselves just as you had? \n\n You are mistaking opinion for evidence. Value is a relative thing. You clearly value something that will likely become a person as much as you value a person themselves. That is an opinion about value that most of us on the pro-choice side find quite skewed. What WILL BE is not the same thing as what IS. \n \n Also, I don't see simply bodies devoid of mind - i.e. bodies with \"nobody home\" - as having rights, just like I don't see an unfertilized egg as having rights. So, your claim that I am denying their rights is irrelevant since mere bodies have no rights to begin with. I need no authority to deny rights to bodies since there is no authority that gives rights to them to begin with.\n \nThat isn't sympathy for the mother at all. It is cheap lip service that considers a woman's inconvenience of carrying her own baby to term and then putting it up for adoption to be a greater injustice than murdering her own innocent baby in cold blood. How is that rational, just, or fair in any way at all, either morally or ethically? \n\n The sympathy I was referring to was in reference to the news article of the opening post, where I said: My sympathies personally go out to the mother since she had invested all that time, physical difficulty, and emotion in carrying what seems to be a wanted pregnancy where she had high hopes for those fetuses.  \n \n Because of that sympathy, I said: Legally, I think the woman should have the right to prosecute criminally against the assault to begin with, and to sue in civil court for the loss of her twins.\n \n Of course, I also have sympathy for women with unwanted pregnancy which you do not seem to have since you seem to view all women with unwanted pregnancies as immorral whores. \n \nAnd it might be nice to get some terminology right too, for once. A zygote is a fertilized egg that is referred to as an embryo until it's 8 weeks old. After 8 weeks it's referred to as a fetus. It's at that time that it has developed fingers and toes and is an accurate representation of a human being. Here are the actual stages of a developing human being Ao, now tell me; how can you say they aren't human beings when I'm sure you know that your beginnings were as humble as the babies in this photo spread. And who are you to define their value as non-human beings? What gives you that right?\n \n http://www.aboutabortions.com/EmbFetal.htm\n\n Once again, you are arguing potential. Just because I was once as humble as those babies in the photos doesn't mean that I was a person at that early stage. Since no level of mind existed in my body in those early stages then I as a person did not exist yet - just my body. Similarly, if I ever get into a major accident which essentially destroys my cerebral cortex then I would no longer exist, despite my body potentially being artificially kept alive. Mental existence is the same thing as our existence as people, in my view and the view of many on the pro-choice side. My mother had every right to abort me up to that stage. Sure, I am glad that she did not, but I am also glad that she did not use contraception, that my parents had sex when they did, that they even met at all, or any other event that had to happen for me to exist.\n \nAnd if your concerns are really for women, then why aren't you concerned about the physical and psychological side effects that come with abortion?\n \n http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/ABC_News.htm#British%20Study:%20Half%20of%20Expected%20Breast%20Cancer%20Cases%20%22Attributable%20to%20Abortion%22\n \n\n The great majority of abortions are safe. As with any medical procedure, there can be problems. Any major problems are quite rare for abortions. I remember reading posts that presented links showing that pregnancy is more unsafe than abortion. Should that be used as an arguement against pregnancy? As with any procedure, including pregnancy, medical science should strive to reduce risks of harm. I fully support that for all medical procedures - including both abortion and pregnancy - and have sympathy for those who do suffer the rare aftereffects. This arguement that you presented works toward neither side.\n ---\n On edit: I found a link that refutes your links of abortion and breast cancer. This is a link of the American Cancer Society who are generally considered a knowledgible organization on these topics:In February 2003, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a workshop of more than 100 of the world's leading experts who study pregnancy and breast cancer risk. The experts reviewed existing human and animal studies on the relationship between pregnancy and breast cancer risk, including studies of induced and spontaneous abortions. Among their conclusions were: \n \n 1. Breast cancer risk is temporarily increased after a term pregnancy (that is, a pregnancy that results in the birth of a living child). \n 2. Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. \n 3. Recognized spontaneous abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. \n \n The level of scientific evidence for these conclusions was considered to be \"well established\" (the highest level). That was from http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_Can_Having_an_Abortion_Cause_or_Contribute_to_Breast_Cancer.asp",

   "In all of your crude examples, the eggs either never did fertilize, or they never did attach to the uterine wall, which means that they had no hope of maturing into sentient beings at all. [bold added]\n\n I love it. Let's recap Archie's position:\n \n First: \"ALL LIFE IS SACRED!\"\n Second: \"ALL LIFE IS SACRED, AND LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.\n Third: \"ALL LIFE IS SACRED, AND LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION, YOU MURDEROUS HEATHENS!\"\n Fourth: \"ALL LIFE IS SACRED, AND LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION, YOU MURDEROUS HEATHENS, BECAUSE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A BORNE HUMAN BEING!\"\n Fifth: \"Well, disabled fetuses can be aborted, and that's okay.\"\n Sixth: \"When I said that disabled fetuses can be aborted and that's okay, I wasn't saying that all life wasn't sacred. All life is sacred, and that life starts at conception because it at that very point then has the potential to become a human being.\"\n Seventh: \"When I said that disabled fetuses can be aborted and that's okay, I wasn't saying that life isn't sacred. All life is sacred, so you shouldn't destroy it once it is started at conception (because that's when it gains the potential to become a human being), but if it is a disabled fetus it doesn't count, and if it has already been fertilized and is therefore alive and sacred and has the potential to become a human life yet does not implant in the uterine wall, it doesn't have potential to become a human life even though it has been fertilized which is when the life begins but it doesn't count here because it didn't implant so that it couldn't actually grow so that it wasn't really alive because it didn't have the potential that it had before it implanted even though it never implanted.\"\n \n \nSo they had no potential as you claim they did.\n\n You know what else doesn't have any hope/potential of maturing into sentient beings, Archie? Aborted fetuses.\n \n Game-set-match.",
