   "I have a feeling we are going to lose on this one. I hope I'm wrong, but I suspect the Supreme Court of California will rule that this was a case of amending the constitution rather than revising it. I think that folks in California will have to move forward with a measure to repeal the provision of the state constitution that bans same-sex marriage. And I think that repeal measure is likely to pass in time.\n \n Meanwhile, there is New York, where the New York Times reports that the opposition to same-sex marriage is weak. If New York legalizes same-sex marriage through the legislative process, this will be a strong and significant step forward for marriage equality. I think it's important that we are seeing states legalizing same-sex marriage through legislative action. It takes away the argument from opponents of marriage equality that same-sex marriage is being forced on the people through the courts.",

When the \"straight\" population can learn to be responsible for the lives they create as a result of their seething and lustful desires, that would probably be a better time for your attempt to pull rank. We are all just people trying to live life the best that we can.\n As for God's law, that is intended for you and only you.

Because the state and the federal recognition matter, which is why we have a legal institution of marriage at all. Legal marriage matters in many ways, notably by providing legal protections of two parents to our children and providing legal protections and obligations of one spouse to another. Our current health insurance system is also based on legal marriage, and by not allowing same-sex couples to marry legally, we either exclude same-sex spouses from health insurance, or we allow them to get the insurance but tax them for it when we don't tax opposite-sex spouses for the same insurance.

It can certainly pertain to committing to someone in terms of monogamy, but not in terms of states granting benefits. To say 'so-and-so can marry someone they love' or 'so-and-so can't marry someone they love' is an irrelevant way of addressing the issue---after all, the right is either to legal benefits or not, regardless of whether the relationship has anything to do with \"love\". Some couples get benefits and there may be no \"love\" whatsoever. Others get no benefits even if there IS \"love\". It's beside the point. The state couldn't care less who loves whom.",

If you are Christian, not all Christians agree with you, and many gay people are Christians. In our civil society, we do not or should not impose one group's religious beliefs on everyone through the laws, because we have religious liberty. Just because you think your religious beliefs are right does not mean they should be imposed on everyone else through the law. We are not a theocracy. You are, of course, free to hold those beliefs as an individual. That's religious liberty. \n \n As for gay people who don't have sex, of course there are gay people who don't have sex, just as there are heterosexuals who don't have sex. People may not have sex because they are single or because they are sick or infirm or because they are busy or apart from their spouses or simply because they choose not to. Why do you have this focus on sex? Are you preoccupied with sex? This is a forum about gay rights, not about sex. Gay people are human beings....full human beings.

In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs).

When homosexual sexual interactions are motivated by sexual enjoyment, suddenly that's a bad thing???\n \n Furthermore, gay sex helps bind a couple together, strengthening the commitment. Just like with straight couples.\n \n \n \nYet the Gay movement continues to fight for the right to same-sex marriage. You would think they could just point to the 14th amendment and say \"see, here it is!\"\n\n Do you realize that a lot of gays DO EXACTLY THAT???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n Just because the 14th amendment forbids discrimination against rights without a legitimate state interest doesn't mean people always listen.\n \n \n \nThere you go making those silly arguments again.\n\n There you go again.\n Making absolutely no argument which provides a persuasive basis for another person to think your position is credible, while simply saying \"Nay\" to counter other people's arguments...",

They are just your beliefs, not everyone's beliefs. We should not base our civil laws, which govern everyone, on the religious beliefs of a few people. You yourself concede that not everyone interprets the Bible the same way. To say that God thinks x, y, or z is to repeat your belief about what God thinks. Not everyone agrees with your belief. If some people want to believe that God disapproves of same-sex love or same-sex marriage, then they can choose not to marry someone of the same sex. They can even choose not to marry same-sex partners in their churches. The problem arises when they try to force their particular religious beliefs on everyone through civil law. \n \n All gay people do NOT have sex, just as not all heterosexuals have sex. You keep coming back to sex for some reason. And you diminish the love that spouses have for each other when you say that all gay people want is to \"get their rocks off.\" You really should ask gay people what our lives are like instead of making pronouncements about gay people. That's like me telling you, \"All Hispanics do X.\" That would be disrespectful, and it would also be foolish, since I don't know what all Hispanics do. I cannot generalize in that way. I cannot do that, even though my daughter is Hispanic. But I cannot generalize from her life to everyone's life. \n \n You pull up a dictionary definition of \"homosexual\" to try to support your contention that all gay people have sex. But the definition itself that you found does not support this. It says \"having a sexual attraction to persons of the same sex.\" Having an attraction to persons of the same sex is not necessarily having sex. \n \n The issue we are discussing here is marriage. Gay people already have the right to have sex with the consenting adults of our choice, as do heterosexuals. The issue before us is not whether sex is right, but whether we should have the equal right to marry our spouses legally. Marriage is a lot more than sex. Sex is just one part, a relatively small part, of marriage. The Bible does not say anything about same-sex marriage, btw. Even the passages about sexuality are ambiguous, and they are interpreted differently by different religious scholars and believers, as you conceded. \n \n If all gay people wanted was to have sex, we can do that already. We want the right to marry legally, to protect our spouses and to protect our children. For the same reasons heterosexual couples marry legally.\n \n As several of us have pointed out to you already, the 14th amendment does not say anything about rights for any specific group; it refers to \"persons.\" And the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that gay people are \"persons\" and our rights are protected from state abrogation under the 14th amendment.",

   "I have a feeling we are going to lose on this one. I hope I'm wrong, but I suspect the Supreme Court of California will rule that this was a case of amending the constitution rather than revising it. I think that folks in California will have to move forward with a measure to repeal the provision of the state constitution that bans same-sex marriage. And I think that repeal measure is likely to pass in time.\n \n Meanwhile, there is New York, where the New York Times reports that the opposition to same-sex marriage is weak. If New York legalizes same-sex marriage through the legislative process, this will be a strong and significant step forward for marriage equality. I think it's important that we are seeing states legalizing same-sex marriage through legislative action. It takes away the argument from opponents of marriage equality that same-sex marriage is being forced on the people through the courts.\n\n \n While I won't be voting for gay marriage, I agree that the correct way to get it is through the legislative process, not forcing it down the public's throats (no pun intended) via the Court.\n \n \nAnthony321\n More like a loud reminder that the minority shall not suffer the tyranny of the majority. Are you aware that those same activist courts were responsible for granting equality to black people in the 1960's?

Both straights, gays, polygamists, siblings, or whatever) can form a union (\"marry\") in the sense of coming together and making a commitment of monogamy before witnesses. If you can find someone to marry you, witnesses, and make a commitment, are you not \"married\"? The only difference is that one is recognized by the state and the others are not. You mention \"love\", but the only level where \"love\" comes into play is that of the commitment which you can do with or without the state. Whether or not marriage is recognized by a state has nothing to do with 'love' which is something the state can't qualify/quantify. I'd be married REGARDLESS of what the state does. If the state suddenly decided to stop recognizing any marriages whatsoever, I'd still be married in the sense that it's a commitment, and THAT'S the only place where 'love' is a factor in this debate.\n\n It's all about the Benjamins.

I've been essentially AWOL for the past year, but have posted a few times lately.\n \n \nSteeeeve is a lot like JP they both would support the vote of the people on wether they were to be grabbed off the street and executed on site.

If there is one thing homosexuals love, it's sex, or otherwise he is not a true homosexual. Maybe he's just a girly-man.\n\n I am routinely amused by people of prejudice, who obviously know little about gays, trying to tell gay people what gays are like...\n emoticon_wow\n \n There are some promiscuous homosexuals, just like there are promiscuous heterosexuals. However, they are the exception and not the norm, regardless of what your stereo-typing mind may think.\n \n Regardless, I've already quoted you a study which shows a significant percentage of homosexuals who have not had sex within the study's time period of testing. You're obviously ignoring it, like many people of prejudice ignore facts while sticking to stereo-types...\n Gay Mental Health\n \n \n \nYou really want to be right, don't you? You'll say anything to prove a point you don't have. Think about it. Sexual attraction means sexual desire, doesn't it?

To build stronger bonds between a couple.&#8220; But is this the true purpose of gay sex?\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n I could ask the same thing about heterosexual sex, but I think ultimately you would realize how futile such a course of questioning would be.\n \n To put it bluntly, sex DOES NOT NEED any purpose in the first place!\n YOU want some reason to condemn it, so you attack what you claim is a lack of purpose.\n But that's like attacking a dog cause it doesn't have wings. The dog DOES NOT NEED wings. It's your mind which wants to insist the dog needs wings, when it doesn't.\n \n Regardless of your willingness to insist on banal standards, what's the purpose of masturbation? It builds no \"stronger bonds\". It doesn't cause the person to procreate.\n Does that mean we should discriminate against people who masturbate??? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nLet me ask you another very important question. What is the purpose of the semen that results from this so called expression of love and intimacy? Surely there is some purpose to the semen. \n\n You're one of those \"natural law\" thinkers, aren't you...\n emoticon_wow\n \n I'm sorry, but the purpose of \"semen\" is irrelevant for gay sex just as it is important for masturbation.\n Just as irrelevant as it is for the heterosexual blowjob.\n \n Just as irrelevant as the egg's purpose is during a woman's period.\n You try to derive meaning and obligatory standards based on the \"purpose\" of things.\n I say that even if I use a kitchen knife as a screw-driver, that knife has a purpose.\n \n One could take your very approach and ask what is the purpose of homosexuals and homosexual couples in the first place.\n After being given a purpose for gays and gay couples, that must prove something about God's design? Ergo, you must accept their place in God's plan?\n Nah. Of course you wouldn't be so consistent...\n \n Your approach is meaningless and personal. It is something YOU PERSONALLY can follow in your life if you so choose, but it is no intelligent standard to demand of others.\n \n \n \nNow, moving on, you stated the following:\nGod has never said anything against same-sex love or marriage \n\n\n That statement was not uttered by me. You have been sloppy in quoting people.\n That statement was uttered by Ohioprof.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12743-day-decision-may-21st-3.html#post354754\n \n \n \nSo my question is, if you don't believe the Bible, how do you know that God never said anything against same-sex love, or marriage?\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Your question is intelligent as me asking you \"If a person doesn't believe in the bible, how does that person know that God never said anything FOR same-sex love or marriage?\"\n \n God MAKES gay people.\n He MAKES gay animals.\n Gays don't result in feelings of abandonment by a father.

   "I think you're somewhat right about the 14th amendment. It's not specific enough to state for sure one way or the other about the rights of gays. I really doubt that when the 14th amendment was written, it was written with this issue in mind, so I don't believe that the 14th amendment can be applied to same-sex marriage. Especially since same-sex marriage is impossible anyway because marriage is only possible between a man and a woman.\n \n Now, you may want to change the definition of what marriage is to fit your view of the way things should be, but it wouldn't be a real marriage. It would simply be a form of make believe marriage. Because no Christian church (well, I'm sure one or two would) would perform the marriage ceremony because it goes against God. \n \n What would happen then? Would you then go to court and try to get laws passed to force churches to perform same-sex marriage? I bet you would. And the freedom of the church would suffer. I think the gay movement is a powerful political force, and one thing about a movement like that is that when they suffer a defeat in the courts, they rally again and again until they get what they want, and I see it in the fact that although same-sex marriage is wrong, it has passed in four or five states already. \n \n I don't know what you hope to accomplish by stating that there are gays that don't have sex, but there must be something. If a man likes to have sex with other men, then he is a homosexual. If a man does NOT like to have sex with other men, then it's hard to fathom how the heck someone can say he is gay, but I bow to your belief and in your opinions. But I for one will continue to refer to gays as men who love to have sex with other men, and I will continue to state the fact that there is no such thing as a non-sexual gay. Thank you for respecting that right. \n \n \nSexual DESIRE is not the same thing as sexual INTERCOURSE.\n Just because a person is ATTRACTED to the same gender, which makes them a homosexual, does not mean the person is automatically having SEX with the same gender.\n\n \n I think that's word play, and nothing more. Let me ask you a question. What does a gay man do when he is overcome with sexual desire for another man, and has the opportunity to engage in it? Sexual desire and intercourse are different things, but one leads to the other. Please respect my intelligence, and stop these word games.\n \n There is a purpose to sex. And the purpose of sex is procreation. I have argued this point on other debate sites, and the answer given by other gays is always the same, which is why I made reference to you're having a list of talking points. But this is something that you cannot change. It will always be for procreation, and you can call it irrelevant if you want to, but I will continue to post the truth on this board because there is too much of half-truths and outright lies about the true nature of gay sex. \n \n I'll get reamed for saying this, and I don't want to come off as some type of homophobe and bigot, but I have to tell the truth. Gay sex is as wrong as it can get. It accomplishes no purpose. It's deviant, perverted, and sick. It's dangerous and can lead to sickness if you're not careful (and I'm not talking about STD's which can happen in heterosexual sex) because it involves the penetration of the anus, an area which is unclean and contains a lot of pathogens. Also, it involves the use of the anus for a purpose which was never intended. Men were given certain equipment that fits perfectly with the equipment that God gave women, and it results in something that God intended. Children and family, and gays are the oddity and a curiosity, and nothing more. They're the square peg that doesn't fit in the round hole. Their form of sex is unnatural. And no matter what you say, or what you do, or even what you may someday get to accomplish (same-sex marriage) it will never be natural, and it will never be normal even if you can get every man, woman, and child to buy into what you're trying to sell.\n \n As far as who said \"God has never said anything against same-sex love or marriage\" it doesn't matter that I quoted the wrong person. It's a wrong statement, and cannot be proven, and if anyone disagrees, then I would like to know how that person knows.\n \n You're ready to believe that God created Gays, but you're not ready to believe God when he says it's wrong. You want to pick and choose what you want to believe. Calling the Bible a fantasy book is you're opinion, and at least there is the Bible. What do you guys have as proof? I saw a post, part of which stated that God actually supports gay sex. I forget who said it, but I doubt he has proof. \n \n So as far as fantasy, I think you guys have the biggest fantasy going, and the most unprovable.",

The freedom of the church will suffer? \n \n \n RamFel\n I don't know what you hope to accomplish by stating that there are gays that don't have sex, but there must be something. If a man likes to have sex with other men, then he is a homosexual. If a man does NOT like to have sex with other men, then it's hard to fathom how the heck someone can say he is gay, but I bow to your belief and in your opinions. But I for one will continue to refer to gays as men who love to have sex with other men, and I will continue to state the fact that there is no such thing as a non-sexual gay. Thank you for respecting that right. \n \n \n Anthony321\n Unlike food, in regards to sex one doesn't have to sample to know what one likes. I'll give you an example. As a young teenager I'd seen magazines with nude women. I couldn't figure out why the girls were wearing high heels and stockings without undergarments and a dress. Now that's a perfect example of a homosexual (who was not having sex with other men). Homosexuality shows it's face in many different ways. Having sex with other men is simply another way.\n \n \n RamFel\n I think that's word play, and nothing more. Let me ask you a question. What does a gay man do when he is overcome with sexual desire for another man, and has the opportunity to engage in it?\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n He enrolls himself in \"Exodus\" and as a result love wins out and he becomes overcome with sexual desire for a woman and knocks up an Asian hooker.\n \n \n RamFel\n Sexual desire and intercourse are different things, but one leads to the other. Please respect my intelligence, and stop these word games.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Sexual desire and intercourse are different things but one does NOT always lead to the other. I will respect your intelligence by being honest with you. I had a boyfriend, partner, (whatever you want to call it) for 9 years. We never had intercourse. We did have a sex life, but intercourse was not a part of it. We were together because we loved each others company. I asked my father once why he married my mother. His reply will stay with me forever. He said \"Because I found somebody that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.\" I felt the same way about my friend. The relationship was not based upon sex, those that are based upon sex (straight or gay) are something that I can't tell you about personally, because I have never been in one.\n \n \n \n RamFel\n There is a purpose to sex. And the purpose of sex is procreation. I have argued this point on other debate sites, and the answer given by other gays is always the same, which is why I made reference to you're having a list of talking points. But this is something that you cannot change. It will always be for procreation, and you can call it irrelevant if you want to, but I will continue to post the truth on this board because there is too much of half-truths and outright lies about the true nature of gay sex. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n I think you are right to a certain degree. The original purpose of sex appears to be procreation. For the past 100 years and especially now, the procreational purpose of sex has become the scourge of overpopulation.\n \n \n \n RamFel\n I'll get reamed for saying this, and I don't want to come off as some type of homophobe and bigot, but I have to tell the truth. Gay sex is as wrong as it can get. It accomplishes no purpose. It's deviant, perverted, and sick. It's dangerous and can lead to sickness if you're not careful (and I'm not talking about STD's which can happen in heterosexual sex) because it involves the penetration of the anus, an area which is unclean and contains a lot of pathogens.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Anal sex is not a given with homosexuals. I am 48 years old and I am quite healthy and disease free.\n \n \n \n RamFel\n Also, it involves the use of the anus for a purpose which was never intended. \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Have you made this speech to the heterosexuals who engage in this practice?\n And yes they do, more often than one might think.\n \n \n RamFel\n Men were given certain equipment that fits perfectly with the equipment that God gave women, and it results in something that God intended. Children and family, and gays are the oddity and a curiosity, and nothing more. They're the square peg that doesn't fit in the round hole. Their form of sex is unnatural. And no matter what you say, or what you do, or even what you may someday get to accomplish (same-sex marriage) it will never be natural, and it will never be normal even if you can get every man, woman, and child to buy into what you're trying to sell.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n In all due respect to you and your intelligence why are you so concerned with what doesn't concern you?\n \n \n \n \n RamFel\n As far as who said &#8220;God has never said anything against same-sex love or marriage&#8221; it doesn't matter that I quoted the wrong person. It's a wrong statement, and cannot be proven, and if anyone disagrees, then I would like to know how that person knows.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n This issue does not pertain to your God. If your God being violated bothers you, are you as mift with Hindus, Jews, and Muslims, as you are with homosexuals?\n \n \n \n \n RemFel\n You're ready to believe that God created Gays, but you're not ready to believe God when he says it's wrong. You want to pick and choose what you want to believe. Calling the Bible a fantasy book is you're opinion, and at least there is the Bible. What do you guys have as proof? I saw a post, part of which stated that God actually supports gay sex. I forget who said it, but I doubt he has proof. \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n I can honestly say that my mother and father created me. I didn't have to read an ancient book to find that out. They told me so,,,,,,,,in person. Even if they didn't create me, they were the ones that clothed, fed me, taught me right from wrong. Most important of all, they loved me. As a side note, my father's little brother was gay, as well as 6 of his first cousins. The cousins were both men and women. My mother and father chalked it up to heredity years ago. They had no other option. On my father's side the outstanding family traits were blue eyes, black hair, and homosexuality.\n \n \n \n RamFel\n So as far as fantasy, I think you guys have the biggest fantasy going, and the most unprovable.\n\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n You are a straight christian man that somehow knows all there is to know about homosexuals and homosexuality, but it's us that have the biggest fantasy going. I think the reason that gay people are not frieked out by staight people is because we are raised by them. We know that they are human beings. We know that being straight does not make them good or bad. It makes them attracted to the opposite sex. It is such a simple thing for ALL the gay people I know. If homosexuality was the worst thing you had ever known in your life, what a charmed life you have lead.",

   "I think you're somewhat right about the 14th amendment. It's not specific enough to state for sure one way or the other about the rights of gays. I really doubt that when the 14th amendment was written, it was written with this issue in mind, so I don't believe that the 14th amendment can be applied to same-sex marriage. Especially since same-sex marriage is impossible anyway because marriage is only possible between a man and a woman.\n \n Now, you may want to change the definition of what marriage is to fit your view of the way things should be, but it wouldn't be a real marriage. It would simply be a form of make believe marriage. Because no Christian church (well, I'm sure one or two would) would perform the marriage ceremony because it goes against God. \n \n What would happen then?

God has NEVER said anything against same-sex love or marriage. I stand by it. The Bible passages to which you have referred (notably the famous ones in Leviticus) say NOTHING about same-sex love or marriage. Their meaning and their relevance have been debated by Bible scholars. But they say nothing at all about either love or marriage, and these are the issues we have been debating. You can try to twist the Bible into any contortions you want to suit your prejudices, but it's just twisting the Bible to suit your prejudices. It's not anything God has said. To equate your prejudices to God's will is insulting to God.\n \n As I have said before, this is not a debate about sex. It's a debate about marriage. You keep fantasizing about same-sex sex and telling everyone how \"gross\" you think it is. Who cares? I don't care whether you think same-sex sex is \"gross.\" If you don't like a particular variety of sex, don't have that kind of sex. But keep your sex talk to yourself please. This is not a forum for you to engage out loud in your sexual fantasizing.",

The \"purpose of semen\" mentality is a dead give-away on the issue to YOU using the \"natural law\" talking points.\n \n Look. Labeling something as a \"talking point\" is meaningless\".\n In your case, it just means that other people recognize a fundamental truth, and you refuse to accept it.\n I didn't go to any place to repeat those arguments.\n Those statements are my observations of reality. Obviously shared by many.\n \n \"procreation\" is not the only purpose to sex.\n If it is, then what about masturbation?\n If procreation is the only purpose to sex, what about oral sex?\n What about the use of condoms?\n Those inhibit the \"purpose of sex\", so are those things bad or wrong or improper by the same logic? emoticon_frazzled\n \n I think the real issue here is that you have some flimsy arguments that have easily recognizable flaws.\n You have no good justification, so you pull this \"talking points\" riff, which is meaningless cause YOUR ARGUMENT is a \"talking point\" as well.\n \n \n \nBut this is something that you cannot change. It will always be for procreation, and you can call it irrelevant if you want to, but I will continue to post the truth on this board because there is too much of half-truths and outright lies about the true nature of gay sex.\n\n Post away as you like.\n Most people don't go the \"there's a purpose to sex\" angle cause it's a dead end. HETEROSEXUALS routinely ignore the \"purpose to sex\" for their own interpersonal designs, so why shouldn't homosexuals?\n \n \n \nI'll get reamed for saying this, and I don't want to come off as some type of homophobe and bigot, but I have to tell the truth. Gay sex is as wrong as it can get. It accomplishes no purpose.

Have had plenty of gay sex.\n I have plenty of gay friends who also have had gay sex.\n None have ever had \"gay bowel syndrome\". None ever damaged the rectum.\n \n \n \nAlso, it involves the use of the anus for a purpose which was never intended.

Therefore, anybody who uses it in Y manner is wrong\". emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nYou're ready to believe that God created Gays, but you're not ready to believe God when he says it's wrong.\n\n Cause God DOES create gays.\n And your mythology says it is wrong, but anybody who thinks your mythology is speaking from \"God\" is failing to pay attention to the DETAILS of your mythology.\n \n And on the flip side, as for you...\n You're ready to believe that God says it's wrong, but you're not ready to believe God created Gays. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nYou want to pick and choose what you want to believe.\n\n Gee.\n And you don't?\n Do you believe in the Muslim Koran? emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nCalling the Bible a fantasy book is you're opinion, and at least there is the Bible.

The federal government thus began a new practice of refusing to extend rights and benefits to people who are legally married in certain states. That's my understanding of this.",

I know that State Constitutions can not trump the federal Constitution.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Quite frankly, that statement is a whole different can of worms.\n Examples where states have legalized marijuana and it's illegal at the federal level come to mind.\n \n Also, you should realize that until the 14th amendment came along, the constitutional \"rights\" recognized by the federal government were EXCLUSIVE to the federal government.\n Meaning that the states DID NOT have to respect the rights recognized by the federal government. The states did not have any requirements on freedom of speech / religion / etc placed on them by the constitution, until the 14th amendment.\n \n \n \nI also know that user defined \"marriage\" is not a right. At least the \"recognition\" of such a so called \"marriage\" is not not a right. \n\n You keep playing this semantics game.

I completely accept that people have the right to just about any relationship they want (some of those are even justifiably legislated),... \"The government's recognition of those relationships is a completely different matter.\"\n\n Quite frankly, interracial couples had a right to \"have a relationship\" too.\n That didn't mean squat about the constitutionality of discrimination against recognizing their marriages.\n \n \n \nYou get so caught up in the emotions of the first, that you can't (won't) even consider the merits of the second.\n\n Don't pull that junk.\n I am putting out legitimate arguments here.\n I am not relying on emotion.\n \n Respond to my legal arguments.\n Don't obfuscate the issue by treating me like I'm \"emotional\".

Nothing I said gave any rational reason to think I was talking about \"child's rights with regard to abortion\".\n \n You treat \"article 1, section 8\" like some sort of magic bullet which cures all ills, without any question as to the VALIDITY of the claim of \"promoting general welfare\".\n \n That's absurd.\n \n Rights are recognized by our government BECAUSE WE EXIST.\n Not because they \"promote\" some \"general welfare\".\n \n Can you please address the fact that rights are recognized BECAUSE WE EXIST and not because they \"promote\" some \"general welfare\"?\n \n \n \nI'm not interested in un-tangling another web of \"Starry decisis\" here.\n\n Quite frankly, what that means to me is that you're not interested in justifying your claims as to the power of \"article 1, section 8\". emoticon_frazzled\n \n You want to CLAIM that the section gives the government the power to do something, IGNORE the fact that amendment #14 STATES OTHERWISE, and then chug along like you've refuted something.\n \n I can show you NUMEROUS examples of Amendment 14 being applied to anti-gay discrimination.\n I am asking you for ANY sign that the \"article 1, section 8\" has been applied like you claim.\n \n Another thing you fail to recognize is that AMENDMENTS to the constitution are put into place to AMEND the constitution.\n Something in the previous constitution needed changing and WAS CHANGED by something later.\n As such, you shouldn't blindly disregard the impact of the 14th amendment upon your analysis.\n \n \n \nI know that it all comes back (eventually) to the Constitution itself and I know that the Congres has the authority BY THE CONSTIUTION to make laws blah blah blah,... and a fundamental aspect to the making of laws is the defining of terms. Article 1, section 8 requires the Congress to remain focussed on the \"general welfare\" needs of the nation and anything beyond that is (to me) extra Constitutional. Of course, Article 1, section 8 does not give the Congress the right to circumvent or to deny the rights of the people (nor the States) But then, I don't see \"marriage\" as the absolute Constitutional right that you do.\n\n A couple things...\n \n First, this whole \"you don't see marriage\" as a constitutional right is just bogus.\n It is illogical to put forth a CONSTITUTIONAL argument on article 1, section 8, and then IGNORE other aspects of constitutional interpretation which disagree with you.\n The courts HAVE stated that marriage IS a constitutionally protected right.\n The Supreme Court judges are experts in constitutional law.\n The court ruled UNANIMOUSLY on the issue, acknowledging marriage was a right.\n There are OTHER CASES cited in the court ruling which ALSO establish marriage as a right.\n Marriage IS a constitutionally protected right. Recognized so by our government.\n \n Second, I think you fail to recognize some overlap in concepts.\n The 14th amendment puts forth the requirement of a \"legitimate state interest\".\n You talk about \"general welfare\".\n Wouldn't a REAL case of \"promoting general welfare\" qualify as a \"legitimate state interest\"???\n \n But again, the real problem with such a situation is ultimately the LACK OF VALIDITY to the claim that preventing gay marriage has anything to do with \"general welfare\" in the first place.\n 1) The government's recognition of straight marriage is not based on \"general welfare\". It is based on recognizing a RIGHT.\n 2) The government's denial of gay marriage is not based on \"general welfare\". Nothing is improved by restricting gay marriage.\n \n Furthermore, if somebody wanted to go down your path of \"general welfare\", it is EASILY ARGUED that allowing gay marriage DOES promote \"general welfare\".\n The only REAL difference between gay and straight couples is that gay couples cannot reproduce solely within the couple.\n \n But gays can adopt just like straight couples do.\n Gays can utilize artificial insemination.\n Gays have and raise kids, creating families just like straight couples do.\n \n Any claim to \"general welfare\" for straight couples obviously is applicable to gay couples.\n \n \n \nAnd i don't think the courts do either, else Prop 8 would have failed not because of the concerns for the State Constitution and processes,... but because it would infringe upon a U.S. Constitutional right. (which IMHO doesn't exist)\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n You really refuse to recognize what the boundaries of the argument and situation are.\n \n First, the question before the court was SOLELY about the validity of Prop 8, on SPECIFIC GROUNDS.\n For example, whether or not Prop 8 required a simple majority approval, or whether it required a more stringent percentage.\n The California court ruled on the arguments before it.\n \n Furthermore, it is illogical to argue marriage is not a constitutional right WHEN IT IS REPEATEDLY PROVEN that it is.\n \n \n \nThe one man one woman template falls within the relm of our Nations \"general welfare needs\" and all of the other relationships that man can come up with fall a little bit short of that assurance.\n\n You have yet to show any cogent reason why restricting marriage to one man / one woman invokes \"general welfare needs\".\n You have been repeatedly challenged, yet you fail to show how it qualifies as such.",

   "As far as the 14th amendment goes, I have to admit I don't know it well, as you obviously do. But I know human nature, and it's human nature to take an amendment and interpret it to suit your needs and goals. And if the 14th amendment was interpreted to support same-sex marriage, then it is within the realm of possibility that it was interpreted that way by those whose sole goal is to advance the cause of same-sex marriage, which of course would mean that in my view, it was misinterpreted. You, of course, support that goal. \n \n Same sex marriage may exist in Canada and Massachusetts, but remember that true marriage exists only between men and women. The marriages you speak of are not true marriages. They're travesties. If you want to get married? Then find a nice girl and marry her, because that's the only way you'll ever be truly married. \n \n You want me to believe that homosexuality is completely natural? You'll have to prove it. I mean, you can't make babies, it's dirty, it's creepy, and saying it's natural just doesn't make sense. So you'll have to come up with something that'll convince priests, scientists, and the common man who knows instinctively that gay sex is wrong. It'll probably with us for a long time yet to come, but natural? I don't think so. I'm open to logic, so please, explain you're logic. \n \n I'm not too sure what you mean by natural law. I had to look it up, but I'm still not too clear on it. But it doesn't seem to prove that gay sex is natural. If I adhere to natural law, does that change the rules? Will God suddenly smile on gays. I use logic, and if logic is the same as natural law, then yes, I guess I adhere to it. You mentioned that I am not open to logic. I do. So go ahead. Get logical. \n \n \nMost people when they think of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" don't start fixating on what the item \"accomplishes\" or if some \"purpose\" is supposedly served.\n\n \n Why not? If something is natural, that means there's a purpose. \n \n \nSo if wasting sperm is a legitimate way to condemn gay sex, then WHY isn't the heterosexual blowjob or the good ol' masturbation condemnable in the same light?\n\n \n I don't really condemn it per se. Gays have always been around (but is still unnatural) and will probably be with us for a long time to come. All I'm doing is stating that it is unnatural. What I really want to make you understand is that same-sex marriage is not only wrong, but unattainable. Heterosexuals having sex for pleasure are natural, even if they have no intent to make a baby. But they can if they want to, and that's what separates the natural, from the unnatural. You cannot impregnate another man. Because it's unnatural. I'll never be able to impregnate anything by masturbating either, but I'm not trying to, am I? It's definitely not righteous, but comparing it to gay sex doesn't make gay sex right. \n \n Masturbation may relieve stress, and prevent prostate cancer risk, but so does straight sex. Gay sex is still wrong. \n \n \nThey are like straight virgins.\n Often, they do go out and have gay sex.\n\n \n Well well, will wonders never cease. I finally got you to admit that there are no gays who simply never have sex out of choice. Especially since everybody, gay or straight was a virgin once! Bravo.\n \n \nHate to break it to you, but the anus being unclean doesn't constitute a health risk.\n And a lot of people take the preliminary step of getting an enema first.\n\n \n Why is the enema necessary? Is it because it's dirty? Yeah, I guess an enema is really quite necessary. \n \n \nRegardless, if you think there is a health risk there, name the medical term for the problem.\n And give some stats on how many gay people actually GET that problem...\n\n \n I have no stats, but it sounds like you believe that there is nothing to worry about. If I can't come up with stats, does that make it clean? \n \n One last thing; please don't call me honey. It's creepy.",

I haven't seen anyone say 'gay marriage will affect so-and-so's marriage, or MY marriage.' \n \n \nYou're funny when you try to b.s. your way around things cause you're not good at it. It's just too easily exposable...\n You quoted that study back in 2006.\n Kurtz's study was performed in 2004.\n\n \n And it's now 2009--lots more time for people to have evaluated the study. No one's trying to b.s. anything; if you'd read what I actually wrote instead of trying to just jump on things people say, you'd see that.\n \n \n \nYou quoting the study had nothing to do with it \"coming out\". You were trying to argue against me cause I was pointing out the whole \"slippery slope\" mentality was unsubstantiated.\n\n \n I don't even remember it and frankly I don't really care. It was probably more a case of you being belligerent, as usual. If I quoted it, it was in part to put it out there for people to evaluate. And that is what has happened.",

   "As far as the 14th amendment goes, I have to admit I don't know it well, as you obviously do. But I know human nature, and it's human nature to take an amendment and interpret it to suit your needs and goals.\n\n Which is exactly what YOU were doing.\n You didn't know much about the 14th amendment, but you took it upon yourself to definitively claim it doesn't protect gays / gay marriage.\n \n So if you want to talk about the 14th amendment, then LEARN about it first.\n Otherwise, your comments are shallow and pointless.\n \n \n \nSame sex marriage may exist in Canada and Massachusetts, but remember that true marriage exists only between men and women.\n\n Do you not get where this is going?\n Do you not see how this plays out?\n You are giving YOUR OPINION as to what \"true marriage\" is.\n That isn't an argument. It's your opinion.\n So stop treating it like it's an argument. Stop treating it like it's a reason to prevent gay marriage.\n \n \n \nYou want me to believe that homosexuality is completely natural? You'll have to prove it.\n\n I have.\n You refuse to listen.\n Moreover, you REFUSE TO ADDRESS my explanation of how homosexuality is natural.\n \n \"Natural\" is defined by nature itself.\n With homosexuality abundantly present in a variety of species in nature, it OBVIOUSLY is natural.\n \n If you want to keep repeating yourself ad nausieum while ignoring what you are told, you're doing a pretty good job.\n If you think you're being convincing in any way shape or form? You're deluding yourself... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI mean, you can't make babies, it's dirty, it's creepy, and saying it's natural just doesn't make sense. So you'll have to come up with something that'll convince priests, scientists, and the common man who knows instinctively that gay sex is wrong.\n\n It's really boring how you have NO IDEA about this topic, yet you pretend to speak definitively and expertly.\n Moreover, you don't know squat about the PEOPLE whose opinion you claim to speak for.\n \n Let's start with \"scientists\".\n Scientists and medical practitioners UNILATERALLY recognize there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. The APA, AMA, AAA, ASA, etc, etc, etc...\n They ALL have come out with statements recognizing that scientifically / medically, there is nothing wrong with homosexuality.\n Do you get that?\n So don't make up junk and claim that I need to \"convince scientists\".\n Cause you obviously don't know what \"scientists\" are actually saying on the subject.\n \n As for \"common man\", again you don't know squat.\n You fixate on the \"gay marriage\" situation, but you don't seem to realize that is the ONLY AREA where anti-gay people have a majority.\n On EVERY OTHER ISSUE of equality, a MAJORITY support gay rights causes.\n * A majority believe gays should be able to serve openly in the military.\n * A majority believe gays should be able to adopt. \n * A majority believe gays should be able to enter into civil unions.\n * A majority believe homosexuality is an \"acceptable alternative lifestyle\".\n \n You only have ONE ISSUE where you have more people against gay equality than for it. Gay marriage.\n That's it...\n \n Furthermore, I hate to be the one to break it to you but you are LOSING THAT BATTLE.\n Sure. The anti-gay marriage crusade has racked up a LOT of points on the scoreboard. They have a LOT of states who have passed legislation and amendments.\n But overall, the ball is progressing down the OTHER side of the field, against your cause...\n \n See, the issue of gay marriage has a HUGE generational gap on it.\n Splitting up people into age groups, the age group with the most opposition to gay marriage is the OLDEST age group.\n The age group with the most support for gay marriage is the younger voters.\n In fact, younger voters have a MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR gay marriage.\n CNN poll: Generations disagree on same-sex marriage - CNN.com\n \n So in 40 years, the biggest opposition to gay marriage will be dead, replaced by a group that has majority support FOR gay marriage.\n It's only a matter of time.\n \n \n \nIt'll probably with us for a long time yet to come, but natural? I don't think so. I'm open to logic, so please, explain you're logic.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n No. You're not.\n Evidenced both in the fact that you can't understand the concept of \"gay virgins\" and also by the fact that I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU REPEATEDLY, and you refused to address it.\n \n Quit pretending that you want an explanation and address the one you've already been given.\n \n \n \nI'm not too sure what you mean by natural law. I had to look it up, but I'm still not too clear on it. But it doesn't seem to prove that gay sex is natural.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n If you comprehended what I was saying, it would be obvious that is the case.\n \n Any time I have seen somebody argue about the \"purpose of semen\", it is invariably a \"natural law\" proponent. The specific approach you bring actually originates in Catholicism.\n Natural law - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nIf I adhere to natural law, does that change the rules?\n\n No.\n It's just accurately assessing the nature of your argument.\n And the logical fallacies of such arguments are already well known. It's one of the reasons this philosophy exists primarily WITH Catholics, cause most people don't see it as a rational way to approach life.\n And at the very least, people do NOT apply it unilaterally.\n Much like how whites used \"can you read?\" to exclude only blacks from voting and never whitse, the \"natural law\" is often applied hypocritically.\n \n \n \nI use logic, and if logic is the same as natural law, then yes, I guess I adhere to it.\n\n No. You don't use logic.\n And logic is not the same as natural law.\n Natural law starts with observations on the \"nature\" of things (i.e. its characteristics) with regards to the FUNCTION of those things.\n From there, it applies a dogma that proclaims that the item MUST BE USED according to its function. And that to not do so is \"wrong\".\n And that is the main fallacy with natural law. It leaps from observations of \"semen is used for...\" to an illogical demand that the semen ONLY be used for ..., and if it isn't used for that purpose then a \"wrong\" has occurred.\n \n Take for example water. It's used for a variety of things.\n But can we really say that a \"natural\" use of the water is for water balloons? It would easily be viewed as wrong and \"unnatural\".\n But does that make using water in water balloons as \"wrong\"???\n A logical man would observe \"no\".\n \n \n \nWhy not? If something is natural, that means there's a purpose. \n\n No. It does not mean that.\n \n I have given the definition of \"natural\".\n You have ignored it.\n \n I would challenge you to show HOW \"natural\" in any way means there has to be a purpose, AND that not utilizing the purpose makes something \"unnatural\", but you've already demonstrated you are more intent on ignoring what I say.\n \n \n \nI don't really condemn it per se.\n\n Talk about splitting semantical hairs... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nGays have always been around (but is still unnatural) and will probably be with us for a long time to come. All I'm doing is stating that it is unnatural.\n\n Please be more honest.\n You are not JUST stating \"it is unnatural\".\n You are using your classification of \"unnatural\" as a reason for OTHER CONCLUSIONS that are actually nonsensical.\n \n Like earlier, you argue that \"unnatural\" is a reason for denying gay marriage.\n But LOTS of things are unnatural. Like the heterosexual blowjob.\n So does that make a couple that loves having oral sex as \"unnatural\" and undeserved of marriage???\n \n Here's another one for you to ignore.\n Women over 60 are incapable of having kids. A man having sex with a woman over 60 is not going to produce offspring. The sex is equivalent to masturbation in that the sperm is just as \"wasted\".\n \"Unnatural\"...\n By your position, should we outlaw marriages with women over 60???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nWhat I really want to make you understand is that same-sex marriage is not only wrong, but unattainable.\n\n See, this is where you prove you are not logical.\n It HAS BEEN ATTAINED in Massachusetts, Canada, Maine, Iowa, etc, etc, etc...\n \n You keep talking about your OPINION instead of recognizing reality.\n \n \n \nHeterosexuals having sex for pleasure are natural, even if they have no intent to make a baby.\n\n And this is where you show your double-standards. emoticon_rolleyes\n YOU were the one who started talking about the \"purposes of semen\"...\n You CANNOT just use \"purposes of semen\" as an argument against the object of your prejudice, and then IGNORE THE SAME ISSUE when it comes to your favored group.\n \n Again, that is precisely what happened with blacks on voting.\n Whites said blacks couldn't vote cause they couldn't read.\n Then when there were whites who couldn't read, they IGNORED THAT STANDARD just like you are doing for heterosexuals.\n \n Either the \"purpose of semen\" has some importance, or it doesn't.\n Make up your mind...\n \n \n \nBut they can if they want to, and that's what separates the natural, from the unnatural. You cannot impregnate another man.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n A heterosexual couple does the \"blowjob\" thing, recognizing that it will not result in procreation.\n A homosexual couple does the \"blowjob\" thing, recognizing that it will not result in procreation.\n \n When EITHER couple wants to do the \"procreation\" thing, they employ OTHER PRACTICES.\n A heterosexual couple can have vaginal sex, or artificial insemination, or a surrogate mother, or ...\n The homosexual couple can do the same, except for the first item.\n \n The thing you can't seem to grasp is that sex NEVER HAS TO HAVE a procreational component in it. Unless you're Bill Clinton looking for an excuse to say \"I didn't have sex with that woman\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI'll never be able to impregnate anything by masturbating either, but I'm not trying to, am I?\n\n OMG!\n Do you think gay couples are trying to impregnate when they have sex?\n \n News Flash.\n Straight couples AND Gay couples are typically not trying to \"impregnate\" when either group has oral sex, anal sex, or any other type of non-vaginal sex.\n \n \n \nIt's definitely not righteous, but comparing it to gay sex doesn't make gay sex right. \n\n There are subtle ways people say things that give away their mentality.\n Like what you did just there.\n \n If I were to come across an act, call it \"diffles\"...\n And somebody were to talk to me about the \"morality\" of diffles...\n I would NOT be challenging them to explain what \"makes diffles right\".\n \n What you just did was show how your mind was already made up.\n You haven't shown a REAL reason why gay sex is \"wrong\" in the first place.\n Not one that appreciates reality (like your \"gay marriage is unattainable\" nonsense) or one that is UNIFORMLY APPLIED.\n You have assumed what you want to assume.\n \n \n \nMasturbation may relieve stress, and prevent prostate cancer risk, but so does straight sex.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n And so does gay sex...\n \n \n \nWell well, will wonders never cease. I finally got you to admit that there are no gays who simply never have sex out of choice. Especially since everybody, gay or straight was a virgin once! Bravo.\n\n You really don't read all my post, do you.\n I already explained how SOME people maintain \"virgin\" for life. Gay or straight.\n Some gays go into the church-hood in order to try to get god to remove their \"homosexual attractions\" from them.\n They remain attracted to the same gender (thus still gay) but just abstain from sexual conduct.\n \n You really need to figure out that the word \"often\" is not the same as the word \"always\"...\n \n \n \nI have no stats, but it sounds like you believe that there is nothing to worry about. If I can't come up with stats, does that make it clean? \n\n ROFLMAO!\n Dude. I am a GAY MAN who knows a variety of other GAY MEN.\n I have NEVER, in my life, come across a gay person who has got a disease from JUST anal sex.\n STDs which are transmitted from gay OR straight sex? Yeah. Those exist.\n \n But YOU have taken it upon yourself to BELIEVE that there is some sort of biological problem with gays and anal sex, JUST cause it's dirty and you ASSUME that it must result in something biologically problematic.\n \n And here you are. Thinking that you're right even though you have NO EVIDENCE of what you're talking about... emoticon_rolleyes",

I think it's more about protecting a sacred and well-established institution from being on the road of whatever-goes.\n\n \n This assumes that the institution of marriage has been static, which it has not. Marriage has been a changing institution. It has also not been the same in all cultures. \n \n I would say that the biggest change in marriage over the past century has been the decreasing relevance of different gender roles and the growing equality between spouses. The acceptance of and legalization of same-sex marriage is largely a result of this change, I think. If marriage is no longer characterized by distinct and unequal gender roles, then gender difference is no longer central to marriage except in biological reproduction. Opposite-sex marriages no longer necessarily reflect distinct gender roles. And so having spouses of the same sex really doesn't change anything, since the truly significant change toward equality and similarity in roles of spouses has already occurred.\n \n I have long observed that the people who most strongly oppose same-sex marriage tend to be people who adhere to a belief in different roles for men and women in families and in the society. They tend to harbor what we might call old fashioned views of gender. But the change they oppose has already occurred to a great degree. Marriage is no longer necessarily characterized by spouses assuming different gender roles.",

   "I am a very busy man, with a family, a job, and an education to pursue. I refuse to waste my time... \n\n \n Then why are you wasting your precious time posting here? All you are doing is repeating tired old stereotypes that others here have heard many times. Anyone can repeat stereotypes and insist that their beliefs about other people are true, whether they know anything about those other people or not. \n \n You can turn your experiences here into something valuable if you would listen to what other people are saying. You have an educational opportunity right here. You can learn from real gay people what our lives are like. Discard the stereotypes and actually listen. That's what education requires. You have to be willing to set aside your preconceived notions and listen to other people. You may find that your preconceived notions are wrong, or partly wrong. \n \n I recommend also that you stop focusing on sex and think instead about gay people. When you hear gay people speaking, don't imagine them having sex. Think of gay people as whole persons, which we are. This is not a forum about sex. It's a forum about equal rights, and this thread is specifically about marriage. Remember that gay people, like heterosexuals, can have sex without getting married. We don't need to get married to have sex. We choose to get married to form families, to commit to and to protect our spouses and our children. That is true of opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. \n \n Remember too that roughly half the gay people are women. You seem to get hung up on your preconceived ideas about gay males having sex. But males are only half the population. I always get irritated when people act like women don't exist, or like we don't matter. \n \n Having sex is a small part of a human life. Marriage is a big part of a human life. We are talking here about marriage, not about sex. If you don't like the idea of marrying a man, then don't marry a man. No one is forcing you to marry someone you don't want to marry. My argument to you is that you should not try to prevent others from marrying the spouse that they love.",

She asked leading psychology experts to conduct tests on the group in areas they were experienced in to determine the mentally ill members in the group.\n They couldn't identify them.\n \n People ASSUMED gays were mentally ill, but in actually HAVING A REASON WHY they thought that, it just plain didn't exist.\n\n \n I also patiently explained one of those studies.

You have refused to answer that challenge, yet you continually claim it is \"detrimental\".\n You have already explained that you understand STDs are not inherent to \"gay\" and exist also in \"straight\". So obviously that is irrelevant.\n What disease do you think is CAUSED by gay sex?\n \n \n [quote=RamFel]No, you mean repeating the truth ad nauseum. Pay attention. \n When I said \"It's also dirty because the anus is dirty, and it was not meant for sex, and it can make you sick if you're not careful.\"\n You said: \"AGAIN with the claims that you cannot substantiate! \"\n Then the anus must be clean, right?

Disregarding the ACTUAL DEFINITION of \"unnatural\" to rely on \"natural law\" ideology.\n (A bit like declaring something \"green\" not because of its color, but because it is \"environmentally friendly\".)\n \n \n \nSigh.\n\n Yeah.

Because everyone knows marriage in the Bible is \"traditional\". emoticon_xgood\n \n In any case for the most part in modern times it comes down to financial reasons and children.\n \n There are several issues polygamists would need to clear up, including divorce (when one person divorces, how much do they get?

(Love to see THAT joint tax return!)\n \n Also, are ALL the individuals in a polygamous relationship equally married to each other? In the traditional polygamous marriage, it's typically one man married to several women. But if the man decides to opt out and divorce himself from the relationship, are his ex-wives married to each other?\n \n The logistics of polygamy are, in my view, so prohibitively overwhelming (as compared the simple equivalency of same-sex to other-sex pairings) as to render the possibility of it ever becoming legal next to nil.\n\n \n Even if it is logistically complex, once you open Pandora's Box and redefine marriage away from its traditional definition, what's to stop further redefinition by any fringe group that has enough money to hire a mouthpiece?",

Marriage has always been a changing institution, more for good than for ill, I think, though others will probably disagree with me about this. There is also no single \"traditional definition\" of marriage. Indeed, if you look at marriage worldwide, polygamy is probably more \"traditional,\" in many societies than is monogamy. Marriage is neither one single thing worldwide, nor has it been static. \n \n That said, marriage is not the slippery slope that some people argue it is. One change in a marriage law does not lead automatically or easily to other changes in marriage laws. People need to discuss in depth proposed changes to marriage laws. That's why the question of legalizing same-sex marriage should be discussed thoughtfully and carefully on its own merits, apart from the question of legalizing first cousin marriage or the question of legalizing polygamy. Those are different issues, and they need to be considered on their own terms.",

That gay sex is unnatural because it doesn't accomplish what nature intended (your excuses for bad behavior not withstanding).\n\n As I have stated repeatedly, that is NOT the definition of \"natural\" by the dictionary.\n It's the definition of \"natural\" as employed by the \"natural law\" philosophy, which leads me to think that you are an adherent and you just don't want to admit it. Presumably cause it's a specifically Catholic taught philosophy (your application) and you're trying to avoid admitting religious involvement in your arguments.\n \n Regardless, \"doesn't accomplish what nature intended\" is a meaningless standard, for the reasons I have already pointed out and you refused to address.\n Furthermore, you are being arrogant in presuming \"what nature intended\".

Instead, you are here to tell others what you believe, and stubbornly refuse to change it even when you are completely and obviously wrong.\n \n \n \nYou were the one with the \"I know better\" attitude, proposing to \"teach me\" by assigning \"reading material\".

What's the difference?\n\n I have dictated no terms.\n Accepting links as proof is something I have NEVER seen somebody balk at so severely as you do.\n You're like a kid whining that somebody else won't play the way you want them to, and then accusing the other person of the same.\n \n The difference is simple.\n I have dictated no terms.\n You can either take it or leave it.\n But make no mistake, when you \"leave it\", it is YOUR CHOICE to ignore what is given to you (and I have honestly NEVER seen anybody do that before).\n In your situation, you want to FORCE me to not provide links. Which is ultimately pretty stupid considering you're asking for the position of scientists, so WHY NOT PROVIDE PROOF (links!) of those positions.\n \n \n \n Besides I don't think it's a real rule. I do dictate, and those are my terms. \n\n So you admit to dictating terms. ROFLMAO!\n \n And what's this \"I don't think it's a real rule\" junk?\n I HAVE CREATED NO RULE.\n You are the one trying to create a rule here.\n I am simply recognizing that when people post links as proof in the past, OTHER PEOPLE ACCEPT IT.\n \n \n \nYeah, I'm sure you're really amused. We could have wasted even less time than I have \"wasted\" if you had not insisted on my reading through your links, which would have wasted more time while I read, digested, then responded. \n\n Dude. YOU ARE THE ONE COMPLAINING about spending time!\n Quite frankly, I am not the one complaining about spending time on this.\n \n Furthermore, you are very wrong in your latest claim.\n If you had gone and read those links, you would have spent LESS time than you are wasting right now complaining about how much you don't want to look at links.\n There really isn't that much verbage in those links.\n In fact, I have TYPED MORE WORDS after posting those links than is contained in those links.\n I wouldn't be surprised if YOU have typed more words after me posting those links, than is contained in those links.\n \n \n \nSo I think that if you intend to write another post without answering the questions, then you might as well not post anything at all. Because any answer you give that doesn't answer my questions is no answer at all.\n\n I have already answered your questions.\n You refuse to respond.\n \n More and more, your responses do nothing to further the conversation and just are about you whining and repeating that you believe what you want.

She asked leading psychology experts to conduct tests on the group in areas they were experienced in to determine the mentally ill members in the group.\n They couldn't identify them.\n \n People ASSUMED gays were mentally ill, but in actually HAVING A REASON WHY they thought that, it just plain didn't exist.\n\n \n I also patiently explained one of those studies. One of the first studies.\n Dr. Evelyn Hooker's.\n You obfuscated the issue, and then DROPPED the issue.\n When you don't truly acknowledge and address what is given to you, what is the point?\n \n \n \nWhat was the content of their statement?

Did they all speak with one voice? \n\n And answered this as well\n \nIrrelevant.\n It is the vast majority position.\n I know there are some bigots out there who listen to their prejudice instead of the science, but that doesn't mean squat.\n \n If you want to debate the MERITS of the issue, I am all for it.\n If you think the existence of \"NARTH\" somehow disproves the APA position, then you're blowing hot air.\n\n \n \n \nI think you should just answer the questions. \n\n I have.\n The problem here is that you are trying to restrict this conversation pointlessly, like you own the conversation.\n You don't.\n \n \n \nWell since there are no health benefits to gay sex, and in fact it's very detrimental, I'd say science (and logic) do not promote homosexuality.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n What is it with you making claims with absolutely NO PROOF.\n I have already pointed out \"health benefits\" to gay sex. Strengthening the relationship. Stress relief. etc, etc.\n \n I have challenged you to show HOW it is detrimental. You have refused to answer that challenge, yet you continually claim it is \"detrimental\".\n You have already explained that you understand STDs are not inherent to \"gay\" and exist also in \"straight\". So obviously that is irrelevant.\n What disease do you think is CAUSED by gay sex?\n \n \n \nNo, you mean repeating the truth ad nauseum. Pay attention. \n When I said \"It's also dirty because the anus is dirty, and it was not meant for sex, and it can make you sick if you're not careful.\"\n You said: \"AGAIN with the claims that you cannot substantiate! \"\n Then the anus must be clean, right? Can you prove the anus is clean?\n\n ....\n You seem to think \"dirty\" automatically means \"get sick\".\n Mud is dirty.

Now, are you going to answer them, or are you just going to keep complaining? Remember, it's your option to either answer them, or not. \n \n \nYou claim anal sex causes disease (above and beyond STDs) because it is \"dirty\". I challenged you to name ANY such illness.\n\n \n I think I said that it was dirty and can be unhealthy if you're not careful. I don't remember saying that it has definitely caused anything. I mean, you agree that it's dirty, don't you? Being dirty means that it has the potential to cause illness, don't you think? I mean, it's like you wouldn't eat what comes out of it, because it's dirty. Right?\n \n \nI explicitly described the work of Dr. Evelyn Hooker. You ignored that.\n\n \n Actually, I didn't really ignore it. Your posts can get rather lengthy, boring, and too tedious to respond to every single ridiculous thing you say, but since you ask, here is my answer. \n \n Dr. Hooker found (by asking leading psychology experts if gays were mentally ill) and they gave their views, finding that it was not. But I never said that gays were mentally ill. All I said that it was not natural, and that it was wrong. Dr. Hookers findings do not prove that gay sex is right, natural, correct, acceptable, or anything else. \n \n You seem to take what I say out of context. \n \n One of the questions I remember asking whether the APA, AMA, AAA, ASA were in unison with no opposition or opposing views. \n \n Because I believe that you don't go around trying to prove, or at least to satisfy in your own mind, that there is something wrong with gay sex. No. In fact, I think you do just the opposite. You go looking for as much material as you can to prove that there's nothing wrong with gay sex, because you like it, and you don't want anyone to tell you that it's wrong.\n \n I believe that out there somewhere is proof that gay sex is wrong, and during your intensive search for proof that being gay is not natural, you may have come across opposing documentation showing that in fact the opposite is true. You may have tossed that proof aside in favor for documentation that supports your views. \n \n And with that \"proof\", you deem to go around, trying to \"teach\" people who have opposing views. As if you're right and everyone else is wrong. You're just too funny for words. \n \n \nI leave it up to the viewing audience to recognize how absurd you're being.\n\n \n What the audience thinks is of no concern of mine. Please proceed doing just that because the audience will see that you take things I say out of context. Of course, they're mostly on your side, so whether they call you to task is something else all together.",

I don't remember saying that it has definitely caused anything.\n\n You're still cowardly ducking the question.\n HOW CAN IT BE UNHEALTHY \"if you're not careful\"?\n WHAT DISEASE or ILLNESS would result from anal sex???\n \n You're trying to include a qualifier, but still stick to the very claim you have FAILED TO JUSTIFY. \n \n \n \nI mean, you agree that it's dirty, don't you? Being dirty means that it has the potential to cause illness, don't you think?\n\n No.\n JUST being dirty DOES NOT alone create the potential to cause illness.\n I am simply asking you to NAME ANY ILLNESS that claims \"anal sex\" as its responsible agent.\n \n WHY can't you answer it?\n Oh wait. It's because, like everything else, you are assuming things WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANY FACTS.\n Probably the reason why you are so repulsed by links...\n \n \n \nActually, I didn't really ignore it. Your posts can get rather lengthy, boring, and too tedious to respond to every single ridiculous thing you say\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You lie and claim you didn't \"really\" ignore it.\n And then you turn around and proclaim AN EXCUSE for why you didn't answer it...\n That's funny.\n \n It's like telling your Mom that you didn't eat the cookie, and then saying that it was because you were hungry...\n \n \n \nDr. Hooker found (by asking leading psychology experts if gays were mentally ill) and they gave their views, finding that it was not. But I never said that gays were mentally ill. All I said that it was not natural, and that it was wrong. Dr. Hookers findings do not prove that gay sex is right, natural, correct, acceptable, or anything else.\n\n It's funny to watch you completely forget WHY these issues came up in the first place.\n You made claims about the opinions of scientists and medical practitioners, SUPPORTING YOUR POSITION.\n I turned around and pointed out that they DO NOT support your position.\n \n Is any of this striking any bell in your brain?\n \n \n \nOne of the questions I remember asking whether the APA, AMA, AAA, ASA were in unison with no opposition or opposing views. \n\n Gee.\n Didn't I just quote my response to that question, FOR THE THIRD TIME???\n \n \n \nBecause I believe that you don't go around trying to prove, or at least to satisfy in your own mind, that there is something wrong with gay sex. No. In fact, I think you do just the opposite.\n\n I believe that you go around trying to prove, or at least satisfy in your own mind, that there is something wrong with gay sex.\n You have your CONCLUSION that you have already reached, and then you take whatever absurd approach you can dream up to claim justification for your prejudice.\n \n Me personally? I look at gay sex and see no intelligent reason for condemnation.\n It's two consenting adults. Nobody else is harmed.\n What reason is there to condemn it?\n \n You turn around and present all sorts of idiotic arguments like \"the purpose of sperm is not satisfied\", while you ignore the fact that nocturnal emissions, masturbation, and oral sex would also be \"unnatural\" and wrong by that analysis.\n AND THE FAULTY MEASURE of your approach is seen in the hypocrisy of your approach.\n You apply that standard SOLELY to gay sex, and NEVER to masturbation, oral sex, nocturnal emissions, or the other examples named.\n \n \n \nI believe that out there somewhere is proof that gay sex is wrong, and during your intensive search for proof that being gay is not natural, you may have come across opposing documentation showing that in fact the opposite is true.\n\n I have come across a variety of attempted arguments.\n Religious arguments for one, believing in a \"good\" God that damns people to hell for disbelief.\n \"Natural Law\" arguments, for another. But I have been showing you the fault in those approaches.\n \n Again, what you fail to recognize is the absurdity of your approach.\n You want to insist that people prove to you why gay sex is not wrong.\n You fail to recognize THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH.\n \n People who think something is wrong SHOULD PRESENT A REASON WHY that thing is wrong. That's the intelligent means.\n Otherwise, I have to ask you for what reason would anybody think masturbation is not wrong???\n \n \n \nYou may have tossed that proof aside in favor for documentation that supports your views. \n\n No.\n I address it when I see it.\n Just like I am addressing you.\n \n \n \nAnd with that \"proof\", you deem to go around, trying to \"teach\" people who have opposing views. As if you're right and everyone else is wrong. You're just too funny for words.\n\n The really funny thing here is that YOU ASKED ME QUESTIONS out of your ignorance on the issues, and I ANSWER your questions...\n ... AND THEN YOU COMPLAIN about me answernig your questions.\n You seriously don't recognize who is \"too funny for words\".\n You seriously don't recognize that you are rather alone in laughing at me, but there have been MULTIPLE posters pointing out your fallacies...",

If you answer just one question, just answer that one.\n\n \n Taking things I say out of context seems to be a bad habit with you. Let me explain.\n \n If you seek to show the \"viewing audience to recognize how absurd\" I'm being, and they're hostile towards me, I don't care. I can take the slings and arrows.\n \n I post to counter the \"gay sex is natural\" misinformation campaign that you seem to be on. You've yet to post convincing proof that this is the case.\n \n I post to offer an opposing view, much to your dismay. And in the event that I can convince a reader to take my point of view, then I care very much. What I don't care about is what someone wants to criticize me because of my views. When that someone thinks they're more enlightened than I am and takes it upon himself to \"teach\" the ignorant louts of this world the facts of life, when in fact they're more full of opinion and misinformation than they are facts. \n \n Your statement sometime back about the purpose of gay sex being to bring a couple closer together (or words to that effect) was the lamest thing I have ever heard. The truth is that the purpose of sex is for procreation, and only procreation. \n \n If gay sex were natural, then men having sex with other men would produce babies. Men would then have larger breasts that produce milk to feed those babies. Women would not be needed. They wouldn't exist and every child born in this bizarre world would be a boy. Would you call them men? Why call them anything at all? That would distinguish them from an opposite sex, and that opposite sex would not exist any more. They would have no sexual identity. \n \n What about gay women. They have girl-on-girl sex and also produce no children either. If gay sex were natural, then all babies born to women would be girls. You, my friend, wouldn't exist. Because only girls exist. And even if you did exist, it would be as a female, and you wouldn't have any males around to have sex with. You wouldn't even know what a penis was, or what one would look like. The concept of penetration would not even exist.\n \n The whole point I'm trying to make here is that the whole thing just doesn't make any sense. And if it doesn't make any sense then it's not true. \n \n So please. Don't try to prove that gay sex is natural because the ghost of logic will always be around to haunt you, and I will be right here to help to resurrect it. No scientist, professor, or doctor can prove otherwise. All they can say is that it isn't a mental illness, that they find nothing wrong with it, but not that it's natural. That's like trying to say something nice about a buddy's new girlfriend by saying that she's not ugly. It's not exactly saying she's beautiful.

   " ... or straight anal sex (which actually has more participants than gay anal sex)\nThat's quite true, though not many people realize it.\n [*]In the a comprehensive nationwide sex survey taken in this country it the early 90s (the results are available in the book Amazon.com: Sex in America: Edward Laumann, Robert T Michael, Gina Kolata: Books (you can pick up a used copy from Amazon for under three bucks; I recommend it), approx. 20% of heterosexual females admitted to having anal sex.\n [*]Since it takes two to tango, we can assume that their heterosexual male partners must also have been participants. Meaning that approx. 20% of them also participated in this \"straight anal sex.\" \n [*]Therefore approx. 20% of the entire heterosexual U.S. populace has engaged in, and most are continuing to engage in, anal sex.\n With that established, let's look at the gay segment:\n [*]Let's take a conservative approach, and assume that only 5% of the US population is gay. (If you want to assume a lower number, as most anti-gay groups do, go right ahead and substitute it for mine in the following calculations. It won't help you this time, trust me.)\n [*]Virtually no gay women practice anal sex -- at least not with a penis. So that's a little less than half the gay group we can cross off right there, leaving gay men at around 3%.\n [*]Believe it or not, not all gay men engage in anal sex. But I'll give you a break and assume they ALL do.Now, which percentage of the population engaging in anal sex is the larger? The 20% or the 3%?\n \n It seems to me that if someone is on a crusade to stamp out anal sex and deny marriage rights to those who do, they're wagging their self-righteous finger at the wrong group.\n \n For more information, see: http://sexuality.about.com/od/sexinformation/a/anal_sex_stats.htm",

   "If the \"wasting of semen\" is condemnable for gay sex, then it is JUST AS CONDEMNABLE for oral sex, condoms, and masturbation. ... If \"gay sex\" is bad behavior because of \"waste of semen\", then it's bad behavior for the other issues as well.\n\n \n You don't listen very well. I never said that others don't waste semen. All I'm trying to say is that gay sex is not natural. Straight anal sex, blow jobs, masturbation, they all waste semen. I KNOW THIS. But it's no reason to make excuses for gay sex. And it's a free country so do your thing.\n \n All I want from you is for you to ADMIT that gay sex is unnatural. And that being the case, that same sex marriages should NEVER happen. JUST ADMIT THOSE TWO THINGS FOR ME.\n \n \nI PROVIDED THE DEFINITION of natural, which shows I DID prove homosexuality was natural by showing \"it exists in nature\".\n\n \n That's the lamest definition of natural I've ever heard. \n \n Sometimes I think you know that it's not natural,, and you're searching deep within that shallow brain of yours and the dimmest spark of an idea slowly forms within that gray matter, and you think to yourself...\"duh, I'll jus keep tellin' folks that its natural 'cause it exists in nature, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh\"\n \n And again, I'm going to tear it apart with common sense. Gay sex is not natural because it doesn't produce children. The purpose of sex is procreation. That's a straight up fact. You can't dance around that fact with lame reasons why you \"think\" it's natural. And you want to \"teach\" me...ha ha ha! You don't even know what you're talking about! You have a lot of nerve thinking you're more well versed in this topic, and you propose to \"teach\", and YOU HAVE NO CLUE what you're talking about...Man, you're pretty pathetic.\n \n \nI was challenging you to SHOW ANY DISEASE that is actually spread by gay anal sex. And we already established we weren't talking \"STD\", but rather a disease SPREAD BY GAY ANAL SEX that resulted in being spread because *it's dirty*, as you argue....\n\n \n You mean I didn't answer that? \n \n Oh, well, let me get right on that. I cannot show any disease that is actually spread by gay anal sex. I thought I said something similar to that, but oh well, it's OK because now I can lead up to something else. IT'S DIRTY, AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DISEASE. If you're so confident in it's safety, why don't you take a spoonful of s**t and eat it. Let me know how that comes out. \n \n You have to get it through you thick skull, try to clear away the cobwebs, quit smoking that whacky weed and THINK. IT'S DIRTY.",

   "You don't listen very well. I never said that others don't waste semen. All I'm trying to say is that gay sex is not natural.\n\n I listen just fine.\n You use one set of standards to declare gay sex as \"not natural\".\n THE EXACT SAME STANDARDS declare heterosexual oral sex, masturbation, and straight anal sex AS ALSO NOT NATURAL.\n They should ALSO be condemned, if your standards of \"not natural\" are any real reason to condemn anything.\n \n \n \nStraight anal sex, blow jobs, masturbation, they all waste semen. I KNOW THIS. But it's no reason to make excuses for gay sex.\n\n You fail to recognize what's really going on.\n When racists tried to say that blacks couldn't vote because they were illiterate, they pretended the issue was \"illiteracy\".\n But it was their DOUBLE STANDARD towards whites, in NEVER applying the same restriction to whites which proved their standard invalid.\n \n Likewise, when you apply your \"unnatural\" test towards gays, but NEVER CONDEMN STRAIGHTS for the \"unnatural\", you are demonstrating hypocrisy.\n You are proving the false nature of your own standards.\n \n \n \nAll I want from you is for you to ADMIT that gay sex is unnatural. And that being the case, that same sex marriages should NEVER happen. JUST ADMIT THOSE TWO THINGS FOR ME.\n\n Nope.\n First of all, your definition of \"unnatural\" is made up.\n Mine comes from the dictionary.\n I am not going to ignore reality and pretend that your made-up definition means \"natural\".\n \n Second of all, marriage HAS NOTHING TO DO with the issue of \"natural\".\n Marriage is a right, and as such it is governed by constitutional requirements.\n There is no logic or demonstrated reason why \"unnatural\" must mean \"this marriage cannot exist\".\n \n Furthermore, your insistence that gay marriage does NOT exist is just plain laughable!\n \n \n \nThat's the lamest definition of natural I've ever heard. \n\n It's a real one.\n From a dictionary.\n Whereas yours is pulled from your rectum.\n \n \"electrical\" =< relating to or concerned with electricity\n \"fictional\" =< related to a work of fiction\n \"directional\" =< of, relating to, or indicating direction in space\n You seeing a pattern here? Involving root words and -al words???\n \n \n \nSometimes I think you know that it's not natural...\n\n Look. Dude.\n You've had SEVERAL people, not just me, try to explain to you the meaning of the word \"natural\".\n I am using THE DICTIONARY.\n \n Quite frankly, I find it hilarious that you can ignore reality to make-up your own definitions and insist that gay marriage does not exist.\n emoticon_xdonno\n I mean, that right there just SCREAMS out how delusional you are being.\n \n \n \nAnd again, I'm going to tear it apart with common sense. Gay sex is not natural because it doesn't produce children.\n\n Your arguments are an epitome of Einstein's statement:\n \"Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.\"\n \n Being able to produce children IS NOT a rational distinguisher for what makes something \"natural\".\n Sex with a woman past menopause can never produce children.\n So in your book, that makes it \"unnatural\"???\n emoticon_xdonno\n Preposterous!\n \n \n \nThe purpose of sex is procreation. That's a straight up fact.\n\n A purpose of sex can be procreation.\n It is NOT the only one.\n \n When two people have sex with condoms, would you tell them that their sex has no purpose?\n Let's say they are man and wife...\n Does their sex have no purpose???\n \n You keep repeating yourself but failing to address my demonstration of your laughable arguments... emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nYou can't dance around that fact with lame reasons why you \"think\" it's natural. And you want to \"teach\" me...ha ha ha! You don't even know what you're talking about! You have a lot of nerve thinking you're more well versed in this topic, and you propose to \"teach\", and YOU HAVE NO CLUE what you're talking about...Man, you're pretty pathetic.\n\n You repeatedly fail to address my arguments, but you try to beat your chest like you're winning something.\n Ultimately, your arguments are unique, and that's not a good thing...\n \n \n \nYou mean I didn't answer that? \n\n No. You didn't.\n When I talk about ACTUALLY SPREAD BY anal sex, I am NOT talking about something that \"could be spread by\" anal sex.\n Can you tell the difference?\n In my request, I am asking you to DOCUMENT EVIDENCE IT HAS HAPPENED.\n \n \n \nOh, well, let me get right on that. I cannot show any disease that is actually spread by gay anal sex. I thought I said something similar to that, but oh well, it's OK because now I can lead up to something else. IT'S DIRTY, AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DISEASE.\n\n And therein lies the problem.\n It's endemic in the way you refuse to think.\n You claim \"it has the potential to cause disease\", but your illogical mind fails to ask a simple question...\n \"Okay. HAS IT EVER caused a disease???\"\n \n It's such a simple next question, but you're already convinced in your head that you refuse to address the obvious next question.\n \n \n \nIf you're so confident in it's safety, why don't you take a spoonful of s**t and eat it. Let me know how that comes out.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Dude. I don't know what the heck you think you're talking about.\n I almost feel I have to draw you a map for this asinine comment you just made.\n So when one guy puts his front part in another guy's back part, that involves \"take a spoonful of s**t and eat it\" ???\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Just out of curiousity, have you covered sex ed in your junior high school?\n Or do you go to one of those Catholic schools that just says \"don't do it\", and that's why you're woefully undereducated...\n \n I've said it before.\n I'll say it again.\n I am a gay man who has had my share of \"anal sex\" in my day.\n I have a variety of gay friends who can say the same.\n We HAVE NEVER heard of anybody getting sick from the act of \"anal sex\" (that doesn't involve an STD).\n \n You are just full of an incapability to actually think and reason...",

A blank sheet of paper. A visitor from another world,... etc. In fact I have trained myself to approach complex issues with just that mindset. (One of the ways I do this is by playing role reversal.)\n \n Long story short,.... however it could be accomplished,...
