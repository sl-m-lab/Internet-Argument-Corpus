   "From: http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&x_outlet=35&x_article=852\n \n The New York Times Buries al Dura Story\n \n The New York Times buried on page 6 of the Business section (Section C) an important story (February 7, 2005) on the escalating scandal surrounding the facts of the infamous Muhammad al Dura episode. The case involved the alleged Israeli killing of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy and the severe wounding of his father at Gaza's Netzarim Junction in September 2000. \n \n Then the Times buried in paragraph 26 the key finding of the article itself which is that two prominent French journalists reviewed footage of the event shot by France 2 televison and found there is no \"definitive scene showing that the boy had died.\"\n \n Additionally, the same journalists, Denis Jeambar and Daniel Leconte, refuted a central claim of the France 2 correspondent Charles Enderlin who reported the al Dura story. His longstanding defense regarding the scant, apparently truncated footage of the alleged killing had been that to show further images of the shooting and thus \"the agony of the child\" - was too \"unbearable.\" \n \n Jeambar and Leconte stated categorically that such images of the \"agony\" do not exist. That is, there are no scenes of a bloody and dying child and injured father in the 27 minutes of tape they reviewed of the scene despite Enderlin's repeated claims to the contrary.\n \n Unmentioned at all in the Times story is the pair's statement in their article in the January 25 edition of Le Figaro that the 27 minutes, including footage taken just prior to the alleged shooting of al Dura, shows scenes in which the \"Palestinians seem to be organizing a staged event. They 'play' at war with the Israelis and simulate, in most of the cases, imaginary injuries.\"\n \n Jeambar and Leconte do not say the al Dura event was staged, nor do they say it was not. \n \n The Times has done a service to bring the story to its readers, given the gravity of the consequences wrought by France 2's worldwide distribution of what became an iconic image of supposed Israeli brutality. Additionally, the story included photos that did give some prominence to the story for those who found it. But why the Business Section instead of the News pages and why not a story that presents prominently and completely all the latest information that triggered the report in the first place?",

Aside from the FUNCTION the media serves, what IS it?\n \n It's essentially broadcasting companies. Huge, billion-dollar corporations, run by wealthy, hardcore business people. What is their job? To increase shareholder value.\n \n Now, given this reality, ask two questions:\n \n #1 On average, are powerful business executives on average more liberal/democratic, or conservative/republican in this period of time? A:Conservative/republican. George Bush calls it his \"base\", I think this is common knowledge.\n \n #2 Would an entire sector of businesses, it's executitves, board, and anyone with business-sense employed there, really want to oppose tax cuts for the wealthy (they are wealthy), tax cuts for businesses (they run businesses), fewer legal restrictions on businesses (ah, this costs them money), tort reform (pro-business)??? Of course not. They would support all of these, in our time period, conservative/republican supported agenda items.\n Not surprising democrats are usually for pro-consumer legal reform, pro-worker rights, pro-business tax (to pay for welfare, education, etc.), the exact opposite of pro-business, we all know.\n \n ===================\n \n So, do you REALLY think anyone claiming the media is liberal-biased is correct, when they do so often for blatant political reasons, and worse still, they say it because they HEARD some other republican's rhetoric and never verified it?

   "\n I don't think that you are arguing that media personnel are simply (and maybe unwittingly ?) mouthpieces for their capitalistic employers and with no editorial freedom whatever ?\n\n \n But from what little I know, it doesn't work that way. Journalists all have their work edited by editors, the gate-keepers to the public. The more high-profile the media coverage, the more prominent the editor. The editors are the only rungs of the ladder you need to have moderate to conservative, or at the least, \"pro-business\". That's cake.\n \n Further, heavy-handed tactics aren't how good strategists prefer to work. No, they don't gag anyone. They can limit promotions to those who speak out against pro-corporate legislature, they can limit hiring in those areas, they can verbally condemn it, and essentially make an atmosphere of \"don't act liberal or else...\" Fire a couple of the extreme examples and your job is done...people will get in line without even being asked to. Negative reinforcement works wonders. On that note, promoting and accepting the more conservative employees is positive reinforcement...they set the example. Do you work? Don't you know the general left/right orientation of most people you interact with, just through casual discussion? Why would people in charge of promotions not have that, and better information to guide their choices? Worse still, why would a pro-business, business executive (living the american dream), promote a liberal business-basher? Screw them, let them get on welfare and leave the real jobs to people who understand the system...right?\n \n I mean, when I use to have a boss, I knew is likes and dislikes, his political orientation, heck, his personal goals. I made sure to do one of the following:\n Align my goals to his goals (and make it known)\n Hide any of my goals that are contrary to his goals.\n \n This is survival 101. All a good leader has to do is set the example, the rest follows. Now, I don't expect they have any written rules about \"don't be liberal\". I think a few do, and get zinged, and the rest learn quickly. That's just a guess, but it's certainly how life seems to work.\n \n \n Corporations are for the most part, kingdoms under the rule of the lords and nobles. It has to work that way. Now, the real difficulty is doing this same thing in PUBLIC view, in a DEMOCRATIC process...like the government. But the republicans (federalist society) are showing us that where there is a will, there is a way. They have the majority, a nice majority, through dilligence and hard work, and they aren't stopping at two branches. They are aiming for the judicial. Having created vacancies by blocking Clinton nominations, they now are pushing to fill those vacancies (they call it a \"crisis\", they fail to mention they created it) with moderate to conservative judges. The kinds of reform that can bring will be long lasting...decades.\n \n Their goal is to achieve, to be winners, to do their best. Nothing more really, it's the American way, it's what captialism promotes, and democracy allows. It's not \"bad\" to label business as pro-business, nor to say they favor people with their views. It's natural, and smart. Pro-business isn't a negative, in fact, I prefer it. I also prefer social liberalism, but fiscally I'm bought and sold on buying and selling...\n \n -Mach",

Even my cynicism would give some benefit of the doubt here.\n \n While it would be stupid to deny that employees in general dissemble in order to keep their jobs, there is a certain flexibility (a jester's license perhaps ?) in the case of working for a newspaper, that allows for some departure from the points of view that would keep the proprietor content. If it were not so, your daily paper might need to change its name to Pravda.\n \n If you agree that such flexibility exists, then it will be and is exploited to the advantage of certain agendas.

You make no allowance for any \"idealism\" - that mission to inform the public - which is supposed to be an article of faith among editors and reporters.\n \n\n \n My take is throughly utilitarian, yes. Science is the pursuit of just that ideal, truth...correctly observing and interperting reality.\n \n I think all doctors should strive for giving people what treatment they need, not making a buck...but they don't.\n I think all laywers should faithfully interepert and follow the spirit of the law. They don't.\n I think all preists should quit, but at the least, not molest little boys...but they don't.\n \n Just because we have ideals, doesn't mean we should allow them to cloud our observation of reality, that would be criminal. After all, how can we realize those ideals if we aren't being honest about our realizations in the first place? The fact is, the media, on the whole, seems to offer a moderate to conservative bias, primarily due to the way business (and human nature..part of business really), function. Yes, some journalists are comitted to the goal of journalism, to inform the public. But what if the public doesn't want to be informed? What if the public wants Paris Hilton instead? Are they right to keep shoving the truth down our throats? Will we pay for something we don't want? Should the government tell all religious people it's 100% fiction and a lie?\n \n If a journalist was to faithfully pursue informing the public, at the price of doing bad business, it would be analagous to a communist society where the government faithfully pursues equality, by destroying freedom and individuality. An interesting \"ideal\", but doomed because it doesn't respect reality.\n \n It's a hard lesson to learn that essentially, we cannot help those who do not want help. That's what captialism is. You offer, someone buys, by choice, not because you THINK they need it, because they CHOOSE to need it (in the case of most consumer goods). Same with democracy, it's a choice. 50 years from now our government will reflect more of the thoughts and ideals of it's time, different than it is now.\n \n Same with journalism. You and some of them might \"think\" their goal is to inform the public about important things...but the mistake is thinking THEY, or YOU, know what's important. We, the consumer, know, and unless they listen, they may be looking for a new job.\n \n Just look at PBS and NPR, video and radio - \"idealistically faithful\" programming. I love it, sure, I listen to NPR every day and grew up on PBS. But are they booming businesses? Do they control the airwaves? No, rich conservatives who give the majority what the majority wants (and are ultimately the most honest and serve the public the most?), are in control (realitively speaking). That's ultimately why the bias is with the majority. Yes many journalists I'm sure are independant thinkers, but that doesn't make them liberal...just honest.\n \n -Mach",

That's a far cry from 47, but it's twice what you cited. Perhaps we're both wrong. Perhaps ours links haven't been updated lately. Here are the embassies I believe are reopened:\n \n Afghanistan\n Australia\n Bahrain\n Bangladesh\n China\n Czechoslovakia\n Denmark\n Greece\n Malaysia\n Oman\n Philippines\n USA\n Britain\n France\n Romania\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that the Iraqi government employs 1.2 million Iraqi people?\n \n \n \n Did you know that the old government of Iraq employed 4.7 million people? Did you know that Bremer and Co fired over 2 million of them for being part of the Baath party? Did you know that overall unemployment in IRaq is now 70%, as opposed to 6 percent pre war?\nNo I didn't. I doubt it, too.\n \n http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/Iraq/2003/05/21/92558-ap.html\n \n I believe it was more like 1.4 million. You likely are counting the army and the secret police that Saddam and Sons used to keep order and murder people.\n \n \n I've seen articles that quote 50% unemployment (January 05) That's likely expected in a toppled country. It will improve. Where did your 70% figure come from, Uranus?\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Did you know that 3100 schools have been renovated, 364 schools are under rehabilitation, 263 schools are now under construction and 38 new schools have been built in Iraq? \n\n \n \n Did you know that most of the students of those schools aren't going because the security is so bad? Did you also know that Iraq's hospitials are STILL not getting the funding, drugs and equipment \n they need? \n\n \n No I didn't. This site:\n http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/r/rayreynolds.htm\n says that attendance is up.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that Iraq's higher educational structure consists of 20 Universities, 46 Institutes or colleges and 4 research centers? \n\n \n \n did you know that there used to be 23 universities and 9 research centers, but we bombed the others out of existance during the invasion? Did you know that all of the ones that we did not bomb off the planet were looted during the invasion and are still not opened? How is this good news from Iraq anyway? We didn't put in those institutions, they were there before we arrived.\n\n \n I'm not sure who blew up the schools. It's obvious that we didn't build them to start with. It's not obvious, nor have you backed up the claim that we destroyed them. Carpet bombing was not utilized in Iraqi cities. If the Iraqi armies were using schools as shelter, their destruction was justified.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that 25 Iraq students departed for the United States in January 2004 for the re-established Fulbright program? \n\n \n \n Did you know that last month an average of 25 Iraqis under the age of 30 were killed each day?\nIrrelevant to the point. Plus, it is not the US doing the killing. It's terrorists (Iraqi or not) blowing up their own people. This too will pass.\n \n\n \n\n Did you know that the Iraqi Navy is operational? They have 5- 100-foot patrol craft, 34 smaller vessels and a navel infantry regiment. \n\n \n \n Did you know that the Iraqi navy had over 200 vessels when we arrived? Did you know that we blew every single one of them up? Did you know that we have now bought them all new ships, on the US taxpayers dime? Did you know that the Iraqi navy has no weapons, and their people are hardly trained? \n\n Their vessels were legitimate targets during the war. The US dime is well spent on their new navy. I doubt they have NO weapons. They just don't have really powerful weapons. Show me something that says they don't even have handguns and rifles.\n \n\n \n \n\n Did you know that Iraq's Air Force consists of three operation squadrons, 9 reconnaissance and 3 US C-130 transport aircraft which operate day and night, and will soon add 16 UH-1 helicopters and 4 bell jet rangers? \n\n \n \n Did you know they actually don't have those planes ready yet? And that the only place the Iraqi Air Force actually exists yet is on paper? \n\n \n http://www.milavia.net/airforces/iraq/iqaf.htm\n \n You shouldn't expect an instant reopening of the Iraqi Air Force, complete with fighters and bombers.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that Iraq has a counter-terrorist unit and a Commando Battalion?Did you know that the Iraqi Police Service has over 55,000 fully trained and equipped police officers?Did you know that there are 5 Police Academies in Iraq that produce over 3500 new officers each 8 weeks? \n\n \n \n Did you know that we don't have 120,000 trained Iraqi troops ready yet? And that the Pentagon CAN NOT actually vouch for the readiness of any Iraqi battalion?\n \n Did you know that number is meaningless because over half of them either quit or desert once in the field? And that those who remain are sitting ducks due to lack of guns, ammo and body armor?\n \n Did you know that prior to the invasion, Iraq had over 400,000 in its military, and over 250,000 police, none of whom desserted and sold their weapons to the enemy the minute nobody was looking? \n\n \n Again, you didn't address the point being made. This site:\n http://www.washtimes.com/world/20050222-115008-1137r.htm\n says there are 60,000 to 90,000 police. I wouldn't worry too much about lack of an Iraqi Army right now. They don't really need an Army yet. I'm relatively sure though that they will be able to defend their country before we leave.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know there are more than 1100 building projects going on in Iraq? They include 364 schools, 67 public clinics, 15 hospitals, 83 railroad stations, 22 oil facilities, 93 water facilities and 69 electrical facilities. \n\n \n \n did you know that virtually all of these building projects are repairing damage we did on the way in? \n\n Likely, we caused a lot of damage, but not \"virtually all\" of it.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that 96% of Iraqi children under the age of 5 have received the first 2 series of polio vaccinations?Did you know that 4.3 million Iraqi children were enrolled in primary school by mid October? \n\n \n \n Did you know that over 40% of those children are expected to die of waterborne diseases, infection, and malnutrition, as opposed to the 4% who might have dies of polio?\n \n Did you know that less than 1 million have actually showed up for school due to security concerns? \n I believe you school attendance claim has already been addressed.\n http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/iqvaccines.htm\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/02/24/iraq.children.polio.ap/\n http://www.savethechildren.org/emergencies/iraq/index.asp\n http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/print.php?story_id_key=4585\n \n Had Saddam and Sons been worth their salt, these children would already have been vaccinated against known diseases. Likely more than you stated would die without what's happening today.\n \n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that there are 1,192,000 cell phone subscribers in Iraq and phone use has gone up 158%? \n\n \n \n Did you know that this is because regular phone service has been restored to less than 3% of the country? did you know that power in most if Iraq is still only on for 8 hours per day? \n I wonder who controlled the sale of cell phones before Saddam and Sons got ousted? You're partially right about the electric power. Some areas are yet to get any, some get about 6 hours, some 8, and some have it all the time. It's still better than it was before the ousting of Saddam and Sons.\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that Iraq has an independent media that consist of 75 radio stations, 180 newspapers and 10 television stations? \n\n \n \n Did you know that this \"independant media\" is being censored by the government for speaking out against americans, and that 7 of those TV stations and 14 of those newspapers are state run? Did you know that the rest of the TV stations are broadcast over the border from Syria, and were banned in Iraq during Saddams reign because they cater to islamic fundamentalists? Did you know that one of those stations starts every program with a prayer for Bin laden? \n I've heard nothing of this. Can you provide a link or two or should I just take your word for it?\n \n \n\n \n\n Did you know that 2 candidates in the Iraqi presidential election had a recent televised debate recently? \n \n \n \n did you know that nobody got the chance to see it, because the power grid in the television stations viewing area was down that day? \n\n I've not heard that. Do you have a link to a supporting source?\n \n\n \n Or maybe we didn't know because a lot of it is BS, and the stuff that is not, or that might not be (since none of this is verifiable) still does not paint us in a good light since it begs questions (like the employment issue, rebuilding navy, construction projects to repair bomb damage, etc...). I think the bush administration is probably happy with the coverage Iraq is getting from the media. \n Perhaps some of it is BS. Perhaps the percentage of BS in it slightly exceeds the BS percentage of BS in your response. Perhaps not.\n \n If we keep at it here, we'll eventually get to the truth.\n \n \n\n ... Got news for you, jim, just because it comes into your inbox, does not make it true. So far today, I have had 3 different Emails that promise to make me a millionaire, 1 Email that promises to DOUBLE the size of my penis in 30 days or less, and one that says I can get a FREE IPOD.\n \n Would you like me to forward these to you, so you can be a multi-millionaire with a huge schlong and an IPOD? \n You're being presumptuous. Maybe I'm already a multi-millionaire. Maybe I don't have a need for member enhancement. Maybe I already have all the iPODS I need. You just never can tell.\n \n In closing, let me say that the original post I made was relevant to the thread even though it contained some misstatements of fact. Your response was just as (if not more) lacking in verified facts. I'll try to improve. You do the same.",
