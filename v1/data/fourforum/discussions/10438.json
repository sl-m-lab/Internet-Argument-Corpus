   "**\n \n FYI--an article posted by Bertvan at ARN whose author seems to see evolution in much the same light as she and I see it. Please note that all 'bold' emphasis has benn added by me.\n \n \"The False Dilemma between Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design \n \n by Ted Dace \n \n \n \n The Hopeless and the Pointless: What Would Darwin Say?\n On a winter night not long ago in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, 200 people gathered at the junior high gym for a school board meeting. The star attraction, a minister named Curtis Brickley, wowed the audience with his multimedia extravaganza purporting to demonstrate that life on Earth could only have been crafted by an \"intelligent designer.\" According to Jenny Johnson, writing for the Ravalli Republic, Brickley \"questioned the process of natural selection at the molecular level,\" as well as \"amino acids organizing into proteins with significant biological consequences, without the presence of a designer.\"1\n \n Creationism is a protest against the deification of DNA, both as engine of species formation and living template in whose image we are cast. Its dispute isn't so much against particular findings of science as the general idea that \"Darwinism\" is all there is and all we are. The good reverend Brickley doesn't deny that from a natural standpoint the body's exquisitely integrated, multi-level, self-regulating, patterned dynamics rest on nothing more than the proper assemblage of amino acids on the basis of linear sequences of nucleic acids. He merely notes that such a skimpy setup might need a helping hand to flesh it out. \n \n Though the creationism debate is generally framed in stark terms - God versus Darwin, religion versus science, superstition versus reason - the enemy camps are actually drawn from the same underlying philosophy. The dominant school of biology, known as neo-Darwinism, harbors a \"mechanistic\" ideology that weakens the case for evolution and leaves the field clear for the return of God, Master Mechanic, to the science classroom. \n \n In the age of Newton, when the cosmic machine whirred and hummed with God-given efficiency, the apex of mechanical achievement was the miniaturized timepiece, a tribute to the power of human intelligence to impose form and order onto dumb matter, much as divine intelligence would have generated living creatures from water and sand. When theologian William Paley likened the organism to a watch, his intention wasn't so much to diminish the glory of living things but to augment that of the Almighty, now portrayed as not only a loving father but a skilled mechanic laboring to realize pre-envisioned plans. \n \n The chief innovation on this model offered by neo-Darwinism is to ditch the mechanic but keep the mechanism. If the machines crafted by our own terrestrial genius can run on auto-pilot, why not the universe? Even if the stars and galaxies are indeed the handiwork of a deity, once we know the program, we have no use for the programmer. In the logic circuits of the celestial apparatus, divinity doesn't compute. God turns out to be the ghost in his own machine. \n \n Newton's absolutist, deterministic philosophy eventually broke down under the pressures of thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics. The machine turns out to be as spectral as the spirit that haunts it. So it's odd that only when physics itself had definitively punctured the Newtonian dream did biology capitulate at last to the mechanistic philosophy, disputing only the means by which the clockwork organism is conceived and assembled. In place of the intelligent design of creationism, we have the thoughtless design of natural selection. Either way, life is determined by external, universal forces, with organisms themselves playing no role in how they live or how their descendents might be reshaped.\n \n Where biologists wonder how supernatural intelligence could be a scientifically meaningful concept, creationists ask how simple chemistry, even in conjunction with natural selection, could yield the most complex, well-formed, purposive systems in the known universe. Are we seriously to believe that the species of life-in all their splendor, precision and incomparable complexity-ultimately derive from random errors cropping up in the replication of DNA? The Hyacinth macaw can crack a nut with its beak that you or I would need a sledgehammer to open. Is all that colossal strength nothing more than a side-effect of a chance mutation in the macaw's genetic toolkit? How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? \n \n So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle. Now multiply this improbability for all the useful traits belonging to more than fifty million life forms, and you see just how profoundly and irredeemably implausible neo-Darwinism really is. \n \n Preoccupied with the creeping threat of divine intervention into the sciences, the pundits of protein can't see how their own favored theory is equally in thrall to the miraculous. Instead of a heavenly weaver stitching legs onto fish, a genetic hiccup does the trick. Like a toy in a cereal box, every defining trait of every species on Earth comes with a special mutation hidden inside. Genes, you might say, work in mysterious ways. We don't know why the right mutation comes along at the right moment-it just does! \n \n Given the choice between intelligent design and its demented cousin, is it any wonder so many Americans prefer the former? As long as living creatures are seen as devices constructed according to blueprints or specifications of one kind or another-a soul deposited by God or a code written by chance-we will be tempted to revert to the cosmic mechanic, who alone seems able to account for not only the astounding intricacy of organisms but our fundamental sense of life that it lives, that it strives to bloom and then bask in its brilliance. The neo-Darwinian mistake is to latch onto a worldview rooted in Protestant theology and try to hammer it into a naturalistic, evolutionary context. So unconvincing are these organic contraptions that pop out of thin air from nucleic accidents that a theory having literally no scientific meaning seems preferable to it. The result is a deadlock between the hopeless and the pointless.\n \n Is there a way out? Well, as it happens, a certain 19th century amateur naturalist devised a theory of speciation not only rigorously scientific but compelling and believable to boot. Known as \"descent with modification by natural selection,\" its creator was none other than Charles Darwin.\n \n \"Throw up a handful of feathers,\" says the author of The Origin of Species, \"and all fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to that of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on [Native American] ruins!\"2 When it comes to issues such as ecology or behavior, the mathematical abstractions of physics have little to offer. dissenting from T. H. Huxley's concept of animal automatism, Darwin stressed the importance of individual will in shaping our actions.3 He further concluded that delicately balanced arrays of cells, tissues and organs cannot properly function without a \"coordinating power\" that brings \"the parts into harmony with each other.\"4 \n \n Whereas today evolution is commonly regarded as the blind interplay of natural selection and random genetic mutations, Darwin explicitly rejected this view, assigning only a marginal role to the \"spontaneous variations\" arising from \"germ-plasm.\"5 He argued instead that the chief source of variations subject to natural selection is the day-to-day struggle to survive in the face of competition and limited resources. Darwinian evolution is a model of clarity and common sense: organisms adapt to changing conditions and transmit their newly acquired behaviors to their progeny. Those adaptations that prove environmentally successful become ingrained and increasingly pronounced with each passing generation until a new species emerges from the old.\n \n Ordinarily labeled \"Lamarckian,\" after the early evolutionist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, the inheritance of acquired characteristics could just as easily be called \"Darwinian.\" What distinguished the two thinkers was that Lamarck believed God had guided the development of life so as to produce Homo sapiens, while Darwin sought to explain evolution in purely naturalistic terms, appealing neither to the intelligence of a deity not the determinism of physics but the good sense of creatures great and small. \n \n \"I think there can be no doubt,\" he writes in Origin, \"that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications are inherited.\"6 He cites many examples, such as young shepherd dogs that know, without training, to avoid running at sheep,7 domesticated chickens that have no fear of cats or dogs as a result of their ancestors having grown accustomed to house pets,8 and ostriches that can't fly because their predecessors learned to kick predators instead of taking flight.9 He was skeptical that cases such as these - and there are countless more - could all result from a mysterious and random process taking place in the remote depths of the body. \"Everyone knows that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants, long before birth, the epidermis is thicker on the palms and the soles of the feet than on any other part of the body... we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of long-continued use or pressure.\"10 \n \n The meaning of evolution is that species are self-created through the act of living and adapting. While physical forces are obviously important, they no more determine our form than theological forces, merely providing the anatomical and environmental constraints within which species define themselves. Regarding the origin of sea mammals, Darwin proposes, \"A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open ocean.\"11 Due to the variability of their bone structure, the very young can alter their anatomy through newly-acquired behaviors, enabling flat-fish, for example, to push their eye sockets a little higher with each passing generation. \"The tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inheritance.\"12\n \n So crucial is the ability of organisms to inherit traits acquired by their forerunners that without it Darwin's hypothesis simply collapses. \"For if each part [of the body] is liable to individual variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at a corresponding or earlier age - propositions which cannot be disputed - then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.\"13 \n \n But what if he got it wrong? He certainly slipped up with his fanciful notion of \"pangenesis,\" a hypothetical mechanism intended to enable adaptations to pass from one generation to the next. In the 1890s, more than a decade after Darwin's death, Austrian theorist August Weismann correctly concluded that animals, no matter how much they alter their behaviors, cannot affect the \"determinants\" (genes) in their reproductive cells. If genes are the sole vehicle of hereditary information, as Weismann assumed, then living adaptations cannot be inherited, and Darwinian evolution must yield to a more precise, mechanistic alternative. The new theory, neo-Darwinism, took final form in the 1930s with the \"modern synthesis\" of natural selection and genetics.\n \n In his magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, the late Stephen Jay Gould reflected on the fact that no evidence bolsters Weismann's assumption. Though he presented his argument as ironclad, a done deal, Weismann offered nothing to support it other than the fact that he couldn't imagine how hereditary information could be transferred to offspring except by way of genes. \"We accept it, not because we are able to demonstrate the process in detail... but simply because we must, because it is the only possible explanation that we can conceive.\"14 Zoologist and author Richard Dawkins helpfully notes that the inability of creationists to imagine how the species of life could have emerged without divine assistance doesn't mean God really does intervene.15 We might add that the inability of neo-Darwinists, including Dawkins himself, to imagine how an organism could inherit traits acquired through life-struggle doesn't mean they aren't picked up nonetheless. \n \n As cell biologist Stephen Rothman observes, adaptive qualities belong to organisms, not genes. It's the animal that must cope with jungle, desert or ocean, not the genome tucked away in its cozy nuclear compartment.16 Darwinian evolution makes sense because it places the organism, not DNA, at the center of the action. Neo-Darwinism, on the other hand, is reductionistic. As with machines, the best way to understand an organism is to \"reduce\" it - level it, you might say - recasting it in terms of its parts which, in turn, are \"reduced\" to their parts, and so on. Overall functioning requires no explanation because once the exact nature of the parts and their interactions is accounted for, the whole picture automatically falls into place. \n \n According to Rothman, who has forty years of experience in the field, reductionism has severely impaired the ability of researchers to accurately assess their own data. As an example, he offers the vesicle theory of protein transport, a stupendously unwieldy model requiring fifteen to thirty mechanisms to move proteins a few microns. None of the experiments cited in the literature can prove these mechanisms actually exist but only what they would look like if they did. Proponents of the theory have never tested it, never saying, \"If it's true, then such and such should happen.\" No matter how much contradictory evidence accrues, confidence in the theory never wavers. Why? Because it's the only model that can account for the movement of protein according to blind, machine-like operations.17 \n \n At the heart of reductionistic metaphysics is the intuitive notion of contact mechanics, according to which a cause must be both temporally and spatially contiguous to its effect. Darwin was skeptical of this view. Toward the end of The Origin of Species, he takes Leibniz to task for alleging that Newton had introduced \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy\" with his theory of gravity, which seems to endow matter with the property of action at a distance.18 As we've known since Einstein's day, electromagnetism and gravity both allow long-distance action without material mediation. Contemporary biologists resemble 19th century physicists who still believed in a \"luminiferous \u00e6ther\" said to mediate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space.\n \n Of all the post-Einsteinian physicists to take an interest in biology, it was the venerable Walter Elsasser who gave the subject its most comprehensive evaluation. A pioneer of quantum mechanics who later solved the equations for the earth's electromagnetic field, Elsasser declared that the necessity of a material medium for the transmission of organic characteristics in no way follows from any known principles of physics.19 Rather than foreclosing on all other theoretical options in favor of an abstract system that casts genes as a kind of bio-ether, Elsasser suggested a new theory based on our actual experience of being alive. In fact, he remarked, we already have a perfectly plausible, commonsense model for retrieval of the past. It's called memory.\n \n \"No principle,\" averred ether-mad physicist James Croll in 1867, \"will ever be generally received that stands in opposition to the old adage, 'A thing cannot act where it is not,' any more than it would were it to stand in opposition to that other adage, 'A thing can not act before it is or when it is not.'\"20. Having recognized that matter does indeed act \"where it is not,\" Elsasser began to wonder if it could also act \"when it is not.\"\n \n Though typically associated with the brain, memory may be much broader in its impact, enabling the organism as a whole to grow and develop on the basis of similarity to previous organisms, particularly those belonging to the same species.21 In contrast to the \"artificial memory\" found in computers, memory in its natural state is the long-distance influence of the past over the present. According to this model, neural \"memory traces,\" instead of storing information about the past, facilitate our recovery of prior perceptions themselves. What reductionistic biology has overlooked is the possibility that memory is exactly what it seems to be - the retention of the past - and that embryos call up the organic forms appropriate to their kind in exactly the same way grownups recall where they left their keys. \n \n Summing up the conventional view, science writer Matt Ridley asserts, \"Something, somewhere must be imposing a pattern of increasing detail upon the egg as it grows and develops.\"22 Elsasser might have rejoined Ridley with a riddle: where, precisely, is the past? \n \n Elsasser's approach, which he presented in a 1981 paper for the Journal of Theoretical Biology, solves several problems at once. Not only does memory account for the inheritance of living adaptations, it eliminates the need for a blueprint from which the body is mechanically constructed. Instead of following a pre-planned design, whether theological or genetic, the embryo simply mimics the developmental steps of its ancestors. And in contrast to the determinism of both creationist and neo-Darwinian ideology, natural memory enables organisms to play a role in their development and to influence the course of evolution. Between the randomness of molecular events and the necessity of physical law lies a probabilistic gray area in which a creature may choose to follow its species memory or - if environmental conditions have changed sufficiently - to select a new course of action.23 Elsasser's organismic selection is thus the logical counterpart to Darwin's natural selection. \n \n Long-range information transferal among living things was inadvertently put to the test a few years ago by French researcher Miroslav Hill, who was studying the ability of hamster cells to withstand a toxic drug. Hill maintained two lines of cells, only one of which was exposed to the toxin. Of this line, predictably some cells died while others adapted and survived. What surprised Hill was that \"cells exposed to the drug shared information for the adaptive changes with the unexposed cells in physically separated cultures.\" Relatives of exposed cells benefited from the knowledge gained by their siblings, suggesting a common pool of memory embracing them all. After numerous repetitions and variations of the experiment yielded the same results, Hill concluded that the information carried on the backs of genes is complemented by long-distance \"adaptive information.\"24\n \n The widespread phenomenon of parallel evolution, one of biology's foremost anomalies, resists explanation along the lines of neo-Darwinism, which asks us to swallow whole the whopping proposition that the stunning, thoroughgoing resemblance between mammals and marsupials-to take but one example-stems entirely from environmental similarities, as though similar foliage and climate could cause virtually identical wolves, squirrels, moles, and jerboas to emerge independently on separate continents. Far more reasonable is the supposition that adaptive information can travel between somewhat similar species, enabling them to evolve into almost perfect alignment.\n \n While Hill was open-minded enough to follow the evidence even where it conflicted with his own reductionistic predisposition, for most biologists an interpretation out of synch with the model of contact mechanics is unthinkable. So when researchers discovered that plants inheriting mutant DNA from their parents can still demonstrate the wildtype trait belonging to their grandparents, it was assumed that RNA contains a backup copy of the grandparents' gene. The Scientist went so far as to report that RNA inheritance had indeed been established, later apologizing to readers for the error and noting that researchers had established only the existence of non-DNA inheritance. Left unstated was the possibility that not all inheritance is mediated by molecules.25 \n \n Much like multicellular organisms, the science of evolution can be traced back to embryological origins. A Latin term meaning \"to unfold,\" evolution originally indicated a fully preformed man or woman in the fertilized egg who simply unfolds in the course of embryogenesis. By the 19th century, investigators had noticed that at each stage of its development the human embryo resembles progressively more complex animal types, such as worm, fish, amphibian, etc. Though the embryonic \"recapitulation\" of lower species is imprecise and should not be taken too literally, the similarities between stages of embryogenesis and the adult forms of ancestors are nonetheless vivid and undeniable. It was on the basis of embryological data that Darwin identified mammals, birds and reptiles as \"the modified descendents of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its adult state with bronchia, a swimbladder, four fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.\"26 Recapitulation, as historian Robert J. Richards contends, was the pivot on which \"evolution\" turned from a theory of individual preformation to species transformation.27\n \n Darwin saw in embryonic recapitulation proof positive that life is evolutionary. Since natural selection operates on adaptations made by creatures after they've left the womb, it's to be expected that juvenile and adult forms will vary over time while embryos remain roughly the same, echoing ancestral heritage. But for neo-Darwinism, which transfers the source of adaptations from life experiences to genetic mutations, recapitulation is a huge problem. Embryos are just as vulnerable to genetic accidents as adults. Mutations that streamline embryogenesis - thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation - ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Can't we just bypass all that and go directly to human form? The persistence of recapitulation in utero signifies that inheritance results not so much from ever-malleable genes but species-wide memory of a past that cannot be altered.\n \n Whether cellular or human, life is fundamentally a matter of habit, the repetition of ingrained behavior. A theory of life is essentially a theory of memory. How does the present come to reflect the past? While the body is certainly impacted by the immediate past, it also records influences from the deep past, a well of knowledge that informs all creatures as to the ways of their kind. \n \n Neo-Darwinism mistakes time for space, compressing history into a molecule that obeys dead laws of nature, that is, laws that account for nonlife but not necessarily life. It's not that life has its own laws but that we shouldn't expect to comprehend them without referencing the fundamental qualities of life: self-existence and self-endurance. A genuine theory of life sticks to the methodology of physics, which explains phenomena such as motion and magnetism in terms of natural properties. Instead of grappling with the possibility that memory is a property of nature, biologists have evaded the issue by cobbling together a jerry-rigged substitute theory in which an artifice accounts for the same effect that follows naturally from memory. Our concept of personal, private memory is similarly distorted by placing in space what exists only in time.\n \n Neurobiology regards enduring patterns of synaptic transmission as the marks of an information-storage system no different in principle from wax tablets, recording tape and computer hard drives. Yet our experience of remembering bears no resemblance to the technological model. Instead of the retrieval of accurate, detailed data, our recollections are vague and often wrong, just as we would expect from the restoration, if only in outline form, of prior subjective events. Memory brings the past back to life, not as picture-perfect representation but a feeling for what actually happened. Missing from the equations and formulae of neo-Darwinism is the fact that we're alive, that our sense of identity is not some kind of auto-hallucination induced by concatenations of blinking neurons but the continuity of our own living history. \n \n We know this. We know this perfectly well. But the wisdom that comes naturally to all living things, ourselves included, is summarily dismissed by those we consider experts. Biologists are indeed highly proficient when it comes to the \"nuts and bolts\" of gathering data from organisms but don't seem to grasp the fact that science long ago gave up on the idea that everything under the sun is physically determined and stamped with the authority of mathematically precise law.\n \n Among the chief lessons of thermodynamics is that molecules in a gas are indeterminate. We can't predict what a particular molecule will do any more than we can specify which members of a talk show audience will laugh or applaud, though we can be assured that the audience as a whole will sound roughly like the previous night's audience, itself eerily resembling the one from the night before that, and so on. While large-scale dynamics fall within the purview of physics, the actions of particulars are continually novel and unpredictable. With the micro level off-limits to deterministic law, thermodynamics restricts itself to statistical analysis at the macro level.28 \n \n As noted embryologist Paul Weiss pointed out many years ago, this also applies to the inner workings of our bodies. Weiss made a habit of debunking popular beliefs about life, such as our picture of cells as tiny factories with well-defined parts fed into smooth-running assembly lines. In reality, the cell is founded on molecular disorder. Large-scale patterns of cellular activity must withstand chaotic molecular reactions perpetually sweeping across the cytoplasmic sea. The smaller the scale, the greater the unpredictability. Holism isn't just an opinion held by a few fringe theorists but a simple fact of life. \"The only thing that remains predictable amidst the erratic stirring of the molecular population of the cytoplasm and its substructures is the overall pattern of dynamics.\"29\n \n Since organisms must maintain order in the large despite disorder in the small, how could a molecule be the prime force for order? As Weiss contended, rather than controlling the organism, mechanistic components such as the replication of DNA are merely tools utilized by the living system to maintain order at the level of the whole, be it protein, membrane, cell, organ, etc.30\n \n Weiss wouldn't have been surprised by a recent report from Scientific American that the top-down approach of modeling and predicting cellular activities is yielding far better results these days than the standard assumption based on genetic determinism.31 As he often remarked, it's a long way from determining eye color to directing the construction of an actual set of eyes. Brown eye color follows from the presence of a pigment produced by an enzyme that results from the combination of several genes. If any of these genes is absent, so is the pigment, and the eye is blue instead. What does this tell us about the structure of an eye or how it works? The fact that genes promote distinguishing traits such as eye color means only that they influence development, altering it one way or another, not that they program and control it down to the last detail. That genes account for the many ways we differ doesn't mean they provide the general pattern according to which we're all the same.32 \n \n If genes are in charge, wondered Weiss, why does organic structure emerge first at the level of the whole body and descend, step by step, to specific tissues? Isn't this the opposite of what we would expect from a process driven from within the nuclei of our cells?33 And if the body follows a pre-determined program, why does embryogenesis begin indeterminately, differing from case to case, as if the embryo must improvise until falling into a definite developmental pathway?34\n \n The key factor in the organization of cells into organisms is not the copying of a particular strand of nucleic acids but the position of a given cell in relation to its siblings. A cell lying at the edge of the embryo has a better chance of individuating as a skin cell than an alveolus buried in the lungs, though both are equipped with identical genes. A classic field effect, this is no different in principle from metal particles aligning in the presence of a magnet or planets held in orbit around the sun. Despite all the hoopla surrounding genetic programs, developmental biology has long relied on holistic models, such as Weiss' morphogenetic or \"form-giving\" fields, to account for the emergence of multicellular structures.35\n \n In the 1970s, the little-known Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Cambridge University began wondering what the basis of these fields might be. Is the morphogenetic field merely a conceptual convenience for scientists lacking a properly reductionistic explanation or an actual property of nature? Though such fields, like those of physics, can be expressed with mathematical precision, surely they're not just manifestations of eternal equations but evolve over time along with the organic systems they govern. Rather than descending from a bio-Platonic heaven, morphogenetic fields would be generated and stabilized by their resonance with similar systems that came before. The greater the familial resemblance, the greater the resonance and the more likely the ancestral organ would influence the current model. \n \n If organisms resonate with predecessors of their kind, we ought to see signs of this in animal behavior. As it happens, the scientific literature contains numerous examples of such effects, including rats that negotiate a water maze faster if their relatives have already been through it, birds that take up the habit of popping caps on milk bottles more readily after many others have already learned the trick, and yes, even people who outscore their predecessors on IQ tests, though they're not any smarter, just better at taking similar tests.36\n \n The scientist responsible for digging up these and many other telling facts is the much-maligned, maverick theorist, Rupert Sheldrake. In contrast to Elsasser, who never gained widespread recognition for his work in biology and could always be written off as a physicist out of his element, Sheldrake is a respected biologist who's struck a chord with the public and can't be ignored so easily. In response, the neo-Darwinian mainstream has launched a campaign of hate and ridicule against him, starting with the 1981 publication of his first book, A New Science of Life, which the editor of Nature, John Maddox, proclaimed \"the best candidate for burning there has been for many years.\"37 Echoing Leibniz on gravity, Maddox later accused Sheldrake of trying to find \"a place for magic within scientific discussion.\"38 \n \n Fishing for a suitably \"balancing\" quote in a 2003 story on Sheldrake, USA Today dredged up Skeptic editor Michael Shermer, who obliged with his fatuous allegation that Sheldrake \"never met a goofy idea he didn't like.\"39 Perhaps Shermer was referring to Sheldrake's contention that psychic ties between pets and people - long attested to by pet owners - are not only demonstrably real but result from the same sort of field effect responsible for coordinating cells and tissues within bodies. What Shermer doesn't mention is that the existence of such trans-species bonds is backed up by rigorously controlled experimental evidence. When psychologist Richard Wiseman claimed to have refuted Sheldrake after conducting a follow-up experiment, it turned out he had reproduced Sheldrake's results and then misrepresented his own findings.40\n \n For dogmatic skeptics, any concept that strays from orthodoxy - about which they're never the least bit skeptical - is denounced as heresy. The tragedy, as evidenced by the recent decision of the Kansas Board of Education to revise its science standards, is that the reductionist dogma of pseudo-Darwinism only encourages the return of supernatural speculation in biology. \n \n Perhaps it's true that all the fine-tuned, perfectly timed interactions of cells, tissues, organs and regulatory systems-not to mention experiences such as desiring, weeping and laughing-are only the automated operations of an organic robot constructed through blind forces of nature acting on macromolecules in the dark depths of our innermost innards. On the other hand, maybe an omniscient, benevolent Being breathed life into a lump of clay and called it Adam. So, what's the point? Why should we subscribe to either of these faith-based propositions when a sensible, scientific portrait of life depends only on the recognition that yet another complex phenomenon of nature can't be explicated on the basis of contact mechanics?\n \n As UC Berkeley professor Harry Rubin explains, an organic function as elementary as the timing of penicillin production in the mold Aspergilla involves astronomical numbers of possible gene couplings, so many possibilities, in fact, that the actual sequence of combinations that takes place inside the mold is \"transcalculational, or beyond the power of any conceivable computer in a finite period of time.\"41 Are we to believe, then, that the genome of a mold possesses a magical power of computation by which it determines the correct sequence of genetic combinations? Isn't it more plausible that its genes simply mimic the sequence of steps long taken by their predecessors? And penicillin is an elementary organic compound. What about the creation, from scratch, of trillion-celled furry animals with big ears and buck teeth? Apparently, DNA is the one thing that really can pull a rabbit out of its hat. \n \n Which hypothesis ought to furrow our brow - that statically inscribed in our chromosomes is the complete blueprint of living, dynamic, real-time bodies or that memory is a property of nature exploited by clever and resourceful creatures such as ourselves? Is it just another of those fantastic neo-Darwinian accidents that a mechanistic outlook reigns supreme over biology at the very moment human society is spellbound by its own mechanical creations? We inhabit a machine-made world where invisible rules of atomic etiquette are more real than struggling, suffering and learning, where computers are intelligent, and life is but an algorithm.\n \n Darwin's contribution to biology was not merely to recognize life-struggle as the main source of evolution but to shift the focus from the transcendent abstractions of theology and mechanics to the tangible and irreducible powers of destruction and creativity that play out day by day in the natural world. As he writes in the famous final passage of Origin, \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers...\" such as growth, reproduction, variability and the will to survive, none of which reduce to any single Power, supernatural or otherwise.42 \n \n Isn't it time for the Darwinian revolution to come full circle? Neither our own species nor any other is the passive product of external forces, be they intelligent or blind. To deny the first but not the second is to leave the revolution half undone. Darwin's declaration of independence establishes freedom from any and all celestial proclamations, regardless of where they originate - in a book or with a bang - so long as they deny our birthright of active self-creation. As Sheldrake and Elsasser demonstrate, with a bit of imagination we can establish a basis for the inheritance of adaptations and thereby escape the sterile, endless clash of Tweedledum and Tweedledarwin. Not only can we conceive of biology without mechanism but we have no choice, as the ghost of mechanism past will surely haunt us until we've expelled it in all its forms. \n \n Notes\n \n \n 1.

   "There also seems to be a critical control experiment missing. Namely the serial transfer and assay for resistance WITHOUT the parallel exposure being conducted. One would also like to see some detail concerning the possibility of either cross contamination of cell lines (such often happens in most laboratories and its a real problem) and a test of the CHO lines themselves for contaminating lines of cells. The best way of course would be to analyze the culture media in each case for thioguanine, ethionine, etc. If you read the thermal resistance tests carefully you will notice a change in basic protocol. Don't know if that introduces bias or not.

Personal experience indicates that it is most difficult for those not highly skilled in the art to avoid all traces of cross contamination with chemicals. It can be done, but its an artform in itself. To assess the likelyhood of such problems one literally has to sit in on thI e operations and observe closely. In my past checkered history I have done just that with a number of clients who were experiencing unanticipated high blank values and it always came down to little bits and pieces of bench technique. I cannot evaluate Hills work in this regard without direct observation, but being a skeptical fellow I suspect cross contaminations of some sort until it can be shown NOT to be the case. Hill has not done so to my iknowledge. And oddly enough I cannot find anyone who references his work that was able to repeat it. Suspicious right there you realize.

   "**\n \n FYI--an article posted by Bertvan at ARN whose author seems to see evolution in much the same light as she and I see it. Please note that all 'bold' emphasis has benn added by me.\n \n \"The False Dilemma between Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design \n \n by Ted Dace \n \n \n \n The Hopeless and the Pointless: What Would Darwin Say?\n On a winter night not long ago in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, 200 people gathered at the junior high gym for a school board meeting. The star attraction, a minister named Curtis Brickley, wowed the audience with his multimedia extravaganza purporting to demonstrate that life on Earth could only have been crafted by an \"intelligent designer.\" According to Jenny Johnson, writing for the Ravalli Republic, Brickley \"questioned the process of natural selection at the molecular level,\" as well as \"amino acids organizing into proteins with significant biological consequences, without the presence of a designer.\"1\n \n Creationism is a protest against the deification of DNA, both as engine of species formation and living template in whose image we are cast. Its dispute isn't so much against particular findings of science as the general idea that \"Darwinism\" is all there is and all we are. The good reverend Brickley doesn't deny that from a natural standpoint the body's exquisitely integrated, multi-level, self-regulating, patterned dynamics rest on nothing more than the proper assemblage of amino acids on the basis of linear sequences of nucleic acids. He merely notes that such a skimpy setup might need a helping hand to flesh it out. \n \n Though the creationism debate is generally framed in stark terms - God versus Darwin, religion versus science, superstition versus reason - the enemy camps are actually drawn from the same underlying philosophy. The dominant school of biology, known as neo-Darwinism, harbors a \"mechanistic\" ideology that weakens the case for evolution and leaves the field clear for the return of God, Master Mechanic, to the science classroom. \n \n In the age of Newton, when the cosmic machine whirred and hummed with God-given efficiency, the apex of mechanical achievement was the miniaturized timepiece, a tribute to the power of human intelligence to impose form and order onto dumb matter, much as divine intelligence would have generated living creatures from water and sand. When theologian William Paley likened the organism to a watch, his intention wasn't so much to diminish the glory of living things but to augment that of the Almighty, now portrayed as not only a loving father but a skilled mechanic laboring to realize pre-envisioned plans. \n \n The chief innovation on this model offered by neo-Darwinism is to ditch the mechanic but keep the mechanism. If the machines crafted by our own terrestrial genius can run on auto-pilot, why not the universe? Even if the stars and galaxies are indeed the handiwork of a deity, once we know the program, we have no use for the programmer. In the logic circuits of the celestial apparatus, divinity doesn't compute. God turns out to be the ghost in his own machine. \n \n Newton's absolutist, deterministic philosophy eventually broke down under the pressures of thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics. The machine turns out to be as spectral as the spirit that haunts it. So it's odd that only when physics itself had definitively punctured the Newtonian dream did biology capitulate at last to the mechanistic philosophy, disputing only the means by which the clockwork organism is conceived and assembled. In place of the intelligent design of creationism, we have the thoughtless design of natural selection. Either way, life is determined by external, universal forces, with organisms themselves playing no role in how they live or how their descendents might be reshaped.\n \n Where biologists wonder how supernatural intelligence could be a scientifically meaningful concept, creationists ask how simple chemistry, even in conjunction with natural selection, could yield the most complex, well-formed, purposive systems in the known universe. Are we seriously to believe that the species of life-in all their splendor, precision and incomparable complexity-ultimately derive from random errors cropping up in the replication of DNA? The Hyacinth macaw can crack a nut with its beak that you or I would need a sledgehammer to open. Is all that colossal strength nothing more than a side-effect of a chance mutation in the macaw's genetic toolkit? How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? \n \n So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle. Now multiply this improbability for all the useful traits belonging to more than fifty million life forms, and you see just how profoundly and irredeemably implausible neo-Darwinism really is. \n \n Preoccupied with the creeping threat of divine intervention into the sciences, the pundits of protein can't see how their own favored theory is equally in thrall to the miraculous. Instead of a heavenly weaver stitching legs onto fish, a genetic hiccup does the trick. Like a toy in a cereal box, every defining trait of every species on Earth comes with a special mutation hidden inside. Genes, you might say, work in mysterious ways. We don't know why the right mutation comes along at the right moment-it just does! \n \n Given the choice between intelligent design and its demented cousin, is it any wonder so many Americans prefer the former? As long as living creatures are seen as devices constructed according to blueprints or specifications of one kind or another-a soul deposited by God or a code written by chance-we will be tempted to revert to the cosmic mechanic, who alone seems able to account for not only the astounding intricacy of organisms but our fundamental sense of life that it lives, that it strives to bloom and then bask in its brilliance. The neo-Darwinian mistake is to latch onto a worldview rooted in Protestant theology and try to hammer it into a naturalistic, evolutionary context. So unconvincing are these organic contraptions that pop out of thin air from nucleic accidents that a theory having literally no scientific meaning seems preferable to it. The result is a deadlock between the hopeless and the pointless.\n \n Is there a way out? Well, as it happens, a certain 19th century amateur naturalist devised a theory of speciation not only rigorously scientific but compelling and believable to boot. Known as \"descent with modification by natural selection,\" its creator was none other than Charles Darwin.\n \n \"Throw up a handful of feathers,\" says the author of The Origin of Species, \"and all fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to that of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on [Native American] ruins!\"2 When it comes to issues such as ecology or behavior, the mathematical abstractions of physics have little to offer. dissenting from T. H. Huxley's concept of animal automatism, Darwin stressed the importance of individual will in shaping our actions.3 He further concluded that delicately balanced arrays of cells, tissues and organs cannot properly function without a \"coordinating power\" that brings \"the parts into harmony with each other.\"4 \n \n Whereas today evolution is commonly regarded as the blind interplay of natural selection and random genetic mutations, Darwin explicitly rejected this view, assigning only a marginal role to the \"spontaneous variations\" arising from \"germ-plasm.\"5 He argued instead that the chief source of variations subject to natural selection is the day-to-day struggle to survive in the face of competition and limited resources. Darwinian evolution is a model of clarity and common sense: organisms adapt to changing conditions and transmit their newly acquired behaviors to their progeny. Those adaptations that prove environmentally successful become ingrained and increasingly pronounced with each passing generation until a new species emerges from the old.\n \n Ordinarily labeled \"Lamarckian,\" after the early evolutionist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, the inheritance of acquired characteristics could just as easily be called \"Darwinian.\" What distinguished the two thinkers was that Lamarck believed God had guided the development of life so as to produce Homo sapiens, while Darwin sought to explain evolution in purely naturalistic terms, appealing neither to the intelligence of a deity not the determinism of physics but the good sense of creatures great and small. \n \n \"I think there can be no doubt,\" he writes in Origin, \"that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications are inherited.\"6 He cites many examples, such as young shepherd dogs that know, without training, to avoid running at sheep,7 domesticated chickens that have no fear of cats or dogs as a result of their ancestors having grown accustomed to house pets,8 and ostriches that can't fly because their predecessors learned to kick predators instead of taking flight.9 He was skeptical that cases such as these - and there are countless more - could all result from a mysterious and random process taking place in the remote depths of the body. \"Everyone knows that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants, long before birth, the epidermis is thicker on the palms and the soles of the feet than on any other part of the body... we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of long-continued use or pressure.\"10 \n \n The meaning of evolution is that species are self-created through the act of living and adapting. While physical forces are obviously important, they no more determine our form than theological forces, merely providing the anatomical and environmental constraints within which species define themselves. Regarding the origin of sea mammals, Darwin proposes, \"A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open ocean.\"11 Due to the variability of their bone structure, the very young can alter their anatomy through newly-acquired behaviors, enabling flat-fish, for example, to push their eye sockets a little higher with each passing generation. \"The tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inheritance.\"12\n \n So crucial is the ability of organisms to inherit traits acquired by their forerunners that without it Darwin's hypothesis simply collapses. \"For if each part [of the body] is liable to individual variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at a corresponding or earlier age - propositions which cannot be disputed - then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.\"13 \n \n But what if he got it wrong? He certainly slipped up with his fanciful notion of \"pangenesis,\" a hypothetical mechanism intended to enable adaptations to pass from one generation to the next. In the 1890s, more than a decade after Darwin's death, Austrian theorist August Weismann correctly concluded that animals, no matter how much they alter their behaviors, cannot affect the \"determinants\" (genes) in their reproductive cells. If genes are the sole vehicle of hereditary information, as Weismann assumed, then living adaptations cannot be inherited, and Darwinian evolution must yield to a more precise, mechanistic alternative. The new theory, neo-Darwinism, took final form in the 1930s with the \"modern synthesis\" of natural selection and genetics.\n \n In his magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, the late Stephen Jay Gould reflected on the fact that no evidence bolsters Weismann's assumption. Though he presented his argument as ironclad, a done deal, Weismann offered nothing to support it other than the fact that he couldn't imagine how hereditary information could be transferred to offspring except by way of genes. \"We accept it, not because we are able to demonstrate the process in detail... but simply because we must, because it is the only possible explanation that we can conceive.\"14 Zoologist and author Richard Dawkins helpfully notes that the inability of creationists to imagine how the species of life could have emerged without divine assistance doesn't mean God really does intervene.15 We might add that the inability of neo-Darwinists, including Dawkins himself, to imagine how an organism could inherit traits acquired through life-struggle doesn't mean they aren't picked up nonetheless. \n \n As cell biologist Stephen Rothman observes, adaptive qualities belong to organisms, not genes. It's the animal that must cope with jungle, desert or ocean, not the genome tucked away in its cozy nuclear compartment.16 Darwinian evolution makes sense because it places the organism, not DNA, at the center of the action. Neo-Darwinism, on the other hand, is reductionistic. As with machines, the best way to understand an organism is to \"reduce\" it - level it, you might say - recasting it in terms of its parts which, in turn, are \"reduced\" to their parts, and so on. Overall functioning requires no explanation because once the exact nature of the parts and their interactions is accounted for, the whole picture automatically falls into place. \n \n According to Rothman, who has forty years of experience in the field, reductionism has severely impaired the ability of researchers to accurately assess their own data. As an example, he offers the vesicle theory of protein transport, a stupendously unwieldy model requiring fifteen to thirty mechanisms to move proteins a few microns. None of the experiments cited in the literature can prove these mechanisms actually exist but only what they would look like if they did. Proponents of the theory have never tested it, never saying, \"If it's true, then such and such should happen.\" No matter how much contradictory evidence accrues, confidence in the theory never wavers. Why? Because it's the only model that can account for the movement of protein according to blind, machine-like operations.17 \n \n At the heart of reductionistic metaphysics is the intuitive notion of contact mechanics, according to which a cause must be both temporally and spatially contiguous to its effect. Darwin was skeptical of this view. Toward the end of The Origin of Species, he takes Leibniz to task for alleging that Newton had introduced \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy\" with his theory of gravity, which seems to endow matter with the property of action at a distance.18 As we've known since Einstein's day, electromagnetism and gravity both allow long-distance action without material mediation. Contemporary biologists resemble 19th century physicists who still believed in a \"luminiferous \u00e6ther\" said to mediate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space.\n \n Of all the post-Einsteinian physicists to take an interest in biology, it was the venerable Walter Elsasser who gave the subject its most comprehensive evaluation. A pioneer of quantum mechanics who later solved the equations for the earth's electromagnetic field, Elsasser declared that the necessity of a material medium for the transmission of organic characteristics in no way follows from any known principles of physics.19 Rather than foreclosing on all other theoretical options in favor of an abstract system that casts genes as a kind of bio-ether, Elsasser suggested a new theory based on our actual experience of being alive. In fact, he remarked, we already have a perfectly plausible, commonsense model for retrieval of the past. It's called memory.\n \n \"No principle,\" averred ether-mad physicist James Croll in 1867, \"will ever be generally received that stands in opposition to the old adage, 'A thing cannot act where it is not,' any more than it would were it to stand in opposition to that other adage, 'A thing can not act before it is or when it is not.'\"20. Having recognized that matter does indeed act \"where it is not,\" Elsasser began to wonder if it could also act \"when it is not.\"\n \n Though typically associated with the brain, memory may be much broader in its impact, enabling the organism as a whole to grow and develop on the basis of similarity to previous organisms, particularly those belonging to the same species.21 In contrast to the \"artificial memory\" found in computers, memory in its natural state is the long-distance influence of the past over the present. According to this model, neural \"memory traces,\" instead of storing information about the past, facilitate our recovery of prior perceptions themselves. What reductionistic biology has overlooked is the possibility that memory is exactly what it seems to be - the retention of the past - and that embryos call up the organic forms appropriate to their kind in exactly the same way grownups recall where they left their keys. \n \n Summing up the conventional view, science writer Matt Ridley asserts, \"Something, somewhere must be imposing a pattern of increasing detail upon the egg as it grows and develops.\"22 Elsasser might have rejoined Ridley with a riddle: where, precisely, is the past? \n \n Elsasser's approach, which he presented in a 1981 paper for the Journal of Theoretical Biology, solves several problems at once. Not only does memory account for the inheritance of living adaptations, it eliminates the need for a blueprint from which the body is mechanically constructed. Instead of following a pre-planned design, whether theological or genetic, the embryo simply mimics the developmental steps of its ancestors. And in contrast to the determinism of both creationist and neo-Darwinian ideology, natural memory enables organisms to play a role in their development and to influence the course of evolution. Between the randomness of molecular events and the necessity of physical law lies a probabilistic gray area in which a creature may choose to follow its species memory or - if environmental conditions have changed sufficiently - to select a new course of action.23 Elsasser's organismic selection is thus the logical counterpart to Darwin's natural selection. \n \n Long-range information transferal among living things was inadvertently put to the test a few years ago by French researcher Miroslav Hill, who was studying the ability of hamster cells to withstand a toxic drug. Hill maintained two lines of cells, only one of which was exposed to the toxin. Of this line, predictably some cells died while others adapted and survived. What surprised Hill was that \"cells exposed to the drug shared information for the adaptive changes with the unexposed cells in physically separated cultures.\" Relatives of exposed cells benefited from the knowledge gained by their siblings, suggesting a common pool of memory embracing them all. After numerous repetitions and variations of the experiment yielded the same results, Hill concluded that the information carried on the backs of genes is complemented by long-distance \"adaptive information.\"24\n \n The widespread phenomenon of parallel evolution, one of biology's foremost anomalies, resists explanation along the lines of neo-Darwinism, which asks us to swallow whole the whopping proposition that the stunning, thoroughgoing resemblance between mammals and marsupials-to take but one example-stems entirely from environmental similarities, as though similar foliage and climate could cause virtually identical wolves, squirrels, moles, and jerboas to emerge independently on separate continents. Far more reasonable is the supposition that adaptive information can travel between somewhat similar species, enabling them to evolve into almost perfect alignment.\n \n While Hill was open-minded enough to follow the evidence even where it conflicted with his own reductionistic predisposition, for most biologists an interpretation out of synch with the model of contact mechanics is unthinkable. So when researchers discovered that plants inheriting mutant DNA from their parents can still demonstrate the wildtype trait belonging to their grandparents, it was assumed that RNA contains a backup copy of the grandparents' gene. The Scientist went so far as to report that RNA inheritance had indeed been established, later apologizing to readers for the error and noting that researchers had established only the existence of non-DNA inheritance. Left unstated was the possibility that not all inheritance is mediated by molecules.25 \n \n Much like multicellular organisms, the science of evolution can be traced back to embryological origins. A Latin term meaning \"to unfold,\" evolution originally indicated a fully preformed man or woman in the fertilized egg who simply unfolds in the course of embryogenesis. By the 19th century, investigators had noticed that at each stage of its development the human embryo resembles progressively more complex animal types, such as worm, fish, amphibian, etc. Though the embryonic \"recapitulation\" of lower species is imprecise and should not be taken too literally, the similarities between stages of embryogenesis and the adult forms of ancestors are nonetheless vivid and undeniable. It was on the basis of embryological data that Darwin identified mammals, birds and reptiles as \"the modified descendents of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its adult state with bronchia, a swimbladder, four fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.\"26 Recapitulation, as historian Robert J. Richards contends, was the pivot on which \"evolution\" turned from a theory of individual preformation to species transformation.27\n \n Darwin saw in embryonic recapitulation proof positive that life is evolutionary. Since natural selection operates on adaptations made by creatures after they've left the womb, it's to be expected that juvenile and adult forms will vary over time while embryos remain roughly the same, echoing ancestral heritage. But for neo-Darwinism, which transfers the source of adaptations from life experiences to genetic mutations, recapitulation is a huge problem. Embryos are just as vulnerable to genetic accidents as adults. Mutations that streamline embryogenesis - thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation - ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Can't we just bypass all that and go directly to human form? The persistence of recapitulation in utero signifies that inheritance results not so much from ever-malleable genes but species-wide memory of a past that cannot be altered.\n \n Whether cellular or human, life is fundamentally a matter of habit, the repetition of ingrained behavior. A theory of life is essentially a theory of memory. How does the present come to reflect the past? While the body is certainly impacted by the immediate past, it also records influences from the deep past, a well of knowledge that informs all creatures as to the ways of their kind. \n \n Neo-Darwinism mistakes time for space, compressing history into a molecule that obeys dead laws of nature, that is, laws that account for nonlife but not necessarily life. It's not that life has its own laws but that we shouldn't expect to comprehend them without referencing the fundamental qualities of life: self-existence and self-endurance. A genuine theory of life sticks to the methodology of physics, which explains phenomena such as motion and magnetism in terms of natural properties. Instead of grappling with the possibility that memory is a property of nature, biologists have evaded the issue by cobbling together a jerry-rigged substitute theory in which an artifice accounts for the same effect that follows naturally from memory. Our concept of personal, private memory is similarly distorted by placing in space what exists only in time.\n \n Neurobiology regards enduring patterns of synaptic transmission as the marks of an information-storage system no different in principle from wax tablets, recording tape and computer hard drives. Yet our experience of remembering bears no resemblance to the technological model. Instead of the retrieval of accurate, detailed data, our recollections are vague and often wrong, just as we would expect from the restoration, if only in outline form, of prior subjective events. Memory brings the past back to life, not as picture-perfect representation but a feeling for what actually happened. Missing from the equations and formulae of neo-Darwinism is the fact that we're alive, that our sense of identity is not some kind of auto-hallucination induced by concatenations of blinking neurons but the continuity of our own living history. \n \n We know this. We know this perfectly well. But the wisdom that comes naturally to all living things, ourselves included, is summarily dismissed by those we consider experts. Biologists are indeed highly proficient when it comes to the \"nuts and bolts\" of gathering data from organisms but don't seem to grasp the fact that science long ago gave up on the idea that everything under the sun is physically determined and stamped with the authority of mathematically precise law.\n \n Among the chief lessons of thermodynamics is that molecules in a gas are indeterminate. We can't predict what a particular molecule will do any more than we can specify which members of a talk show audience will laugh or applaud, though we can be assured that the audience as a whole will sound roughly like the previous night's audience, itself eerily resembling the one from the night before that, and so on. While large-scale dynamics fall within the purview of physics, the actions of particulars are continually novel and unpredictable. With the micro level off-limits to deterministic law, thermodynamics restricts itself to statistical analysis at the macro level.28 \n \n As noted embryologist Paul Weiss pointed out many years ago, this also applies to the inner workings of our bodies. Weiss made a habit of debunking popular beliefs about life, such as our picture of cells as tiny factories with well-defined parts fed into smooth-running assembly lines. In reality, the cell is founded on molecular disorder. Large-scale patterns of cellular activity must withstand chaotic molecular reactions perpetually sweeping across the cytoplasmic sea. The smaller the scale, the greater the unpredictability. Holism isn't just an opinion held by a few fringe theorists but a simple fact of life. \"The only thing that remains predictable amidst the erratic stirring of the molecular population of the cytoplasm and its substructures is the overall pattern of dynamics.\"29\n \n Since organisms must maintain order in the large despite disorder in the small, how could a molecule be the prime force for order? As Weiss contended, rather than controlling the organism, mechanistic components such as the replication of DNA are merely tools utilized by the living system to maintain order at the level of the whole, be it protein, membrane, cell, organ, etc.30\n \n Weiss wouldn't have been surprised by a recent report from Scientific American that the top-down approach of modeling and predicting cellular activities is yielding far better results these days than the standard assumption based on genetic determinism.31 As he often remarked, it's a long way from determining eye color to directing the construction of an actual set of eyes. Brown eye color follows from the presence of a pigment produced by an enzyme that results from the combination of several genes. If any of these genes is absent, so is the pigment, and the eye is blue instead. What does this tell us about the structure of an eye or how it works? The fact that genes promote distinguishing traits such as eye color means only that they influence development, altering it one way or another, not that they program and control it down to the last detail. That genes account for the many ways we differ doesn't mean they provide the general pattern according to which we're all the same.32 \n \n If genes are in charge, wondered Weiss, why does organic structure emerge first at the level of the whole body and descend, step by step, to specific tissues? Isn't this the opposite of what we would expect from a process driven from within the nuclei of our cells?33 And if the body follows a pre-determined program, why does embryogenesis begin indeterminately, differing from case to case, as if the embryo must improvise until falling into a definite developmental pathway?34\n \n The key factor in the organization of cells into organisms is not the copying of a particular strand of nucleic acids but the position of a given cell in relation to its siblings. A cell lying at the edge of the embryo has a better chance of individuating as a skin cell than an alveolus buried in the lungs, though both are equipped with identical genes. A classic field effect, this is no different in principle from metal particles aligning in the presence of a magnet or planets held in orbit around the sun. Despite all the hoopla surrounding genetic programs, developmental biology has long relied on holistic models, such as Weiss' morphogenetic or \"form-giving\" fields, to account for the emergence of multicellular structures.35\n \n In the 1970s, the little-known Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Cambridge University began wondering what the basis of these fields might be. Is the morphogenetic field merely a conceptual convenience for scientists lacking a properly reductionistic explanation or an actual property of nature? Though such fields, like those of physics, can be expressed with mathematical precision, surely they're not just manifestations of eternal equations but evolve over time along with the organic systems they govern. Rather than descending from a bio-Platonic heaven, morphogenetic fields would be generated and stabilized by their resonance with similar systems that came before. The greater the familial resemblance, the greater the resonance and the more likely the ancestral organ would influence the current model. \n \n If organisms resonate with predecessors of their kind, we ought to see signs of this in animal behavior. As it happens, the scientific literature contains numerous examples of such effects, including rats that negotiate a water maze faster if their relatives have already been through it, birds that take up the habit of popping caps on milk bottles more readily after many others have already learned the trick, and yes, even people who outscore their predecessors on IQ tests, though they're not any smarter, just better at taking similar tests.36\n \n The scientist responsible for digging up these and many other telling facts is the much-maligned, maverick theorist, Rupert Sheldrake. In contrast to Elsasser, who never gained widespread recognition for his work in biology and could always be written off as a physicist out of his element, Sheldrake is a respected biologist who's struck a chord with the public and can't be ignored so easily. In response, the neo-Darwinian mainstream has launched a campaign of hate and ridicule against him, starting with the 1981 publication of his first book, A New Science of Life, which the editor of Nature, John Maddox, proclaimed \"the best candidate for burning there has been for many years.\"37 Echoing Leibniz on gravity, Maddox later accused Sheldrake of trying to find \"a place for magic within scientific discussion.\"38 \n \n Fishing for a suitably \"balancing\" quote in a 2003 story on Sheldrake, USA Today dredged up Skeptic editor Michael Shermer, who obliged with his fatuous allegation that Sheldrake \"never met a goofy idea he didn't like.\"39 Perhaps Shermer was referring to Sheldrake's contention that psychic ties between pets and people - long attested to by pet owners - are not only demonstrably real but result from the same sort of field effect responsible for coordinating cells and tissues within bodies. What Shermer doesn't mention is that the existence of such trans-species bonds is backed up by rigorously controlled experimental evidence. When psychologist Richard Wiseman claimed to have refuted Sheldrake after conducting a follow-up experiment, it turned out he had reproduced Sheldrake's results and then misrepresented his own findings.40\n \n For dogmatic skeptics, any concept that strays from orthodoxy - about which they're never the least bit skeptical - is denounced as heresy. The tragedy, as evidenced by the recent decision of the Kansas Board of Education to revise its science standards, is that the reductionist dogma of pseudo-Darwinism only encourages the return of supernatural speculation in biology. \n \n Perhaps it's true that all the fine-tuned, perfectly timed interactions of cells, tissues, organs and regulatory systems-not to mention experiences such as desiring, weeping and laughing-are only the automated operations of an organic robot constructed through blind forces of nature acting on macromolecules in the dark depths of our innermost innards. On the other hand, maybe an omniscient, benevolent Being breathed life into a lump of clay and called it Adam. So, what's the point? Why should we subscribe to either of these faith-based propositions when a sensible, scientific portrait of life depends only on the recognition that yet another complex phenomenon of nature can't be explicated on the basis of contact mechanics?\n \n As UC Berkeley professor Harry Rubin explains, an organic function as elementary as the timing of penicillin production in the mold Aspergilla involves astronomical numbers of possible gene couplings, so many possibilities, in fact, that the actual sequence of combinations that takes place inside the mold is \"transcalculational, or beyond the power of any conceivable computer in a finite period of time.\"41 Are we to believe, then, that the genome of a mold possesses a magical power of computation by which it determines the correct sequence of genetic combinations? Isn't it more plausible that its genes simply mimic the sequence of steps long taken by their predecessors? And penicillin is an elementary organic compound. What about the creation, from scratch, of trillion-celled furry animals with big ears and buck teeth? Apparently, DNA is the one thing that really can pull a rabbit out of its hat. \n \n Which hypothesis ought to furrow our brow - that statically inscribed in our chromosomes is the complete blueprint of living, dynamic, real-time bodies or that memory is a property of nature exploited by clever and resourceful creatures such as ourselves? Is it just another of those fantastic neo-Darwinian accidents that a mechanistic outlook reigns supreme over biology at the very moment human society is spellbound by its own mechanical creations? We inhabit a machine-made world where invisible rules of atomic etiquette are more real than struggling, suffering and learning, where computers are intelligent, and life is but an algorithm.\n \n Darwin's contribution to biology was not merely to recognize life-struggle as the main source of evolution but to shift the focus from the transcendent abstractions of theology and mechanics to the tangible and irreducible powers of destruction and creativity that play out day by day in the natural world. As he writes in the famous final passage of Origin, \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers...\" such as growth, reproduction, variability and the will to survive, none of which reduce to any single Power, supernatural or otherwise.42 \n \n Isn't it time for the Darwinian revolution to come full circle? Neither our own species nor any other is the passive product of external forces, be they intelligent or blind. To deny the first but not the second is to leave the revolution half undone. Darwin's declaration of independence establishes freedom from any and all celestial proclamations, regardless of where they originate - in a book or with a bang - so long as they deny our birthright of active self-creation. As Sheldrake and Elsasser demonstrate, with a bit of imagination we can establish a basis for the inheritance of adaptations and thereby escape the sterile, endless clash of Tweedledum and Tweedledarwin. Not only can we conceive of biology without mechanism but we have no choice, as the ghost of mechanism past will surely haunt us until we've expelled it in all its forms. \n \n Notes\n \n \n 1.

   "About the Author:\n \n Ted Dace is a freelance philosopher currently at work on his first book. Many of his science commentaries can be found at skepticalinvestigations.org. This is a slightly modified version of an article published in the Anderson Valley Advertiser.\n http://www.swans.com/library/art13/tdace02.html\n \n \n Subject: Evolution and Believerism September 6, 2005 \n \n From the Skeptical Investigations website: \n \n The False Dilemma between Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design\n \n \"In a new paper Ted Dace contends that the dispute between the rival views of evolution is between two failed theories. The mechanistic ideology of Neo-Darwinism weakens the case for evolution and leaves the field clear for Creationism. Sheldrake and Elsasser have found a basis for the inheritance of adaptations making this endless clash of ideologies redundant.\" \n \n Exercise for anyone with even a high-school knowledge of how evolution works: Poke SUV-sized holes in the following, embarrassingly wilber-esque objections to neo-Darwinian evolution, from the same paper: \n \n The Hyacinth macaw can crack a nut with its beak that you or I would need a sledgehammer to open. Is all that colossal strength nothing more than a side-effect of a chance mutation in the macaw's genetic toolkit? How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? \n So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle. \n Note that Wilber has since (unconvincingly) claimed that he was deliberately oversimplifying his comparable presentation of the mechanism of evolution-and thus intentionally deceiving his readers-in a book intended for the general public (A Brief History of Everything). Yet, his cohorts in \"integral skepticism\" (ha!) quite clearly believe exactly what he claims to have purposely wrongly presented. \n \n Whether or not any of the other avant-garde claims made in Dace's paper are valid, when perfect nonsense (or deliberate lies, take your pick) like the above is presented as if it were insightful wisdom, one is being generous in even reading further. \n \n It is frequently not at all easy to tell which side of the skeptic vs. believer debate is telling you the truth (cf. Sheldrake vs. Richard Wiseman, or Sheldrake vs. Randi). Blatant misrepresentations like the above from Dace, though, make it a little easier. \n \n Interestingly, Sheldrake, Brian Josephson, Larry Dossey and Gary Schwartz are all \"Associates and Advisors\" of the same Skeptical Investigations group. Dossey and Schwartz are also both founding members of Wilber's Daffy Integral Institute. \n \n So, presumably we can look forward to Dace's paper being proudly featured on Wilber University, when that institute of unlearning finally goes public ... somewhere near the end of time, perhaps.\n http://www.geoffreyfalk.com/blog/September2005.asp\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity.\nThis single sentence takes the whole train off the tracks into a huge train wreck of logic. This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion. Why is a single \"perfect\" mutation required as opposed to one of millions that take place in a population at every generation that may offer a slight reproductive advantage? As Gould often asked, do \"historical patterns of development represent a set of mechanically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs,\" or \"do they represent just one possible solution among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth?\" (Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 1159) Thus, the likelihood of a mutation is not determined because subsequent evolution would have been impossible without it.

   "Ted Dace (not a scientist), Bertvan, and ww all seem to have evolutionary theory backasswards.\n\n \n Thats a common logical error. The error is made when one looks at what exists and then thinks of how difficult it would be to arrive that by a single step or a series of steps each one of which is correct and sequential. IT IS looking through the wrong end of the telescope that precisely what it is. What one needs to do is to think from the deep past into the present based on what one knows of all of life in the past and present. THEN one can sometimes see a glimmering of the actual path which might have been followed. This is very productive with the various types of eyes out there for example. Most if not all creos ignore natural selection entirely and the fact that it makes evolution a stepwise process rather than a single step process. Eyes did not arise in a single leap from a creature with no photosensors and they did not arise in an instant either. Is the vertebrate eye improbable - yes of course it is, is it impossible well obviously not! Did it spring forth like aphrodite in a createive burst? Nope it was a lengthy trial and error process with no goal or driver other than the relative survival and reproduction of creatures with increasingly effective means to sense light and deal with more highly resolved images.\n \n What creationists and IDers do is look at a 747 and say hey thats impossible that could not just leap into being at random or by trial and error - and in doing so they ignore the attempts that did not fly, the attempts that barely flew, the earliest models which could fly effectively, the slow development of power plants, alloys, avionics, etc etc etc etc.",

   "Bertvan; Hi Chemist99a, My most immediate disagreement with the article you cite is the assertion that \"information is physical\". Information can be expressed physically, such as by language or other communication systems, but ideas and concepts are themselves immaterial. I also happen to believe an immaterial mind exists separate from a brain. It is a difference between materialism and immaterialism.\n \n My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.\n \n My third disagreement is that DNA sequences resemble blueprints. I see the genome more as a resource utilized by the intelligent system to manufacture proteins and containing a memory to assist (not dictate) the development of the organism. \n \n If you are a materialist, and I'll let you define your own philosophical assumptions, we can agree to disagree. I am a religious agnostic, but not a materialist. I believe science can be done under either assumption and I will not call you a \"threat to science\" because of your philosophical assumptions.\n \n If it is true that Darwin \n \n \nstressed the importance of individual will in shaping our actions. He further concluded that delicately balanced arrays of cells, tissues and organs cannot properly function without a \"coordinating power\" that brings \"the parts into harmony with each other.\n \n Whereas today evolution is commonly regarded as the blind interplay of natural selection and random genetic mutations, Darwin explicitly rejected this view, assigning only a marginal role to the \"spontaneous variations\" arising from \"germ-plasm. He argued instead that the chief source of variations subject to natural selection is the day-to-day struggle to survive in the face of competition and limited resources. Darwinian evolution is a model of clarity and common sense: organisms adapt to changing conditions and transmit their newly acquired behaviors to their progeny. Those adaptations that prove environmentally successful become ingrained and increasingly pronounced with each passing generation until a new species emerges from the old.\n\n \n Bertvan: If that is what Darwin actually said, then Darwin was closer to EAM than to Neo Darwinism. In any case, I do not believe \"natural selection\" would have any power to organize genomic accidents of any kind into functional biological systems.\n \n Questions about Materialism with some pretty funny stuff about Freud.",

Information can be expressed physically, such as by language or other communication systems, but ideas and concepts are themselves immaterial. I also happen to believe an immaterial mind exists separate from a brain. It is a difference between materialism and immaterialism.\n\n \n Ok then remove the brain and see whats left of the mind. As to information being physical - information is always embodied in material form there is no evidence that it can exist outside of such a context. And as you might recall information was defined as an aspect of entropy (actually negentropy), also please recall that materialism includes both matter and energy within its borders. You are of course entitled to believe whatever you choose and of course to accept the consequences of that belief when you act on it.\n \n \nMy second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.\n\n \n Well firstly we do not know that \"volition\" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.\n \n\n My third disagreement is that DNA sequences resemble blueprints. I see the genome more as a resource utilized by the intelligent system to manufacture proteins and containing a memory to assist (not dictate) the development of the organism. \n\n \n The code sequences are of course \"blueprints\" in much the same sense. But genomes are utilized through a series of automatic nonvolitional and unintelligent reactions. NIR - no intelligence required.\n If you are a materialist, and I'll let you define your own philosophical assumptions, we can agree to disagree. I am a religious agnostic, but not a materialist. I believe science can be done under either assumption and I will not call you a \"threat to science\" because of your philosophical assumptions.\n \n \nBertvan: If that is what Darwin actually said, then Darwin was closer to EAM than to Neo Darwinism. In any case, I do not believe \"natural selection\" would have any power to organize genomic accidents of any kind into functional biological systems.\n\n \n Well he did invoke use and disuse (not necessarily intelligence) along with his theory of pangenesis but he was incorrect in both instances. After all he was shooting in the dark in a highly speculative way with regard to the mechanisms of both variability and inheritance. Its unfortunate he was not aware of the contemporary work of Mendel, but them is the breaks. Its quite obvious that molecular biology and genetics have moved leagues beyond Darwins level of information.\n \n And what you believe natural selection can and cannot achieve is moot its capabilities are well known and nicely demonstrable both in theory and in practice. Vast tomes of empirical evidence says your belief is not valid.",

   "To quote some more from the article posted by Wascallywabbit .\n \n Intelligent Design\n \n Bertvan: This author claims Darwin believed mutations were not random, but the result of individual organisms responding to the environment, intelligently and purposefully.\n \n:\n Whereas today evolution is commonly regarded as the blind interplay of natural selection and random genetic mutations, Darwin explicitly rejected this view, assigning only a marginal role to the \"spontaneous variations\" arising from \"germ-plasm.\" He argued instead that the chief source of variations subject to natural selection is the day-to-day struggle to survive in the face of competition and limited resources. Darwinian evolution is a model of clarity and common sense: organisms adapt to changing conditions and transmit their newly acquired behaviors to their progeny. Those adaptations that prove environmentally successful become ingrained and increasingly pronounced with each passing generation until a new species emerges from the old.\n\n \n Bertvan: He further claims that such adaptations developed gradually and purposefully. Used organs developed and unused ones atrophied, as suggested by Endogenous Adaptive Morphogenesis.\n \n \n:\n Ordinarily labeled \"Lamarckian,\" after the early evolutionist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, the inheritance of acquired characteristics could just as easily be called \"Darwinian.\" What distinguished the two thinkers was that Lamarck believed God had guided the development of life so as to produce Homo sapiens, while Darwin sought to explain evolution in purely naturalistic terms, appealing neither to the intelligence of a deity not the determinism of physics but the good sense of creatures great and small.\n\n \n \n Bertvan: What could \"The good sense of creatures great and small\" mean, another than intelligence.\n \n \n:\n \"I think there can be no doubt,\" he (Darwin) writes in Origin, \"that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications are inherited.\" He cites many examples, such as young shepherd dogs that know, without training, to avoid running at sheep, domesticated chickens that have no fear of cats or dogs as a result of their ancestors having grown accustomed to house pets, and ostriches that can't fly because their predecessors learned to kick predators instead of taking flight. He was skeptical that cases such as these - and there are countless more - could all result from a mysterious and random process taking place in the remote depths of the body. \"Everyone knows that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants, long before birth, the epidermis is thicker on the palms and the soles of the feet than on any other part of the body... we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of long-continued use or pressure.\". \n\n \n Bertvan: All this evidence for inheritance of acquired traits was forgotten when someone cut the tails of some mice for a few generations and then declared that because such mutilations didn't seem to be heritable, neither were those adaptations that were being organized by the internal intelligence of the biological system -- such as acquired attitudes and behaviors and thickening of epidermis.\n \n Questions about Materialism with some pretty funny stuff about Freud.",

Soft inheritance was nothing new but it was a theory. The fact that Darwin did not understand genetics is no reason to fail to understand it today however and the current best theory of variation and inheritance has physical and empirical evidence to back it up. We have come a very long way since Darwin who did not know or at least apparently was unaware of Mendel.\n \n \nBertvan: He further claims that such adaptations developed gradually and purposefully. Used organs developed and unused ones atrophied, as suggested by Endogenous Adaptive Morphogenesis.\n\n \n I do not think you will find a PURPOSEFUL attribution in Darwins work. Use and disuse was ONE of the mechanisms he proposed (although he realized it was . a very shakey idea) after LaMarck and others. LaMarck DID invoke will in the process much like EAM invokes \"intelligence\" but you realize LaMarck got it backwards, understadibly so in his day, not excusable today.\n \n \nBertvan: What could \"The good sense of creatures great and small\" mean, another than intelligence.\n\n \n Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains. EAM attributes \"intelligence\" even to bacteria and to corn plants, trees, jellyfish, single celled eukaryotes etc. If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept.\n \n \nBertvan: All this evidence for inheritance of acquired traits was forgotten when someone cut the tails of some mice for a few generations and then declared that because such mutilations didn't seem to be heritable, neither were those adaptations that were being organized by the internal intelligence of the biological system -- such as acquired attitudes and behaviors and thickening of epidermis.\n\n \n It was not forgotten as you well know. People still study LaMarcks theories in college biology, and high school biology. The evidence (such as it is) remains and is remembered, its just not taken as being up to the task of constructing a meaningful explanation of inheritance.\n \n In summary the current theory of inheritance and variability is by far the more logical and rational explanation and it is supported by the evidence which is available as well as by empirical testing. \n \n You may prefer it to be otherwise, but as you know reality does not conform to ones wishes no matter how often or forcefully you express them.",

It's the animal that must cope with jungle, desert or ocean, not the genome tucked away in its cozy nuclear compartment.. . .(EAM). . . makes sense because it places the organism, not DNA, at the center of the action. \n\n \n Bertvan: (I've substituted EAM for \"Darwinism\" because today few Darwinists would acknowledge that adaptations originate in living organisms rather than their genomes. Most Darwinists are still stuck on versions of genetic accidents.) All organisms some ability to respond to stimuli. I agree that plants and sponges seem to have a lesser choice of optional responses than more complex organisms. Yet even they are capable of some creative response. I've seen evidenceconvincing to me that even single cultured cells are capable of some limited free response. However the options available to a DNA molecule must be miniscule. Yet the Darwinists seem to grant pieces of DNA the power to \"selfishly\" control entire organisms.\n \n \nAccording to Rothman, who has forty years of experience in the field, reductionism has severely impaired the ability of researchers to accurately assess their own data. As an example, he offers the vesicle theory of protein transport, a stupendously unwieldy model requiring fifteen to thirty mechanisms to move proteins a few microns. None of the experiments cited in the literature can prove these mechanisms actually exist but only what they would look like if they did. Proponents of the theory have never tested it, never saying, \"If it's true, then such and such should happen.\" No matter how much contradictory evidence accrues, confidence in the theory never wavers. Why? Because it's the only model that can account for the movement of protein according to blind, machine-like operations.\n\n \n Bertvan: Every living organism and every cell of every living organism has some limited ability to change and adapt in response to stimuli, intelligently and purposefully. Once volition is acknowledged as an aspect of living systems, the mechanisms may be found.\n \n \nAt the heart of reductionistic metaphysics is the intuitive notion of contact mechanics, according to which a cause must be both temporally and spatially contiguous to its effect. Darwin was skeptical of this view. Toward the end of The Origin of Species, he takes Leibniz to task for alleging that Newton had introduced \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy\" with his theory of gravity, which seems to endow matter with the property of action at a distance. As we've known since Einstein's day, electromagnetism and gravity both allow long-distance action without material mediation. Contemporary biologists resemble 19th century physicists who still believed in a \"luminiferous \u00e6ther\" said to mediate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space.\n\n \n Bertvan: Darwin may have been skeptical or reductionism, but twentieth century biologists who called themselves Darwinists were not.

   "I'm delighted to see this thoughtful, courteous exchange regarding the ideas proposed in my article, \"The False Dilemma between Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design.\" Since I'm coming in after the fact, I'll bring all my responses together into a single post.\n \n chemist99a writes:\n \n On memory. I have indicated to you several times that the genome becomes modified by binding information about past environments the linage has been subjected to. That means that DNA \"remembers\" past environments. There is your memory component. Neo-Darwinism is fully consistent with the idea of \"memory\" (a record of the past) being a core element of evolution.\n <<<\n \n I've made this point myself, though not in this particular essay. The gene-based theory of inheritance is essentially a theory of memory. The idea is that species retain their characteristic forms and instincts from generation to generation by storing the relevant information in genes which are then passed on from parent to offspring. The trouble with this view is that the amount of information that would have to be stored is incalculably vast while the storage capacity of genes is limited. The same problem applies to storage of personal memory in the brain. The solution is that both genes and brain cells operate in much the same way as tuning devices in radios. Let's say 91.5 FM is playing Beethoven while 97.5 FM is playing Buck Owens. Clearly, 91.5 is not a code containing all the information needed to reproduce a violin sonata, any more than 97.5 is a code from which a country ballad can be assembled. To put it in logical terms, the station setting is necessary but not sufficient for the music that plays over the radio. It may be that genes and brain cells are also necessary but insufficient to account for memory. All the evidence for the role of genes in the inheritance of forms and instincts is evidence as to necessity. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could verify or falsify the proposition that genes or brain cells are not only necessary but also sufficient to account for memory. \n \n There are thus two possibilities: 1) biological memory is reducible to material storage of information, and 2) biological memory is a two track process involving both stored information and the act of \"tuning\" into past organic forms on the basis of similarity. In this case, genes merely ensure that the proper proteins are available to the developing organism.\n \n sinjin quotes Geoffrey Falk:\n \n \"In a new paper Ted Dace contends that the dispute between the rival views of evolution is between two failed theories. The mechanistic ideology of Neo-Darwinism weakens the case for evolution and leaves the field clear for Creationism. Sheldrake and Elsasser have found a basis for the inheritance of adaptations making this endless clash of ideologies redundant.\n \n \"Exercise for anyone with even a high-school knowledge of how evolution works: Poke SUV-sized holes in the following, embarrassingly wilber-esque objections to neo-Darwinian evolution, from the same paper:\n \n \"'The Hyacinth macaw can crack a nut with its beak that you or I would need a sledgehammer to open. Is all that colossal strength nothing more than a side-effect of a chance mutation in the macaw's genetic toolkit? How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle.'\n \n \"Note that Wilber has since (unconvincingly) claimed that he was deliberately oversimplifying his comparable presentation of the mechanism of evolution-and thus intentionally deceiving his readers-in a book intended for the general public (A Brief History of Everything). Yet, his cohorts in \"integral skepticism\" (ha!) quite clearly believe exactly what he claims to have purposely wrongly presented.\n \n \"Whether or not any of the other avant-garde claims made in Dace's paper are valid, when perfect nonsense (or deliberate lies, take your pick) like the above is presented as if it were insightful wisdom, one is being generous in even reading further.\"\n <<<\n \n The nonsense is entirely Falk's. Note that he never explains exactly what it is that's taught in high school biology that contradicts my statement. Is he referring to mixing of genes during sexual reproduction? Is he referring to allele fixing? Is he referring to Lynn Margulis' symbiosis? He doesn't say, perhaps because none of these factors can explain radically new traits in evolution. Gene mixing and genetic drift can account for minor changes but not the kind of wholesale transformations that occur with the emergence of new species (not to mention new classes and phyla). Symbiosis only pushes the question back a step: if a cell gains the ability to produce energy by absorbing mitochondria, where did the mitochondria gain this ability? \n \n Or perhaps Falk was thinking of the new developments in the field of \"evo-devo\" (though of course this sort of thing would never have been taught in a high school biology class). What evo-devo shows, according to Sean Carroll, author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful, is that large-scale bodily change does not necessarily require genetic mutation. What it requires instead is mutation in the DNA directly preceding the relevant gene, which causes the gene to operate differently. In other words, the basis of novelty in organisms is not genetic mutation but DNA mutation. Not much of a distinction. In the end, it still comes down to seemingly random mutation that has an astonishingly beneficial impact. \n \n Evo-devo research has demonstrated that what counts is not so much the genes themselves but how they're used. Assuming that the knowledge of how to manipulate genes is not paradoxically encoded in the genes themselves, this implies the existence of endogenous intelligence at the cellular level. \n \n Falk conceals the weakness of his position with the use of charged language and meaningless insult. If he had a real argument to make, he'd make it. \n \n chemist99a writes:\n \n The Hill results are not consistent with EAM. EAM would predict that exposure IS required to produce the mutations. In HILLs work the mutations were occurring in cells never exposed to the toxins etc.\n <<<\n \n I've since learned that Hill only assumed the resistance was produced prior to exposure to the toxin. However, this assumption is understandable. He found that each time he added healthy cells to the flasks containing the toxin, thioguanine, a greater proportion mutated and survived. Each new population seemed to have a better knowledge of how to mutate. It may be that this knowledge is the result of holistic memory. Once the cells were exposed to the toxin, they tuned into cells that had been exposed before. The more cells that had previously made the adaptation, the stronger the \"signal\" that the new cells tuned into. \n \n Incidentally, Hill was director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Villejuif, France. He and his assistants conducted their research using the most careful methodology available. He got the same results whether using thioguanine, ethionine or high temperature. There is no reason to doubt his results, though obviously further replication would be helpful. \n \n <<<\n the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems.\n <<<\n \n Complex systems, where living or merely lifelike, always emerge in whole, not in part. Complexity is fundamentally holistic. The shift to complexity in biological thinking represents a definitive rebuke of the reductionist interpretations that characterized 20th century theory. \n \n <<<\n we now are being asked to toss out causality and mechanism. We are asked to abandon all of physics! To toss it all out and go back to just exactly what? To a causeless universe? To chaos? To a total lack of any explanations for anything at all? Back to GOD? Such a Brave New World the author proposes. When you take your car to the mechanics in his world they will tell you that your car is possessed by curse and needs exorcism? Is that what he advocates?\n <<<\n \n No. I am not advocating that mechanism be abandoned in the sense of causality, only in the sense of contact mechanics, an event that occurred in physics centuries ago and was reinforced by both Maxwell and Einstein. Of course, we could say that morphic resonance (i.e. formal similarity) is the mechanism by which current organisms tune in to their predecessors. I didn't use the word mechanism that way in this essay because I didn't want to create confusion by using the same word in two different ways. \n \n pandion writes:\n \n \"So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity.\"\n \n This single sentence takes the whole train off the tracks into a huge train wreck of logic. This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion.\n <<<\n \n That there are no distant goals in evolution does not mean there are no immediate goals. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Nothing foolish about any of this.

   " It may be that genes and brain cells are also necessary but insufficient to account for memory. All the evidence for the role of genes in the inheritance of forms and instincts is evidence as to necessity. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could verify or falsify the proposition that genes or brain cells are not only necessary but also sufficient to account for memory.\n\n The short answer: gene splicing.\n \n I had a protracted discussion with WW about this very point: to induce a trait in a different species or organism it is necessary to transfer to that organism all the information necessary to yield the trait. Obviously, the organisms will already have a lot of non-trait-specific information in common, eg they employ the same cipher for translating DNA bases into amino acids and thus proteins. So what we're really asking is whether a given gene encapsulates all the novel information required for the trait to present. The success of gene splicing confirms that this is very often the case.\n \n Even where the transplanting of a single gene is insufficient, it seems reasonable to suppose that it is the unique physical context in which that gene is operating - the cogs with which it meshes in the original species - that yield function, rather than speculating that it indexes some metaphysical 'memory'.\n \n \nThe nonsense is entirely Falk's. Note that he never explains exactly what it is that's taught in high school biology that contradicts my statement.\n\n I don't know whether it's taught in high-school biology, but the primary faults in the (your?) reasoning are common wrong-turns made by critics of evolutionary theory: the false assumption of constancy, and the construction of an implausible starting scenario.\n \n In the scenario as presented, the macaw is the only variable. Right from the start it is faced with the problem of an incredibly tough nut, which it must somehow eat. Thus you engineer an insurmountable problem for evolution to solve: a non-viable animal which must within its own lifetime become viable.\n \n Taking the assumption of constancy first - why are you assuming that back in the day when macaws lacked their formidable jaw strength, the nuts they had to eat were as tough as they are now? Why would they need to be that rugged and over-engineered if nothing in the environment poses them that great a threat? Remove the assumption of constancy and we see an evolutionary arms-race: the toughest nuts from one generation surviving to grow, yielding a next generation of tougher-nutted plants, in turn favouring the macaws with the strongest jaws, who breed to produce a stronger-jawed macaw population - and so on.\n \n Secondly, is your starting scenario a sensible one? For the macaw species to have survived long enough to evolve that far, there must be other things around it can and has been eating! If all those food sources suddenly disappeared, we know what would happen: extinction.\n \n We don't need to find ways to improve evolution's ability to solve your problem, because your problem is fundamentally flawed.\n \n \nEvo-devo research has demonstrated that what counts is not so much the genes themselves but how they're used. Assuming that the knowledge of how to manipulate genes is not paradoxically encoded in the genes themselves, this implies the existence of endogenous intelligence at the cellular level. \n\n Why would that be a paradox? Have you never bought anything that came with an instruction manual? I have a child seat for my car with the instructions printed on the side - where's the paradox?\n \n Even that is underselling the potential for genes to regulate themselves and each other. They are not words on paper but chemically active compounds: they can directly alter the function of their biological context without that biological context needing to know 'how', or make any kind of decision on the matter.\n \nComplex systems, where living or merely lifelike, always emerge in whole, not in part. Complexity is fundamentally holistic. The shift to complexity in biological thinking represents a definitive rebuke of the reductionist interpretations that characterized 20th century theory. \n\n This is another common logical failure, similar to that responsible for the myth that 'Irreducible Complexity' is a problem for evolution.\n \n Just because a complex system is holistic doesn't mean it couldn't previously have been a simpler (or in the case of IC systems, more complex) holistic system in the past. What is a vital role now may at one time have been an unintended by-product of a quite different process - a by-product which opportunistic evolution made use of, to the point where the role is now indespensible.\n \nOf course, we could say that morphic resonance (i.e. formal similarity) is the mechanism by which current organisms tune in to their predecessors. I didn't use the word mechanism that way in this essay because I didn't want to create confusion by using the same word in two different ways.\n\n Such 'resonance' is trivial to debunk. Carry out a fluctuation test on a batch of bacteria. Now do it again on another batch. If morphic resonance could inform the second batch they ought to do better - they don't.\n \n Even at the theoretical level, the notion of morphic resonance is irretrievably flawed. At any given instant, the molecular configuration of one bacterium will be entirely unlike that of even its immediate neighbour, let alone some previous generation, so what exactly is supposed to be resonating? If you invoke the idea of conceptual resonance to solve that problem, you still haven't provided a place for the metaphysical rubber to hit the physical road.\n \nThat there are no distant goals in evolution does not mean there are no immediate goals. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Nothing foolish about any of this.\n\n See above. I wouldn't go so far as to call it foolishness, but there is a failure on your part to critically examine your assumptions.\n \nIn fact, it's foolish to deny that evolution is driven, in part, by purpose and intelligence.\n\n Now that is true. Sexual selection, migration, intelligently exploiting niches using what nature has given you - all these factors guide evolution. But to extrapolate this to EAM is wishful thinking.",

   "The short answer: gene splicing.\n \n I had a protracted discussion with WW about this very point: to induce a trait in a different species or organism it is necessary to transfer to that organism all the information necessary to yield the trait. Obviously, the organisms will already have a lot of non-trait-specific information in common, eg they employ the same cipher for translating DNA bases into amino acids and thus proteins. So what we're really asking is whether a given gene encapsulates all the novel information required for the trait to present. The success of gene splicing confirms that this is very often the case.\n\n \n That a given gene is needed to induce a given trait in an organism does not mean that this gene (along with the protein it generates) is sufficient to produce the trait. I need a computer to view 4Forums. Does this mean 4Forums is contained within my computer? Of course not. \n \n It's a simple question of logic. Maybe all the information does lie within the gene. But from a scientific standpoint, it hasn't been proven. \n \n \nEven where the transplanting of a single gene is insufficient, it seems reasonable to suppose that it is the unique physical context in which that gene is operating - the cogs with which it meshes in the original species - that yield function, rather than speculating that it indexes some metaphysical 'memory'.\n\n \n Calling it metaphysical is begging the question. If natural memory is real, then it's not \"metaphysical.\" \n \n \nI don't know whether it's taught in high-school biology, but the primary faults in the (your?) reasoning are common wrong-turns made by critics of evolutionary theory: the false assumption of constancy, and the construction of an implausible starting scenario.\n \n In the scenario as presented, the macaw is the only variable. Right from the start it is faced with the problem of an incredibly tough nut, which it must somehow eat. Thus you engineer an insurmountable problem for evolution to solve: a non-viable animal which must within its own lifetime become viable.\n \n Taking the assumption of constancy first - why are you assuming that back in the day when macaws lacked their formidable jaw strength, the nuts they had to eat were as tough as they are now? Why would they need to be that rugged and over-engineered if nothing in the environment poses them that great a threat? Remove the assumption of constancy and we see an evolutionary arms-race: the toughest nuts from one generation surviving to grow, yielding a next generation of tougher-nutted plants, in turn favouring the macaws with the strongest jaws, who breed to produce a stronger-jawed macaw population - and so on.\n \n Secondly, is your starting scenario a sensible one? For the macaw species to have survived long enough to evolve that far, there must be other things around it can and has been eating! If all those food sources suddenly disappeared, we know what would happen: extinction.\n \n We don't need to find ways to improve evolution's ability to solve your problem, because your problem is fundamentally flawed.\n\n \n My example is simplified for the sake of brevity. Of course, the nuts are also evolving, and the macaw has other food sources. The question is how this evolutionary arms race proceeds. Does natural selection operate in tandem with random mutation or adaptive mutation? Does the adaptation need to be expressed at the genetic level, or can somatic changes, through a process of morphogenetic memory, directly influence the forms and instincts of descendants? If not, is there an intelligence operating at the cellular level which is sensitive to the survival needs of the whole organism? Or is there some kind of mechanical process such as Darwin's pangenesis that allows somatic information to enter the germline? \n \n Nobody knows the answers to these questions. It's all up in the air. That's the thing about science. We can imagine we know the answers, but in the end science kicks us in the XXX. \n \n \nWhy would that be a paradox? Have you never bought anything that came with an instruction manual? I have a child seat for my car with the instructions printed on the side - where's the paradox?\n\n \n The instruction manual for the child seat works precisely because there is an intelligent agent, i.e. you, that interprets it. So this analogy is not helpful to the point you're trying to make. \n \n In the old days it was assumed that DNA contains the blueprint or recipe of the organism and that the application of this blueprint was a strictly mechanical process. Now we see that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from flies to people. What really counts is the way genes are used rather than their content. So now we need an instructional manual on how to properly implement the blueprint. If the manual is embedded within the DNA itself, how is the DNA able to read it? Presumably the instructions for reading the manual would also be contained within the manual. Perhaps there's another manual that explains how to read the first manual, and then yet another manual to explain how to read that one, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the fallacy of the homunculus. \n \n Even without the question of the instructional manual, the idea that organisms require a kind of blueprint in order to be formed is already an example of the homunculus fallacy. After all, if an organism needs a blueprint in order to be assembled, wouldn't the blueprint also need a blueprint? \n \n Of course, now that we understand the stupendous complexity in the operation of genes, the whole issue has been rendered moot. The point of reductionism is that a complex process is \"reduced\" to a simple process. Yet the operation of genes turns out to be as complex as any process in the body, including the brain. In short, biological reductionism is as dead as the mechanistic creationism that inspired it.\n \n The search for the sources of evolutionary novelty in genetic mutations, remixing, drift, etc., is no longer viable, as the entire theoretical framework of epigenetic development has been abolished. \n \n \nJust because a complex system is holistic doesn't mean it couldn't previously have been a simpler (or in the case of IC systems, more complex) holistic system in the past.\n\n \n Let's take the example of a tornado. One moment there's no tornado, just a massive gradient between warm air on the ground and cool air in the sky. The next thing you know, a tornado has emerged fully formed, seemingly out of nowhere, and begins efficiently wiping out the temperature gradient. It's not as if the tornado emerged from the dust particles of which it is composed or a smaller proto-tornado. \n \n Organisms aren't built up from DNA any more than tornadoes are built up from dust. This is what I mean when I say that complex systems are holistic, not reductionist. \n \n \nSuch 'resonance' is trivial to debunk. Carry out a fluctuation test on a batch of bacteria. Now do it again on another batch. If morphic resonance could inform the second batch they ought to do better - they don't.\n\n \n Why should the second batch do any better? Unless there's a survival issue involved, the second batch should take exactly as long as the first. \n \n The most recent test I'm aware of that confirms morphic resonance was carried out by Rupert Sheldrake and Steven Rose on chicks who received food after pecking at LEDs of a particular color. Only those who pecked at the \"correct\" color (yellow) were rewarded. Each batch of chicks, unrelated to the previous batch, learned to peck at the yellow diodes more quickly. Shockingly, Dr. Rose refused to concede the results of his own experiment. He came in convinced that each batch of chicks would perform no better than previous batches, and he came out no less convinced. Though science follows the evidence, scientists sometimes do not. \n \n \nEven at the theoretical level, the notion of morphic resonance is irretrievably flawed. At any given instant, the molecular configuration of one bacterium will be entirely unlike that of even its immediate neighbour, let alone some previous generation, so what exactly is supposed to be resonating? If you invoke the idea of conceptual resonance to solve that problem, you still haven't provided a place for the metaphysical rubber to hit the physical road.\n\n \n What resonates is the whole form, not the material constituents. In contrast to artificial memory, which reduces to stored material configurations, natural memory is holistic, operating on the basis of morphological similarity. I tune into my ancestors because we have a similar overall form, not because we have the same chemical constituents. \n \n Incidentally, the point you make about chemical individuality in organisms is precisely the point made by the revered embryologist Paul Weiss when he coined the term morphogenetic field. What endures in the organism is overall pattern, not molecular details. The field has causal primacy, directing molecules towards its own end. Sheldrake adds to this notion the idea that morphogenetic fields contain an inherent memory on the basis of which they direct molecular activity. Thus life is fundamentally conservative, continually mimicking its past states, with evolution as the exception that proves the rule.\n \n \nNow that is true. Sexual selection, migration, intelligently exploiting niches using what nature has given you - all these factors guide evolution. But to extrapolate this to EAM is wishful thinking.\n\n \n Why posit intelligence at the level of the organism but ban it from the level of the cell?",

We haven't proven that the earth revolves around the sun, therefore we aren't justified in accepting the boatloads of evidence that it does?

As I stated in my paper and in follow-up reports on this bulletin board, morphic resonance is a kind of memory that operates on the basis of similarity. Though organisms are obviously similar to their ancestors, they can resonate with any past creature that is similar. Direct lineage is not required. \n \n Interestingly, this is not the case in quantum physics. When two photons are separated out from a beam of light, they are entangled, meaning that if one photon is disturbed, the other photon, no matter how far away, will exhibit exactly the same disturbance. Thus the photons \"remember\" that they were once united. But there's no such thing as similarity in quantum physics. All photons are identical, as are all electrons, etc. In physics, natural memory is revealed through lineage, while in biology, mere similarity enables resonance across time. \n \n \nIn fact it seems that morphological resonance occurs wherever you can imagine it does, and whenever it isn't needed somewhere, it pops up somewhere else, like a game of whack a mole, impossible to pin down.\n\n \n Impossible to pin down if you never bother to understand the theory. Once you get it, then of course there's no problem pinning down where resonance occurs and where it does not. \n \n \nSo everything influenced by the past has memory. But neurons, which are influenced by the past, do not have memory.\n\n \n Of course neurons have memory. They have the memory of how to operate as neurons. By operating correctly, they facilitate both conscious and unconscious memory. But this doesn't mean the neuron's memory is located within the neuron itself. The only things you'll ever find in a neuron are chemicals and electrical pulses. \n \n Memory is an expression of time, not matter. Rather than containing memory, living bodies are only influenced by it. This is no different than saying gravity is an expression of space, not massive bodies, and that the behavior of planets is only influenced by gravity rather than literally containing it. (Search all you want. You will find only atoms and molecules of various kinds, not \"gravity\"). To say that the concept of memory is inherently mystical or unscientific is to say that the concept of gravity is inherently mystical or unscientific, which by the way, is precisely what Leibniz said when Newton unveiled his theory over three centuries ago. Leibniz was wrong. Newton was right. \n \n \nHow convenient it is when words you are using don't mean anything. Or mean two contradictory things at the same time.\n\n \n And how convenient it is to simply dismiss a proposal rather than taking the trouble to understand it. \n \n \nOk, so you believe that everything that happens in the brain is deterministic, so you can't actually pinpoint any non-deterministic effects, but you want the brain to be non-deterministic anyway.\n\n \n Where do I claim that what happens in the brain is deterministic? Once again, you're revealing an inability or unwillingness to follow my argument. \n \n \nShow me one of these so-called \"probabilistic\" events in the brain, show me a neuron which might fire, or then again might not, under the same physical conditions. No such probabilistic events occur. One neuron, two neuron, three neuron or four, it doesn't matter how many you add together, they don't start becoming \"probabilistic\".\n\n \n This is pure fantasy. You're way out of the loop here. It's well known that the brain is the most complex system in the known universe. Like all complex systems, the brain is nonlinear, meaning that a minuscule event can have huge repercussions. Like the weather, which is also nonlinear, the behavior of the brain cannot be predicted with 100% confidence.\n \n \nActually you have it entirely backwards champ, neurons are not necessary for memory, many other memory systems will suffice. But they are sufficient. As I have already explained to you, even a SINGLE neuron \"remembers\" the charges it is exposed to. There isn't anything probabilistic about it, there isn't a Ghost Pirate at the wheel, or a Magic 8-Ball telling it what to do, it just does it, because that's the way a neuron is constructed - to be influenced by the past.\n\n \n As I have already explained to you, that neurons exhibit a kind of mechanical memory does not mean their activity is sufficient to account for conscious and unconscious memory. The brain may simply be facilitating memory, much as a tuner facilitates radio reception. It's a fundamental point of logic, and disagreeing with logic is generally not a good idea. \n \n It's odd that you claim neurons are not necessary for memory. Neurons are implicated in all brain activities, including those that facilitate memory. \n \n electrolyte writes:\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by dace\n \"You're referring to P Bateson, whose analysis, as Sheldrake demonstrates, was indeed biased.

By falsely claiming that I propose some kind of conspiracy theory, you can dismiss my views without actually investigating them. Of course, there's no conspiracy. Pervasive bias can be explained by the simple fact that it's easier to go along with established opinion. It goes without saying that the will to conform is antithetical to science. Nonetheless scientists are only human. We all like to be accepted by the majority. \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by dace\n \"But there's no denying that Sheldrake's prediction, on the basis of morphic resonance, was correct.\"\n \n What were the results of the pre-injection runs? What trends did we see in those? How did Sheldrake miraculously come up with other numbers that Rose wasn't privy to? Why did Sheldrake miraculously come up with other numbers that Rose wasn't privy to? There's plenty of denying; can't you read?\n <<<\n \n Let me make this as plain as I can. Rose and Sheldrake got together to perform an experiment on memory in chicks. Each batch of chicks was conditioned to associate pecking yellow LEDs with an unpleasant sensation. Rose predicted that any given batch of chicks would show no difference in pecking behavior relative to prior batches. Sheldrake predicted that once a batch of chicks had been conditioned to be averse to yellow LEDs, subsequent chicks would demonstrate an initial bias against yellow LEDs, and that this bias would increase with each new batch. The result was that subsequent batches of chicks demonstrated a significant initial bias against yellow LEDs. The more batches that were tested, the stronger the bias. This bias was much stronger than what the control group demonstrated. Rose was privy to same numbers as Sheldrake. He just didn't want to admit he got it wrong. \n \n However, that Sheldrake's prediction was correct doesn't mean that memory operates holistically on the basis of similarity. It only means exactly what I said it means, that Sheldrake's prediction was correct. Perhaps there was something wrong with the experiment. What we really need is replications. We need more experiments along these lines. \n \n Since you and Symbiote don't seem to grasp the issues at stake here, let me try to bring you up to speed. Biology is in a state of crisis. It was long believed that organisms are \"reducible\" to genes (and the complex of proteins that accompany genes). But this notion was predicated on the idea that genes are simple units of information whose expression automatically results in organisms. Now it turns out that genes are not simple at all. The genome undergoes incredibly complex operations, so complex that they are beyond computation. Thus, instead of reducing something complex to something simple, we are reducing something complex to something else complex. The entire basis of genetic reduction has been swept away. We no longer have a viable theory of development from the egg. \n \n But there's a much deeper problem to reductionist biology. In order to have a science of life, we must be able to account for such factors as conscious self-existence, the unconscious mind, purpose, intelligence, feeling, experience, etc. Instead, reductionism posits that organisms are machines and that all nonmechanistic features of life are illusory. Yet the mind is self-evident. We begin with a recognition of the mind and from there assume that our perception of physical reality is essentially correct. But the only thing we know for sure is that mind is real. Reductionism was never a sensible or logical approach, so it's no surprise that molecular biology has now rendered it obsolete. It was only a matter of time before the methodology of science exposed the failed philosophy underpinning modern biology. \n \n This is why the notion of holistic memory is significant. If memory is a property of nature, then organisms can inherit morphological and behavioral information directly from their predecessors on the basis of similarity. Rather than being built by genes from the ground up, organisms self-organize on the basis of how their predecessors lived. As the organism develops, each system - - be it chromosome, cell, tissue, organ, organ system or body - - simply mimics what its kind has been doing for eons. \n \n This is crucial in the evolution debate, because it means adaptations do not have to find their way into our genes before they can be passed on. Thus we can return to Darwin's original commonsense view of evolution, according to which organisms make adaptations to their environment and, if successful, pass along those adaptations to offspring. A commonsense view of evolution will have far more strength to withstand creationist attack than the unwieldy theory we've been stuck with since the 30s. \n \n Of course, I've already explained all this in the essay posted at the top of this thread as well as in subsequent posts. I will not be explaining it again. If you and Symbiote are too dogmatic to participate in scientific discussion, that's your problem, not mine.",

I have not committed the fallacy of guilt by association; I'm exposing your reasoning that is basically the no-true-Scotsman fallacy.\n \n \nBy falsely claiming that I propose some kind of conspiracy theory, you can dismiss my views without actually investigating them.\n\n Falsely?

Look, I can read, but my questions weren't answered. As somebody quite educated about science, my questions are topical and substantive, and they demand an answer for a reasonable interpretation of the recountings.\n You say that Rose had the same numbers. Sheldrake said that Rose didn't have the same numbers. Are you knowingly lying, or are you talking out of your XXX because you really don't know?

That's your right. You seem to think that cellular processes happen because similar processes happened in the past. Then why can't humans synthesize vitamin C? Our ancestors could. Why did that trait go away? According to your cockamamie balderdash about morphogenetic fields, a mutation wouldn't effect this, because the correct amino acid would mystically be placed in the correct position. It's not, which is a hurdle that your mystics cannot overcome.\n \n Please go read about Occam's razor; you can come back when you've realized how idiotic it is to take your insistence of incompletion based on ignorance and shoehorn fantasy into cellular biology.

   "That a given gene is needed to induce a given trait in an organism does not mean that this gene (along with the protein it generates) is sufficient to produce the trait. I need a computer to view 4Forums. Does this mean 4Forums is contained within my computer? Of course not.\n\n A fact which can be straightforwardly established by disconnecting your computer from the internet and attempting to access the site. The exact same test would establish that plenty of software is entirely contained within your computer. You claim traits are like internet sites - gene splicing demonstrates that many are not; that 'installing the software' is sufficient.\n \nMy example is simplified for the sake of brevity.\n\n If it were merely simplified, then nothing you omitted or assumed would damage your argument. But since that argument concerned the implausibility of evolution solving such a huge problem in a single step, the example was a worthless contrivance, not a 'simplification' \n \nOf course, the nuts are also evolving, and the macaw has other food sources. The question is how this evolutionary arms race proceeds.\n\n I see. So this is your fallback position when this:\n \nHow many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle.\n \n The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal.\n\n is not allowed to pass unchallenged.\n \nDoes natural selection operate in tandem with random mutation or adaptive mutation?\n\n This is a false dichotomy. Random mutation can be - and is - modulated by previously evolved regulatory systems (mutation-prone plasmids etc). However, the very existence of such physical systems undermines the notion of a holistic intelligence doing the same job. If those physical systems are necessary for evolution, then how did they themselves evolve? The only logical explanation is that such systems are an evolved optimisation - helpful, but not absolutely necessary.\n \nDoes the adaptation need to be expressed at the genetic level, or can somatic changes, through a process of morphogenetic memory, directly influence the forms and instincts of descendants? \n\n Another false dichotomy. Epigenetic inheritance does not require morphogenetic memory - whatever that is.\n \nThe instruction manual for the child seat works precisely because there is an intelligent agent, i.e. you, that interprets it. So this analogy is not helpful to the point you're trying to make. \n\n Of course it is. You don't need intelligence to follow instructions, and you don't need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. \n \n \nWhat really counts is the way genes are used rather than their content. So now we need an instructional manual on how to properly implement the blueprint. If the manual is embedded within the DNA itself, how is the DNA able to read it? Presumably the instructions for reading the manual would also be contained within the manual. Perhaps there's another manual that explains how to read the first manual, and then yet another manual to explain how to read that one, and so on, ad infinitum.\n\n This apparent recursive paradox is the result of a failure of your own imagination.\n \n 1. You do not need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. You merely need a different configuration of existing instructions.\n \n 2. You fail to take into account the active chemical nature of the 'instructions'. If a new gene were a hammer, it could be thought of as a hammer with electrodes in the handle, capable of inducing a muscular spasm to cause itself to be wielded.\n \nLet's take the example of a tornado. One moment there's no tornado, just a massive gradient between warm air on the ground and cool air in the sky. The next thing you know, a tornado has emerged fully formed, seemingly out of nowhere, and begins efficiently wiping out the temperature gradient. It's not as if the tornado emerged from the dust particles of which it is composed or a smaller proto-tornado.\n\n I'm really not sure what you're trying to achieve with this analogy. The concept of a 'tornado' is something we as observers impose upon the collective motions of individual particles. Any problems we might have with the fuzzy distinction between no tornado and tornado are our fault for inventing a discontinuous concept to describe a continuously variable phenomenon.\n \nWhy should the second batch do any better? Unless there's a survival issue involved, the second batch should take exactly as long as the first.\n\n Well, it's your hypothesis so you can make it up as you go along, of course. I merely presumed it would be consistent.\n \nThe most recent test I'm aware of that confirms morphic resonance was carried out by Rupert Sheldrake and Steven Rose on chicks who received food after pecking at LEDs of a particular color. Only those who pecked at the \"correct\" color (yellow) were rewarded. Each batch of chicks, unrelated to the previous batch, learned to peck at the yellow diodes more quickly.\n\n My first concern would be, as others have voiced, that insufficient controls were in place to ensure independence of the trials. Occam's razor suggests that's the more likely explanation, given the utter failure of millions of routine fluctuation tests to yield a similar improvement in results over time.\n \nWhat resonates is the whole form, not the material constituents.\n\n As I anticipated, you speak of conceptual resonance - which merely shuffles the problem around without solving it. How do the material constituents attain the status of 'a concept'? If we abstract a vital nucleotide, why isn't the remaining 'resonance' enough to carry the organism through? It should be, given that many of the 'living' configurations of that organism are far more physically distinct from one another than the one we've engineered by removing the nucleotide. What decides that the trillions of moment-to-moment 'living' configurations of a cell resonate, but not the one where a single genetic base-pair has gone astray?\n \n \nIn contrast to artificial memory, which reduces to stored material configurations, natural memory is holistic, operating on the basis of morphological similarity. I tune into my ancestors because we have a similar overall form, not because we have the same chemical constituents.\n\n Epigenetic inheritance still has traceable, physical mechanisms - not all memory needs to be genetic for it to be represented physically.\n \n As an aside, I would wager you're no more physically similar - at any level beyond the genetic - to your great great grandfather than I am - so why haven't I 'tuned in'?\n \nThus life is fundamentally conservative, continually mimicking its past states, with evolution as the exception that proves the rule.\n\n You do know what 'proves the rule' means, don't you?\n \nWhy posit intelligence at the level of the organism but ban it from the level of the cell?\n\n For the very simple reason that if cells were intelligent animals wouldn't need brains. You may as well ask 'why posit computational power at the level of the computer but ban it from the level of the transistor'.",

   "From Sheldrake's own paper on the subject:\n \nI predicted that there would be a secular trend, with latency of birds exposed to the test stimulus progressively increasing, while the latency with the control stimulus stayed the same. This prediction was correct in that there was a secular trend, but incorrect in that the latency with the control stimulus tended to decrease. I should have worded my prediction more carefully, emphasising that what was important was an increasing difference between the response to test and control stimulus.\n\n Sheldrake predicted that subsequent batches of chicks would learn, via morphic resonance, not to peck the yellow LED. He therefore phrased his prediction accordingly:\n \n\"There is a secular trend; the latency to first peck of the illuminated bead increases by the tenth week, while the latency\n to peck the chrome bead remains unchanged.\"\n\n In other words, he got it exactly wrong. Where it gets interesting is his interpretation of the results. He leaps to the conclusion that there must be some unknown experimental factor which - coincidentally - exactly offsets the accumulating resonant aversion he predicted.\n \n However, he's already noted that experimental factors can affect the two tests (LED and chrome pin) differently:\n \nBoth test and control birds were trained more successfully as time went on; in other words, a higher proportion of the birds pecked at the yellow light or chrome bead within the initial 30s training period. This effect was greatest with the yellow light over the first six days\n\n So when the graph is against Sheldrake, and each successive batch of chicks are actually pecking harder and faster at the yellow LED rather than learning to avoid it, he attributes it to experimental error and blames the physical differences between the chrome pin and the LED stylus. Yet when the graph turns in a way that can be twisted in his favour, suddenly he assumes that the chrome pin and LED stylus are being wielded with equally greater proficiency as time goes by, at a rate which just manages to perfectly hide the morphic resonance effects he believes are occurring.\n \n Aye, right :)",

No; I spoke of particles, in which category I include those of the air, water and all other components of the system. Each of them individually moves under the laws of physics, and the pattern thus formed we call a tornado, when it becomes apparent to our senses. The supposed 'holistic' nature of the system is merely semantic confusion: the application of a binary, on-off term to describe an analog, continuous phenomenon.\n \n In future, if you're going to cherry-pick one point out of a post to use as a smokescreen for your inability to tackle the rest, I recommend you fully understand it first.\n \nIn the case of natural, complex systems, including organisms, the whole is a thing in itself, not just a concept.\n\n Sorry, but I don't see you drawing any useful distinction between 'thing' and 'concept' here. Or 'form' for that matter, which is another term you've used interchangeably.\n \n All these words simply refer to degrees of abstraction. Two bacteria are not similar at all in terms of their moment-to-moment molecular configuration. By ignoring progressively more and more of the detail of that configuration - abstracting from the reality - we can find sweet spots of conceptual similarity: stage of lifecycle, species etc. But that's a function of us as observers, not the 'thing' itself. What you propose is that the universe itself appreciates these anthropological degrees of abstraction.\n \n Unfortunatly the whole notion is incoherent. How can morphic resonance be so specific as to discern between species of bacteria, yet so loose as to equivocate between you and your ancestors? How can subtle mutations - changes in the fine molecular detail - of one organism propagate accurately into the completely different fine molecular detail of another via a resonance which must of necessity ignore such detail in order to occur? It would be like trying to play gamma waves on a violin. Conversely, why don't mutations that substantially alter the gross physical form of the creature 'break' the morphic resonance?\n \n Then there's the 'first time' paradox. If a new form - possessed of a particular novel trait or mutation - can function for the first time without needing to be informed by resonance with past equivalents, then it can work for the second time without resonance, and the third, and every time after that. Morphic resonance can't be needed the first time - thus it is redundant every time.\n \n All in all, it's empirically defunct and a theoretical train-wreck. Now I think I've said it all.",

   "Basically you claim that the brain operates non-deterministically, but that you can't provide a single example of a non-deterministic event that has ever occured in it.\n\n \n The burden of proof is not on me. How can you prove that a single large-scale event in the brain is conditioned by immediately prior events? Of course, in retrospect you can always say that a given event was caused by whatever came right before, but in advance you don't know what will occur. \n \n \nIn fact, when asked to provide an example, you point to a small change deterministically causing a large change, later.\n\n \n The point is that we don't know which tiny event will result in huge consequences down the road. In meteorology, this is known as the butterfly effect. A butterfly flaps its wings, and the weather takes a radically different course than would otherwise have happened. Well, butterflies flap their wings all the time. Which one will trigger a momentous chain of events? We can't say. This is because the weather hasn't been determined in advance. At any given time, many things could happen. Only in retrospect can we trace a definitive causal chain. At the moment it's happening, it's wide open.\n \n Strict determinism died in the 19th century with the onset of Boltzmann's statistical mechanics. Boltzmann established that the behavior of molecules in a gas cannot be accurately predicted. The laws of thermodynamics apply only en mass. Thus the gas as a whole will most likely follow predictable modes of behavior but not the individual molecules composing it. \n \n With the death of strict determinism, a new outlook emerged which was built around \"chance and necessity,\" as Jacques Monod put it. This is fine as far as clouds are concerned, but the behavior of complex systems cannot be explained according to chance at one level of operation and necessity at a higher level. Instead, the system as a whole is probabilistic. All complex systems, whether lifelike or living, are embedded with goals. The goal of a whirlpool is to evacuate water. The goal of a tornado is to equalize temperature between ground and sky. The goal of a bacterium is to consume sugar. If there's more than one way to achieve a goal, then there's no telling which route the system will choose. \n \n Let's say an individual suffers brain damage and loses the ability to speak. The goal of the brain is to restore its lost function. If the damaged area is beyond repair, another brain region will adapt to the task of processing speech. No one can say beforehand which brain region will take on this task. All we can say is that a new speech center will emerge somewhere in the cerebrum. There is no chain of cause and effect that determines precisely what the brain will do. The point is that it has a goal and will use whatever means it has to attain that goal, by whatever route. \n \n A cell operates the same way. No matter what event you point to in a cell, you can only trace the causal chain back so far before hitting a wall of molecular disorder. A cell is essentially a sea of gas on which macromolecules bounce about like buoys. Simple physical and chemical forces do not determine the overall patterns of activity within the cell. Rather, the cell makes use of physical and chemical forces to achieve its ends. \n \n If you wish to prove that the behavior of a cell is physically determined, you must identify a causal chain leading from the actions of genes to large-scale activities such as building membranes, removing waste, distributing ATP, etc. Of course, no one has been able to demonstrate anything close to this. We can identify only very short causal chains in tiny pockets amidst an ocean of chaos. It's the cell as a whole that has causal primacy not its chemical constituents. \n \n \nPS you still haven't explained how you tune into your ancestors, is this psychic tuning the same power that allows people to bend forks with their mind?\n\n \n Ah, a trick question. I'm not aware of any evidence for \"telekinesis.\" As to natural memory, I've explained it many times. We are all at all times influenced by our past behaviors as well as those of any past, similar organism, presumably though not necessarily ancestral. \n \n A current organism resonates with a past organism on the basis of similar morphology. In essence, this is no different than saying an antenna resonates with a transmitter on the basis of similar frequency. We have no direct evidence of electromagnetic fields but can certainly deduce their existence given the fact of radio. So to, we have no direct evidence of morphogenetic fields, but we can deduce their existence given the fact of memory. Since organisms behave in particular, stereotypical ways in the absence of deterministic forces compelling these behaviors, we can surmise that they are influenced by past, similar modes of activity. \n \n Whereas electromagnetic fields are deterministic, morphogenetic fields are probabilistic. An organism has many options at any one time. It will probably do what it has done in the past but not necessarily. Otherwise, there would be no novelty and no evolution.\n \n Bottom line: causation is deterministic when it stems from the immediate past and probabilistic when it stems from the deep past.",

   "But since that argument concerned the implausibility of evolution solving such a huge problem in a single step, the example was a worthless contrivance, not a 'simplification'\n \n \n Not evolution per se but an evolution which relies on natural selection combined with random mutation. And I never said anything about a single step. It's implausible that random mutation would provide the necessary solution in any reasonable amount of time. But let's say the macaw and the tough nut is the one example in which a random mutation did the job. What about all the other millions upon millions of similar examples? Every organism on earth is suited to its environment in numerous ways. Are we to explain every one of these traits in every one of these creatures by an astronomically improbable mutation?\n \n This doesn't mean, of course, that we must invoke a supernatural intelligence to account for life in its manifold varieties. All we need is to identify a method by which the adaptations resulting from the natural intelligence of organisms can be transmitted to descendants. There are two possibilities. One is adaptive mutation, implying cellular intelligence, while the other is holistic, species-wide memory, allowing adaptations of organisms to be picked up by their descendants without the need for genetic transmission. It may be that both of these scenarios are correct. Certainly, once we admit to the existence of intelligence at the level of the whole organism, we cannot deny the possibility that it exists at lower levels of structure, right down to the cell. If a bacterium can make intelligent decisions, so can our cells. The brain is merely a vehicle of intelligence. There are other possible vehicles. So too, the genome is a vehicle of species memory, but there are other possible vehicles. \n \n \nRandom mutation can be - and is - modulated by previously evolved regulatory systems (mutation-prone plasmids etc). However, the very existence of such physical systems undermines the notion of a holistic intelligence doing the same job.\n\n \n According to Walter Elsasser, memory runs on two tracks, genetic and holistic. If it's strictly genetic, why do organisms reveal the same general patterns of their predecessors while exhibiting wildly varying individuality in their chemical makeup? It doesn't make sense. There's got to be a holistic aspect of development. Couple that with the undeniable fact of our own self-existence as conscious minds, and ideological reductionism starts looking weak at best. \n \n \nWell, it's your hypothesis so you can make it up as you go along, of course. I merely presumed it would be consistent.\n\n \n No inconsistency. If there's no imperative to act more quickly, there's no reason why a second batch would complete faster than the first. \n \n Oh, and it's not my hypothesis. First of all, the notion of holistic memory, otherwise known as morphic resonance, goes back to 1981, when Elsasser proposed it in the Journal of Theoretical Biology and Sheldrake independently proposed it in his book, A New Science of Life. Moreover, holistic biology in general has a lineage going back 200 years, and yes, it includes Charles Darwin (though not his chief popularizer, TH Huxley). \n \n Holistic and reductionist biology are like the tightly coiled strands of DNA. They've always both been present and always will be. After all, even with the recognition of the fundamentally holistic nature of life, we must still recognize that many processes in organisms can be reduced to simpler, more mechanical processes. \n \n \nYou do know what 'proves the rule' means, don't you?\n\n \n Yeah, do you? \n \n When you say \"the exception that proves the rule,\" it means yes, there's an exception, but the rule is still essentially correct. Life is mostly conservative, but where an opportunity for something better arises, it can radicalize real fast, hence punctuated equilibrium.",

   "How can morphic resonance be so specific as to discern between species of bacteria, yet so loose as to equivocate between you and your ancestors?\n\n \n Morphic resonance neither discerns nor equivocates. A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form. \n \n \nHow can subtle mutations - changes in the fine molecular detail - of one organism propagate accurately into the completely different fine molecular detail of another via a resonance which must of necessity ignore such detail in order to occur? It would be like trying to play gamma waves on a violin. \n\n \n Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate. So, for instance, during development liver cells form by mimicking the development of prior liver cells, not on the basis of genetic information. In their details, the cells will be quite different. Only in their overall pattern of activity are they the same.\n \n \nConversely, why don't mutations that substantially alter the gross physical form of the creature 'break' the morphic resonance?\n\n \n Who says they don't? It's called speciation. A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species. \n \n \nThen there's the 'first time' paradox. If a new form - possessed of a particular novel trait or mutation - can function for the first time without needing to be informed by resonance with past equivalents, then it can work for the second time without resonance, and the third, and every time after that. Morphic resonance can't be needed the first time - thus it is redundant every time.\n\n \n The mystery is not how an organism does something novel. The mystery is how it knows to do things exactly the same way their ancestors did. This includes development from the egg. How does a fish embryo know to hold onto its gills while a primate embryo knows they're just a stage? \n \n An organism can certainly engage in something novel once. But for it to keep doing it and for its descendants to keep doing it just the same way, there has to be a kind of memory. It can be particulate, as in DNA, or it can be holistic, which is harder to understand because it's not tangible.

You need to re-examine the paper because it does not say what you're claiming it says.

There's no other reason why they would do it more often, since they weren't rewarded for it.\n \n If you've been going around the net claiming that these batches of birds showed an increased aversion to pecking the yellow LED, you have a lot of apologising to do.",

In reality there were many, many potential evolutionary avenues, and many, many ways in which each avenue could be followed.\n \nThere are two possibilities.

Only general forms propagate.\n\n Again, inconsistent. If you're right and only 'general forms' propagate thus, Sheldrake was completely wasting his time testing those chicks - the tiny neurological differences present in a yellow LED-averse chick could never propagate via morphic resonance into another chick. Even if you claim the differences were not neurological, the same logic applies: for a chick's mind to 'resonate' with those of its predecessors all the fine detail would need to be smoothed over - a 'thought' as fine grained as 'don't peck the yellow LED' could never propagate.\n \nWho says they don't?

Why do developing organisms recap, to a degree, their phylogenetic history? This is a total mystery to reductionist biology, as I discuss in my paper, which was posted at the top of this thread:\n \n \"Darwin saw in embryonic recapitulation proof positive that life is evolutionary. Since natural selection operates on adaptations made by creatures after they've left the womb, it's to be expected that juvenile and adult forms will vary over time while embryos remain roughly the same, echoing ancestral heritage. But for neo-Darwinism, which transfers the source of adaptations from life experiences to genetic mutations, recapitulation is a huge problem. Embryos are just as vulnerable to genetic accidents as adults. Mutations that streamline embryogenesis - thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation - ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Can't we just bypass all that and go directly to human form? The persistence of recapitulation in utero signifies that inheritance results not so much from ever-malleable genes but species-wide memory of a past that cannot be altered.\"\n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace: \n \"An organism can certainly engage in something novel once.

And my point remains the same: if you wish to deny the existence of human freedom, you must demonstrate that everything that happens in the brain is determined by prior physical events.\n \n It's interesting that you have a tag that links to a video on Ron Paul:\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bCRc2ub8hU - Rap track of the decade.\n \n So, we do agree on something after all. Ron Paul is a libertarian. Though I'm more of a left-libertarian, I greatly admire Paul. Libertarian social philosophy is predicated on the existence of freedom. If we're all essentially machines whose actions are determined by physics, we might as well be slaves. If we're enslaved to physics, what difference does it make if we also happen to be enslaved to a corporation or the White House? The die has already been cast. \n \n This illustrates a basic problem in mechanistic thought, going all the way back to Galileo, Descartes and Newton. Since reductionism denies everything human, including mind, feeling, consciousness, free will, etc, we're left with a schism of thought. On the one hand, we have mechanistic reductionism, falsely known as \"science,\" and on the other hand, we have our human lives, including, mind, feeling, consciousness, free will, etc. The dominant philosophy of modernity is incoherent.

   "This is an argument in favor of intelligent design, not evolution.\n\n How is a demonstration that selection is effective an argument in favor of intelligent design? \n \n \nFallacy of abuse.\n\n Stating that you haven't made your case is not abuse.\n \n \nGeneral patterns include the whole form of the organism, the forms of of its organs and organ systems, its tissue types and its patterns of instinctive behavior.\n\n \"'General patterns' include whole form, other forms, and patterns.\"\n Do you see yet why nobody believes you know jack about science? Can't you explain what the hell you mean?\n \n \nGeneral patterns include anything beyond mere chemistry.\n\n And what is \"beyond mere chemistry\"?\n \n \nChemical details vary enormously within strictly regulated general patterns of activity. This is proof in and of itself that organisms are fundamentally holistic, meaning that the whole has causal primacy over the particular.\n\n This is proof of nothing. Collision theory says that two reactants may collide with sufficient energy and still not react. This is no reason to believe that there must be some mystical factor that results in correct orientation.\n Do you have any experience in a chemistry lab? a chemistry class? Do you understand that non-identical systems often react in extremely similar ways?\n \n \n \nIt is only assumed that general forms are inherited via genes.\n\n As Peeling already explained to you: no, it's not only assumed. (Unless you're still appealing to some cockamamie idea of \"forms,\") We have sufficient evidence from gene splicing experiments -- I've done some, have you ever done one? -- to know that traits are carried by genes.\n \n \nNot only has it never been proven,\n\n What hasn't been proven? Some idea reliant upon your fantasy of \"forms\"?\n \n \n \nSpeciation is explained by evolution, not genetics.\n\n Let's recap:Peeling said: Conversely, why don't mutations that substantially alter the gross physical form of the creature 'break' the morphic resonance?\n \n dace replied: Who says they don't? It's called speciation. A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species.\n \n I said: [Speciation] is explained by genetics.This is directly referring to what Peeling asked about and what you tried to answer. Mutations are capable of causing these changes; you don't even deny it. But you insist upon applying an unnecessary piece in order to come up with your explanation. Hence your need for an Ockham shave.\n \n \nGenetics has absolutely nothing to say on the matter of why ontogeny (roughly) recapitulates phylogeny.\n\n Well, I can't get through to you when you're stuck on your blantant lies.\n \n \n[quoting his own paper] Can't we just bypass all that and go directly to human form?\n\n And that's what we'd expect if the whole morphic resonance hogwash had any validity. Instead, we still contain much of the genetic programming for ancestral traits. (You haven't heard of toothed mutant chickens?) This is what we'd expect from Darwinian evolution. So, not only is pseudo-recapitulation not the problem for Darwinian evolution as you say (lie) it is, and not only does it support Darwinian evolutionary theory, it is a contradiction of what we'd expect if morphic resonance had any effect.\n \n \nBy contrast, Sheldrake's holistic model sweeps away all these mechanisms and replaces them with one: morphic resonance.\n\n You mean replaces with magic. Ockham isn't working against me because we have the simple pieces already. You are introducing something foreign to our understanding despite lack of evidence. Sheldrake's had his XXX kicked, both by the analysts and by our very own Peeling (to whom you haven't responded, at least yet).\n \n \nThe cell knows how to distribute proteins because it directly \"remembers\" how it has done so in the past.\n\n So when we induce a mutation or two in the targeting regions of these proteins, the proteins still get delivered at the same rate and accuracy?

Perhaps you thought that with the phrase \"at the perfect time\" I was referring to a particular moment within an individual's lifetime. What I meant was simply a time when the mutation would have done some good for the species. Macaw's weren't always in a place where they could capitalize on their newfound jaw strength. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"It's implausible that random mutation would provide the necessary solution in any reasonable amount of time. But let's say the macaw and the tough nut is the one example in which a random mutation did the job. What about all the other millions upon millions of similar examples? Every organism on earth is suited to its environment in numerous ways. Are we to explain every one of these traits in every one of these creatures by an astronomically improbable mutation?\"\n \n As others have pointed out, you're making the false assumption that the survival traits organisms developed were the only ones possible, and furthermore that they had to hit upon the precise mutation or recombination they did in order to realise those traits. In reality there were many, many potential evolutionary avenues, and many, many ways in which each avenue could be followed.\n\n \n Who says I assumed anything? Naturally, there are many possible evolutionary routes, and if another route were taken, it would be just as implausible as the one that actually was taken. Point being that no matter how an organism adapts, random mutation is a very unlikely source. The only reason it's assumed to be the basis of novel forms and instincts is that theorists all the way back to August Weismann have been unable to imagine any other possibility, precisely the problem with creationism, whose advocates simply lack the vision to recognize that life could appear in its many forms without divine input. \n \n But now there's no longer any reason to make this assumption. Weismann's whole outlook was based on the idea that the organism in all its complexity can be reduced to a simple \"germ-plasm,\" which we now know as DNA. Well, it turns out it's not the genes themselves which count but how they're operated, and their operation is incalculably complex. So there's no longer any basis for genetic reductionism, no longer a reduction from something complex to something simple. As such, there's no reason to assume that all biological inheritance comes through genes. Holistic inheritance has been thrust onto us whether we like it or not. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace: \n \"There are two possibilities. One is adaptive mutation, implying cellular intelligence, while the other is holistic, species-wide memory, allowing adaptations of organisms to be picked up by their descendants without the need for genetic transmission. It may be that both of these scenarios are correct.\"\n \n Or neither - and since you have no evidence for either, that seems the most likely option.\n\n \n Oh, yeah? Aside from such well-known phenomena as atavism, parallel evolution and embryonic recapitulation, none of which can be explained without recourse to holistic memory, we also have evidence from chemistry, adaptive mutation in cell cultures (Miroslav Hill), transferal of plants to different environments, the frequency of phenocopies, the transmission of aversion (Sheldrake and Rose), the evolution of animal behavior, and collective human memory. \n \n The evidence from chemistry concerns changing melting points. Each chemical substance has a particular temperature at which it melts. Morphic resonance predicts that melting points of long-established chemicals will not change noticeably, while recent, man-made chemicals will change significantly. This is because what keeps the melting points the same for perennial chemicals is not some abstract, timeless law of physics but simply the force of memory acting on the crystals. \n \n Sheldrake's prediction has been verified among numerous man-made chemicals. This is taken from the appendix of the new edition of A New Science of Life: \"For example, saccharin, the oldest artificial sweetener, was first synthesized in 1878. In 1902, its melting point was 220 Celsuis. By 1996 it was 229 C, a 9 degree increase. Phenolphthalein, used in chemistry laboratories to indicate when substances are acid or alkali, was first made in 1880. In 1907 its melting point was 252 C; in 1989 it was 262 C, a 10 degree increase. The crown ethers are a family of crown-shaped molecules used as chelating agents, first synthesized in 1976. The most widely-used member of the family, 18-crown-6, started off with a melting point of 390 C. By 1989, it was 450 C, a 60 degree increase.\" He gives many more examples and notes the well known fact that such increases don't occur with long-established chemicals. He goes on to note that when aragonite-type crystals are heated into calcite, the original aragonite structure mysteriously reappears when the calcite is cooled down, leading researchers to invoke a \"memory effect.\" \n \n Transplanting to different climates: In The Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication, Darwin noted that wheat and barley quickly adapt to different climates, whether hotter or colder, and pass on these adaptations to their offspring. No need to wait around for a million or two years for just the right mutation. \n \n Phenocopies: In the 50s, CH Waddington found that after exposing drosophila eggs to ether, many developed four wings instead of two. After 29 generations, many unexposed fruit flies also showed the phenotypic mutation. He called this genetic assimilation, meaning that the genes had assimilated the change. Decades later, Mae-wan Ho found she needed only ten generations of exposure before subsequent unexposed generations showed large numbers with the alteration. What demonstrates morphic resonance is that phenocopies began showing up frequently in control flies once enough exposed flies demonstrated the mutation. In the case of control flies, there was no possibility of genetic transmission. \n \n Animal evolution: Morphic resonance was demonstrated before and after World War II by birds that learned to open milk bottles in Western Europe. Known in England as blue tits, their ability to open bottles and steal the cream at the top spread locally and then suddenly began popping up in several far-flung locales far beyond their flight range. In contrast to the apocryphal 100th monkey story, this one is thoroughly documented. Another well-documented case concerns cattle whose movements had long been controlled by expensive cattle guards. Eventually ranchers found they could save money by simply painting a fake cattle guard onto the ground. The cows reacted the same way to the fake ones, demonstrating that their fear of cattle guards had become instinctive in only a few generations. Again, no need to wait for that magic mutation. British and Swiss newspapers have confirmed the same phenomenon among sheep. \n \n Human memory: Sheldrake conducted a test on collective human memory with Japanese nursery rhymes. Test subjects were asked to remember real lines mixed in with made up lines that closely resembled the real ones. Test subjects fared far better at remembering real lines. Several other experiments conducted independently by psychologists on collective human memory have produced the same results. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"Certainly, once we admit to the existence of intelligence at the level of the whole organism, we cannot deny the possibility that it exists at lower levels of structure, right down to the cell.\"\n \n Computational power at the level of the computer does not imply it at the level of the transistor.\n\n \n This is a common error in logic wherein \"some\" is confused with \"all.\" That you have an example in which a property at the level of the whole is not present at the level of one of its parts does not mean that in all cases a property at the level of the whole will not be found at the level of the part.\n \n In order to prove your point, you need to actually demonstrate that brains are necessary for intelligence, that intelligence cannot exist in any other form. This is of course an impossible task. Very had to prove a negative. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"According to Walter Elsasser, memory runs on two tracks, genetic and holistic. If it's strictly genetic, why do organisms reveal the same general patterns of their predecessors while exhibiting wildly varying individuality in their chemical makeup?\"\n \n Such as...?\n\n \n Such as literally every single fluid in the body. Blood, saliva, bile, mucus, you name it. Every single one. They're all like that. They all reveal huge chemical variation from person to person, including genetically identical twins. Same genes, different chemistry. How does a reductionist explain that? \n \n \nI can only conclude you haven't the first clue what a fluctuation test is, if you think it doesn't induce a survival imperative.\n\n \n Hey, if you've got a refutation of morphic resonance based on fluctuation tests, I'd love to hear it. But you need to explain it in detail. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"When you say 'the exception that proves the rule,' it means yes, there's an exception, but the rule is still essentially correct.\"\n \n That's what I thought you thought it meant. There are two interpretations that make sense, and that isn't either of them.\n \n One interpretation is that 'proves' was used to mean 'tests'. Black swans are the exception that proves the rule 'all swans are white'. Similar to \"the proof of the pudding is in the eating\".\n \n Ultimately, however, the phrase is a legal one, and applies to the valid inference of a rule from a stated exception. A sign saying \"50% off today!\" implies that as a rule the price is double what it is today. If in fact the vendor only doubled his prices one day a year, he could be guilty of false advertising. Going back to the swans: observing a black swan does not validate the rule that 'all swans are white'. Rather, the statement \"This swan is black\" allows us to infer (proves) the rule that not all swans are black.\n\n \n Great. Now you've taught me something too.",

This is a total mystery to reductionist biology, as I discuss in my paper\n \n <snip<\n \n Mutations that streamline embryogenesis - thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation - ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Can't we just bypass all that and go directly to human form?\n\n As it turns out, genetics has everything to say on this subject. It positively predicts O.R.P.\n \n The logic is simple: at any given point in the embryonic developmental process, what happens next is a transformation of what is already there. It's like a set of directions to a destination: first left, straight on for two miles, turn right, etc.\n \n Let's imagine we have a set of directions that takes us from 'zygote' to 'fish', and let's also imagine the formation of a swim bladder occurs fairly early on in those directions. Now imagine we experience a series of mutations that changes our ultimate destination - now our directions take us from 'zygote' to 'amphibian'. But we're still going via 'swimbladder', so we still end up with one.\n \n Can a further mutation eliminate the formation of the swim bladder? Not if the creature's mutated genes only tell it how to get to 'amphibian' from 'embryo with swim bladder'. You would need an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations: eliminating the swim bladder and rewriting all the subsequent developmental process to still reach a viable end product, all in a single step.\n \n Once the developmental dependency stage has passed, however, the otherwise useless swim-bladder (or tail, say) can be subject to atrophy and reabsorption. Mutations which cause this will be beneficial and selected for.\n \n In short, then, genetics predicts we should see a spectrum of such features in embryonic development: features upon which no subsequent development critically depends that have disappeared entirely, features which appear during development, hang around long enough for the processes that depend upon them to complete, and then get reabsorbed, and features which, though useless in themselves, are so integral to the subsequent developmental processes that they cannot be mutated away.",

Fulfilling all necessary conditions for the hypothesis does not make the truth of the hypothesis deductively sufficient. Instead, what happens is that the hypothesis will offer a series of deductions, and if none of a giant list of necessary conditions is ever contradicted, then the conclusions can safely follow probably, or inductively.\n \n Stop lingering on meaningless concepts like \"proof\" in science. As Francis Bacon noted centuries ago, logical deduction is a chain that prohibits science from advancing. Our newfound reliance on inductive reasoning is what allowed the scientific enlightenment.\n \n \n Getting back to the point now: What this means is that you are wrong. Induction often allows \"some\" to be extrapolated to \"all.\" Hence, the scientific process itself allows \"some\" to be extrapolated to \"all.\" It is by no means necessary to demonstrate that intelligence cannot exist on any other level except in brains.

A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form.\"\n \n To retrieve past organic form on the basis of similarity, it must discern between the non-similar and equivocate the similar.\n\n \n That's like saying for a receiver to pick up a signal from a transmitter, it must discern between non-similar frequencies and equivocate similar frequencies. You're anthropomorphizing, a common mistake among reductionists, who claim that DNA is like a book and the body a machine. Reductionism is in fact a modern form of anthropomorphosis, projecting our technological mindset onto nature much as Paley did 200 years ago. \n \n There's nothing remotely like intelligence in morphic resonance or any other kind of resonance. This is not to deny the possibility of nonhuman intelligence, only that morphic resonance is about memory, not intelligence.\n \n \nThe trouble is, you have no consistent definition of 'similar'. Two seperate species of bacteria are far more similar to each other than you are to your immediate ancestor. So I ask again: how can morphic resonance be at the same time so discerning as to only equivocate between bacteria of the same species, yet so loose as to permit resonance between you and your mother?\n\n \n What matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences. If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate.\"\n \n Again, inconsistent. If you're right and only 'general forms' propagate thus, Sheldrake was completely wasting his time testing those chicks - the tiny neurological differences present in a yellow LED-averse chick could never propagate via morphic resonance into another chick.\n\n \n Nature doesn't discriminate against the very small. What the experiment seemed to show is that changes in neural resting states propagated to subsequently tested chicks via morphic resonance.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by dace:\n \"A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species.\"\n \n Which throws another spanner into your works. According to you, morphic resonance tells an organism what shape to be. But the novel trait that has made this population a new species only informs a small part of that organism's form, yes? A longer neck, webbed toes, whatever. But now the resonance with the ancestral species is broken, what tells the rest of the organism what shape to be?\n\n \n Each pool of memory is a subset of a larger pool. Perhaps a better metaphor would be the parts of a tree. The trunk is the set of memory shared by all living things. One of the boughs emerging from the trunk is the set of memory shared by all animals. Out of this bough comes the limb of mammalian memory, and out of this limb comes the branch of primate memory, and out of this branch comes the shoot of hominid memory, and out of this shoot comes the twig of Homo sapiens memory. We still draw from all the prior branches, all the way down to the trunk. \n \n \nEpigenetic inheritance is integral - that's why you can't grow a baby in a test-tube: you need the biological systems of the mother - and essential nutrients, the production of which is inherited in different species entirely - to regulate and cooperate in its development. Life has grown into a tangled web indeed, but we don't need morphic resonance to explain it.\n\n \n Unless developmental information is inherited via nongenetic material in the cell, this point is neither here nor there. \n \n Thank you for your thoughtful questions and comments.

This is because what keeps the melting points the same for perennial chemicals is not some abstract, timeless law of physics but simply the force of memory acting on the crystals.\n\n You should know better than to discuss biochemistry and chemistry with somebody who has a degree in biochemistry and teaches chemistry. (But then, you should know a lot of things that you don't.) The temperature of phase changes are determined by the strengths of the intermolecular forces of a substance. The melting point of a pure substance is the temperature at which the average particle has sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that prevent that particle from moving within the lattice structure of the solid.\n We expect the apparent melting points of substances to change as we get better at producing the substance with fewer contaminants and in a more stable arrangement of molecules. Amorphous silicon dioxide has a melting point different than crystalline silicon dioxide's due to the optimized intermolecular forces within the crystalline structure. If melting points were based on the \"force of memory\" on the \"crystals,\" you'd be able to take crystalline SiO2, melt it, cool it quickly, and then heat it to that same melting temperature before it melts. You won't. Cooling it quickly results in irregular arrangement of the covalent network, which reduces the melting point. See glass transition.\n Add to this the fact that introducing impurities into substances lowers their melting points (a colligative property with the technical name that even you can understand: freezing point depression), and the increases that we see make sense without invoking magical molecular memory.\n \n \nHe gives many more examples and notes the well known fact that such increases don't occur with long-established chemicals.\n\n You mean chemicals for which we've had good purification techniques for as long as we've had accurate and precise temperature measurement techniques?

How does a reductionist explain that?\n\n But they're not \"wildly variable.\" Blood is blood, bile is bile, and you don't find bile picking up on the vibes from blood and deciding to haul around some oxygen for a while. I already told you that similar reactions can occur even with different substances; why do you think that my blood -- which is nearly identical to your blood -- wouldn't react the same way to carbon dioxide without magical memory? If I construct a heme group complete with iron from scratch, do you think it wouldn't bind oxygen because it hasn't been exposed to my blood's magical memory?",

   "That's like saying for a receiver to pick up a signal from a transmitter, it must discern between non-similar frequencies and equivocate similar frequencies.\n\n ...yes, I suppose it is, because that's what it does. Function does not imply intelligence.\n \nYou're anthropomorphizing,\n\n No, I'm not. You are engaging in semantic quibbling, a pursuit you will have to undertake solo, I fear, since I have no patience for it.\n \nWhat matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences. If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention.\n\n I couldn't make much sense of that at first, but I eventually decided what you must have meant is that the degree of similarity relative to the potential scope for difference between two things is what counts. So two bacteria, which can differ to a lesser extent than two humans, enjoy a more sharply focused morphic resonance.\n \n Superficially that sounds reasonable, but in reality it's deeply flawed. If you ask me how different two creatures could be, why should I assume you mean 'while both still being bacteria'? Why isn't the scope species, genera, the whole scope of life itself? And given that we classify creatures as bacteria based on their similarity in the first place, what possible answer has the question \"How different could those two creatures be while still being similar?\" It's circular nonsense.\n \nNature doesn't discriminate against the very small. What the experiment seemed to show is that changes in neural resting states propagated to subsequently tested chicks via morphic resonance.\n\n It showed no such thing, because the batches of chicks never demonstrated any increased aversion to the yellow LED. Again, I urge you to reread the paper more carefully.\n \nEach pool of memory is a subset of a larger pool. Perhaps a better metaphor would be the parts of a tree. The trunk is the set of memory shared by all living things. One of the boughs emerging from the trunk is the set of memory shared by all animals. Out of this bough comes the limb of mammalian memory, and out of this limb comes the branch of primate memory, and out of this branch comes the shoot of hominid memory, and out of this shoot comes the twig of Homo sapiens memory. We still draw from all the prior branches, all the way down to the trunk.\n\n Well, yes - that's genetics for you. \n \nUnless developmental information is inherited via nongenetic material in the cell, this point is neither here nor there.\n\n The point is very much here and there. To give birth to a healthy baby a mother must consume certain nutrients, nutrients produced by other species. The 'information' concerning the synthesis of those nutrients is entirely exogenous to the human race.",

   "As it turns out, genetics has everything to say on this subject. It positively predicts O.R.P.\n \n The logic is simple: at any given point in the embryonic developmental process, what happens next is a transformation of what is already there. It's like a set of directions to a destination: first left, straight on for two miles, turn right, etc.\n \n Let's imagine we have a set of directions that takes us from 'zygote' to 'fish', and let's also imagine the formation of a swim bladder occurs fairly early on in those directions. Now imagine we experience a series of mutations that changes our ultimate destination - now our directions take us from 'zygote' to 'amphibian'. But we're still going via 'swimbladder', so we still end up with one.\n \n Can a further mutation eliminate the formation of the swim bladder? Not if the creature's mutated genes only tell it how to get to 'amphibian' from 'embryo with swim bladder'. You would need an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations: eliminating the swim bladder and rewriting all the subsequent developmental process to still reach a viable end product, all in a single step.\n \n Once the developmental dependency stage has passed, however, the otherwise useless swim-bladder (or tail, say) can be subject to atrophy and reabsorption. Mutations which cause this will be beneficial and selected for.\n \n In short, then, genetics predicts we should see a spectrum of such features in embryonic development: features upon which no subsequent development critically depends that have disappeared entirely, features which appear during development, hang around long enough for the processes that depend upon them to complete, and then get reabsorbed, and features which, though useless in themselves, are so integral to the subsequent developmental processes that they cannot be mutated away.\n\n \n You make a good argument. However, the idea that eliminating phylogenetic recapitulation in the womb would require \"an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations\" sounds suspiciously like Michael Behe's claim that a complex system such as the eye could not possibly have evolved in a single step. In fact, the eye did not have to evolve in a single step. Its various elements could have played useful roles before the organ as a whole coalesced. Nor do I buy the argument that a swimbladder or gills or any of that other fishy stuff is so integral to embryonic development that multiple simultaneous mutations would be required to streamline it out of the picture. \n \n I'm with Darwin on this one. What drives novelty in behavior and body is primarily the adaptations made by organisms themselves in response to the outer environment and only secondarily the \"spontaneous variations\" in \"germ-plasm\" buried deep in their cells. The reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb. Thus the occasional random genetic mutation might cause some streamlining, but otherwise embryogenesis stays the same. Darwin's explanation strikes me as more elegant and compelling than the predictably unwieldy neo-Darwinian explanation. \n \n By the way, you've anthropomorphized twice in your post, once with the use of the term, \"rewriting,\" implying that DNA is something like a \"book of life\" or \"recipe,\" and also with your use of the concept of directions, implying that DNA is essentially a map of development. If so, then there must be a reader or interpreter of this book/recipe/map, which brings us back to the homunculus. Now, I realize perhaps you're just stating it this way for the sake of clarity. Still, I have to wonder if all this habitual anthropomorphizing colors our perception of biological processes.",

   "Proof doesn't exist in science. I'm surprised someone at your level is even confusing the deductive logic used in philosophy with the inductions drawn in science. \n \n Science works like this:\n \n Hypothesis: The data shows A. It appears as though B is true.\n Prediction*: If B is true, then we should not observe C and/or we should observe D.\n Conclusion**: We did not observe C and/or we did observe D. Therefore, B is probably true.\n \n *As you can see, the prediction is the only section of the scientific process that ever relies on deductive logic. Modus tollens is the most common operation here, in that it's often a necessary condition of the hypothesis that certain data does not appear, because if that data does appear, it contradicts the hypothesis and shows it to be false.\n \n **You will also note that the conclusion is deductively flawed. Fulfilling all necessary conditions for the hypothesis does not make the truth of the hypothesis deductively sufficient. Instead, what happens is that the hypothesis will offer a series of deductions, and if none of a giant list of necessary conditions is ever contradicted, then the conclusions can safely follow probably, or inductively.\n \n Stop lingering on meaningless concepts like \"proof\" in science. As Francis Bacon noted centuries ago, logical deduction is a chain that prohibits science from advancing. Our newfound reliance on inductive reasoning is what allowed the scientific enlightenment.\n \n Getting back to the point now: What this means is that you are wrong. Induction often allows \"some\" to be extrapolated to \"all.\" Hence, the scientific process itself allows \"some\" to be extrapolated to \"all.\" It is by no means necessary to demonstrate that intelligence cannot exist on any other level except in brains. As far as the science goes, you're the one with the burden of proof here.\n\n \n Keep in mind that the issue here is whether intelligence can exist at the cellular level. My point was that once you allow for the concept of intelligence at any biological level, the door has been opened for it to be applied at any other level. The only way to negate this view is to somehow prove that brains are necessary for intelligence, an impossible task. So my point stands. \n \n My view of how science works is a little different than yours. While studying an anomaly, you get in intuition as to how the problem might be solved. You state your intuition in the form of a hypothesis that can be tested either against historical data or new data generated through experimentation. The test can either provisionally verify your hypothesis or definitively falsify it. There is thus no positive proof, only negative proof. \n \n Proof is a mathematical concept. It was smuggled into science back in the days when science was little more than highly abstract mathematical physics. For Galileo, Descartes and Newton, it's all in the equations. Newton was a modern day Plato, except that instead of positing timeless, immaterial Forms that correspond to every intelligible material form, Newton posited equally timeless, immaterial Laws whose operations on matter bring on the familiar forms of material existence. Either way, you have a dualistic worldview in which physics is divided between passive matter on the one hand and deterministic laws on the other. The proof, it was thought, was in the math. \n \n Over time, many discoveries have abolished the modified Platonism of early science. With the convertability of matter and energy, we can no longer accept the notion of a purely passive matter being operated on by timeless \"laws.\" Instead what we have is process and complexity. There's neither a Form of \"tornado\" nor a set of laws that compel the \"tornado\" to come into existence. A tornado is a self-organized system that spontaneously emerges in the process of the separation of cold and warm air. Like an organism, tornadoes do not defy physical laws, but neither are they explained by these laws. Moreover, natural laws seem to be time-based, not descended from some eternal heavenly realm. There are no laws of motion without motion and no motion without time. It now appears that the so-called fundamental constants of nature can alter over time. For instance, the alpha constant, the electromagnetic force that holds matter together, seems to have altered over the course of cosmic evolution. Evolution itself is a strictly time-based concept and implies genuine novelty in the universe. \n \n The idea that the laws of physics are more like habits, meaning that they can evolve over time, was first proposed by Darwin's contemporary, the American philosopher CS Peirce. Since then, there's been a kind of culture war pitting those who accept the new \"holistic\" science based on time, process and evolution against those who cling to the \"reductionst\" science based on passive matter under the weight of deterministic law. Given that all the evidence is in favor of process science, the only explanation for the reactionary tendency is a psychological one. Reductionism used to be known as the \"grand doctrine\" (GD) because, at least in theory, it provided an explanation for all quantifiable phenomena. Thus he who understands the GD is, in essence, master of the universe. \n \n Proponents of the GD cling to their model because it gives them a sense of authority. It's no accident that the GD is a direct descendant of mechanistic theology. Newton believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver. God created the universe and gave it the laws that have determined every event that has transpired since. The worldview of the GD is identical to this except that God has been airbrushed out. That the laws are now blind doesn't make them any less deterministic. With or without God, you've got a universe in which everything is completely under control, and true novelty is disallowed. Once we completely understand these laws, we are safe from surprises. By applying our knowledge of the laws, we merge with cosmic Authority. \n \n It's because the GD is based not on reason but on fear of uncertainty and the need for control that its proponents lash out hysterically against anyone who calls into question their blinkered worldview. Electrolyte is literally hysterical. He cannot even begin to engage, as Peeling has done, with my arguments. All he can do is misconstrue my words, denounce my mental state, and assert his fear-based assumptions as fact. For electrolyte, the point of being a scientist is not to understand nature but to establish himself as an authority figure. As the Authority, his word is sacrosanct. He speaks with the voice of nature itself. No matter how at odds with the facts, his words are true simply because he has uttered them. \n \n To take but one example, electrolyte casually denies my assertion of chemical heterogeneity in organisms and claims that the blood in one person's veins is essentially identical to the blood in anyone else's. Yet the fact of chemical heterogeneity in a wide range of bodily substances was firmly established decades ago by Roger Williams, who published the results of his studies in his book, Biochemical Individuality (1956). Williams notes wide ranges of chemical variability in brains, blood, bones, muscles and glands, in which the relative prevalence of chemicals commonly vary from person to person (and within the same person over time) by a factor of two and often as high as four to six. As Walter Elsasser notes, even within a single cell, no two regions demonstrate the same chemical makeup. In contrast to chemists, who purify their samples as thoroughly as possible, cells can tolerate heterogeneity because causal primacy in the cell does not reside at the chemical level. \n \n The source of electrolyte's confusion regarding biology is not simply his handicap as a chemist but his fear of a messy universe, a place where all sorts of things can happen, and nothing is under control. The deterministic nature of the universe, he believes, has long-since been proven, and anyone who doubts it is simply incapable of understanding science. Yet this is not science but a cult with a long lineage known since the 19th century as scientism. In contrast to scientism, where everything of consequence was proven long ago, real science is not so much about proving a postulate as determining what the default assumption ought to be. I make no claim of having proven that evolutionary novelty is driven primarily by heritable adaptations undertaken by the organism in its environmental context. I merely claim that this ought to be the default assumption until it's been disproved. I don't claim to have proven that an organism is a holistic system whose central properties are self-existence and self-determination. I merely claim that this ought to be the natural assumption for many reasons, not the least of which that it fits in with what is self-evident in our own experience as organisms. \n \n Even if you can't prove something difficult, at least endeavor to disclose what is obvious. This, by the way, is the aim of philosophy.",

   "My point in mentioning how science works at an inductive level is that \"some\" can be extrapolated to \"all,\" and it often is, as is the case here.\n\n \n We can never be certain of the jump from some to all. This is particularly true in this case. The fact that the properties of a computer can't be found at the level of a transistor does not mean that in all cases, including organisms, a property found at the whole cannot also be found in one of its parts. This is not even a serious proposition, particularly given the fact that organisms have a completely different relationship to their parts from machines. In machines, the whole is really nothing more than the parts all working together. The parts are built so as to fit the machine. As Kant pointed out, in organisms each part is both cause and effect, end and means of the operation of the whole. Parts and whole emerge together, that is, organically, rather than being stamped into place mechanistically. \n \n \nIf the only evidence of intelligence we have is above the cellular level, there is nothing wrong with concluding intelligence does not operate on the cellular level.\n\n \n Oh, there's plenty of stuff on single celled organisms reacting intelligently to altered conditions. When their usual food source is removed, they simply adapt, producing a new enzyme with which they can digest a carbohydrate they hadn't relied on before. \n \n And of course there's the whole issue of how genes are operated, which turns out to be incredibly complex. Each developmental gene is preceded by bits of DNA called \"switches,\" or epigenetic tags, which can activate and deactivate the gene so it turns on at precisely the right moment in the developmental process. This is happening simultaneously to thousands of genes in a given cell at blinding speed, a jaw-droppingly complex procedure that seems to have no basis in any information contained within the genes. It's bad enough that the genes are supposed to direct the construction of a complete living organism, far worse that now they need another map just to properly negotiate their own operations.\n \n This has caught reductionists off guard. No one has any idea how the genome performs its miraculous feat. Hence the supposition of cellular intelligence. Perhaps the cell operates holistically, via what the great theorist and embryologist Paul Weiss dubbed a \"morphogenetic field\" which, according to Rupert Sheldrake, contains inherent memory. The cell field directs the operations of the genome, producing the proteins required for the developing matrix in which it is embedded. \n \n Of course, it's not much of an intelligence if all it has to do is make the same decision cells of its kind in similar situation have always made before. Not so much intelligence as memory. Nonetheless mentality is implicated at all levels of biological operation.",

Behe's argument relies upon the false assumption that there is no 'half an eye' - no intermediate step - that is in any way useful; it's all or nothing.\n \n My argument is that if you already have a sequence of developmental events A and B, where B depends upon A, then there may well be no single mutation that can eliminate A and transform B so as to work in the absence of A, and it's also very unlikely that any stepwise accumulation of mutations would be viable. A mutation that makes B work in the absence of A could be catastrophic in the presence of A, and a mutation that eliminates A would be catastrophic for B.\n \n This would not hold true for every developmental step, but it's reasonable to predict that it would crop up from time to time.\n \nNor do I buy the argument that a swimbladder or gills or any of that other fishy stuff is so integral to embryonic development that multiple simultaneous mutations would be required to streamline it out of the picture.\n\n You may not buy it, but you cannot discount it. Given evolution's opportunistic nature, the gene combinations responsible for those structures may have become entangled with the formation of other structures. \n \n Actually, there's an even simpler explanation which doesn't involve that kind of developmental dependency: say we start with a creature with gills. The first mutation that eliminates them from the adult form might be one that prevents them forming in the first place, but it might not be - it might be one that catalyses reabsorption. Now we have a two-step process in place - what happens if another mutation 'streamlines' the development process by preventing the gills forming at all? What will the 'reabsorption' step do now? Maybe nothing, maybe something catastrophic. Again, you might end up stuck with the first solution hit upon.\n \nThe reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb.\n\n Of course it does! Physical isolation from other organisms doesn't necessarily mean you aren't in competition. A longer, more complex and potentially more error-prone developmental process will yield statistically fewer live births than a simpler, safer one.

On the other hand, there are senses in which DNA is read by an interpreter, eg. the formation of proteins. I think it remains a useful aid to visualisation.\n \n Ironically, by far the worst culprit for anthropomorphising the function of DNA was wascallywabbit, who insisted for the longest time that it was nothing but a jotter in which the organism noted down words to jog its memory.",

A statistically significant increase in the latency of the test chicks relative to the controls means the test chicks showed greater aversion over time than the controls.\n\n Like I said, unless you assume - with no reason or evidence to back you up - that the same decreasing latency trend underlies both sets of results, you cannot infer increasing aversion.\n \nThis is what Sheldrake predicted on the basis of morphic resonance.\n\n No, he didn't - he stated as much in his paper. When formulating his prediction he couldn't conceive of any reason why the chrome bead latency would change, so he made the explicit prediction that the LED latency would increase. It didn't.\n \nThis is incorrect. Perhaps you're confused owing to the fact that at first both groups tended to peck more readily. Rose and Sheldrake agreed this was an artifact of the improving skills of the lab-tech.\n\n No, I am correct. Those same trends continued throughout to some degree - only the diversion in the trends altered. At no point did the birds exhibit a trend of greater aversion towards either stimulus,.\n \nThe student who actually ran the experiment needed a few trials to get the hang of it. By simply lopping off the first few trials, the trend toward increased aversion becomes clear.\n\n There was no trend towards increased aversion, only different degrees of decreased aversion, easily explicable via the different learning curve and inherent attractiveness of chrome pin and yellow LED.\n \nAbsolutely not. Sheldrake includes all trials after the first few when the lab-tech was getting the hang of it.\n\n Exactly - he assumes that at the precise point where the graph turns in his favour, the student had 'got the hang of it'. Actually, it's worse than that: he assumes that the student continued to get better for the whole of the rest of the experiment at the same rate with both implements despite having increased in proficiency at different rates with each implement in the past.\n \nSeems like you're working from Rose's attempted rebuttal rather than the original paper, then ignoring Sheldrake's response in which he refutes all of Rose's transparently lame objections.\n\n I haven't read any rebuttal, I only followed the link you provided earlier to the original paper.\n \n Ok, now I've read the rebuttal, and Rose makes some additional points regarding the influence of base and ceiling values on the data. After the initial learning period the birds pecked with such eagerness at the yellow LED - for the whole of the rest of the experiment - that it was practically impossible for any experimenter-induced increase in enthusiasm to register. The chrome bead, on the other hand, was always far less popular a target for pecking, thus leaving room for the lab-tech to improve his technique and improve the peck-rate.\n \n That's by far the simplest explanation for the results: the test results didn't show a trend towards reduced aversion because they couldn't, while the control results could, thus inducing the apparently significant diversion.\n \n I'll check out Sheldrake's rebuttal and get back to you.",

   "Ok, from Sheldrake's rebuttal:\n \nWe agree that the continued decline in latency in the control chicks (not predicted by either of us) is best explained as a result of Ms Harrison's increasing familiarity with the chicks and the test procedures.\n\n So Sheldrake agrees that that trend was experimenter-induced.\n \nand hence by morphic resonance subsequent chicks showed an increasing tendency to avoid it, even though they themselves had not been made sick. This increasing aversion to pecking the yellow light countervailed the tendency to peck sooner as a result of the experimenter's practice.\n\n See? He assumes, with no justification, that the exact same trend underlies both sets of results.\n \n His attempted rebuttal of the 'ceiling' effect pointed out by Rose is smoke and mirrors.

   "My argument is that if you already have a sequence of developmental events A and B, where B depends upon A, then there may well be no single mutation that can eliminate A and transform B so as to work in the absence of A, and it's also very unlikely that any stepwise accumulation of mutations would be viable. A mutation that makes B work in the absence of A could be catastrophic in the presence of A, and a mutation that eliminates A would be catastrophic for B.\n\n \n This is the kind of argument I expect to see from creationists. It's simply a matter of shifting the context from womb to outer environment, and you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution. I happen to take this view myself, which is why I support Miroslav Hill's proposal for adaptive mutation of genes (really just an updated version of Darwin's pangenesis) as well as Sheldrake's proposal for form-based inheritance. \n \n \nGiven evolution's opportunistic nature, the gene combinations responsible for those structures may have become entangled with the formation of other structures. \n\n \n It's interesting how, as soon as you begin looking at it from the point of view of the embryo, you start to see the implausibility of neo-Darwinian evolution. Yet any argument that applies to the womb can also be applied to evolution in the context of the outer environment. Be careful of what you write. Creationists could easily remove your words from their embryonic context and claim you're talking about the implausibility of evolution in general.\n \n \ndace: \"The reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb.\"\n \n Of course it does! Physical isolation from other organisms doesn't necessarily mean you aren't in competition. A longer, more complex and potentially more error-prone developmental process will yield statistically fewer live births than a simpler, safer one. Unless the attendant benefits in adulthood outweigh the risks, such a process is at a selective disadvantage.\n\n \n And this is my point exactly. Given the potential problems that can crop up during a lengthy gestation full of odd detours through the phylogenetic tree, embryogenesis ought to have been streamlined by the same process of random mutation that allows for advances in the adult form of the organism. But it hasn't happened because novelty doesn't stem primarily from random mutation. It stems from pressures on the organism in its environment and the adaptations it undertakes so as to improve its chances for survival. These adaptations, as Darwin argued, are then inherited by offspring. But in this case, the risks are faced by the expectant mother while the organism that would have to creatively adapt is adrift in the oceanic bliss of the womb. Since the embryo itself isn't going to adapt, and the mother can't do anything but wait for the process to play itself out, the only adaptations that occur are those that arise spontaneously from accidents in the replication of genes. And here we see just how paltry is the effect of such accidents. After millions upon millions of years, we're still recapitulating in the womb the same old developmental processes of our early vertebrate ancestors. \n \n It all comes down to what our default assumption ought to be. Neither side has been proven. The originator of genetic reductionism, August Weismann, stated that he had no evidence for his belief but simply couldn't imagine any other possibility. He assumed that organisms possess no endogenous intelligence by which to adapt genes in accord with behavioral and morphogenetic adaptations. Thus organisms cannot transmit their living adaptations to progeny. He also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance. \n \n So there's no evidence that inheritance is limited to whatever mutations spontaneously arise from within DNA. Just pure assumption from the get-go. Nor is there any evidence that genetic transcription is the motive force in development. It's not as if anybody's ever traced a causal chain from the activities of genes to the creation of multicellular structures or even the patterned activities within cells themselves. All we have is a link between genotype and phenotype. This gene means you'll have blue eyes. This one means you'll have dimples. This one means you'll have a gift for mechanical analysis. It's simply assumed that since we have the front end (genotype) and the back end (phenotype) there must be a causal chain connecting them which accounts for the construction of all the organs and tissues of the body. But what if genes don't contain anything like a blueprint of the body but merely influence its development so as to promote differences between individuals? Perhaps the actual basis of development is the ability of organic systems to directly mimic previous similar systems. Like Newton positing gravity to explain planetary motions, we simply posit memory as a universal feature of nature.\n \n Because we cannot discount the possibility that memory is a property of nature, we cannot assume that genes provide the basis for development in general. Instead, we must have evidence, but the only thing we know on the basis of hard evidence is that genes differentiate between individuals, not that they provide the general template for the species. \n \n The beauty of Weismann's reductionism is that it explained something complex (the complete living organism) according to something simple (\"germ-plasm\" or genes). And it's true that the information contained in genes is stunningly simple in relation to the body and its organs. But now, in light of \"evo-devo\" research, we discover that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from people to flies. What distinguishes us is the way in which our genes are operated, and this process of operating genes is as complex as anything we've ever found in nervous, endocrine or immune systems. What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another? The entire foundation of genetic reductionism has simply vanished. Where before we stood on terra firma, we now stand on thin air. \n \n But there's more. It turns out that complexity is fundamental to nature. Nature is not based on static simplicity but process complexity. A whirlpool, for instance, is a self-organized system that derives energy by rapidly reducing the pressure gradient resulting from a large body of water trying to fit through a small opening. The only law of physics that gives shape to a whirlpool is the second law of thermodynamics. Because energy is always being leached in the form of entropy, natural systems must draw in more energy than is lost. It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy. \n \n It's often thought that evolution is a property of life. In reality, life is a property of evolution. Before there was life, there was evolution of complex chemical systems that derived energy by tapping into temperature and/or pressure gradients. The greater its internal complexity, the more energy a given chemical system can harness. The problem is that increased energy flow today means increased entropy tomorrow. In order to overcome increased entropy, the system must further complexify in order to harness even more energy, setting the stage for even more entropy down the road. And so on, and so on, and so on until you've got human beings trying to develop new sources of energy while coping with all the garbage and pollution and infrastructure decay resulting from prior energy-intensive development. From complex chemical systems of the early Earth to human civilization, it's all a single thread of complex self-organized systems overcoming entropy by drawing in more energy.\n \n Evo-devo and complexity theory constitute a one-two punch that has knocked reductionism out of the ring. It's holism from here on out with reductionism demoted from theory to mere methodology. Naturally, we still wish to break down complicated phenomena into simpler underlying phenomena wherever possible. It's just that we'll never reduce any complex, self-organized system into laws, on the one hand, and matter on the other. The system must be taken as a thing in itself, and to understand its actions, we must interpret them in light of its overall needs and not some combination of abstractions and atoms. \n \n So where does this leave biology? Do we have to start from scratch, scrambling to apply the lessons of complexity science to organisms? Not at all. Biology has always had a holistic component. The theory of evolution doesn't follow from biochemistry but stems from observations of embryos recapitulating their ancestral forms. Darwin explicitly denied Descartes' notion (then being trumpeted by T.H. Huxley) that animals are machines. Rejecting the view of the fundamental passivity of matter, Darwin saw evolution as an expression of the creativity inherent in matter. C.S. Peirce generalized Darwin's doctrine by arguing that even the principles of physics are mere cosmic habits that came into being in time and reinforce themselves over time. Henri Bergson argued on the basis of neurological observation that brains are not passive memory-storage devices but serve to filter out the masses of extraneous memory continually pouring down on us from our living past. In other words the problem is not remembering what is important but forgetting what is not. Bergson's arch-enemy Bertrand Russell referred to this insistent pressure of the past on the present as \"mnemic causation.\" Though Russell disdained everything uttered by his more famous French counterpart, he did at least concede the possibility that the present is influenced by the deep past in addition to the immediate past of standard causation. Russell's associate Alfred North Whitehead went much further, arguing that science was in for a wholesale shift from physio-centric to bio-centric, from static instant to living process. Embryologist Paul Weiss, who argued that \"morphogenetic fields\" organize development from the egg, was once president of the National Academy of Sciences, giving the lie to the idea that holistic biology has always been the reserve of marginal thinkers. South African naturalist Eugene Marais demonstrated that an organizing field, over and above ordinary chemical communication, maintains the integrity of termite mounds. The physicist Walter Elsasser, who solved the equations for the Earth's electromagnetic fields before turning from physics to biology, published his insights in numerous biological journals. He defined holistic memory not just in terms of personal memories and habits but \"all informational stability in the organism that does not yield to an understanding in terms of mechanistic models.\" \n \n Sheldrake's notion of morphic resonance, far from being an oddball theory out of left field, is the crowning achievement in a long lineage of holistic thought in biology. For the first time we have a testable means by which the present comes under the influence of the past. Though complexity theory can explain how a generic system self-organizes and self-perpetuates, it can't explain why one particular system comes into being and not another. This is where memory comes in, and there's no longer any reason to assume that species-memory is strictly a matter of genes. If an organism is a holistic, complex system, why assume its memory is reducible to particles?\n \n \nIronically, by far the worst culprit for anthropomorphising the function of DNA was wascallywabbit, who insisted for the longest time that it was nothing but a jotter in which the organism noted down words to jog its memory.\n\n \n Fascinating.

If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention.\"\n \n Superficially that sounds reasonable, but in reality it's deeply flawed. If you ask me how different two creatures could be, why should I assume you mean 'while both still being bacteria'? Why isn't the scope species, genera, the whole scope of life itself? And given that we classify creatures as bacteria based on their similarity in the first place, what possible answer has the question \"How different could those two creatures be while still being similar?\" It's circular nonsense.\n\n \n Morphic resonance doesn't operate according to abstract classifications. It doesn't have to answer questions about difference and similarity. Like gravity or electromagnetism, it's a property of nature. The circular nonsense is what happens when you try to fit nature into the logic of human abstraction.\n \n Is a tornado circular nonsense? Think about it. The damn thing comes into being by reducing the gradient that provides the energy that gives it its form. Sound weird? It's called self-organization.

Now there's no basis for the conclusion that the evolution of species in the outer world is but the shadow of genetic mutations in microscopic chromosomes.\n \n Instead of determining the process, maybe alterations in DNA during speciation merely mark at the genetic level the real action taking place in the resonance between current and past organic forms.

It's simply a matter of shifting the context from womb to outer environment, and you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution.\n\n Oh dear me, no. The argument pertains to potential restrictions on how evolution can proceed, not what it can yield. Evolution can produce a human without gills or a swimbladder, but it can't necessarily streamline those features away entirely. That was in fact what you asked for: a genetic explanation for why certain features would be revised away in a particular manner.\n \n Imagine you have some scaffolding covered in tarpaulin. It functions well enough as a domicile. Then, within and using the scaffolding, you construct a house, and you live for a while within the house within the scaffolding. Then you remove the tarpaulin, then you remove the scaffolding. That process of constructing houses can be arrived at by stepwise evolution: repeat it several times, adding one more modification each time. \n \n However, although it's possible in principle for houses to be built without ever using scaffolding, it may not be possible to evolve stepwise to such a process from the one above. The scaffolding may get in the way of the scaffold-less process of construction, so that has to be the first change you make to the process - except that without it, you can't build the house any more, so you need to change the house-building process first, except you can't because the scaffolding is in the way... your only option is to make two precisely complementary changes simultaneously, which is comparatively unlikely in an evolutionary scenario.\n \n None of this says anything about the ability of evolution to produce the result we're interested in: a process for constructing a house. It only speaks to the optimisations it can or cannot be reasonably expected to make to that process.\n \nBe careful of what you write. Creationists could easily remove your words from their embryonic context and claim you're talking about the implausibility of evolution in general.\n\n Undoubtedly, and I would have to correct their misapprehension, as I have here with you.\n \nAnd this is my point exactly.

Thus organisms cannot transmit their living adaptations to progeny.\n\n That does not entirely follow. The lack of any conceivable mechanism for reverse-engineering phenotypic change into genetic change precludes it happening in some ways, but there are other routes by which behavioural adaptations in particular can be transmitted between generations. The fact that animals raised in captivity - even naturally solitary ones - can struggle to function in the wild demonstrates that exogenous pathways for inheriting acquired behaviour exist within their species.\n \n Indeed, that's yet another empirical nail in the morphic resonance coffin: if chicks can supposedly learn something as specific as 'don't peck the yellow LED' via morphic resonance, then no animal, wherever and however reared, should struggle to occupy its usual niche when released into the wild.\n \nHe also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance.\n\n That's terribly woolly thinking. A reciever does not resonate with the transmitter, it resonates with the proximate electromagnetic waves. By what method do waves of 'chick averse to pecking yellow LEDs' propagate?\n \nSo there's no evidence that inheritance is limited to whatever mutations spontaneously arise from within DNA.\n\n Nor is there any statement to that effect; you are constructing a strawman.\n \nBecause we cannot discount the possibility that memory is a property of nature,\n\n Tea, anyone?

What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another?\n\n The complexity of life is layered; cumulative. Just because genes are leveraged in a complex fashion now does not mean such was always the case, any more than the complexity of the genes themselves has been invariant, or the complexity of the macro forms produced by those systems. All life in existence today has had a few billions of years to accrue the most baroque complexity, so naturally understanding it is going to be difficult. We may never understand it entirely - but that doesn't mean there's nothing there to be understood. I don't see any merit in saying \"That explanation is just so darn complicated, I can't understand it, so I've decided a different explanation that I can understand must be right instead\".\n \nIt's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy.\n\n I'm not sure where animism gets us, either. \n \nThe system must be taken as a thing in itself, and to understand its actions, we must interpret them in light of its overall needs and not some combination of abstractions and atoms.\n\n Mmm.

You have no theoretical basis for determining what morphic resonance ought to be able to achieve and thus what you ought to test for: the constant goalpost-moving in response to my questions is evidence enough of that. And when your tests fail - as they did with the chick experiment - you simply invent a way of juggling, pruning and reinterpreting the results to fit your preconceptions. You still no doubt maintain that the chicks demonstrated increased aversion to the yellow LED, despite there being no evidence to that effect.\n \nThis is where memory comes in, and there's no longer any reason to assume that species-memory is strictly a matter of genes.\n\n Since we don't do that anyway, the point seems somewhat moot.",

All you're saying is that you get to make it up as you go along: you get to look at two humans and say 'yeah, close enough to resonate' and then look at two bacteria of different species that are far, far more similar than any two humans and say 'Yeah, but they could be even more similar so they won't resonate'.\n \n Because that's clearly nonsense, I gave you the benefit of the doubt and presumed you had merely clumsily worded a quite different idea: that resonance is based on the actual degree of difference compared to the potential degree of difference. Except that still doesn't work because to measure 'potential' you need to draw a circle around what counts as 'a bacterium' and measure its diameter - and you can't do that without imposing arbitrary classifications, which you've just said morphic resonance doesn't.\n \n So I suppose we have to fall back to the original interpretation where we throw any notion of a metric of similarity out of the window and you get to decide how similar two organisms are on a passing whim.\n \n \nIs a tornado circular nonsense?

Sound weird?\n\n It sounds like an unnecessarily convoluted wording of a straightforward physical phenomenon. \n \nInstead of determining the process, maybe alterations in DNA during speciation merely mark at the genetic level the real action taking place in the resonance between current and past organic forms.\n\n You've already said morphic resonance does not propagate molecular details, so no, maybe they don't. Nor do I see what we gain by replacing the admittedly mind-bendingly complex but empirically successful bottom-up view with this even more rarified top-down flight of fancy.",

   "dace: \"you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution.\"\n \n Oh dear me, no.\n\n \n Sometimes, the truth hurts. \n \n \nyour only option is to make two precisely complementary changes simultaneously, which is comparatively unlikely in an evolutionary scenario.\n\n \n Point being that all randomly driven evolution is unlikely compared to intelligently driven evolution, as Darwin originally conceived it. Because the intelligence of the organism has been removed from the equation, it's popped up again in the form of intelligent design. Hence the creationist monkey on reductionism's back. \n \n \nIndeed, that's yet another empirical nail in the morphic resonance coffin: if chicks can supposedly learn something as specific as 'don't peck the yellow LED' via morphic resonance, then no animal, wherever and however reared, should struggle to occupy its usual niche when released into the wild.\n\n \n Morphic resonance is not magic. It doesn't perform miracles. An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory. \n \n \ndace: \"[Weismann] also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance.\"\n \n That's terribly woolly thinking. A reciever does not resonate with the transmitter, it resonates with the proximate electromagnetic waves.\n\n \n Receivers resonate with transmitters via electromagnetic waves. It's not that I'm being woolly but that you're splitting hairs. \n \n \ndace: \"So there's no evidence that inheritance is limited to whatever mutations spontaneously arise from within DNA.\"\n \n Nor is there any statement to that effect; you are constructing a strawman.\n\n \n More hair splitting. As you know perfectly well, according to Weismannian, a.k.a. \"neo-Darwinian\" theory, the information relevant to the formation of the body is limited to genes in the nucleus. \n \n \ndace: \"Because we cannot discount the possibility that memory is a property of nature\"\n \n Tea, anyone? There's a pot in orbit around Jupiter if you're thirsty... ;)\n\n \n When Newton proposed that gravity is a property of nature, Leibniz accused him of introducing \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.\" I learned about this ignorant and unscientific comment from none other than Charles Darwin, who took Leibniz to task in The Origin of Species, a book you may just want to have a look at someday. \n \n \ndace: \"But now, in light of \"evo-devo\" research, we discover that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from people to flies. What distinguishes us is the way in which our genes are operated, and this process of operating genes is as complex as anything we've ever found in nervous, endocrine or immune systems. What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another?\"\n \n All life in existence today has had a few billions of years to accrue the most baroque complexity, so naturally understanding it is going to be difficult. \n\n \n Spoken like a true bureaucrat. Stop prevaricating and accept reality. Reductionism is based on translating something complex into something simple. The operations of genes are no longer simple relative to the bodies whose forms they allegedly determine. End of theory. \n \n Modern thought offers four theories of life. The first was proposed in 1802 by William Paley in his book, Natural Theology. Paley claims that life is the product of God's mechanical genius. An organism gains its form through divine craftsmanship. Call it the intelligence theory of life. The second theory was proposed by August Weismann in the 1890s. An organism gains its form through the inheritance of morphogenetic information contained in its germ-plasm. The complex organism is effectively \"reduced\" to its germ-plasm (genes). Though the organism is still a machine, its \"maker\" is whatever random mutations in its genes happen to be beneficial and are therefore environmentally selected. The first theory was undone by evolution, while the second theory was undone by evo-devo and the refutation of reduction from complex body to simple genome. These are the mechanistic theories, and both are wholly discredited. To continue clinging to the second is no more scientific than clinging to the first. There is no longer any difference, so far as scientific credibility is concerned, between a creationist and a reductionist. \n \n The next two theories are holistic, and the dispute between them is the fundamental concern of 21st century biology. First we have the theory coming into focus under the guise of complexity theory, which is derived primarily from the study of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Life originated from self-organized chemical systems characterized by autocatalytic reactions, meaning that the result of the final reaction sets the stage for the first step. The processes occurring in our cells are simply continuations of autocatalytic reactions that began four billion years ago. Species are differentiated via genes which, rather than containing information for the construction of the organism, merely channel the autocatalysis in a slightly different direction, causing a different outcome at the morphological level. This is akin to C.H. Waddington's concept of chreodes, whereby a hillside is carved with grooves that represent developmental pathways, and ontogeny is represented by a ball rolling down the hill. The function of genes is to redirect the ball from one set of grooves to another. Since the body is not reduced to genetic information but is taken as a holistic, complex system, the fatal flaw in reductionist information theory is avoided. \n \n Much like Michael Shermer arguing against creationists, I've spent far too much time battling proponents of a failed theory. The complexity theory of life is formidable. It is not easily falsified, as is the reductionist model which, after all, never had any evidence to back it up. As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out, from the time of Weismann forward, no one ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could either verify or refute the reduction of organisms to morphological information. It was simply assumed, due to lack of imagination, precisely the problem with creationists, who simply can't imagine how life could exist without an intelligent designer. \n \n However, as brilliant as the complexity theory is, it still falls short of a convincing explanation of life. Where is the explanation of atavism? Where is the explanation of parallel evolution? What about personal memory? What about consciousness and intelligence? And can we really account for the activities of cells without any kind of coordinating force, such as the electromagnetic force that lines up magnetic particles? The fourth theory of life, proposed almost simultaneously by physicist Walter Elsasser and biologist Rupert Sheldrake, accepts the holistic framework of complexity theory but adds to it an inherent memory by which organisms negotiate the many biochemical pathways at their disposal. Choices are made unconsciously in accord with whatever the organism has always done before. During development of new structures, it does what its kind has always done before. In novel situations, it can use its intelligence to set out on a new course. Out of the organism's inherent memory is derived mind and all the seemingly impossible properties that follow from it, including representational intelligence. In short, organic order in matter leaves a wake in mind, and this wake then informs subsequent activity. \n \n Perhaps the memory theory of life is incorrect, and somehow the complexity theory will account for all known features of life. I doubt it. Nonetheless, this is where the action is. If you want to be relevant to the science of life as it unfolds in the coming years, you will need to get a solid grounding in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, not to mention the dynamics of instability, a.k.a. \"chaos theory.\" \n \n \ndace: \"It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy.\"\n \n I'm not sure where animism gets us, either. \n\n \n You're coming across as awfully provincial. You need to get up to speed on complexity theory. Cambridge University Press has a superb introduction called Complex Systems, edited by Terry Bossomaier and David Green. It's as good a place to start as any. You will soon learn that what I've been telling you about complex systems is established fact. \n \n \ndace: \"The system must be taken as a thing in itself, and to understand its actions, we must interpret them in light of its overall needs and not some combination of abstractions and atoms.\"\n \n Mmm. And here you were accusing me of waxing anthropomorphic. 'Needs' of a system?\n\n \n Again, your provincialism is showing. The fundamental insight of complexity theory is that goal-directed behavior is a property of all gradient-reducing self-organized systems. \n \n \ndace: \"Sheldrake's notion of morphic resonance, far from being an oddball theory out of left field, is the crowning achievement in a long lineage of holistic thought in biology.\"\n \n It's empirically bankrupt, theoretically vacuous and quite, quite potty.\n\n \n This is disrespectful. You know, I don't have to continue talking to you. I'm trying to help you by steering you away from the cult of reductionism, which cannot accept its demise no matter how obvious (and it was obvious long before evo-devo came along and definitively finished it off). I hate to see bright young people taken in by cults, creationist or otherwise. \n \n \ndace: \"For the first time we have a testable means by which the present comes under the influence of the past.\"\n \n Not really. You have no theoretical basis for determining what morphic resonance ought to be able to achieve and thus what you ought to test for: the constant goalpost-moving in response to my questions is evidence enough of that.\n\n \n There has been no moving of the goalpost, and frankly, you're starting to come across as arrogant. How would you know that morphic resonance is untestable if you haven't studied the theory? That you presume to know is evidence of your failure to take on a proper scientific outlook. First become acquainted with the theory. Then criticize it. No one who's acquainted with the theory doubts its testability. That's not even an issue. The issue is whether it has passed its tests. \n \n \nAnd when your tests fail - as they did with the chick experiment - you simply invent a way of juggling, pruning and reinterpreting the results to fit your preconceptions. You still no doubt maintain that the chicks demonstrated increased aversion to the yellow LED, despite there being no evidence to that effect.\n\n \n It appears that your critique is correct. There was no absolute increase in aversion in the test group. The only increase was relative to the control group. Both groups decreased their aversion with each subsequent batch, but the control group did so more rapidly. Thank you for clearing up my confusion on this issue. \n \n It is odd though, don't you think, that each time a new batch of chicks went into the cage, they pecked more readily than previous batches? No one would have predicted that. It seems inconceivable to me that this trend could be attributed to improved skills of the lab-tech throughout the entire experiment. Sure, the first day or two, but the whole run? Not likely. It's certainly anomalous. \n \n There is one more point to be made, however. The first batch of test chicks were injected with saline solution after pecking the yellow LED. Subsequent chicks were far more averse to the yellow LED than the chrome LED. How else can we explain this except with morphic resonance? As Sheldrake noted, what's important is not the absolute willingness to peck yellow LEDs but the chicks' willingness to peck them relative to the chrome LEDs. The results bear out this crucial difference. Despite my misunderstanding of the experiment, which you've kindly corrected, it still appears to bolster the hypothesis.

The fundamental insight of complexity theory is that goal-directed behavior is a property of all gradient-reducing self-organized systems.\n\n Perhaps the terminology is tripping me up, but why employ the term 'goal' with its connotations of intelligence? Especially when you were pretty intolerant of the practice earlier.\n \nThis is disrespectful. You know, I don't have to continue talking to you. I'm trying to help you by steering you away from the cult of reductionism, which cannot accept its demise no matter how obvious (and it was obvious long before evo-devo came along and definitively finished it off). I hate to see bright young people taken in by cults, creationist or otherwise.\n\n I'm sorry for speaking harshly about something close to your heart, but when you hold up Sheldrake's 'chick' experiment as evidence, and stand by it no matter how many times its flaws are exposed, it tarnishes whatever value your message might possess. For morphic resonance to have any kind of credibility you must distance yourself from bad science done in its name, and Sheldrake's chick experiment - and especially his write-up - was bad science.\n \n I think you've been a bit hasty in branding me a reductionist and thus dismissing me out of hand. I'm quite aware of the fact that one cannot always arbitrarily divide a system in half and understand each half in isolation - my day job would be much easier if you could. But nor do I fall into the 'what use is half an eye?' trap. While an eye can and should be understood holistically, it can also be understood in terms of the incremental steps by which it attained its modern form. That can tell us a great deal about what is steering the process: is it goal-based and holistic, results-fed and reductionist, or a bit of both on different levels? The fact the end result is very complicated does not on its own give us the answer, as you seem to think it does - we need to investigate the stages by which that complexity accrued.\n \nThere has been no moving of the goalpost, and frankly, you're starting to come across as arrogant. How would you know that morphic resonance is untestable if you haven't studied the theory? That you presume to know is evidence of your failure to take on a proper scientific outlook. First become acquainted with the theory. Then criticize it. No one who's acquainted with the theory doubts its testability. That's not even an issue. The issue is whether it has passed its tests.\n\n Perhaps it's my fault. When you talk about two humans resonating and two bacteria not, it's hard for me to conceive of one set of goalposts that could accommodate both observations without rendering the theory of morphic resonance purely descriptive. Similarly, when you talk about chicks learning to avoid a yellow LED in a few weeks while simultaneously saying the instantaneous loss of million-year-old wild instincts isn't a problem.\n \n The former in particular sits very ill with me. What exactly is it about bacteria that would induce such a tremendously steep attenuation of morphic resonance compared to two humans? Your earlier reply, that their similarity means small differences matter more, is a contradiction. If A, B and C are all creatures, and A is more similar to B than to C, then A and B should resonate more strongly, right? Only you're saying that because A and B are more similar the differences matter more, so they resonate less than A and C. Uhhhhh....\n \nIt appears that your critique is correct. There was no absolute increase in aversion in the test group. The only increase was relative to the control group. Both groups decreased their aversion with each subsequent batch, but the control group did so more rapidly. Thank you for clearing up my confusion on this issue.\n\n Not at all - thank you for reading it. That in itself is a rarity :)\n \nIt is odd though, don't you think, that each time a new batch of chicks went into the cage, they pecked more readily than previous batches? No one would have predicted that. It seems inconceivable to me that this trend could be attributed to improved skills of the lab-tech throughout the entire experiment. Sure, the first day or two, but the whole run? Not likely. It's certainly anomalous. \n\n It depends upon what scope for improvement there is. I look at the results and see a short familiarisation period where bumbling ineptitude gives way to competence, followed by a more gradual gaining of expertise. To the best of my knowledge, all non-trivial activities follow a similar pattern.\n \n Without knowing what the procedure actually was it's hard to speculate, but I can imagine the lab tech getting more adept at both physically wielding the stimuli and picking up and responding appropriately to signs of interest on the part of the chicks. Remember, the chicks were far less interested in the chrome pin than the yellow LED in absolute terms, so there's much more of a scope for improvement on the part of the lab tech.\n \nThere is one more point to be made, however. The first batch of test chicks were injected with saline solution after pecking the yellow LED. Subsequent chicks were far more averse to the yellow LED than the chrome LED. How else can we explain this except with morphic resonance? \n\n I think that might be a misunderstanding.\n \n Every batch of test chicks and control chicks were injected with something after pecking the LED or chrome pin. In the case of the test chicks the injection contained lithium chloride which made them mildly ill, in the case of the control chicks the injection was pure saline and didn't make them ill. That constituted the 'training' phase of each batch. Those exact same chicks (both the test and control groups) were then exposed to both the chrome pin and the yellow LED in order to establish whether any greater or lesser aversion to either had been induced by the training. This was the 'test' phase of each batch. Both these phases were performed with each daily batch of chicks.\n \n There are therefore two kinds of results we can observe: changes in latency of a single batch of chicks between their first and second exposure to the chrome pin or yellow LED, and any trends in those latencies over the course of the experiment. The results were as follows:\n \n 1. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on Chrome: \n \n In any given control batch, chicks on average exhibited no detectable change in aversion between training and testing on the chrome pin. There was an unexpected overall downward trend in the aversion of each successive batch over the course of the experiment.\n \n 2. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on LED:\n \n The LED was, as noted, much more attractive than the chrome pin, so it's not meaningful to compare the training/testing results. There was no trend toward increased aversion to the LED over the course of the experiment. However, Sheldrake reports this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing the results from 1. above.\n \n 3. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on Chrome:\n \n Again, becase the LED was much more attractive than the chrome pin, comparisons between training and testing results are meaningless. The chrome pin latencies followed the same downward trend as elsewhere.\n \n 4. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on LED:\n \n Pronounced increase in aversion between training and testing: these chicks had learned their lesson. Still no trend toward increased aversion to the LED on the part of each successive batch over the course of the experiment. Again, Sheldrake reports this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing by the chrome pin results.\n \n As Sheldrake noted, what's important is not the absolute willingness to peck yellow LEDs but the chicks' willingness to peck them relative to the chrome LEDs. The results bear out this crucial difference. Despite my misunderstanding of the experiment, which you've kindly corrected, it still appears to bolster the hypothesis. The mistake was mine, not Sheldrake's.\n\n The mistake is to assume that the same trend underlies both the control results and the test results, which is what would need to be true for the divergence in the results to require further explanation. I don't feel that's a safe assumption for two reasons:\n \n 1. If the divergence was evident and the control group showed the expected lack of a trend, I feel we would be justified in looking for an explanation favourable to morphic resonance. One anomaly, one explanation. Such was not the case. Sheldrake must therefore propose not one but two forces at work: experimenter experience influencing both sets of results equally, counteracted by morphic resonance in the case of the yellow LED. But if experimenter experience is a factor, why can't it be the sole explanation for the chrome pin trend, end of story?\n \n 2. If the stimuli were equivalently attractive to the chicks to begin with, I feel we might be justified in attaching significance to the later divergence of the results. However, the chicks always preferred the yellow LED, so much so it would have been impossible for the trend in the control results to be reflected in the test results. Once you appreciate that, you can see how flawed Sheldrake's interpretation was. Experimental capping made it impossible for the LED results to exhibit the downward trend Sheldrake assumes was counteracted by morphic resonance.",

That is the answer to your original question concerning recapitulation; this whole 'creationist monkey' diversion is a red herring.\n\n \n You're creating a false distinction. Randomly-driven novelty can yield the relevant results - - but not necessarily. So too, randomly-driven novelty can generate the optimal process which achieves those results - - but not necessarily. There's no fundamental difference between the results and the optimum route of achieving them. In both cases, maybe random mutation will produce the relevant outcome - - or maybe not. \n \n Even if the unlikelihood of producing the optimum route is greater than the unlikelihood of producing the optimum results, it's still all extremely unlikely in any given case. But hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right?\n \n By the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise. Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise.

I find that horribly contradictory.\n\n \n I would find that contradictory as well. So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation. Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time. It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations. Still, there's never a complete break. Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus.\n \n \ndace: \"Receivers resonate with transmitters via electromagnetic waves.

You cannot gloss over that when describing morphic resonance - how much big science is being done to identify the carrier waves of properties like gravity?\n\n \n None, of course. It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves. Though the existence of such a carrier was assumed in the classical era of science, the \"luminiferous ether\" was refuted by the Michelson-Morley experiment (or more specifically Einstein's interpretation of Michelson-Morley). Genetic reductionism is the ether of the 20th century, positing genes as the carrier of biological inheritance when no such carrier is necessary. Just as gravitational and electromagnetic waves are propagated across space without any material intermediary, acquired adaptations are inherited without having to be carried on the backs of mutated genes.\n \n \ndace: \"As you know perfectly well, according to Weismannian, a.k.a. 'neo-Darwinian' theory, the information relevant to the formation of the body is limited to genes in the nucleus.\"\n \n Not the modern synthesis as I understand it; perhaps I'm out of touch :)\n\n \n Weismannian-Mendelian theory, which ultimately came to be known as \"the modern synthesis,\" (since superceded by evo-devo) posits that phenotypic changes are derivative of changes in genes. (We now know that developmental genes stay the same while their epigenetic tags, also composed of DNA, are what mark evolutionary changes at the genetic level). As to the overall egg cell donated by the mother, according to Haldane's synthesis, none of this material determines phenotypes. \n \n \nPerhaps the terminology is tripping me up, but why employ the term 'goal' with its connotations of intelligence?\n \n \n All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction. The movements of a tornado follow precisely the concentration of warm air near the surface. So, is a tornado intelligent? Surely we can agree that this is not the case. Yet it is goal-directed.\n \n I think what this means is that intelligence evolves out of the germ of goal-direction. Once again, we see how life not only involves evolution but is a product of evolution.\n \n \nFor morphic resonance to have any kind of credibility you must distance yourself from bad science done in its name, and Sheldrake's chick experiment - and especially his write-up - was bad science.\n\n \n Absolutely not. Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully. He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance. When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data. Now that's bad science.\n \n \nPerhaps it's my fault. When you talk about two humans resonating and two bacteria not, it's hard for me to conceive of one set of goalposts that could accommodate both observations without rendering the theory of morphic resonance purely descriptive.\n\n \n Again, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken. I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time). Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself. Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily. If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance. Nonetheless, so long as there are similarities in contrast to differences, resonance will occur. It's only natural.\n \n \nEvery batch of test chicks and control chicks were injected with something after pecking the LED or chrome pin.

I read the description of the test procedure yet didn't grasp the divide between training phase and testing phase. To me, testing was just another word for training. This caused untold confusion in my ability to understand the results. Thanks again.\n \n \nThere are therefore two kinds of results we can observe: changes in latency of a single batch of chicks between their first and second exposure to the chrome pin or yellow LED, and any trends in those latencies over the course of the experiment. The results were as follows:\n \n 1.

The mean latency of chicks tested with the control chrome bead falls, while the latency of these same chicks tested with the yellow diode rises. The trends move in opposite directions, not the same direction, as you've asserted. Rose simply left this result out of his paper. \n \n Moreover, you've overlooked a crucial point in the training phase of the experiment, during which \"naive chicks\" revealed an increasing aversion to the yellow diode with each successive batch. This figure is arrived at by using Rose's own proportional methodology of comparing the number of chicks who pecked within ten seconds to the total number of chicks trained. Because previous chicks who pecked at the yellow diode were injected with lithium chloride, newly trained chicks showed an aversion to pecking at the yellow diode. In other words, their collective memory was weighing on them, discouraging them from pecking at the bright, attractive diode. \n \n It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post. Go back to the original paper. You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3. The increased aversion among chrome-tested chicks to the yellow diode is presented in figure 5. \n \n http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&Papers/papers/morphic/formative.html",

   "You're creating a false distinction.\n\n No, I'm not. Stepwise adjustments to a process resulting in a different outcome and optimisations to a process preserving the same outcome are not equivalently difficult problems for evolution to solve. \n \nIn both cases, maybe random mutation will produce the relevant outcome - - or maybe not.\n\n Maybe a coin will land heads ten times in a row - or maybe not. Maybe it will land heads up a thousand times in a row - or maybe not. Hey look: I managed to phrase those statements so they sound similar - that must mean I can use them interchangeably!\n \n You cannot equivocate between events of radically different probability like that. Furthermore, it's meaningless to say that both are possible without reference to the number of opportunities available for each event.\n \nBut hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right?\n\n So long as there is, somewhere on that mountain, a gradient that can be scaled by the available opportunities for variation, yes. What you're doing is picking an arbitrary piece of rockface, claiming that evolution ought to be able to scale it, and complaining when it can't. Which pretty much misses the whole point of the Mt Improbable analogy.\n \n \nBy the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise. Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise.\n\n 'Next thing you know' is not the same as 'instantly fully formed'.\n \nI would find that contradictory as well. So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation. Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time. It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations. Still, there's never a complete break. Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus.\n\n That was not what I was referring to. It was perfectly clear what I was talking about<b></b>:\n \nMorphic resonance is not magic. It doesn't perform miracles. An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory.\n\n \nOn the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation.\n\n I find it ludicrous to suppose that something as esoteric, novel and specific as aversion to a yellow LED could propagate within weeks, while literally millions of years of resonating species memory could fail to inform an animal raised in captivity how to behave in the wild.\n \nNone, of course. It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves.\n\n Evasiveness is not an attractive quality. I'll say it again: receivers do not resonate with transmitters but with electromagnetic waves - do you contend that there are waves of 'chick averse to yellow LED' propagating through the universe?\n \nAll self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction.\n\n No, it has the effect of gradient reduction. Why introduce teleological terms to describe an effect?\n \nAbsolutely not. Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully. He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance. When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data. Now that's bad science.\n\n The experiment was performed just fine, but it was a bad experiment in principle. First, it failed to exclude enough factors for the proposed effect to be reliably discerned, and second the LED results were too close to the experimental cap for trends in both directions to register. Sheldrake's write-up is worse science because it ignores both these problems.\n \nAgain, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken. I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time).\n Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself. Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily. If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance.\n\n Why narrower and not stronger? You can't have both the strength of the resonance and the attenuation of the resonance based on the similarity between two organisms because the two effects conflict with each other. More similar = more resonance, yet more similar = steeper attenuation = less resonance.\n \n If I have two organisms and tell you nothing except the fact they are 90% similar, you cannot tell me how strongly they should resonate, can you? You've nothing to base the attenuation upon. I could be talking about two bacteria, two primates, two anything. Now think: if I tell you it's two bacteria, what information are you using to arrive at the decision that the attenuation should be steep? Answer: you're using your knowledge of what counts as a bacteria to decide that 90% similarity is not that high, relatively speaking. You're using the definition of 'bacteria' as your benchmark for potential variability. You don't include yeast cells in your estimate because you know they don't 'count'. But why don't they count? If A and B are both bacteria and C is a yeast cell, why isn't C an example of a really, really different kind of A? Unless you arbitrarily draw a line around what's allowed to count, a line chosen to yield the 'right' answer, there's no reason to suppose the existence of yeast cells - or primates for that matter - wouldn't broaden the attenuation of bacterial morphic resonance beyond the species level.\n \nOkay, this is where you go wrong. The mean latency of chicks tested with the control chrome bead falls, while the latency of these same chicks tested with the yellow diode rises. The trends move in opposite directions\n\n No, they dont. They merely diverge, in the same way that a man whose parachute has worked will diverge from a man whose parachute hasn't.\n \nMoreover, you've overlooked a crucial point in the training phase of the experiment, during which \"naive chicks\" revealed an increasing aversion to the yellow diode with each successive batch. This figure is arrived at by using Rose's own proportional methodology of comparing the number of chicks who pecked within ten seconds to the total number of chicks trained. It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post. Go back to the original paper. You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3. The increased aversion among chrome-tested chicks to the yellow diode is presented in figure 5.\n\n The 'trend' in figure 3 is in no way statistically significant (p=0.6, compared to the typical required value of 0.05). Figure 5 shows the LED results with the chrome pin results subtracted.\n \n I'll reiterate for clarity: there was no statistically significant trend towards increased aversion to the yellow LED. There was a statistically significant trend towards decreased aversion with respect to the chrome pin. Sheldrake himself explains this via increasing competence on the part of the experimenter. He assumes the divergence between the chrome and LED results is caused by two factors: \n \n 1. Equally increasing competence on the part of the experimenter with both the chrome pin and LED (so the graphs should look the same all else being equal)\n 2. Morphic resonance precisely offsetting factor 1 (making the graphs diverge and removing all sign of a secular trend from the LED results)\n \n These assumptions are unfounded for three reasons:\n \n 1. Sheldrake himself asserts that competence with the two stimuli advanced differently earlier in the experiment - what justification does he have for supposing this has changed?\n 2. The LED and chrome pin were not inherently equally attractive to the chicks, so improving experimental technique would inevitably influence the chrome pin results more strongly than the LED results. Thus any trend induced by equally increasing experimental competence with the two stimuli would be a divergent one (as seen), not a parallel one as Sheldrake assumed. I dub this the 'bad product, good salesman' effect: a good salesman will improve the sales of a bad product more significantly than he will improve the sales of a product that sells itself.\n 3. The LED results were experimentally capped, such that it would be impossible for them to exhibit the same trend as the chrome pin results, even if morphic resonance aversion had been removed from the equation by not making the LED-trained chicks sick.",

Either way, if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, it doesn't catch.

It operates across time. Another way of saying this is that time is two-fold. On the one hand, time is in motion. We see this perfectly well all around us, moment to moment. On the other hand, time is perfectly still. We see this within, in our consciousness of presence. No matter what time it is, it's always now. Five minutes ago, now was five minutes ago. Five minutes hence, now will be five minutes hence. Time is absolute presence, and via consciousness we are plugged in, each of us in our mind a microcosm of the absolute presence of time. The material present is always in motion, but the mental present is always the same. Only from the point of view of matter-energy-space is time on the move: one moment disappears as another moment takes it place, and so on. From the point of view of mind, time is not passage but accumulation. The absolute now is always expanding, taking in more and more of the past. The material configuration of a body is always changing, but the presence of its form is absolute. For mind, past is present and therefore always informing what is currently materializing. The now of material presence is locked in the embrace of absolute presence. This is what enables morphic resonance. No need to posit waves of form traversing the universe. \n \n \ndace: \"All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction.\"\n \n No, it has the effect of gradient reduction.

There's no way of understanding the motions of the particles comprising a tornado without considering the telos of gradient reduction. It's not as if abstract laws of physics are determining every little particulate motion. The only law driving the system is the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which demands that in order to maintain active, a system must compensate for energy loss due to entropy by drawing in more energy. This it achieves by reducing a temperature or pressure gradient. \n \n \ndace: \"Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself.

The trends move in opposite directions, not the same direction, as you've asserted.\"\n \n No, they dont. They merely diverge, in the same way that a man whose parachute has worked will diverge from a man whose parachute hasn't.\n \n \n While following up on this discussion, I've discovered that the paper as it originally appears in Biology Forum is not the same as it appears online. Whoever posted the article online messed it up. What is purported to be figure 5 in the online version is actually figure 6. (You'll notice that the two figures are identical). Sheldrake is now aware of the discrepancy, but so far the error remains, so I'll have to describe the actual figure 5, as it appears in Biology Forum 86 (3/4), 1992, 431-44.\n \n First of all, there's no mention of \"test minus control\" on the left side of the figure. These are absolute numbers, not comparisons. Secondly, there are two trend lines, not one. The top line charts the change in latency of control chicks tested on chrome beads while the second line, underneath, charts the change in latency of control chicks tested on yellow LEDs. The top line slants downward while the bottom line slants upward. The three day results are displayed for chrome beads and yellow LEDs, and they clearly match the trend lines.\n \n So, as I said, and as Sheldrake says in his write-up, control chicks demonstrated increasing latency with the yellow LEDs, while they demonstrated decreasing latency with the chrome beads. The trends move in opposite directions, not at different speeds in the same directions. Rose simply left this result out of his analysis, as it contradicted his assumption against biological memory, a.k.a. morphic resonance. \n \n I should add that this is an odd assumption to make, since we experience memory constantly, and we have no reason to believe this experience is based on a computer-like storage of information in our brains. If memory is holistic, meaning not reducible to brains (which merely facilitate our consciousness of memory) then there's no reason to reject a priori the existence of collective memory.\n \n \nThe 'trend' in figure 3 is in no way statistically significant (p=0.6, compared to the typical required value of 0.05). Figure 5 shows the LED results with the chrome pin results subtracted.\n\n \n I apologize for the confusion. Figure 5 as it appears in Biology Forum shows absolute figures, not test minus control. \n \n As to the alleged insignificance of figure 3, even if this is true, it only demonstrates that the experiment should be replicated. A statistically insignificant result becomes significant when it keeps popping up with each replication. \n \n \nThe LED and chrome pin were not inherently equally attractive to the chicks, so improving experimental technique would inevitably influence the chrome pin results more strongly than the LED results. Thus any trend induced by equally increasing experimental competence with the two stimuli would be a divergent one (as seen), not a parallel one as Sheldrake assumed. \n\n \n Sheldrake is not assuming increased competence on the part of the lab-tech throughout the experiment. He and Rose agreed the lab-tech got better initially, not that any further increase in competence occurred. \n \n \nThe LED results were experimentally capped, such that it would be impossible for them to exhibit the same trend as the chrome pin results, even if morphic resonance aversion had been removed from the equation by not making the LED-trained chicks sick.\n\n \n Among control chicks, the yellow LED results did not exhibit the same trend as the chrome results. Aversion to the yellow LEDs increased while aversion to chrome beads decreased. The control chicks appeared to be influenced by the experience of test chicks, which were injected with lithium chloride after pecking the yellow LEDs. This would indicate collective memory. Distressed that his experiment not only failed to falsify but even verified Sheldrake's hypothesis, Rose backed out of his promise of jointly publishing the results.

For representation, the law is A = B (a thought \"stands in\" for the object being thought of). Representation cannot exist in material form, whether in time capsules, books, brains or genes.

Strength comes from foreground while attenuation comes from background.\"\n \n Which has been exactly my point all along: you can't determine the resonant state of two organisms without introducing abstract classifications like 'species' to divide the surrounding world of lifeforms into those which contribute to attenuation and those which do not.\n\n \n Morphic resonance is not based on species identity but on similarity, which could conceivably apply to other species. This is how we can explain parallel evolution, such as the astonishing similarity of marsupial and placental mammals that evolved on different continents. Marsupials fell into the developmental pathways of already-established placentals. No abstract classifications involved.\n \n \nIf you dispense with such classifications, every organism, every single one, operates against exactly the same 'background' spectrum of lifeforms - you just insisted as much by denying that morphic resonance operates across space. Therefore, any two organisms should be subject to the same attenuation of resonance. Only by arbitrarily dividing up the background into 'counts' and 'doesn't count' can you fine-tune attenuation to fit observations. What natural law can you posit that would accomplish such segregation?\n\n \n Morphic resonance, of course. It's for precisely this reason that Sheldrake posits morphic resonance, so as to provide a mechanism by which an embryo is placed under the influence of the appropriate developmental pathway and not simply tossed about on a sea of morphogenetic noise. We resonate with whatever is similar. That's what determines what counts and what doesn't. Sheldrake is proposing that similarity is the mechanism of organic memory. This applies only to organic forms, such as atoms, crystals and complex, self-organized systems, including organisms.\n \n Nonetheless, you've made a really useful observation, one that I've never come across before. Resonance would be different for bacteria than for, say, primates. Contra Gould, evolution does have a direction, from simplicity to complexity (involving ever greater efficiency at gradient reduction and energy harvesting). Since primitive species are more similar to each other than more evolved species, bacteria would experience more background noise relative to foreground information. Perhaps this does mean that resonance is weaker among bacteria than primates. If so, not only does energy efficiency increase with evolution, but so does resonance efficiency.",

   "While following up on this discussion, I've discovered that the paper as it originally appears in Biology Forum is not the same as it appears online. Whoever posted the article online messed it up. What is purported to be figure 5 in the online version is actually figure 6. (You'll notice that the two figures are identical). Sheldrake is now aware of the discrepancy, but so far the error remains, so I'll have to describe the actual figure 5, as it appears in Biology Forum 86 (3/4), 1992, 431-44.\n\n Not having access to that publication I cannot comment on the graph itself. I con only note that none of the trends mentioned in relation to figure 5 are statistically significant in themselves.\n \nSo, as I said, and as Sheldrake says in his write-up, control chicks demonstrated increasing latency with the yellow LEDs, while they demonstrated decreasing latency with the chrome beads. The trends move in opposite directions, not at different speeds in the same directions. Rose simply left this result out of his analysis, as it contradicted his assumption against biological memory, a.k.a. morphic resonance.\n\n He left the result out because a) it was statistically insignificant and b) not backed up by a matching 'trend' in the test chicks. What possible morphic resonance effect would make only the control chicks exhibit increasing aversion to the yellow LED and not the test chicks?\n \nAs to the alleged insignificance of figure 3, even if this is true, it only demonstrates that the experiment should be replicated. A statistically insignificant result becomes significant when it keeps popping up with each replication. \n\n It demonstrates nothing, that's what 'statistically insignificant' means. It's true that repeating the experiment many times would make it finer-grained, allowing smaller trends to be detected with statistical significance, but you can't use this result as any indication that you would expect to find such a trend.\n \n \nSheldrake is not assuming increased competence on the part of the lab-tech throughout the experiment. He and Rose agreed the lab-tech got better initially, not that any further increase in competence occurred.\n\n Incorrect. He makes the statement twice:\n \nNeither Rose nor I anticipated that the latency of the control birds would show a progressive decline, and we agree that this is probably due to an experimenter practice effect. From the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, the important finding is that in the test birds, the experimenter practice effect was counteracted by some other influence.\n\n Clearly he must be talking about the latter part of the experiment which he deems significant, otherwise he would have no reason to talk about the practice effect being counteracted. Earlier on he also says, with regard to figure 2 which shows the control chick trend over the whole of the experiment:\n \n Although neither Rose nor I had anticipated such a trend in the control data, we agree that it was probably due to an experimenter practice effect\n\n It is as I said: Sheldrake (probably rightly) assumes an experimenter practice effect is responsible for the chrome pin trend, but then makes a further unsafe assumption: that the same trend also underlies the LED results. This despite the stimuli being very different (chicks loved the yellow LED and didn't love the chrome pin: my 'good salesman, poor product' effect) and the experimental capping which meant it was impossible for the test chicks to demonstrate the same underlying trend even if nothing were counteracting it.\n \nAmong control chicks, the yellow LED results did not exhibit the same trend as the chrome results. Aversion to the yellow LEDs increased while aversion to chrome beads decreased.\n\n Neither to any degree of statistical significance, and in particular naive test chicks did not exhibit a corresponding trend of aversion to the yellow LED. \n \nThe control chicks appeared to be influenced by the experience of test chicks, which were injected with lithium chloride after pecking the yellow LEDs.\n\n Then why were naive test chicks not similarly affected? Since morphic resonance should have informed both naive groups equally, it seems reasonable to me that the two sets of results should be combined - which eliminates even the insignificant trend observed in the control chicks.",

   "And I disagree that there are no scalable slopes for embryogensis.\n\n Whether or not you disagree is irrelevant. Evolutionary theory states only that we should be able to find a scaleable slope leading to every phenomena we do observe. Since a streamlined embryogenesis of the type you postulate (eliminating gills and swim bladder) is something we don't observe, there's nothing for evolutionary theory to explain. Your challenge to it, on the basis of something we don't see, is therefore meaningless.\n \nYou snipped the most important part. \"Either way\" refers to genetic memory or holistic memory. Either way, if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, the information doesn't catch. You're arguing against your own theory. There isn't even an issue here.\n\n The issue, which you're dodging again, is that you have no working definition of the 'preconditions' for holistic memory. You just make it up as you go along. If some holistic memory goes missing, you just say the preconditions mustn't have been in place. You never have to say what they were or why they were missing.\n \n Please, prove me wrong: describe a consistent scheme under which isolated chicks could 'pick up' something as abstract, esoteric and fleeting as 'don't peck the yellow LED' while a creature reared in captivity would consistently and inevitably fail to pick up on millions of years of 'holistic memory'.\n \n \nA completely groundless claim. Can any observation shake your conviction in genetic reductionism? You see how pointless such ad hominem comments are. They don't move the debate forward.\n\n I did not say you would do that, which would indeed be ad hominem. I merely said you could - which is true. If morphic resonance does not require wild animals to pick up millions of years of accumulated holistic memory, then it certainly doesn't require a few chicks to learn to avoid a yellow LED over a period of a few weeks.\n \n \nObviously morphic resonance is a simpler explanation than relying on storage of relevant information via random genetic mutation. I mean, come on, are you serious? Every time we change our way of thinking or behaving, we have to wait around for just the right mutation in order for it become instinctive? Wouldn't it be simpler if we just resonate with our forebears, so the newly-formed instinct comes through with or without genetic change? \n\n If that's what you think has to happen in every case, I'm not surprised you're turning to morphic resonance :)\n \nBe careful. Occam is a double-edged razor.\n\n Not in this case. We're talking about behaviours animals raised in captivity lack in comparison with their wild cousins. Why is it simpler to first say those behaviours are instinctive and then invent a reason why they aren't being activated, than it is to say the behaviour isn't instinctive and the organism was simply denied the opportunity to learn by example from its parents? \n \nTime capsules do not contain representations.\n\n They do in the book I'm thinking of. \"The End of Time\" if I recall correctly. We're probably not talking about the same thing here.\n \nRepresentation cannot exist in material form, whether in time capsules, books, brains or genes. Representation is strictly a function of mentality. It's the interpretation of material configurations.\n\n That much, at least, is wrong - or at least it's question-begging. For representation to be strictly a function of mentality you would have to prove that mentality is not a function of the material.\n \nSo many questions. I suppose it is possible that abstract laws of physics determine the actions of a tornado. Of course, it's also possible that the devil is responsible for tornadoes. Problem is, from a scientific standpoint, both conjectures have no meaning. The only actual scientific theory anyone has ever come up with to explain tornadoes is based on the subset of physics known as nonequilibrium thermodynamics. I'm sorry if this is not the answer you were hoping for. You need to get yourself up to speed on this. Read Into the Cool by Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan. This is a brilliant book, and best of all, it has nothing to do with Rupert Sheldrake!\n\n I will; it sounds very interesting. But I'm sure you aren't suggesting that the formation of a tornado causes the individual particles of which it is composed to break the laws of physics, hmm? Failing which, they must be in accordance. Nature may abhor a gradient, but it has to play nice when eliminating them.\n \n \nMorphic resonance is not based on species identity but on similarity, which could conceivably apply to other species.\n\n But again, only when it suits you. Placentals and marsupials - yep, there's morphic resonance at work. Two species of bacteria? Well, that depends - have they done anything that looks similar lately? :)\n \nMorphic resonance, of course. It's for precisely this reason that Sheldrake posits morphic resonance, so as to provide a mechanism by which an embryo is placed under the influence of the appropriate developmental pathway and not simply tossed about on a sea of morphogenetic noise. We resonate with whatever is similar. That's what determines what counts and what doesn't.\n\n Inventing morphogenetic noise and then inventing a solution to it doesn't strike me as much progress. In any case, resonating with whatever is similar - fine. The missing variable is the attenutation of that resonance, and what causes that to vary between organism-pairs. You cannot invoke similarity again to define attenuation; it contradicts itself. \n \n Though I despair at the idea of propagating this nonsense further, I can't in good conscience pretend there aren't answers, so here's the one I would favour: there's no variability in attenuation. Morphic resonance, based as it is on form, is incredibly strong between all bacteria - but doesn't have a great deal to do. Rather like the strong forces at work in the nucleus of an atom, genetic/chemical imperatives are overpowering on that scale. Only at the macro scale of intercellular organisation can the comparatively weak marshalling force of morphic resonance make itself felt to any great effect.\n \n There really is no reason to try and explain anything a bacterium does by morphic resonance anyway. Mind you, I feel the same about all organisms but I think the attenuation issue is a killer. Background levels of similarity just won't cut it - you can't seriously suggest that just the right number of bacteria have existed so as to fine-tune morphic resonance attenuation down to the observable (ie species) level. That's just mad. No: better to let genes have their say and postulate morphic resonance as a parallel or layered effect like other exogenous inheritance pathways.",

   "peeling,\n \n That we don't see evolution in embryogenesis is highly significant since it ought to occur, as it would be beneficial to the mother. When you claim that the absence of streamlining means it must be impossible from a neo-Darwinian perspective, you're begging the question. You're assuming that the neo-Darwinian model is the only way evolution can happen, but that's precisely what needs to be proved. \n \n The idea that probabilistic influence is unscientific because it can't be falsified is not a serious claim. Probabilistic causation has been part and parcel of physics since Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, probabilistic behavior is built into the foundation of matter. An electron is literally a probability wave. Does that mean quantum mechanics is unfalsifiable? What about Prigogine's dissipative systems? Do we just toss that out because we can't always predict how such systems will behave? Probabilistic causation is perhaps the single most important trend in modern science. You're way out of the loop on this one. \n \n There's no issue regarding chicks in the lab vs. animals released into the wild. Either way, if the preconditions are met, resonance will occur. If the preconditions have not been met, resonance will not occur. To take the example of language, the precondition is that the baby must be exposed to speech. This applies whether the capacity for language is conveyed via genes or resonance. You're arguing against yourself. I have made this point before, and I will not be making it again. \n \n You can't expect to consistently achieve evolutionary novelty out of gene duplication, symbiosis, sexual recombination or allele fixing. Ultimately, neo-Darwinian evolution depends on random genetic mutation. No, it doesn't necessarily have to happen that way every time, but that's how it would be in most cases, and no, we don't have time to wait around. New behaviors that are beneficial become instinctual very quickly, and clearly the neo-Darwinians (or better yet Wiesmannians) have no explanation.\n \n Your comments are getting increasingly loopy. It's obvious you're tapped out. You're just tossing up anything that sounds like maybe it would refute Sheldrake's hypothesis. At this point, you're working purely on ego. There's no effort whatsoever to arrive at knowledge. Your entire objective here is to avoid conceding error. You lack the character to come clean and admit that your own favored theory might not be right after all and that there are possible alternatives, including Sheldrake's.\n \n The problem is that you have a false sense of security. You figure you've just got to be right, no matter how off base your arguments, simply because you're got the power of the herd backing you up. You're a conformist going along with what you imagine everyone else is saying, an attitude that could hardly be more antithetical to science. \n \n But there's hope for you. Once the power of the cult of determinism has begun to wane, you may just find that your eyes are opening of their own accord. The same cannot be said of elecrolyte, who will take his delusions to the grave. Is this really somebody you want to be ideologically allied with? Check out some of these comments:\n \n \nGenetics is not an assumption. It is known and therefore necessary.\n\n \n No one has ever demonstrated that genes store the information by which an egg develops into an animal. Moreover, no one has even proposed a test which could either verify or falsify this assumption. This is well known among biologists and was reported by Stephen Jay Gould shortly before his death (The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (pp. 201-202). But it matters not to the wide eyed true believer. It is known and therefore necessary!\n \n \nPerhaps the instinct was the cause of the selective advantage. Or perhaps the favorable action increases with certain physiological changes, and since those changes are favorable, they are passed down with further modification until the physiology causes what we arbitrarily call an \"instinct.\"\n\n \n My point was that according to Weismannian theory, some kind of genetic alteration is necessary for newly evolved traits to be inherited. Because electrolyte feels he must disagree with everything I say, here he argues in favor of Lamarckism, whereby traits are passed down simply because they're favorable. \n \n \nAnother round to Mr. of Ockham, but not in your favor.\n\n \n And he thinks he's pulled off some kind of philosophical coup. Pure delusion.\n \n \nThe evidence says that the laws of the universe determine the actions of a tornado.\n\n \n You almost have to admire his childlike certainty. Needless to say, no laws of nature have ever been proposed that would explain something as complex as a tornado. Until non-deterministic, non-equilibrium thermodynamics came along, we had no clue. \n \n \nNone of the evidence says that tornadoes follow the resonance of previous tornadoes.\n\n \n And of course I never said it did, as anyone could easily discover. Yet he makes the point anyway, as if no one is going to figure out he's making a straw man argument. So authoritative is he that no one could possibly question him, any more than he questions himself. \n \n \nWhat the hell do you mean \"have no meaning\"? \n\n \n Uh-oh, getting a little testy. \n \n \nTwo hydrogen atoms spontaneously bond. Does this \"have no meaning,\" too? If this has no meaning, does that mean that spontaneous bonding of hydrogen atoms doesn't occur?\n\n \n Notice that he can't distinguish the bonding properties of atoms, well described in the literature of deterministic physics, and the probabilistic behavior of complex, self-organized dissipative structures such as tornadoes. It's all the same to him, all under the will of God - - er, I mean, deterministic law. \n \n \nAre you really wabbit back for round two?\n\n \n This comment indicates clinical-quality paranoia. Perhaps he'd prefer me to be the wascally wabbit because at a deep unconscious level, he realizes he's Elmer Fudd. \n \n \n\"Organic\"? Look, you may get some kicks using some obscure meaning of \"organic\" while talking about biochemistry, but that's pretty asinine. In this context, \"organic\" refers to the carbon-containing compounds related to organisms. Else, referring to atoms and crystals as \"organic\" just proves that you have no effin' clue what you're talking about.\n\n \n Note that he can't veer from his rigid understanding of a term. He can't adjust his thinking to a different context, in this case the use of \"organic\" to denote any structure that forms organically rather than being stamped into shape by some external pressure. Crystals, for instance, form through a process of crystallization, not because physical pressures determine one form instead of another. Proteins also crystallize. Starting with a simple amino acid chain, proteins develop three more levels of structure, the last of which, the so-called quaternary level, is completely undetermined by physical pressures. Known as the \"multiple-minimum\" problem in molecular biology, the quaternary level of the protein typically has several minimum energy configurations but usually arrives at the \"correct\" configuration. (And when it doesn't arrive at the correct configuration, it is destroyed). From a deterministic standpoint, we have no idea how proteins know which way to fold up. Of course, this is one of literally countless examples of how events in the body are irreducible to matter under the absolute control of abstract, eternal law. The old paradigm is broken, and no amount of whining or gnashing of teeth is going to change that. \n \n In short, peeling, this debate has run its course. I've already given up talking directly to electrolyte, and I will no longer respond to any of your comments regarding the general theory. Do not take my lack of response as confirmation that you've made anything resembling a persuasive argument. As to the particularities of the Rose experiment, I'm still open to further discussion. \n \n Ted Dace",

Indeed, your proposed good salesman-bad product effect is relevant only if the trends were in the same direction. But it turns out the trends moved in opposite directions.

Starting with a simple amino acid chain, proteins develop three more levels of structure, the last of which, the so-called quaternary level, is completely undetermined by physical pressures.\n\n If you mean literal physical pressure (force per unit area), I'm unaware of any research addressing this, although my knowledge of the physical sciences tell me that you're likely wrong. If, however, you mean any physical influence, you're once again dead wrong. Electrostatic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions (and some covalent bonds) determine the quaternary structure of complex proteins.\n \n So, this thing I said about having no effin' clue what you're talking about...

   "That we don't see evolution in embryogenesis is highly significant since it ought to occur, as it would be beneficial to the mother. \n\n By the same logic I ought to be able to fly, as it would help me no end getting to work in the morning. The fact something would be beneficial if it were possible has no bearing upon whether it is possible.\n \nWhen you claim that the absence of streamlining means it must be impossible from a neo-Darwinian perspective, you're begging the question. You're assuming that the neo-Darwinian model is the only way evolution can happen, but that's precisely what needs to be proved.\n\n Eh? You're saying that because we don't see something that existing evolutionary theory doesn't require, we ought to infer the existence of a different process under which the same events would fail to happen?\n \n That's deeply flawed logic.\n \nThere's no issue regarding chicks in the lab vs. animals released into the wild. Either way, if the preconditions are met, resonance will occur. If the preconditions have not been met, resonance will not occur. To take the example of language, the precondition is that the baby must be exposed to speech. This applies whether the capacity for language is conveyed via genes or resonance. You're arguing against yourself. I have made this point before, and I will not be making it again.\n\n Good, because it's irrelevant. \n \n The issue is not that of necessary preconditions. The existence of preconditions for the proper functioning of a system is hardly news. The issue is that the theory of morphic resonance is purely descriptive. The chicks in Sheldrake's experiment could (as indeed they did) show no trend towards increased aversion and it wouldn't put the slightest dent in the theory because that get-out clause is always there: some unknown precondition was not met. While at the same time you're willing to ascribe placental/marsupial similarities to morphic resonance by assuming some vague preconditions are in place. It's a meaningless exercise in cherry-picking.\n \nNew behaviors that are beneficial become instinctual very quickly, and clearly the neo-Darwinians (or better yet Wiesmannians) have no explanation.\n\n Just as with the macaw example that started all this, you're throwing up a strawman. You assume that a tendency toward some new or variant instinctive behaviour must first be invented and then encoded. From that you wrongly deduce that the time available for 'just the right' mutation to occur is impossibly short: a single generation.\n \n If a mutation (or some persistent environmental interaction - let's not get hung up on just genes here) induces a tendency toward some new behaviour, then by the time we observe the behaviour the 'encoding' is already in place. Again, there's no problem for evolutionary theory to solve.\n \nYour comments are getting increasingly loopy. It's obvious you're tapped out. You're just tossing up anything that sounds like maybe it would refute Sheldrake's hypothesis. At this point, you're working purely on ego. There's no effort whatsoever to arrive at knowledge. Your entire objective here is to avoid conceding error. You lack the character to come clean and admit that your own favored theory might not be right after all and that there are possible alternatives, including Sheldrake's.\n\n I was under the impression that ad hominem arguments were... oh, I can't remember exactly; you said there was something wrong with them at any rate.\n \nThe problem is that you have a false sense of security. You figure you've just got to be right, no matter how off base your arguments, simply because you're got the power of the herd backing you up. You're a conformist going along with what you imagine everyone else is saying, an attitude that could hardly be more antithetical to science.\n\n Or perhaps the problem is that you haven't tackled a single one of the criticisms leveled at Sheldrake's experiment, other than to make a series of factually incorrect statements about the contents of his writeup. Or maybe it's that the theory itself is a one-size-fits-all explanation for any conceivable observation, from which we can learn nothing.\n \nBut there's hope for you. \n\n Excellent.\n \nIn short, peeling, this debate has run its course. I've already given up talking directly to electrolyte, and I will no longer respond to any of your comments regarding the general theory. Do not take my lack of response as confirmation that you've made anything resembling a persuasive argument.\n\n The thought never crossed my mind. People with this kind of weight of logic and evidence on their side stop talking to me all the time. I wouldn't let it trouble me if I were you.\n \n RE the experiment:\n \nWhat makes you so sure <the results were not statistically significant<?\n\n Because the significance of the results was stated below the incorrectly pasted graph.\n \nThat's the whole point of the experiment. The test chicks in each successive batch were injected after pecking the yellow LED, so they had no reason over time to show increasing aversion. Yet the control chicks, who were not injected with lithium chloride, did show increasing aversion to the yellow LED. This is what demonstrates collective memory via morphic resonance.\n\n Unfortunately you're wrong again. In each batch all chicks, both test and control, were naive when first exposed to the yellow LED. So why wasn't the (statistically insignificant) trend towards increased aversion exhibited by the control chicks when first exposed to the yellow LED mirrored in the test chicks when first exposed to the LED (ie prior to ever being injected with anything)?\n \n There's no reason not to combine the results of both control and test chicks when assessing whether morphic resonance influenced their naive level of aversion to the yellow LED. Again, you're cherry-picking the results you like and ignoring the ones you don't.\n \nDo you really think you can con me into believing you know the first thing about the mathematics of statistics? Not only would no statistician agree with your statement, but even common sense disagrees. If an experiment produces a finding at variance to probability by .01%, and the experiment is replicated ten thousand times with the same result, then the finding is now considered 100% reliable.\n\n I did not claim otherwise. Indeed I said precisely that: repeating the experiment many times makes it possible to detect smaller effects with greater confidence. What I said is that if you do the experiment once and the results lack statistical significance, you cannot infer any likelihood that they would be borne out were you to repeat the experiment ten thousand times. If you could, you wouldn't need to bother repeating the experiment, now would you?\n \n The results were statistically insignificant. Thus they don't tell you that you should repeat the experiment, and they don't tell you that you shouldn't. They only tell you that the effect, if there is one at all, is likely to be too slight to be detected by that experiment.\n \nI stand corrected regarding the control chicks with the chrome pins. However, Sheldrake couldn't have assumed the same trend occurs with the control chicks and the yellow LEDs, as in this case the aversion increases. \n\n He explicitly states that he does. He assumes that the same trend underlies both graphs, with morphic resonance aversion offsetting that trend in the case of the yellow LED. Read his words:\n \nFrom the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, the important finding is that in the test birds, the experimenter practice effect was counteracted by some other influence.\n\n \nYou're still stuck on the idea that the trends among control chicks were in the same direction regarding chrome pins and yellow LEDs. Indeed, your proposed good salesman-bad product effect is relevant only if the trends were in the same direction.\n\n Which they were. Sheldrake says so:\n \nBoth test and control birds were trained more successfully as time went on; in other words, a higher proportion of the birds pecked at the yellow light or chrome bead within the initial 30s training period. This effect was greatest with the yellow light over the first six days\n\n Look at figure 1 if you don't believe me. See any downward trend at all in that graph?\n \nBut it turns out the trends moved in opposite directions. There was no selling whatsoever of the yellow LED, as control chicks became increasingly averse to pecking it. So it's not as if the experimenter was simply a better salesman with the chrome pin than the yellow LED.\n\n I still can't see the relevant graph, so you'll forgive me for not incorporating it into my argument earlier. The trend towards increased aversion is not statistically significant, and is contradicted in any case by the trend towards increased training success shown in figure 1. Moreover, it is not mirrored in the results of naive test birds prior to injection. Once their results are factored in (and you've no reason for not doing so, since both sets of birds were naive and both ought to have been subject to morphic resonance), the statistical significance drops completely out of sight, from 0.12 to 0.61).\n \nAs to the so-called experimental capping effect, this is unclear. \n\n Sheldrake assumes that if morphic resonance were not occurring, the chrome pin and LED results would exhibit the same experimenter-practice-induced trend towards decreased aversion. But the yellow LED was so attractive that once the experimenter got over their initial fumbling there was no experimental room for the results to exhibit such a trend. Only the less-popular control pin had the necessary experimental headroom to exhibit the trend it did, which enforced a divergence even in the absence of morphic resonance. Which makes the inference of morphic resonance an unsafe deduction.\n \nCheck figure three again. Successive batches of naive chicks showed increasing aversion to pecking the yellow LED. You can claim the result is statistically insignificant, but even if so, it only means the experiment should be replicated.\n\n Look at the P value of that result: 0.61. A 61% chance of getting a result at least that extreme by pure chance. You really can't get much less significant than that. And it doesn't mean the experiment should be replicated: it means nothing.",

From those criticisms of your poor application of logic you have chosen to infer that I am wedded to a particular evolutionary mechanism. I doubt there is anything I can say to convince you otherwise at this point, since you have arrived at what is for you a satisfactory conclusion and will in all likelihood be reluctant to abandon it.\n \n The bulk of my posts has been devoted to a critique of your theory and its supporting evidence. \n \n \nIncredibly, he still thinks he has a point about the invoking of preconditions to evade falsification, though as I've noted twice now, whatever applies to morphic resonance in this context also applies to genetic information.\n\n Noted quite wrongly, however. Hypotheses about particular information being encoded genetically can be positively tested and falsified. No such test exists for morphic resonance - or at least, you seem unable or unwilling to describe one.\n \n Assuming for the sake of argument that I'm right about Sheldrake's experiment and it shows no evidence of morphic resonance at work, would that in any way falsify the theory? This is a question you've avoided answering several times now, I can only surmise because the answer is not favourable to your cause.\n \n \nHe still doesn't get it that embryogenesis ought to have streamlined according to neo-Darwinism but not according to Darwin's view, whereby organisms make adaptations in the context of the outer environment and pass them along to their offspring. \n\n I don't 'get it' because the logic you've tried to wield in support of this misapprehension began poorly and deteriorated as time passed. I get the impression you weren't expecting to be challenged on this point.\n \n In the same empirically-established way that a group of ten bacteria will in all likelihood not hit upon a billion-to-one mutation while a billion-strong colony probably will, it is inevitable that some events - particularly those requiring multiple simultaneous and complementary changes - will be unlikely to occur within the available population. With no evidence to support your case, you've simply asserted that particular optimisations to embryogenesis lie on the scaleable faces of Mt Improbable. There's no way you can make any safe deductions from that. If you had some figures to back you up it would be a different story.\n \nIf genetic mutation is the source of novelty, then it's not the organism doing the work of evolving but its genes. Instead of adapting, the animal can only hope that a useful adaptation will pop up at some point from its germ-plasm. That adaptations must enter the germline in order to be heritable is a problem for neo-Darwinism. Nowhere in his many randomly shifting responses has he demonstrated that he understands this simple point.\n\n Again, because it's not true. There are multiple sources of adaptive novelty. Recombination in sexually reproducing populations, for instance - a mechanism whose potency is only strengthened by the discovery of complex gene regulation. And again, we're standing in the shadow of the macaw strawman: the idea that the particular adaptive mutation or recombination that did happen is the one that species had to wait for.\n \nWhy do certain people make use of their intelligence to evade the truth instead of grasping it? That's really all that's left to discuss here.\n\n Quite.\n \nAs to the Rose experiment, the corrected version is now up. The key findings are contained in figures 3 and 5. Chicks injected with a harmless solution appear to have been influenced by the experience of chicks who were injected with lithium chloride after pecking at a yellow diode.\n\n The results shown in figure 3 are utterly insignificant at p = 0.61. No scientist would infer an effect from such a result.\n \n Figure 5 is more interesting, since the results are at least close to being significant (p = 0.12). When reviewing the updated paper, however, I noticed this for the first time:\n \nIn the initial training period, each chick was exposed to the control or LED for a period of 30s, and the number of seconds taken to the first peck was recorded with a stopwatch. <snip< Chicks that did not peck at all within the test period were recorded as having a latency of 30s, and these \"untrained\" chicks were dropped from the experiment, although they were left in their pens. \n\n Here we find the likely explanation for the (albeit insignificant) control-chick trend observed in figure 5. It also explains why the same trend would not be observed in the naive test chicks.\n \n Consider what is being said above: if a control chick does not peck at all when first presented with the chrome bead, it is removed from the experiment and never exposed to the yellow LED. That means that the 'chrome pin' results in figure 5 are the mean latency of all the control chicks, whereas the LED results in figure 5 are the mean latencies of the control chicks which had already pecked the chrome bead.\n \n In other words, those chicks who were generally sluggish and disinterested were excluded from the second phase of the experiment.\n \n Now consider the experimenter practice effect, which as we've noted Sheldrake invokes throughout the experiment. Look at figure 1. The number of control chicks pecking the chrome bead within 30 seconds progressively increases, which means that as the experiment proceeds, the experimenter's competence induces more and more sluggish, disinterested chicks to make it through to the second phase of the experiment and take a stab at the yellow LED. So rather than not contributing to the LED results at all, they now contribute high latencies, with the inevitable consequence that the proportion of birds with low latencies decreases.\n \n That explains why the same trend is not observed in the naive test chicks: all of them were presented with the yellow LED. There was no previous step to filter out the generally disinterested ones.\n \n A summary of the various 'trends' observed:\n \n 1. Control chick chrome pin mean latencies dropping (fig 5):\n \n As Sheldrake says, experimenter practice.\n \n 2. Control chick yellow LED mean latencies increasing (fig 5):\n \n See figure 1: experimenter practice meant the more sluggardly and disinterested chicks pecked the chrome pin and thus made it through to be tested against the yellow LED, increasing the number of high latencies recorded and thus inducing an apparent upward trend in the mean latencies.\n \n 3. Naive chicks not pecking the yellow LED within 10s (fig 3)\n \n Utterly insignificant result (p = 0.61), and that's even with the false positive from 2) factored in.\n \n 4. Deviation of test and control results (chrome pin vs yellow LED) (fig 4):\n \n Improving salesman vs good product\n \n 5. Deviation of means in control chicks (fig 6):\n \n This is a reformulation of figure 5, adding the two trends together. Unfortunately as noted above the LED trend is induced by the chrome pin trend, so Sheldrake is wrongly doubling up the effect.\n \n I think that more or less takes care of everything. It's nice to have an explanation for the discrepancy between the naive test chicks and the naive control chicks wrt. the yellow LED - at least it saves you from having to invent one.",

If genetic mutation is the source of novelty, then it's not the organism doing the work of evolving but its genes. Instead of adapting, the animal can only hope that a useful adaptation will pop up at some point from its germ-plasm. That adaptations must enter the germline in order to be heritable is a problem for neo-Darwinism. Nowhere in his many randomly shifting responses has he demonstrated that he understands this simple point.\n \n When I point out his obvious inability to concede error, peeling thinks I'm engaging in ad hominem attack. On the contrary, it's something altogether different. What's happening is that the discussion is shifting from the topic at hand to the psychology of willful ignorance. Why do certain people make use of their intelligence to evade the truth instead of grasping it? That's really all that's left to discuss here.\n \n As to the Rose experiment, the corrected version is now up. The key findings are contained in figures 3 and 5. Chicks injected with a harmless solution appear to have been influenced by the experience of chicks who were injected with lithium chloride after pecking at a yellow diode. No point arguing with someone who's ideologically committed to denying the evidence, though I do like peeling's notion of the bad product-good salesman. What he doesn't realize is that he's describing himself, and the product is reductionist biology.\n\n \n I congratulate you on your patience Dace, and for defining so perfectly the frustration shared by many here who disagree with these two posters. Your perceptions in describing their inflexibility as well as lytes constant claims of victory via personally attacking his opposition before he has ever proven or supported anything at all in reality. And Peeling is no better, even though he isn't so offensive in his personal attacks as the one who thinks of him as a god. I fell off my chair at that revelation of how easy it is to gain lytes worship. \n \n Anyway, welcome to the forum, and I hope you'll hang around awhile. Your perspectives are much needed. emoticon_xgood",

   "Wow, no wonder dace thinks Sheldrake's writeup says exactly what dace wants it to say. He's capable of reading anything and thinking it says what he wants it to say. Watch:\n \n \nElectrolyte, who imagines he's being stalked by a wascally wabbit...\n\n Stalked? I don't think this. When did I say this? When did I imply this? I didn't. Yet, here you are making the claim.\n \n \n... can't understand why WW and I would both react the same way to him.\n\n And when did I say this? I have people who wind up on the business end of the Truth Stick of No Mercy\u0099 react in the same general way all the time. It's that the arguments you forward -- every damn one of them -- are incredibly similar, your selective education is incredibly similar, your selective ignorance is incredibly similar, and your reactions are incredibly similar. Seriously, it's like you borrowed his brain (or else he left it in his pants pocket and you happened to find his lost pants).\n \n \nYou see, most people get frustrated talking to someone who can't listen, who can't admit wrong and who loudly proclaims ad nauseum the imagined errors of those who don't see things his way.\n\n See? More similarity. Here, it's the projection we've come to know and love from both wabbit and Archangel. You can't listen: here I am explaining why what you say I said isn't what I said at all; you can't admit wrong: multiple people explained why Sheldrake's analysis is bunk, and Peeling did so exhaustively, but you maintain that it's great evidence for resonancism; you proclaim ad nauseam imagined errors: say, deterministic bias and inability to explain processes at the atomic/molecular level.\n \n \nHe's so fixed in his sense of authority that he can claim I'm wrong about the quaternary structure of protein even though he's not a biologist, and all my information comes from biologists.\n\n You're right: I'm not a biologist. But I'm a biochemist and teacher, and all of my information comes from biochemists and molecular biologists.\n \n \nAll we know is that genes are necessary in the formation of bodies, not that they contain information describing organic structures and instinctive behaviors. But it doesn't matter that I've explained this.\n\n No, that's not \"all we know.\" And -- just like wabbit -- you are trying to impart some meaning of \"information\" upon this topic when there is no reason to do so. Why do these things have to be \"described\" informationally? You whine and moan about Occam's razor, but when faced with a singular solution -- genetics -- you cry that there must be \"information\" and that the answer must be \"genetics and [something else]\" even though you have no evidence for the latter; in other words, you are purposely violating Occam's razor.\n \n \nBut electrolyte doesn't know about NET, so it can't possibly be our current explanation, particularly since it's probabilistic, and our current explanation can only be deterministic.\n\n I'll admit that I should have used more precise wording. My intent was to ask why we need to appeal to morphic resonance. \"What's wrong with our current explanations? How are these phenomena not explainable by appealing to the particles of the system (i.e. why do we need to invoke resonancism)?\" Nothing's wrong, they're not unexplainable, and we don't need to invoke resonancism. If we want to be technical, cell processes are also subject to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, yet we can explain those processes on the molecular level. Now yelling that NET makes you right is... well, dumb.\n \n Also note that despite my multiple responses to your statements in which you claimed to know a lot about crystals, pressures, and protein folding mechanisms, you came back with responses to only a couple. \n \n \nAs to peeling, it seems I've given him too much credit.\n\n Peeling hardly needs me to defend him, but I don't think you've given him possibly enough. Perhaps you're just jealous that he can read.\n \n \nhe [Peeling] assumes it's because no one can keep up with his brilliant argumentation...\n\n No, it's just that you can't. But that's not saying much.\n \n \nAgain, there's no point bothering with someone whose only interest is defense of his own prior belief system.\n\n Pot, kettle. Kettle, pot. Discuss.\n \n \nAs to the Rose experiment, the corrected version is now up.\n\n And Peeling has ripped it (and your other points) to shreds, too.",
