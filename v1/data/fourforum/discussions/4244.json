The greenback responded on Monday, by jumping to three-month highs against the euro.\n \n With the communique from from the G7 meeting in London at the weekend proving to be a non-event, markets seized instead on Greenspan' speech to the meeting, in which he indicated he was now less concerned about the US current account deficit.\n \n Analysts said the Fed chairman sounded a lot more sanguine about the deficit and its likely impact on the $US than he did in November when he warned that there would be a limit to foreigners' willingness to keep adding to dollar balances.\n \n \"The US current account deficit cannot widen forever, but fortunately the increased flexibility of the American economy will likely facilitate any adjustment without significant consequences to aggregate economic activity,\" the chairman said.\n \n Essentially, Greenspan said that market forces and greater budget discipline, as promised by the second Bush administration, would help reduce the record external shortfall without the need for any further correction in currencies.\n \n The speech was seen as significant and offered markets a focal point after the G7 stuck to its existing script on currencies, disappointing those who had expected some concrete action on Chinese exchange rate flexibility.\n \n \"Greenspan's speech should work in reverse, significantly undercutting structural negative psychology toward the US dollar and extending its recovery,\" said Westpac currency strategist Robert Rennie.\n \n \"The risks of a more protracted dollar recovery have risen strongly as a result of the Greenspan current account and Chinese 'now is not the time' comments.\"\n \n In early currency trading on Monday, the $US extended the gains it made on Friday night. The euro was the biggest victim, sliding to three-month lows near $US1.2860. The greenback was steady against the yen at around 104.30 yen.\n \n The Australian dollar managed to hold up relatively well in the face of the euro's decline, easing back below US77\u00a2 but avoiding a dip through technical support at US76.80\u00a2 ahead of the Reserve Bank's monetary policy statement on Monday.\n \n Analysts said the $A was finding support in expectations that the RBA might signal another interest rate rise for the coming months.\n \n \"The Australian dollar remains comfortably in the prevailing US74.5-78\u00a2 range,\" said National Australia Bank analysts in a morning note.\n \n \"Given the price action in the euro, the bias in the currency should be to the downside but there is no doubt that the interest rate carry element is keeping the $A reasonably well supported.\"\n\n \n Just a little backgroud......\n \n Friday I got a call from my brokerage service to let me know that my broker had made an emergency adjustment in some of my currency positions. Friday, Non Farm payroll information for january came out. Estimates put new jobs in the 200,000 range. I did the math myself and calcualted closer to 150,000, a significatn enough loss to effectively tank the dollar, or at least drive it to record lows (was looking for a rougly 100 pip loss to the euro and cable). \n \n The Non farms payroll data came out, and the dollar started to tank....badly. then it turned around and the dollar is trading at a 3 month high. The bulk of this move took only an hour, which I already know because I have an online currency trading account that I generally sit on during such announcements. \n \n \n Greenspans comments were basically that fiscal restrain from washingotn (namely the bush administration) and a weaker dollar would help the current account deficit, as well as stating that asian entities would step in to help stabilise the dollar.\n \n The only conclusion I can come to on this is that Greenspan lied to save the dollar form taking a nast stumble (we have been sitting at a farily important point fo resistance for a while, and breaking that resistance, there is no telling how far the dollar might drop).\n \n Current account deficit is expected to RISE this year, fairly drastically, adn Even Bushs statement support a larger budgetary deficit than last year.\n \n His statements regarding the Asian connection are at 180 degree odds with the statement by Japans central bank spokesperson, who stated that the Japanese were prepared to take measures to bring the yen back to a \"more resoanble\" level (currently the yen is heavily overvalued), but he specifically stated that the Japanese would not move to attempt to stabilise the dollar this year. He called the effort \"hopeless\".\n \n It seems to me that greenspans comment was simply made to counteract the poor economic report. I can only imagine that, this being Greenspans last year, his is worrying about what the history books will say about him (since fed cahriman has become an important enough role that history books will almost certainly be including them). \n \n Anybody have a take on this one? When I called my broker friday afternoon to see waht he thought he said \"This is the first time in 35 years that I have no cohenrent thoughts. I am flabberghasted. Everything he said was either a half truth or an outright lie. In the old days, when only professionals played the currency market, his comments would have changed nothing. Since online trading has become popular, there are enough amateurs out there to change the market\"\n \n I personally can only imagine that the market has been so keen to hear ANY good news about the dollar that when a litlte came, they were just so excited that they overplayed it.\n \n I still cannot understand why Greenspan got up there and made statements that he absoltuly must know to be untrue. What did he hope to accomplish? Already the market seems to be correcting itself (dollar is falling tonight). Was he just afraid of what may happen if it fell below current psychologically important resistance levels? \n \n Even his statement about the decresing US dollar helping the current account deficit was only a half truth when you consider manufaturing numebrs, NFP numbers, and export pricing margins (which are way up, due to us having to pay more for the imported componants that the majority of our exports are assembeled from).",

I spent the majority of the weekend wading through economic data trying to figure out if I had missed something (It would have had to have been something pretty major). Even if you view everything in the most favorable light, and make some pretty serious postive assumptions, I just cant reconcile Greenspans statements with anything resembling fact. I am glad I am not loosing it.",

I am glad I am not loosing it.\n\n \n The administration's 2006 budget went to congress and that's also a complete sham. Not only is there an increase of 4.8% for military spending with corresponding domestic program cuts, it doesn't include costs for Afghanistan/Iraq and even more important, there's no reduced revenue reflection for their asinine tax cuts included in the projected deficit. Any American who doesn't understand those simple numbers and supports them deserves to live in abject poverty. \n \n Cheney has already announced what the administration terms feasible plans to increase public debt in compensating SS fund payouts to allow younger workers to divert a percentage of SS contributions into private funds. He stated in the neighborhood of $750 billion a year, politicians being what they makes that at least $1.5 trillion, about a 14% increase in our GDP facilitated by public debt. At the same time, Bush, separately, announced that all workers born before 1950 will not see any decrease in their SS benefits to preserve political support from that large sector. Japan and China both know that's an attempt to use additional public debt in an effort to drive equity markets and consequently GDP with younger worker private contributions and public debt, which will benefit them (China/Japan) on a short-term basis with expanded consumer purchases. 2% of payroll from what is becoming a youthful work force is a big chunk of money, and so is the public debt required to replace it. IMO, that's the reason Japan will remain uncommitted in helping the dollar (but will) and China continued its prudent monetary policy.\n \n You're correct about everyone and their brother now being in the currency game. Large institutions are now mixing currency trade gains in with other fee income structures to show positive numbers because those other business segments, primarily advisory in nature, have declined in scope due to reduced domestic industrial activity. \n \n Servicing existing and future debt is still the primary issue. As long as an administration can continue to load an apathetic, ignorant public with debt, service it and keep the false economy expanding, both primary China and secondary beneficiaries Japan and other nations who plan to service China are aided in their long-term goal to replace US consumer markets with China's population. The longer we can keep all those balls in the air, the smoother that transformation will be. Every treasury issue for deficit spending purposes is just another nail in our financial coffin.",

Any American who doesn't understand those simple numbers and supports them deserves to live in abject poverty. \n\n \n AND this just came across the wire not long ago:\n \n \n[FED\"S GRMALICH ON US ECONOMY] Gov. Gramlich is on the wires, saying that the US economy is doing \"well\" and it is \"less vulnerable\" to oil shocks now. However, he would like to see the jobless rate fall faster although the economy is \"not far\" from full employment. Like other Fed officials, he says the government needs to reduce the budget deficit. On the matter of foreign CB buying of Tsys, he notes that such buying by Japan and China has helped to support the dollar's value and hurt the Euro in the process. \n \n \n Now, we all know that a budget release like we are seeing should tank the dollar badly. In 45 minutes, we will have the projected real deficit numbers, and the deficit increase that we all know is there should be devastating, just like the NFP numbers should have been. Immediately prior to the budget release, we have another FED official coming out and making half true statements (sure, the economy is less vulnerable to oil shock....we are used to $50 per barrel oil now).\n \n I did a little research and found that Greenspan scheduled his own speech, and things were running just a little behind. I think he specifically scheduled it to coincide with the release of the damaging NFP data. This looks like a concerted effort by the fed to keep the dollar up.\n \n \nCheney has already announced what the administration terms feasible plans to increase public debt in compensating SS fund payouts to allow younger workers to divert a percentage of SS contributions into private funds. He stated in the neighborhood of $750 billion a year, politicians being what they makes that at least $1.5 trillion, about a 14% increase in our GDP facilitated by public debt. At the same time, Bush, separately, announced that all workers born before 1950 will not see any decrease in their SS benefits to preserve political support from that large sector.\n\n \n In addition to a drive for GDP increase, the additional money will help support our equity markets, which are already due for a pretty major correction. It will be interesting to see what the public has to say about the incurred debt that comes with this. My own guess....nobody will even notice.\n \n \nJapan and China both know that's an attempt to use additional public debt in an effort to drive equity markets and consequently GDP with younger worker private contributions and public debt, which will benefit them (China/Japan) on a short-term basis with expanded consumer purchases. 2% of payroll from what is becoming a youthful work force is a big chunk of money, and so is the public debt required to replace it. IMO, that's the reason Japan will remain uncommitted in helping the dollar (but will) and China continued its prudent monetary policy.\n\n \n I know that Japan and China will continue to intercede on the dollars behalf, but I don't think we will see nearly the level of cooperation that we have in the past. The Japanese have always played kind of a shell game when it came to the value of the dollar. They would accept low value dollars as payments for exports, then drive the value of the dollar up until the Yen was trading in the 125 range, then they would cash out into either yen or euros, and let the dollar fall. They can't seem to get the dollar high enough to put the yen at 125 to save their souls these days (a smaller number on the yen means it is more valuable, for those who do not follow such things). \n \n The Chinese will I think this year peg the yuan to a basket of currencies as opposed to just the dollar. Currently, the yuan is badly undervalued. It seems to me that they are looking for a breakaway point that will maximize return. I really do envy the Chinese. All they have to do to double their net worth is unpeg the yuan from the dollar. But that America had such problems. \n \n \nYou're correct about everyone and their brother now being in the currency game. Large institutions are now mixing currency trade gains in with other fee income structures to show positive numbers because those other business segments, primarily advisory in nature, have declined in scope due to reduced domestic industrial activity. \n \n \n I do not think this is good for the currency market. 5 years ago, when the market was still limited, Greenspan could have come out and said something like that and everybody would have looked at their scratch pads and gone \"the guys on crack\" and things would have continued normally. The currency market was always incredibly cyclic. It was fairly easy to sit down in January with your broker and outline a strategy for the first half of the year, then sit down in July and revise the strategy. \n \n Currently I have 2 currency accounts running. One is a long term account. I still run it the same way, basically 1 strategy for 1st and 2nd quarter, then a change for 3rd quarter, and if I see something that looks promising from a profit standpoint (like the shortfall I saw coming in NFP numbers), I give the broker a call and let him know how I want to be positioned. Now my brokerage has some software you can download to micromanage your account. I have not downloaded it, since it is a long term account, the last thing I want is to be playing with it. I have a good broker who makes good emergency moves when needed, so I really don't need to mess with it.\n \n My second Currency account is strictly on online account though RJOFX. I don't keep much money in it, just enough to play a couple dozen full lots at 100:1. It is largely what I do when I am having a slow day at the office or can't sleep at night but am too tired to really do anything. I use the proceeds from it to buy things that I want, but the wife doesn't want me to have :) It really is interesting sometimes to watch it minute by minute, or in 15 or 20 minute chunks. The market has become totally destabilized now that it is so easy to trade and every tom dick and harry is in on it. It is not uncommon to see a 150 pip swing in an hour for no apparent reason. You don't even need any brains to trade like that. You just sit and look at the graph and when your currency has built some momentum, you open a position. When it looks like the momentum is starting to slow, you close it.\n \n The problem with this is that the currency market used to be primarily controlled by professionals, or at least folks who were up on economic matters enough that a statement like that from Greenspan would not have done much to or for the market. Now that non professionals are doing a lot of trading, and folks who have no idea which end of the economy the GDP comes out of, the market is a roller coaster on a daily basis. While the long term trends do still hold, it is at the point that toward the end of second quarter, when it is time to liquidate and reverse your positions, it is worth it to sit on a live chart all day. It can mean a difference of $10 or $12 thousand.\n \n \n \nServicing existing and future debt is still the primary issue. As long as an administration can continue to load an apathetic, ignorant public with debt, service it and keep the false economy expanding, both primary China and secondary beneficiaries Japan and other nations who plan to service China are aided in their long-term goal to replace US consumer markets with China's population. The longer we can keep all those balls in the air, the smoother that transformation will be. Every treasury issue for deficit spending purposes is just another nail in our financial coffin.\n\n \n This is the real issue, I think. I don't think that most Americans realize that this years budget dwarfs last years, or that the majority of Bush's 150 program cuts will not go through, we will be lucky if 1/3 of them make it. Military spending is UP, despite the fact that there are articles out there that have the word \"reduction\" in them, it is, in fact, WAY, WAY up when you consider not only the budgetary increase but the increase in discretionary military spending that we expect to see this year. I REALLY don't think they realize the effect that an additional 1.5 trillion per year in debt spending for a SS overhaul will have. \n \n I hope your average American does not have a problem with eating out of garbage pails and butchering the neighbors pets for food.",

There is no way that they are going to cut all the spending programs Bush has proposed (at least I hope not, since a few of them, like perkins loans, are good programs). In addition, you are correct in that not one provision was made for decreased revenues. Quite the opposite seems to be the case, there seems to be an assumption of increased tax revenues. \n \n When you figure in an extra 100 billion for the domestic programs that will not be cut, the shortfalls from the tax cuts, discretionary spending, and the fact that Bush seems to be taking the hardline in regards to militray spending (he is not going to accept any less that the 4.8% incraese proposed) and the fact that the 2% increse for foreign aid is really mandatory, since most of our foreign aid money for this budget cycle has already been promised as bribes for being members of the coalition of the coerced, $457 billion seems extremely conservative.",
