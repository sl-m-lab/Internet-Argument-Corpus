I'm sure the contributors so far are well-versed and may think this is old hat, but perhaps, if you don't mind, could fashion an argument for fresh ears? \n\n I could go over some of my beliefs (which have been stated before) but this would upset too many evolutionists, so I won't, at this time... except to outline one...\n There is more than one theory of evolution.\n There is Darwinism, which states that everything we have came about simply by chance mutation. This is materialist evolution. It is the belief that all that is came about through material, or physical process - that there was nothing 'super-natural' at work, at all.\n There is the theory of evolution that some believe still can't account for how man came into being, and therefore God was at work somewhere. Michael Behe claims to believe in evolution, but also he states that there are some components that can't have come about by chance. Therefore these things, such as the machine that is the flagellum of a bacteria (the whip-like device that enables it to swim) are signs that a creator was at work.\n There's also different versions of each of these. Take Darwinism; there's the gradualist change scenario, then there's the moderately fast, to the very fast change (sometimes called 'monsterism').\n Also, within the materialist versions, there are some few who believe that aliens were at work shaping us. They deem that this doesn't fall into 'super-natural' categories, because the aliens were 'real' and physical in the sense that you and I are real. Francis Crick, the Nobel Prize winner believed that aliens are responsible for life-on-earth, though some might argue that this is nothing to do with evolution, it still is important for materialist evolutionists to ask 'where did it actually begin?'\n Even within the gradualist, Darwinist version, there are versions. :)\n There is a theory that we evolved in Africa, and then spread-out. Then there's the one that we spread-out first, then evolved later.\n There's different emphasis placed depending whether you're a western capitalist or a communist.\n Communist or Marxist theories of evolution will show that man evolved using his tool-making ability, and worked collectively.\n Capitalists are more 'survival of the fittest' types - competition leads to survival.\n Some people cry out in protest at these reminders, saying that they are in fact philosophies of science - but to many of the proponents, they ARE science, and the others are mere philosophies... because they have the evidences to back up their versions. For instance, Marxists can trace there line back to Engel's who studied the formation of tools and deduced that labour was crucial to the development of higher thinking in the early-man-brain.\n Why is this upsetting for evolutionists?\n They like to present a case that there's one evolution - with the answers -v- religion in all its many forms. They typically ask - 'If religion is true - which one?'\n \nI voted for the first choice as it fits quite comfortably in my overall philosophy. But an immediate question: If one believes the hand of God was necessary to fashion this environment and all its creatures, is it necessary to also believe it is only this world in which he expended his time and energy?\n I hope the question isn't too far afield.\n\n I can respond, but it won't be much of an answer. As far as beings on other planets, I don't know of anything in Orthodoxy (my faith) that deals with them. Excepting as they appear in the form of 'alien visitors'. The late Fr. Seraphim Rose wrote \"Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future\" who claims that these aren't aliens, but demons. If you want to dispute this, that's fine, I won't argue here for or against.",

   "As usual, Montalban distorts and misrepresents evolutionary biology. I think that at root is his failure to understand science as well as his desire to somehow give his faith some sort of legitimacy.\n \n After his trite poll in which he sloppily presents only three distorted and artificial choices, he responds to Ursus martimus by asking, \"Is it the materialist evolutionary theory that you believe in?\" Surely Ursus martimus was clear in his statement. What is it that Montalban didn't understand. Perhaps Montalban is confused. He following posts certainly seem to make that apparent. He mixes his distorted philosophical concerns with incorrect refferences to science, as if they were the same. It is clear that Montalban's objection is to evolutionary theory, since he puts considerable effort into distorting and misrepresenting that. Funny that he doesn't make any references to materialist physics theory, or materialist geology theory, or materialist astronomy theory. Why not?\n \n Among all of the distorted philosophical babble that he pretends is science, Montalban claims that he won't state his beliefs because it would \"upset\" too many evolutionists. Actually, not one evolutionist cares what Montalban believes. The problem is that Montalban gets laughed at when he states his beliefs so he is reluctant to do so.\n \n Let's look at some of Montalban's gross misrepresentation. He says, \"There is more than one theory of evolution.\" Certainly there is, but not in the way that Montalban means. Darwin actually stated 5 separate theories of evolution, each of which can be evaluated and tested separately.\n \n 1) Evolution as such: The idea that lineages of organisms change over time. An old idea by the time Darwin expressed it. One risks looking foolish for opposing the idea.\n \n 2) Gradualism: differences between populations of organisms accumulate by a series of innumerable small steps through intermediate forms.\n \n 3) Population speciation: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population over time.\n \n 4) Common descent: species have diverged from common ancestors and thus comprise a great tree of life. Creatiionists object to this most strongly because it conflicts with ancient Hebrew mythology.\n \n 5) Natural selection: All organisms produce so many offspring that the population would increase exponentially if not constrained, and yet, adult populations tend to remain relatively constant. The limited resources in any environment limit population size. Thus, all organisms are constantly competing for available resources. In all populations there is great variability such that no two indivicuals are exactly the same. Among the variable characteristics some lend an advantage in the competition for resourses and these organisms are more likely to reach maturity and to reproduce.\n \n The above is a brief statement of Darwinism - specifically, the theories as stated by Darwin. Compare that to the muddled statement by Montalban: \"Darwinism...states that everything we have came about simply by chance mutation.\" How interesting since Darwin never mentioned mutation, and in fact, whouldn't have known what it meant if he heard it.\n \n Montalban goes on, \"This is materialist evolution. It is the belief that all that is came about through material, or physical process - that there was nothing 'super-natural' at work, at all.\"\n \n I imagine that there may be people who believe that. I suspect that Richard Dawkins might agree, but as a matter of philosophy and (lack) of religious belief. But it certainly isn't a statement about the biological theories of evolution, any more than it is a statement about physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, or even plumbing for that matter.\n \n Science is actually naturalistic, not materialistic. Montalban will probably cite several sources that use the word materialistic (mostly creationists as for example the pages of Harun Yahya, the Turkish Muslem). But for the most part they have the same purpose, to misrepresent evolutionary theory in order to make his own credence in mythology seem acceptable. Many creationists also like to use the word \"atheist\" in the discussion but always seem to limit the connection to biology.\n \n And Montalban represents the views of the old earth creationist, Michael Behe as a \"theory of evolution.\" Montalban flatters Behe. Behe has been debunked by a number of evolutionary biologists. His work was never published in peer reviewed literature and isn't part of the theory of evolution.\n \n And Montalban seems to think that personal beliefs of different people have the status of scientific theory. At one point he even acknowledges that these are merely expressions of religious philosophy and then finish by disingenuously representing evolution as antireligious philosophy.\n \n As I mentioned, science is naturalistic and evolution is a scientific theory. That means that science is limited to the study of what is natural, not because science denies that there are also other important things worthy of consideration, but because they can't be measured by science. If I am wrong, then I ask that Montalban quantify his god for us so that he may be included in scientific study.\n \n Montalban does ask a really good question, \"If religion is true - which one?\" Unfortunately he doesn't answer.\n \n Other comments:\n \n Punctuated equilibria was a theory formulated by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. Funny how creationists always leave out Dr. Eldredge. Perhaps because Dr. Gould popularized it in his magazine articles and few creationists actually are aware of the scientific literature. The theory is a variation of gradualism. It is not now and never was proposed to be the way that all evolution occurs. It is often called punk eek for short. It is not saltationism (of Richard Goldschmidt). In fact the evolution/replacement that the theory proposes was observed in the fossil record by both scientists.\n \n Goldschmidt's theory (now discredited) was not known as monsterism. I did a google search for 'Goldschmidt monsterism' and both references turned out to be Montalban posting on 4Forums.com. I did a search for 'monsterism biology' and got more discussion boards with posts by Montalban, along with a few other fundamentalist christian references. Goldschmidt's theory was called saltationism. A saltation is a jump. It was sometimes scornfully called the \"hopeful monster\" theory.\n \n The rest of what Montalban has to say is religious babble wherein he assumes a position of superiority by attributing attitudes and beliefs of which he disapproves to others. For example, he says, \"And of course, materialist evolution doesn't really have a purpose anyway. If you want a purposeless existence, other than what you make of things yourself, then evolution is good - except it doesn't explain why you have your own purpose.\"\n \n Actually, real evolution doesn't have a purpose either even without the misrepresentation as a nihilistic philosophy. And of course, those who disagree with him have a purposeless existence, unless you happen to be able to find a purpose for yourself. Apparently Montalban must be told his purpose by reading Hebrew law and mythology. Funny though that he doesn't seem to have paid much attention to the law about bearing false witness.\n \n And, of course, evolution isn't meant to explain why anyone would have a purpose. Evolution is a scientific theory meant to explain the observations of the natural world that have been observed. It is meant to explain how the changes we see in living things happen. But since Montealban requires purpose to be imposed on him from outside, he is unable to arrive at purpose for himself.",

THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM LESS IMPORTANT TO HUMANS! Please understand that. This does NOT make them any less important. I am a human, as are you. These are things we can experience or observe, and they have a real impact on our lives. Knowing where they come from and why is JUST as important as what they are. Don't you agree?? Don't you think understanding leads to a greater appreciation of most things in life? Understanding it's origins does NOT diminish it's worth..unless you know something I don't. We applaud the grass roots presidents that arose from meager beginings to greatness, why can you not accept those same meager beginings of life, and the greatness that now allows us to even discuss the matter electronically, on the other side of the earth???

If you want a purposeless existence, other than what you make of things yourself, then evolution is good - except it doesn't explain why you have your own purpose.\n\n \n What is this \"purpose?\" You're reasoning is so scary. Because the most well accepted theory about how life on earth originates doesn't give you the answer you specifically want, you don't want to accept it? That's disappointing.

But of course, they fail to apply this line to their own beliefs in evolution - or atheism, or both.\n\n Religion isn't brought up because it's a non-issue. There is nothing in the physical universe that points to their being deities, or divine influence, or anything like that. That's why it's not addressed, it's not real, and we have no reason to believe it \"may\" be real, so it's simply not something anyone has any information to work with.\n \n \nI recognise the revelations God has made in my life.

   "But Hopeful Monster escapes me. Most theories have names that capture the essence of the idea, but what are we to make of this one? That Godzilla may be real? Or one jump away from real?\n\n As biologists came to understand genetics and realize that it was the mechanism it explained both the reasons why offspring resembled their parents and why it also explained genetic diversity in populations, several old lines of investigation were debunked and new lines arose.\n \n A discovery of Mendel's work in genetics discredited Neo-Lamarckism, the idea that modifications acquired during the lifetime of an organism could be passed on.\n \n Several theories of orthogenesis arose. These theories proposed that variation is directed toward some fixed goals. I heard of these theories as part of introductory studies in evolutionary theory. These theories were mostly attempts by paleontologists to explain observations. These have now been debunked and are only proposed only by creationists.\n \n Finally, there is a set of theories known as mutationsim. These theories were based on the principles of Mendelian genetics, which gave them some import at the time. Darwin had maintained that slight differences among individuals that make up the continuous variation of a population are the characteristics upon which natural selection acts to gradually change a species. Hugo De Vries (who coined the term \"mutation\") proposed that each genetic change produced a new species. That view has been shown to be extreme in the extreme. Individual mammals have been found to have between 10 and 100 mutations.\n \n But Goldschmidt was a geneticist. About 1940 he proposed that the mutations that caused the origin of new species and higher taxa was fundamentally different from changes within species. Goldschmidt proposed that occasionally a mutation occurred that caused a drastic changes that reorganize the whole genome of the organism. These were the \"hopeful monsters.\" Most were deleterious, but a few would be progenetors of a new species and new genra.\n \n The standard view is that Goldschmidt's theory is incorrect. For the most part, evolution seems to procede at a gradual pace. Sometimes, in a stable environment, there may be no observable change in morphology for great lengths of time. In rapidly changing environments, organisms must either adapt or go extinct, and thus they exhibit relatively rapid change (over only a few million years).\n \n But while Goldschmidt's \"hopeful monsters\" theory has been debunked as the primary means of the origin of species and higher taxa, some recent research has indicated that a single mutation in a HOX gene (a complex of several gene clusters on several chromosomes that control the sequences of embryo development), may have significant effect. A single observed mutation of a HOX gene in a shrimp surpressed the development of abdominal appendages. It had only the cephalic and thoracic appendages (i.e., the swimmerets were totally absent). The offspring were viable and fertile. A mutation that has this effect has been hypothesized as necessary for the separation of insects and arachnids from crustaceans. It is likely that HOX gene mutations may have been part of the many changes that caused this separation.\n \n I hope this has been helpful.",

What is it that Montalban didn't understand. Perhaps Montalban is confused.\n\n I asked Ursus to explain himself. He hasn't. It might be that you think you know what he has said. I don't. Hence I ask questions. This might alarm someone such as yourself. Not only am I not allowed to state beliefs, I'm not allowed to seek clarification. Very droll.\n \n He following posts certainly seem to make that apparent. He mixes his distorted philosophical concerns with incorrect references to science, as if they were the same. It is clear that Montalban's objection is to evolutionary theory, since he puts considerable effort into distorting and misrepresenting that. Funny that he doesn't make any references to materialist physics theory, or materialist geology theory, or materialist astronomy theory. Why not?\n\n I have no problem with things that are material. I exist in a material sense. But is all that I am, material? Ungerdunn seems not to understand this. Rather than ask, he simply engages in this very funny post of his. I am unaware of engineers producing any documents on human emotions, but I believe evolutionists have. Hence, I ask how do evolutionists explain these things. Or, should I ask engineers Ungerdunn? Can you reference any works on the matter that I might consult. Your funniest post yet!\n \n Among all of the distorted philosophical babble that he pretends is science, Montalban claims that he won't state his beliefs because it would \"upset\" too many evolutionists.\n\n I have obviously upset you\n \n Actually, not one evolutionist cares what Montalban believes.\n\n Now enter the sweeping emotive cry. Ungerdunn is able to speak for all evolutionists! Bravo.\n \n The problem is that Montalban gets laughed at when he states his beliefs so he is reluctant to do so.\n\n Yes you have laughed. And I have laughed at you... I do so as I write.\n \n Let's look at some of Montalban's gross misrepresentation. He says, \"There is more than one theory of evolution.\" Certainly there is, but not in the way that Montalban means\n\n That simply isn't true. Note this article is not pro-Creationist\n \"So, what does it mean to say that evolution is also a theory? For scientists, evolutionary theory deals primarily with how evolution occurs, not whether it occurs - this is an important distinction lost upon creationists. There are different theories of evolution which can contradict or compete with each other in various ways and there can be strong and sometimes quite acrimonious disagreement between evolutionary scientists regarding their theories.\"\n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/evo/blfaq_evo_fact.htm\n It then goes to deal with Gould who recognises 'data' might be the same, but how one interprets it, differs greatly. Hence I state the fast, the slow, the moderate change theories. That is only one plane of difference.\n There's those involved in trying to work God into the theory. Though for most evolutionist sites they believe that this is dangerous, there is a group of people, such as Behe who believe that certain inferences can be drawn from the evidences found by science that suggest God's hand must be there.\n Also, there have historically been different theories. There's Darwinism, and now neo-Darwinism.\n \"What is your opinion of the Holy Father's message to the Pontifical Academy of Science?\n MARCOZZI: The Holy Father's message contains no specific recognition of Darwin or his theories. \n John Paul II is proceeding along the doctrinal lines traced by the Popes before him. There are many different theories of evolution. \n It is possible to accept evolution as a theory, while affirming that the spiritual and philosophical elements must remain outside the competence of science.\"\n http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Inside/01-97/creation.html\n Darwinism, and it's modern spawn are theories of evolution that are not accepted by Catholics - whilst they still accept the possibility of 'evolution'\n \"Dr. Simpson had defined the theory by suggesting: \n First, there is the theory of evolution in the strict sense. This states that all living organisms have evolved from common ancestors in a gradual historical process of change and diversification. The theory rejects the notion that all organisms were designed and created at the beginning of time (1957, pp. 25-26, emp. added).\n http://www.apologeticspress.org/rr/rr1996/r&r9608a.htm\n This is the theory that Catholics would reject. Ungerdunn is in a bit of a bind here because one of the playboys of evolution - Dawkins obviously believes this too, even if Ungerdunn does not - Ungerdunn thus proves this argument of mine. There's the version of evolution that Ungerdunn has, and the one Dawkins has.\n \nDarwin actually stated 5 separate theories of evolution, each of which can be evaluated and tested separately.\n 1) Evolution as such: The idea that lineages of organisms change over time. An old idea by the time Darwin expressed it. One risks looking foolish for opposing the idea.\n 2) Gradualism: differences between populations of organisms accumulate by a series of innumerable small steps through intermediate forms.\n 3) Population speciation: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population over time.\n 4) Common descent: species have diverged from common ancestors and thus comprise a great tree of life. Creationists object to this most strongly because it conflicts with ancient Hebrew mythology.\n 5) Natural selection: All organisms produce so many offspring that the population would increase exponentially if not constrained, and yet, adult populations tend to remain relatively constant. The limited resources in any environment limit population size. Thus, all organisms are constantly competing for available resources. In all populations there is great variability such that no two individuals are exactly the same. Among the variable characteristics some lend an advantage in the competition for recourses and these organisms are more likely to reach maturity and to reproduce.\n\n What are we to make of the following...\n Eldredge and Gould quoted from Darwin in their 1972 paper to establish their concept of phyletic gradualism. They claim that Darwin set the task of later workers to search out confirmation of phyletic gradualism. That view is, unfortunately, just so much hokum.\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/punc-eq.html\n They don't seem to think that PunkEek falls into line with Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism). Does this mean that it's not an 'alternative' view of evolution, even though they don't mesh?\n \n The above is a brief statement of Darwinism - specifically, the theories as stated by Darwin. Compare that to the muddled statement by Montalban: \"Darwinism...states that everything we have came about simply by chance mutation.\" How interesting since Darwin never mentioned mutation, and in fact, wouldn't have known what it meant if he heard it.\n\n You mix \"Darwinism\" with \"Evolution\". Further I said \"Darwinism\" not Darwin. Many people have taken the reigns since he lived - though you might be able to argue whether I should have said 'neo-Darwinism', but you don't.\n \n Montalban goes on, \"This is materialist evolution. It is the belief that all that is came about through material, or physical process - that there was nothing 'super-natural' at work, at all.\"\n I imagine that there may be people who believe that. I suspect that Richard Dawkins might agree, but as a matter of philosophy and (lack) of religious belief. But it certainly isn't a statement about the biological theories of evolution, any more than it is a statement about physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, or even plumbing for that matter.\n\n You suspect correct. Dawkins believes that a material process is all that there is. This is one version of evolution. Another is held by many theists who believe that God was behind it.. at various stages.\n \n Science is actually naturalistic, not materialistic. Montalban will probably cite several sources that use the word materialistic (mostly creationists as for example the pages of Harun Yahya, the Turkish Muslem). But for the most part they have the same purpose, to misrepresent evolutionary theory in order to make his own credence in mythology seem acceptable. Many creationists also like to use the word \"atheist\" in the discussion but always seem to limit the connection to biology.\n\n You've made this howler before.\n And I've stated\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601_1.html\n before too. It is to rebuke a belief that the materialism of evolution does not discount God. But in doing so, it admits the materialist nature of evolution. Although I've stated this before, Ungerdunn may well be suffering from amnesia.\n Here's another\n \"Due to their preconceptions and bias for materialism, evolutionists have blinded themselves to seeing design.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI402.html\n They claim that this is a 'false idea' of creationists. Not the bias for materialism, but for the inability to see design. They don't even debate that evolution is materialist.\n It is sad that Ungerdunn, who's seen this before would pretend that I would not go review it again. Some people accept help. Others don't.:)\n \n And Montalban represents the views of the old earth creationist, Michael Behe as a \"theory of evolution.\" Montalban flatters Behe. Behe has been debunked by a number of evolutionary biologists. His work was never published in peer reviewed literature and isn't part of the theory of evolution.\n\n Ungerdunn simply states that Behe has been debunked. And you just have to accept that it is true. Behe states that he does believe in material processes at work, but he does also believe that certain process can't be material. This is itself, another version of evolution. Simply re-labelling him as 'an old earth creationist' is another Ungerdunn slight of hand.\n \n And Montalban seems to think that personal beliefs of different people have the status of scientific theory. At one point he even acknowledges that these are merely expressions of religious philosophy and then finish by disingenuously representing evolution as antireligious philosophy.\n\n Another rhetorical ploy. Dismissing Behe's views as 'personal opinion'. Behe is a scientist, expert in his field.\n \n As I mentioned, science is naturalistic and evolution is a scientific theory. That means that science is limited to the study of what is natural, not because science denies that there are also other important things worthy of consideration, but because they can't be measured by science. If I am wrong, then I ask that Montalban quantify his god for us so that he may be included in scientific study.\n\n Only relatively recently have scientists been materialistic in its outlook Ungerdunn simply assumes that this is science.\n \nMontalban does ask a really good question, \"If religion is true - which one?\" Unfortunately he doesn't answer.\n\n I merely state the ploy evolutionists use... I take no credit for it, but you credit me with it, because it helps your own emotive argument - using another slight of hand.\n \nThe rest of what Montalban has to say is religious babble wherein he assumes a position of superiority by attributing attitudes and beliefs of which he disapproves to others. For example, he says, \"And of course, materialist evolution doesn't really have a purpose anyway. If you want a purposeless existence, other than what you make of things yourself, then evolution is good - except it doesn't explain why you have your own purpose.\"\n\n Ungerdunn again shows his narrow focus is science, not the study of knowledge. Somehow he believes that scientific knowledge has been wrought out of the ether freed from the foibles of the men working on it. These 'super-men' unencumbered by any of the processes that form the bias of any of us mere mortals are his new gods.\n \n Actually, real evolution doesn't have a purpose either even without the misrepresentation as a nihilistic philosophy. And of course, those who disagree with him have a purposeless existence, unless you happen to be able to find a purpose for yourself. Apparently Montalban must be told his purpose by reading Hebrew law and mythology. Funny though that he doesn't seem to have paid much attention to the law about bearing false witness.\n\n This gave me a good giggle. Ungerdunn needs to explain how a non-materialistic thing such as 'purpose' evolved from materialistic forces. For him 'purpose' doesn't have a purpose - if it was produced by evolution.\n \nAnd, of course, evolution isn't meant to explain why anyone would have a purpose. Evolution is a scientific theory meant to explain the observations of the natural world that have been observed. It is meant to explain how the changes we see in living things happen. But since Montalban requires purpose to be imposed on him from outside, he is unable to arrive at purpose for himself.\n\n Actually this is another redefining of evolution. Such men as Dawkins, one of the darlings of atheistic circles believes that things such as 'belief in religion' (belief being a non-material process) is caused by genetic malfunctions - a material process.\n Ungerdunn has give one very emotive plea, and re-worked only a few things, and ignored a few others. But it almost works as an irrational plea to 'believe in science'.",

   "This is for you and Ungerdunn.\n \"My conclusion is that evolution, especially the modern theories, is science at its best, and when it and the nature of science are considered realistically, evolution is not lacking from a philosophical perspective.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil.html\n Note too, 'modern theories' (pl.).\n \n \nI don't believe that materialism is all that there is, because I recognise the spiritual. Even if you don't believe in God - non-material things such as love, and honour, and even beauty must prompt a mind to ask - what is the evolutionary purpose of these? Why have these 'evolved'? \n\n \n Montalban, first you have to allow yourself to process the information you acquire without judging it against religion. Otherwise, just stop right there.\n\n Why? It is only relatively recently that people have tried to make science strictly naturalistic/materialistic. This is a philosophy of science, which you and Ungerdunn ascribe to. That science must only deal with what is material. For 1,000s of years there have been numerous mergers between the two. Most recently we see the Intelligent Design people attempting to use science to prove the hand of God.\n You believe in love - love is not material. You can measure, perhaps, its effects, but you can't find a meter that shows that I love more than you do. Intelligent Design proponents seek to find the 'effects' of God.\n \n Secondly, all you have to do is read ONE book (MANY more are available, but one without math and a very thorough read);\n Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\n Carl Sagan\n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/t...542508?v=glance\n He has plenty of end notes in there to follow up on too.\n\n For what reason? How does it play out? Do the chimps win?\n \nIf you ask a question, you don't get to make up the answer. Follow others who have toiled their life away on finding the answers. Judge their works not next to your belief system, but on the merit of the work and evidence.\n\n A beautifully emotive piece.\n \nScience is not anti-religious, it's pro-understanding. If you take the easy road out, and make up an answer, you're only hurting yourself and your fellow humans.\n\n I have never stated that science is anti-religious.\n \nLove, honor, beauty, all physiological responses. THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM LESS IMPORTANT TO HUMANS! Please understand that. This does NOT make them any less important. I am a human, as are you. These are things we can experience or observe, and they have a real impact on our lives. Knowing where they come from and why is JUST as important as what they are. Don't you agree??\n\n I for one don't believe that they are less important either. If you believe these non-material processes are from material processes - in this case physiological show me the evolutionary stage by stage process by which love developed.\n \n Don't you think understanding leads to a greater appreciation of most things in life? Understanding it's origins does NOT diminish it's worth..unless you know something I don't. We applaud the grass roots presidents that arose from meagre beginnings to greatness, why can you not accept those same meagre beginnings of life, and the greatness that now allows us to even discuss the matter electronically, on the other side of the earth??? It's wondrous! And it's REAL.\n\n More great emotive stuff.\n \nAnd of course, materialist evolution doesn't really have a purpose anyway. If you want a purposeless existence, other than what you make of things yourself, then evolution is good - except it doesn't explain why you have your own purpose. \n\n \nWhat is this \"purpose?\" You're reasoning is so scary. Because the most well accepted theory about how life on earth originates doesn't give you the answer you specifically want, you don't want to accept it? That's disappointing. You seem to have a good \"heart\", I hate to see it spent on fiction (that isn't entertainment fiction..that's OK ) \n\n Tell me, if you will...\n a) what is the most accepted theory about life on earth?\n and\n b) How do you know it is the most accepted theory about life on earth?\n As to 'purpose', if evolution doesn't have a 'purpose', then how did 'purpose' evolve? Was is the purpose of purpose?\n \nSome evolutionists believe that there's an evolutionary need for religion -otherwise, why would people be religious. But of course, they fail to apply this line to their own beliefs in evolution - or atheism, or both. \n\n \nReligion isn't brought up because it's a non-issue. There is nothing in the physical universe that points to their being deities, or divine influence, or anything like that. That's why it's not addressed, it's not real, and we have no reason to believe it \"may\" be real, so it's simply not something anyone has any information to work with.\n\n Those that met Jesus, and saw Him even after His death saw 'evidence'. They even talked to Him, and He talked back.\n \n I recognise the revelations God has made in my life. That God exists makes me question evolution. Some might meld the two together. Why I have not, I have not the time to explain at present - though I have done so in the past.\n I find that I have over-extended myself (again) by replying to far too many threads. \n\n \nYou cannot meld the two together to suit YOUR needs, and then be expected to have a valid argument or reason to believe what you believe. Aren't you seeing the pattern? You constantly mould and meld things to fit your paradigm, which is fallacy. Either admit you have no need to be correct or understand through reason what human kind has discovered (which is fine, Australia is also a free country!), or get on board and start learning what enormous efforts your race has undertaken to push us continually forward from the dark ages. So many lives before you have been sacrificed to understand and to teach, listen to the whispers of your ancestors... \n -Mach\n\n Isn't it fallacy to adopt a philosophy of science that science should only deal with the material, and then only accept proofs based on what science can deal with? You adopt a belief in science knowing that your limits on it, or terms of reference for it, can't include any explanation of God, and then wonder where is God? It's like me wanting to see a painting, but keep my eyes shut.\n \n You believe love exists. Show me the science that proves love. How is it that you believe in this, something we experience, and yet science doesn't prove it? You seem able to accept or trust our emotive selves here.\n \n Newton believed that in understanding the 'mechanism' of the universe, he'd better be able to understand God. Though he did change his mind about how and where God intervened...\n \"It is obvious from the above that Newton had come to the conclusion that the orbits of the planets were self-sustaining. This is in contrast to his earlier view that God was needed to continually correct the motions of the planets producing Leibnitz?s jibe that Newton?s God was but a poor watchmaker who had to intervene in his mechanism to ensure that it did not run down. Newton has by this time fallen from the idea of special providence (the direct action of God in the physical world) and has resorted to the idea of general providence that displaces the action of God to an act of creation that set the planets in motion for ?yet they could by no means have at first derived the regular position of the orbits themselves from those laws.? The action of God upon the world was displaced to the origin of the universe much as modern scientists/theologians place the creative act of God in the big bang.\"\n http://users.bigpond.net.au/sellick/Newton.htm\n \n APPENDIX\n \"Naturalism is\n \"a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is natural in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events...[thus, there cannot] exist any entities or events which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation\" (Danto, 1967, p. 448); \n \n \"the view that nature is all there is and all basic truths are truths of nature\" (Audi, 1996, p. 372);\n \n \"the twofold view that (1) everything is composed of natural entities--those studied in the sciences--whose properties determine all the properties of things, persons included, ...abstract entities... like possibilities...and mathematical objects...and (2) acceptable methods of justification and explanation are commensurable, in some sense, with those in science\" (Post, 1995, p. 517);\n \n \"the view that everything is natural, i.e. that everything there is belongs to the world of nature, and so can be studied by the methods appropriate for studying that world...\" (Lacey, 1995, p. 604);\n \n \"the philosophical movement that \"wishes to use the methods of science, evidence, and reason to understand nature and the place of human species within it\"...\"skeptical of the postulation of a transcendental realm beyond nature, or of the claim that nature can be understood without using the methods of reason and evidence\"... and \"the philosophical generalization of the methods and conclusions of the sciences\" (Kurtz, 1990, p. 7, 12).\"\n http://www.freeinquiry.com/naturalism.html",

I don't see how you can label me something very specific, then argue against it. Do you need me to debate or are you going to debate yourself? :)\n \n And to your misguided response. Sure, there have been countless ignorant people in the world, still are, what does that have to do with requiring there to be sufficient evidence before you believe in something? Since there are 5B people in history that didn't understand quantum mechanics, it's therefore not something we should believe in? Is THIS how you reason? Stop looking to others that agree with you, and start looking for the ANSWER. \n \n \nFor what reason? How does it play out? Do the chimps win?\n\n Scared? (um, no, there is no \"winner\", but the end does touch on how humans can use such knowledge to make the world a better place)\n \n \nI have never stated that science is anti-religious.\n\n Yet you CONSISTENTLY deny science BASED on your religion. Interesting aren't you? \n \n \n \nI for one don't believe that they are less important either. If you believe these non-material processes are from material processes - in this case physiological show me the evolutionary stage by stage process by which love developed.\n\n Come on, please, the literature is out there on evolution, a simple google search or examiniation of a high school textbook is more than you probably need to back any of this up. However, the onus is on YOU to disprove it since the material is readily available. Since you cannot, you can either accept it, or deny it. But if you deny it without a rational reason, you lose.\n \n \nThose that met Jesus, and saw Him even after His death saw 'evidence'. They even talked to Him, and He talked back.\n\n Ah, perfect. You heard from someone who read something that was written by someone (take that back to 2000 years ago) and you call that evidence? I call it nonsense. I'm asking YOU for evidence in the modern day (i.e. since we started paying attention to reality instead of superstition). I'll save you the hassle, there isn't any :/\n \n \nIsn't it fallacy to adopt a philosophy of science that science should only deal with the material, and then only accept proofs based on what science can deal with? You adopt a belief in science knowing that your limits on it, or terms of reference for it, can't include any explanation of God, and then wonder where is God? It's like me wanting to see a painting, but keep my eyes shut.\n This materialistic thing you labeled me earlier? We're still talking about sufficent evidence. Do you have sufficient evidence to show how anything in the universe requires something \"not of this universe\" to function or to exist? Of course you can't. We have millions looking for things like this through history to present day. It sounds cool, and it MAY be, but right now, there is no reason to believe this. You can HOPE, but you should not believe without a reason..i.e. evidence.\n \n \nYou believe love exists. Show me the science that proves love. How is it that you believe in this, something we experience, and yet science doesn't prove it? You seem able to accept or trust our emotive selves here.\n\n We already went over this. First you have to define love. But you haven't yet. Regardless:\n Love can easily be measured both through behavioral responses, and through monitoring physiological responses. And stop saying the word \"prove\", it only proves you're not understanding what science tries to do. EVERYTHING that comprises your \"love\" exists within the human body. You claim there is something \"non-physical\" about our body? Please do enlighten the world with this revelation.\n \n Thought...itself. The idea of abstracts, such as math, reasoning, etc. These things seem to reside outside the body, yet I don't think anyone has evidence that they are or are not, of this universe. You do?? So if I look at a pencil and THINK about a pencil, that thought exists outside the physical universe? Sorry, the brain operates, according to nueroscience, through purely physical means. They simlply have no evidence that it operates otherwise. It would be cool if it were just a big swirly vortex in there that resisted all of our scientific instrument readings...but alas, it's physical...and fragile.\n \n \nNewton believed that in understanding the 'mechanism' of the universe, he'd better be able to understand God. Though he did change his mind about how and where God intervened...\n\n What do his personal beliefs have to do with you lacking evidence? Still looking for others who support your beliefs? You can find them all day every day. This has nothing to do with the lack of evidence to support your beliefs, but that's not what I'm most concerned about. I think you beleiving things is less important than you NOT believing in things that are reasonable, rational, to believe. That's the part I'm not comfortable with. I'd be satisifed if you said \"No evidence, yes, but I HOPE there is a God, and I'll live my life as if there is one\", and also accepted what science has to offer. At least you're back into the rational realm in that case...\n \n -Mach",

   "\"My conclusion is that evolution, especially the modern theories, is science at its best, and when it and the nature of science are considered realistically, evolution is not lacking from a philosophical perspective. This essay will deal with these philosophical questions and misunderstandings about evolution\"\n \n \nAt this point, I don't know if I understand your position Montalban. Are you completely rejecting evolution in all its various forms? If you've voted in your own poll, there is no other conclusion to draw, the way I see it.\n\n \n My intent at a poll was not to go \"Oh gosh gee, more people believe this, I'll switch\". It was to see what other people think. Without doubt I have my own convictions, but that still doesn't stop me asking questions. Note Ungerdunn has not answered any of mine. He actually came dangerously close to proving my point. He suggested that the three options I gave in my poll were not enough. So, he actually believes that there are more combinations of theories out there :) Maybe he just realised in time, hence his shyness from responding. But he did give us a glimpse that he too acknowledges far more options exist.\n \n As to this debate: Ungerdunn and Mach for instance believe that there's one theory of evolution, and science should be materialistic.\n \n The problem here is that Goldschmidt alone proves that there's more than one theory. My intent was never to say \"Goldschmidt is wrong!\", or \"Goldschmidt is right.\" But that \"Goldschmidt presents a different evolutionary theory.\" That there are many different theories of evolution.\n \n The fact that Gould's theory is different from Dawkins is also self-evident. The fact that there are mutually exclusive theories regarding the ascent of man is also self-evident.They; Ungerdunn, Close_slave_can, Kronus, WJ, Mach et al have in face been unable to see the proofs in front of them. It matters not that one has 100 followers, and the other 97. They are different theories of evolution. This is the very argument they make of religion - if religion is right, how come there are so many.\n And, sure these theories; Goldschmidt, Dawkins, Gould are within the materialistic-naturalistic camp. There's varieties there in that camp as I've shown, HOWEVER there's other forms of evolution that include God, or aliens or other phenomena. Which is the correct one?\n \n Further to this, the idea that science should only deal with the material is itself a philosophy of science. It is easy enough to show this... if they can provide a scientific experiment to show that the material is all that should be tested for -an impossible task, they'd have shown that there view of science is science -because it would be proved by science. It can't be, therefore there's is a philosophy [i]of[/] science.\n \n I have shown that materialism is itself entwined with 'the Theory of Evolution' (the one followed by said posters), and this is a philosophy.\n \n As to my own beliefs. I believe in God, creation etc. I reject the term 'evolution' but I do believe in adaptation, for instance. And some people might argue that this is just semantics.\n \n However semantics are found in the opposite camp; such as the phrase \"Survival of the Fittest\". I mention it here too, because Ungerdunn has laughably claimed he defeated me on this issue. He tried many rhetorical ploys such as concentrating not on the phrase itself, but on whether I'd read the book. Then he argued, sure, Darwin used it, but he was pressured to by popular demands, or persuaded to by others etc. That Darwin didn't 'coin' the word; everything under the sun was brought out to try to salvage this. And why? Because it is a tautology. It is meaningless, and worse, Darwin preferred it FOR WHATEVER REASON Darwin accepted it.\n \"Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n \n \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is [b[more accurate[/b], and is sometimes equally convenient.\" \n from the 6th edition of \"Origin of the Species\"\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html\n He is stating that a tautology is more accurate this his own idea of Natural Selection!\n And that of course leads to howlers like this...\n \"From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled \"Darwin's Mistakes,\" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.\n \n Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n Darwin is 'prooved' correct by artificial selection! What a laugh.\n \n Science education is built upon a set of theoretical and philosophical beliefs about the nature of science and the nature of learning which are not reliable in practice. \n \n Science education traditionally defines science as a body of knowledge, beginning with facts, and moving on to concepts and relations, models and theories, processes and activities. Its conception of knowledge is a fundamentally mentalistic and superficially cognitive one. What is known, be it facts or concepts, is said to be known in the \"mind\" (a curiously unscientific place, both immaterial and inaccessible to observation). The processes of science are likewise reduced to imaginary \"mental\" or \"cognitive\" processes, which also occur only in this imaginary domain. Traditional science education argues that the same mind-knowledge and the same mind-processes take place both in the school context and the context of working science, and that it is these which constitute science and these which are being taught. \n \n This is no longer a credible view, neither of science nor of learning to do science. Science is neither a system of well-understood mental concepts and processes, nor a body of facts, principles, and theories. These are at best the tools, and in some cases, the products of scientific activity. Science is a social subculture: a vast interlocking network of the working activities of producers and users of these products and tools (cf. Latour 1987, 1988). A culture and its activities cannot be known by inference from a study of its products and tools alone, but only by direct knowledge of their actual contexts of production and use.\"\n http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/education/jlemke/papers/gap-sci.htm\n \n Presently, curriculum designers around the world may differ in their views about topics to include in the science curriculum. However, they almost all would include the nature of science in science curriculum (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989; Hazen & Trefil, 1991; Lederman, 1992; and Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990).\"\n http://www.balfakih.net/epistemology.htm\n \n That is, people who have accepted a need for explanations that don't entail God will shape their findings to fit in with a priori materialistic notions. And this is the crux of the matter. These posters have such self-belief in their own version of the truth that they dogmatically condemn all others as heresies or abominations. But the others rely on evidences too! Ultimately which theory (based on evidences) that you accept will be based on your own philosophy. I too, do this. I recognise that my belief in God precludes a purely materialistic-naturalistic Godless vision as proposed by Dawkins. My studies have not been science, but arts. But a study of why we think what we think is equally revealing as questions about 'how do we think'.\n \n Note too how terribly emotive the opposition arguments have been. I post citations to back up my arguments. Ungerdunn makes appeals based on easily dismmissed re-workings of the history of our debates. I note too that this too is an appeal, but I have at least shown from quotes from Darwin himself, that he believed his own theory was best represented by a tautology",

There are Christians, for example, who do not believe (2) but none-the-less accept (1). Also, it is possible to believe (1) but not accept (2) -- they would either have another theory for origins, or they would simply not claim to know an answer, only that they believe that (2) is false.

They are, after all, a heartfelt testimony with a degree of logic thrown in. You have thought the matter through it seems, and in the metaphysical realm, can defend your faith eloquently. \n\n Many thanks.\n \nBut evolutionary science is the physical realm,\n\n No. One focus of the evolutionary science that you speak of is the physical realm, but that is a philosophy of science to deem that science should only be about the material world. It is the form of science taught 'as' science in most western educational systems, but it remains a philosophy of science.\n Other forms of evolutionary science don't deal with just the physical (see below an interesting theory on the 'Fitness of the Environment'. You simply believe that there is one evolutionary science, it is normative, everything else is not evolutionary science.\n \"The real problem with the evolution debate is not empirical Darwinism. Rather, it is a sort of theory creep in which a bold but circumscribed scientific claim becomes conflated with a much more sweeping philosophical claim. The philosophical claim is then presented as though it were a confirmed scientific fact. Metaphysical Darwinism maintains that the theory of natural selection has successfully reduced all teleological and normative phenomena to the interplay of chance and necessity, thus eliminating purpose and value from our picture of the world. Metaphysical Darwinists regard belief in objective values as primitive superstition, on a par with a belief in witches and ghosts. What is worse, they perpetrate a fraud on the public by draping their profoundly speculative philosophy with the mantle of scientific authority.\n James Barham \"Why I am Not a Darwinist\", in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p178. \n Your idea; this is a funny statement to make for someone who only a day ago was claiming that they were there to here all sides and appeared undecided. If you believe that science should only deal with the material - then you need show that this itself is a scientific idea. If you can prove it by science, then it is scientific. If you can't, then it is not. If it is not, it is not science, but a philosophy of science.\n \nand has a lot of cumulative evidence to support itself, though admittedly I know little of the subject and bring my pre-existing biases with. But to reject the theory out of hand is,Why hold to such a radical position, especially when it doesn't seem necessary? \n\n You will have to explain the 'necessary' aspect of this further.\n The mechanistic process in Darwin's idea is disputed by other theories of evolution. Lawrence Henderson wrote \"Fitness of the Environment\" \n You can see a very large tract on it at http://www.members.iinet.net/~sejones/pe06envr.html . The earth seems so suited for life, it can't have been by chance that life came about by chance. The inference is that there's an intelligence/blueprint behind it. This does not mean that the Christian God is proved by it, or God in any definition. BUT it is a form of evolutionary theory that tackles the problems of the holes in Darwin's mechanistic models.\n Michael Denton agrees with when he states that the gene-centric theory of neo-Darwinism - is insufficient to explain all aspects of biology. He states \"Yet by the late 1980s it was becoming obvious to most genetic researchers, including myself, since my own main research interest in the '80s and '90s was human genetics, that the heroic effort to find the information specifying life's order in the genes had failed. There was no longer the slightest justification for believing that there exists anything in the genome remotely resembling a program capable of specifying in detail all the complex order of the phenotype... From being 'isolated directors' of a one-way game of life, genes are now considered to be interactive players in a dynamic two-way dance of almost unfathomable complexity, as described by Keller in \"The Century of the Gene\"\n Michael John Denton \"An Anti-Darwin Intellectual Journey\", in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p172.\n He gives examples of the folds in RNA which happen consistently, and independently of genetic coding... but these rules governing the folds... \"These laws of protein form are strictly equivalent to the rules that govern the way atoms are combined into molecules or subatomic particles are combined into atoms to generate the periodic table of elements...\n The folds present stunning evidence, perhaps the first clear evidence discovered in biology, that highly complex organic forms can be generated by natural law. With the folds, the impossible has become possible - the basic building blocks of nature are specified in abstract laws of form and are not simply a mechanical program in the genes. They are lawful, emergent, self-organising forms and not contingent 'cleverly contrived machines'. Here is a set of forms that arise directly out of the basic properties of matter, confirming the inference I had previously drawn from reading Henderson, that life might be encoded in the basic properties of matter.\"\n Ibid, pp173-74\n \nYour strategy in this thread seems to be to obfuscate, then divide and conquer, but few cracks have appeared as yet that I can detect.\n\n Not at all. I don't believe that proving you have a belief in a philosophy of science will equate to conversion to the Orthodox Church. Someone earlier made the same claim, and I refuted it then. One does not prove the other. You might go on to accept evolution, but a non-materialistic form, and argue against me then.\n My purpose is to\n a) undermine the rather contrived 'which one is right' argument used against religion\n b) to show that many of the assumptions people make about the nature of their 'science' are flawed.\n (with regards a) the idea is how can religion be correct, when there are so many of them. There are many versions of Evolution, even within the artificial constraints of the mechanistic steam.",

So, he actually believes that there are more combinations of theories out there Maybe he just realised in time, hence his shyness from responding. But he did give us a glimpse that he too acknowledges far more options exist.\n\n \n Actually, I more than answered. Maybe I did come close to proving your point since it isn't clear what your point is. I didn't suggest that the three options you gave were not enough, I said it outright. It seems that your thinking is too limited that you are unable to see other options. Perhaps if you cleared your head of the superstitious, religious mumbo-jumbo.\n\n No\n Post 15\n \nAfter his trite poll in which he sloppily presents only three distorted and artificial choices\n\n Saying 'Only three choices' suggest that there's more. What other choices are there, besides believing in evolution, or believing in God, or believing in a combination of both?\n Instead you talk back about Darwin suggesting 5 models of evolution, are these not all 'evolution to you? If they are the same, then they fall into a category of my question, and you need to state what other options you see, or if they are different evolutionary theories, you confirm my point.\n \nAs to this debate: Ungerdunn and Mach for instance believe that there's one theory of evolution, and science should be materialistic.\n\n \nIs this another example of your difficulty in understanding English? Maybe you have a reading problem. To think otherwise would mean that you are a liar.\n\n I warn you here about the use of the insulting language... which you fired at me at almost every post you wrote in our previous engagement.\n I hope that this is clear. I don't like the inferences here you make - to not understand my own language is you deeming me stupid. You thus suggest I am either stupid or a liar.\n \nIf you notice, I pretty clearly said that Darwinism, as originally proposed by Darwin himself, consisted of five theories of evolution. I have also stated that on several occasions that the word \"materialistic\" is a poor choice.\n\n No you stated materialism has nothing to do with science and you believe Darwinism is scientific, ipso facto materialism has nothing to do with Darwinism.\n Post 15 (again)\n \nScience is actually naturalistic, not materialistic.\n\n I provided quotes from TalkOrigins that disagree - further evidence of the differences in your philosophy of science.\n \nOf course, you choose that word as a means of deprecating evolutionary biology and reducing it to the level of your religion. We've been over this before and still you fail to understand. Science makes no philosophical claim that only the material exists. Science, and therefore evolutionary biology, are naturalistic. They proceed by studying anything and everything that can be observed.\n\n I put forward witness of miracles as observation to Mach and he repeated that I have no evidence. For him and for you, you don't mean ''observed' you mean 'measured'. They are not the same thing. You have a belief that science is all that can be measured, or in theory potentially measured. If there is no measure for God, science can't deal with it. This isn't saying that science has ruled God out. But it is a philosophy of science that science should be so constrained.\n \nNaturalism is not an assertion but a limitation of science.\n\n I agree totally. It is a philosophy that artificially limits science.\n \nYou see, science can't take mythology into account when formulating naturalistic theories of science. Only you seem to want to claim that superstition and mythology are real.\n\n And here we go back to it... what I observe - you can't measure. Therefore it is 'myth'. Funny you say that 'science doesn't rule God out' but my religion is myth. True colours emerge\n \n The problem here is that Goldschmidt alone proves that there's more than one theory. My intent was never to say \"Goldschmidt is wrong!\", or \"Goldschmidt is right.\" But that \"Goldschmidt presents a different evolutionary theory.\" That there are many different theories of evolution. \n\n \nAgain this seems to be your problem in understanding English. You are arguing against claims that have not been made (except by you). In other words, you need straw men to make points. It is a sign that you know that your points are weak.\n\n This is a strawman. You insult by saying that I don't understand English. It is your stock standard insult. \n Goldschmidt proposed a theory that differs from that of Dawkins, which differs from that of Gould. The differences between them make some closer than others, but they are not the same. That is what 'differences' are. As stated, there's heaps of others.\n \nFurther to this, the idea that science should only deal with the material is itself a philosophy of science.\n\n \nSo you didn't understand what I was asking the last time you made such a claim? Please quantify your god so that we can include him in studies of evolutionary mechanisms.\n\n And here we have it again. If God is at work in evolution, His 'handiwork' many not necessarily be measurable - by you. Because it can't be measured by you, your version of science can't recognise it. Intelligent Design theorists have a different philosophy of science and Dembski for instance has set out to measure or detect God's handiwork. You think it's not science based on your own philosophy of science.\n \nTo say that there is a philosophy of science is not the same as saying that science is philosophy. Science is a naturalistic means by which we learn about the universe and everything in it. Just because there is a philosophy of teaching does not mean that teaching is philosophy.\n\n No, that definition of science is a philosophy. If you think that it is scientific, then prove it by science!\n \n I have shown that materialism is itself entwined with 'the Theory of Evolution' (the one followed by said posters), and this is a philosophy.\n\n \nNo you haven't. You have asserted it.\n\n The fact that I used pro-evolutionary sites such as TalkOrigins to back this up doesn't phase you.\n \n And the theory of evolution is science - naturalistic. While an evolutionary scientist may be a materialist, that is not to say that all are.\n\n Yes, we have a break-through. Not all are. Some are, some aren't - it depends on their philosophy. After months of debating me, we finally are on the verge of agreeing.\n \n In fact, in my experience, few are. And since my philosophy isn't materialistic, that makes you wrong. However, if I am wrong, then please indicate how we can include the study of the supernatural in the natural. Isn't that a contradiction?\n\n See Dembski. See Newton. Both thought to find God in science. You don't... because you don't think science can/should. Just because you follow Epicurean ideals - in a more modern pack, doesn't mean that everyone else does!\n There are those who believe in evolution, but don't think neo-Darwinism's mechanistic gene-centric explains everything (see above post for web-references)\n \nScience is limited to what is natural because we have no means to quantify the supernatural. Again, please quantify your god for us. Then we can say that science is supernaturalistic - it studies fairies, ghosts, demons and various deities.\n\n Fairies? Is that a straw-man you have built again? Should I define God first? Is God definable? I can for instance see a column of stone and recognise it as being man-made, without knowing which man made it, or anything else about him.",

   "Good morning, Montalban.\n \n \nHow then do you explain the non-material that we do accept exists, such as 'love' or 'honsety'? (I am, I guess assuming that you believe it exists)\n\n I accept them in the same way I accept the existence of \"height\". These are words describing phenomena, which can be reduced to mere states of the brain.\n \n \n \nHow did it evolve? Please provide step-by-step models, if you have them.\n\n It is known that altruism can confer a survival advantage to the individuals in a population of altruists -- game theoretic models show that such traits can persist and out-compete non-altruists. There are plenty of examples of a range of behavior, from sporadic cooperation to the complex social dynamics of some primates, to suggest that the gradual evolution of complex social instincts is a reasonable theory. I believe this was even discussed by Darwin himself in Descent of Man.\n \n In humans, there is also intelligence. These two different traits, intelligence and social instincts, once arisen in even a rudimentary way, would begin to interact with one another (meaning that traits would evolve that influenced, and were influenced by, these two other traits). I have little doubt that the feelings of love and honesty are two traits evolved to allow individuals of this particular intelligent species to maintain the social cohesion necessary for their survival.",

   "Note Ungerdunn has not answered any of mine. He actually came dangerously close to proving my point. He suggested that the three options I gave in my poll were not enough. So, he actually believes that there are more combinations of theories out there Maybe he just realised in time, hence his shyness from responding. But he did give us a glimpse that he too acknowledges far more options exist.\n\n Actually, I more than answered. Maybe I did come close to proving your point since it isn't clear what your point is. I didn't suggest that the three options you gave were not enough, I said it outright. It seems that your thinking is too limited that you are unable to see other options. Perhaps if you cleared your head of the superstitious, religious mumbo-jumbo.\n \n No\n Post 15\n\n No what? No I didn't clearly say that there are more than three choices? No, it wouldn't help if you cleared you head of the superstitious, religious mumbo-jumbo? Did you actually read post #15 or is it that you had trouble understanding what it said?\n \nAfter his trite poll in which he sloppily presents only three distorted and artificial choices\n \n Saying 'Only three choices' suggest that there's more.\n\n Congratulations. You seem to have grasped that thought.\n \nWhat other choices are there, besides believing in evolution, or believing in God, or believing in a combination of both?\n\n You demonstrate your limited abilities to think clearly. It isn't hard to see more posibilities. Oh, let's see. How about evolution and a god, but not your god?\n \nInstead you talk back about Darwin suggesting 5 models of evolution, are these not all 'evolution to you? If they are the same, then they fall into a category of my question, and you need to state what other options you see, or if they are different evolutionary theories, you confirm my point.\n\n Why do you find it necessary to misrepresent what was said? That's not honest. Or maybe you were having trouble with the fairly simple English. I didn't say that Darwin suggested 5 models of evolution. I quite clearly said that Darwin proposed 5 theories of evolution. My exact words were, \"Darwin actually stated 5 separate theories of evolution, each of which can be evaluated and tested separately.\" Please explain what it was about that statement that you failed to understand clearly. Please explain how, \"Darwin...stated 5 separate theories of evolution,\" became, \"Darwin suggest[ed] 5 models of evolution.\" If you had read my explanation of each you would have understood that they are NOT all the same to me, but are, in fact, 5 separate theories of evolution, each of which can be evaluated and tested separately. Each explains a facet of evolutionary theory as Darwin understood it. Of course, we have learned much since then. While Darwin's 5 theories have been confirmed, some of his logic was incorrect. Later, the synthetic theory of evolution was formulated that explained two things - why offspring look like their parents, and why offspring aren't exactly like their parents. The synthesis of Mendelian genetics with Darwinism formed the synthetic theory, sometimes known as neo-Darwinsim.\n \nAs to this debate: Ungerdunn and Mach for instance believe that there's one theory of evolution, and science should be materialistic.\n\n Is this another example of your difficulty in understanding English? Maybe you have a reading problem. To think otherwise would mean that you are a liar.\n\n I warn you here about the use of the insulting language... which you fired at me at almost every post you wrote in our previous engagement.\n \n I hope that this is clear. I don't like the inferences here you make - to not understand my own language is you deeming me stupid. You thus suggest I am either stupid or a liar.\n\n I have been charitable and given you the benefit of the doubt. I assumed that your constant misrepresentation of what I have said and what others have told you is caused because you have some sort of cognitive problem. I have seen copious evidence that you have an incomplete grasp of English grammar and syntax. I assumed that your repeated misrepresentations were caused by this failure to understand the meaning of the written word. If your misrepresentation are not caused by difficulties with English, a severe reading problem, then what is the cause? I was reluctant to attribute it to dishonesty, but it seems that is the case. I find it insulting, demeaning and hostile in the extreme. It seems that you lack the knowledge and skill to confront my ideas directly, you must misrepresent what I have said. That way, someone who has not read carefully and may not know what I said will read your misrepresentation of what I said and deem me stupid. I find your constant use of the technique to be insulting and offensive. It is certainly not the way a Christian would act.\n \n I hope that is clear. I have tried to keep it friendly, but since you seem to prefer that your lies be called lies, I guess I should do so in the future. Perhaps then we will hear less whining.\n \nIf you notice, I pretty clearly said that Darwinism, as originally proposed by Darwin himself, consisted of five theories of evolution. I have also stated that on several occasions that the word \"materialistic\" is a poor choice.\n\n No you stated materialism has nothing to do with science and you believe Darwinism is scientific, ipso facto materialism has nothing to do with Darwinism.\n Post 15 (again)\n\n That's a lie. I said no such thing. Post 15 again. I responded to your comment, \"This is materialist evolution. It is the belief that all that is came about through material, or physical process - that there was nothing 'super-natural' at work, at all.\" I have explained to you on several occasions that you are misrepresenting the theory of evolution. Evolutionary theory makes no assertions as you claim. That's why I told you that \"materialistic\" is a poor choice of words. It is too easly misunderstood by some who have a weak grasp of English. Evolution is not a philosophy.\n \nScience is actually naturalistic, not materialistic.\n\n I provided quotes from TalkOrigins that disagree - further evidence of the differences in your philosophy of science.\n\n And then I must assume that you deliberately misrepresented the meaning of those quotes. Science is materialistic in that it deals mostly with the material - in other words, it is naturalistic. Evolutionary biology is not a philosophy any more than geology or physics is a philosophy. While one may have a philosophy of science, science isn't a philosophy. You are being dishonest when you claim otherwise (or you lack a grasp of the meaning of the words).\n \nOf course, you choose that word as a means of deprecating evolutionary biology and reducing it to the level of your religion. We've been over this before and still you fail to understand. Science makes no philosophical claim that only the material exists. Science, and therefore evolutionary biology, are naturalistic. They proceed by studying anything and everything that can be observed.\n\n I put forward witness of miracles as observation to Mach and he repeated that I have no evidence. For him and for you, you don't mean ''observed' you mean 'measured'. They are not the same thing. You have a belief that science is all that can be measured, or in theory potentially measured. If there is no measure for God, science can't deal with it. This isn't saying that science has ruled God out. But it is a philosophy of science that science should be so constrained.\n\n Well, that's enough quibbling since you clearly don't understand what you are talking about. Your witness of miracles is not up to the standards of science. I'm going to ask again the question that you keep ducking in your supernaturalism. Please quantify your god. In the matter of the miracles to which you \"witnessed\", please state the observation made, the hypothesis formed, the prediction made from the hypothesis, and how the prediction was tested - in other words, how was the miracle reliably repeated?\n \nYou see, science can't take mythology into account when formulating naturalistic theories of science. Only you seem to want to claim that superstition and mythology are real.\n\n And here we go back to it... what I observe - you can't measure. Therefore it is 'myth'. Funny you say that 'science doesn't rule God out' but my religion is myth. True colours emerge\n\n Actually, you have said it correctly. I don't rule out God or religion. I rule out your god and your superstitious religion as you have expressed on this board. Your need to make your weak faith scientific is pathetic.\n \nThe problem here is that Goldschmidt alone proves that there's more than one theory. My intent was never to say \"Goldschmidt is wrong!\", or \"Goldschmidt is right.\" But that \"Goldschmidt presents a different evolutionary theory.\" That there are many different theories of evolution.\n\n Again this seems to be your problem in understanding English. You are arguing against claims that have not been made (except by you). In other words, you need straw men to make points. It is a sign that you know that your points are weak.\n \n This is a strawman. You insult by saying that I don't understand English. It is your stock standard insult.\n \n Goldschmidt proposed a theory that differs from that of Dawkins, which differs from that of Gould. The differences between them make some closer than others, but they are not the same. That is what 'differences' are. As stated, there's heaps of others.\n\n But your silly point is that there exists more than one theory of evolution. Of course there does. Physics has lots of theories too - there are theories of motion, there are theories of sound, there are theories of heat. There are theories of light, magnetism and electricity (those theories are grouped under the title of electromagnetism), there are theories of elementry particles (nuclear theory), and there are theories of quantum mechanics.\n \n In geology there are theories of sedimentation, theories of erosion, theories of up-lift and theories of subsidence. There is vulcanism, subduction - both theories of tectonics, which is a theory of geology.\n \n For some reason you think that everything about the complexity of nature that causes changes in living organims over time should be expressed in one single thought. So what if Goldschmidt did propose a theory? He was wrong. Newton proposed theories in physics and he was shown to be wrong by Einstein. And Einstein by Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac and others.\n \n Now stop claiming that I and others insist that there is only one theory of evolution. To do so is a lie and an insult. It is an assertion that I am stupid.\n \nAnd here we have it again. If God is at work in evolution, His 'handiwork' many not necessarily be measurable - by you.\n\n Then it isn't science. As above, please support one of your miracles scientifically. Please indicate how \"His 'handiwork'\" can be quantified and measured. One of the requirements of science is that the experiments can be repeated. If you can do it, then so can I or it isn't science.\n \nBecause it can't be measured by you, your version of science can't recognise it. Intelligent Design theorists have a different philosophy of science and Dembski for instance has set out to measure or detect God's handiwork. You think it's not science based on your own philosophy of science.\n\n Dembski's explanatory filter reduces to a tautology. It is worthless as science. He can't seem to make up his mind whether tractability is a requirement of design - 1st it is (The Design Inference) and then it isn't (No Free Lunch). And of course, Dembski places himself on a level with Newton and Einstein and claims a 4th Law of Thermodynamics (his discussiion makes it clear that he was unaware that there already are 4), one that was missed by Carnot, Kelvin, Clausius and Planck. No ego problem there. The problem is that Dembski's discussion of his 4th law violates the 2nd law. The man is a genius.\n \nTo say that there is a philosophy of science is not the same as saying that science is philosophy. Science is a naturalistic means by which we learn about the universe and everything in it. Just because there is a philosophy of teaching does not mean that teaching is philosophy.\n\n No, that definition of science is a philosophy. If you think that it is scientific, then prove it by science!\n\n You are having trouble with distinguishing definitions of things from the things themselves. Are you acting the fool on purpose?\n \nI have shown that materialism is itself entwined with 'the Theory of Evolution' (the one followed by said posters), and this is a philosophy.\n\n No you haven't. You have asserted it.\n\n The fact that I used pro-evolutionary sites such as TalkOrigins to back this up doesn't phase you.\n\n Actually, no. I understood what I read at those sites. I can distinguish a philosophy of religion from the religion. I can distinguish a philosophy of teaching from actually teaching. I can distinguish a philosophy of art from the actual art. And I can distinguish a philosophy of science from the practice of science. You don't seem to be able to do so. But of course, since you insist that you aren't haveing trouble in understanding what you read, you must be offering that little bit of confusion as an intentional effort to misguide and deceive.\n \nAnd the theory of evolution is science - naturalistic. While an evolutionary scientist may be a materialist, that is not to say that all are.\n\n Yes, we have a break-through. Not all are. Some are, some aren't - it depends on their philosophy. After months of debating me, we finally are on the verge of agreeing.\n\n Yet more distortion. It seems that you can't differentiate between a scientist who's philosophy of science is not materialistic, who's practice is methodological naturalism, and a scientist who may be a materialist. Is it a matter of understanding or one of dishonesty?\n \nIn fact, in my experience, few are. And since my philosophy isn't materialistic, that makes you wrong. However, if I am wrong, then please indicate how we can include the study of the supernatural in the natural. Isn't that a contradiction?\n\n See Dembski. See Newton. Both thought to find God in science. You don't... because you don't think science can/should. Just because you follow Epicurean ideals - in a more modern pack, doesn't mean that everyone else does!\n\n I asked you but you don't seem to be able to do it. So you make assertions that you can't support and try to pass questions along to a dead man and an egomaniac. By the way, Neither Newton nor Dembski found God in science. If they did so, then please detail the observations, the hypothesis, the prediction, and the experiment that confirmed the prediction. Who has repeated the experiments.\n \nThere are those who believe in evolution, but don't think neo-Darwinism's mechanistic gene-centric explains everything (see above post for web-references)\n\n Again with your implied insults. Now someone who has not paid attention to what I have been saying will believe that I have made such stupid assertions. I am tired of your insults and lies.\n \nScience is limited to what is natural because we have no means to quantify the supernatural. Again, please quantify your god for us. Then we can say that science is supernaturalistic - it studies fairies, ghosts, demons and various deities.\n\n Fairies? Is that a straw-man you have built again?\n\n Now you are being silly. If there are no fairies, then please demonstrate scientifically that that is a fact. Maybe you call them angels - who can tell with those who believe in mythology.\n \nShould I define God first? Is God definable? I can for instance see a column of stone and recognise it as being man-made, without knowing which man made it, or anything else about him.\n\n And what does the column of stone have to do with your god. Did your god make the column of stone? Is that what you are saying? You see, I have seen people build things. I have build things. From experience I can recognize human handiwork. I have seen roads, bridges, houses, walls, cars, airplanes and recognize them all as the work of humans. But none of those things reproduce themselves. I have seen trees reproduce themselves (unless it is you claim that your god came down and planted the tree by the fence). What you are claiming is that because you can recognize that a wall was built by humans that you can know that your god designed the rock.\n \n Now quit messing around and quantify your god. Offer an observation and the data derived from that observation. Offer an hypothesis that explains it and then make a prediction of an unobserved fact that is necessarily true if the hypothesis is correct. Design an experiment to test the prediction, i.e., make the predicted observation. Come on. Don't be shy.",

   "Morning is relative.\n\n Good morning, Montalban. (I looked it up -- it is very early morning where you are assuming that you are on the east coast.)\n \n \n \nWhat survival trait leads people to stand up on principles?\n\n First, it is a common error (especially among the \"sociobiologists\") that all traits are the direct product of evolution, and that these traits must serve an immediate purpose.\n \n Some traits can be accidents.

So there is not a universal trait of \"bravery\" that is biologically determined for all individuals. What I suspect is happening in your example is this: it is known that some animals have an instinct that compels them to risk their lives to protect their young or other members of their social group. The survival benefit is clear -- Darwin himself expounds on it, at least in Descent of Man (it's been too many decades to remember precisely what he said in Origin of Species).

This is what I meant when I said that in humans instinctive drives and intelligence can interact to produce what we consider to be normal human behavior.\n \n \n \nSecondly, you equate height with love. I therefore take it that love does not exist except in an abstract sense.\n\n I'm not sure that \"abstract\" is the word I would use. I meant that \"love\" is not an object, a thing -- it is a phenomenon, a state that a person can be in.\n \n \n \nHow did this develop through evolution?\n What survival trait to you exhibit in debating these things?\n\n Humans are social animals. We interact and cooperate with one another to increase our chances of survival. Love would be a way to compel us to do this.\n \n \n \nHave you ever been in love? Do you believe that it is merely chemical switches?\n\n Yes to the first question. The second is a bit simplistically put, but I will say \"yes\" to it also.",

   "Your example about light is invalid because it would not be a definition in isolation. The definitions of science exist in isolation and none is more true and than another. You can define light as electromagnetic radiation that travels at the 300000 km/s and using electricity to create radio waves you can back up this definition. No such thing is possible for different definitions of science none is true you choose the one that people around you use. I fully accept that people define science in many ways but those definitions just don't seem useful or interesting so I disagree with them. \n\n Not just that, you believe they are wrong. You state your version is 'the' version. You do this when you say science can only study material factors etc.... you are attributing essentialist criteria to science. Based on your philosophy of science.\n \nWhat do you need your bizarre definition for can't you express your ideas without it?\n\n I am trying to point out that your version of science is a version of science. Not 'science' per se. You believe that the others are pseudo-science, at best. I know this from arguing with you in the past - Mach does the same.\n \nYou want to say that humans are fallible let bias creep into to everything they do to a degree I totally agree . I certainly agree that people would not act identically in a communist society or a Nazi society it is obvious that your environment influences your behaviour. There might be perception that science proves that Christianity false and I agree that is wrong.\n\n One of the champions of evolution who has gained much credence - or publicity - maybe they are perceived the same (Richard Dawkins), believes that people who have religious ideas are throwbacks from some as yet unexplained evolutionary process - and in effect, we are irrational.\n It goes by the idea that...\n Science can only test the material.\n The material is all that there is.\n God must be immaterial.\n Therefore God not only can't be tested by science, He can't exist. Or, that there is no 'evidence' for God.\n \n Sir Isaac Newton believed that science could be used as a tool for understanding God. Currently there are many people who do; Intelligence Designers, and those believing in the \"Fitness of Nature\".\n In arguing with people here, including one very ruder poster, I am left with the impression that these people are not following 'science' because they are engaged in acts beyond their definition of science.\n \n It is a highly restrictive definition too. Just hypothetically, just say God, or some other super-natural force was at work... somewhere in nature. Your version of science would never be able to explain what was happening, there's would - if it was there. There version would be more freer, and more accurate. Your version has ruled out one set of causes right from the beginning. And that doesn't seem to be a 'quest for knowledge' but a philosophical stance - to interpret the world through only materialistic circumstances.\n \n The 'Fitness of Nature' theorists are attempting to find universal laws (as in physics) and apply them to biology. It is a theory that encompasses evolution, but is not wholly materialistic. It is yet another version of evolution.\n \n Although I don't agree with the \"Fitness of Nature\" people, in that they accept an Old Earth, it is much more intriguing than the geno-centric neo-Darwinism foisted upon us at the moment.\n \n They ask questions like - why is the Earth so suited for life? It's just the right distance from the sun - it's angle allows for seasons, the moon allows for tides. Even the non-life planets such as Jupiter etc help by acting as giant protectors, often pulling away any potentially dangerous meteors etc. And they have less trouble explaining things such as 'purpose'.",

It is an easy definition to understand and it is obvious many people adopt it.\n\n Many people casually adopt it because it is the only one currently being taught. Most people don't look into epistemology, as evidenced by some of the posts I get on this debate. It was not the only one being taught in the past - and not everyone agrees with it. But it has become 'normative', yes. But does that make it 'science'? No, it is still a philosophy of science, although more widely taught.\n \nIt is clearly so common that you should realise people are not going to change it for you.\n\n Acceptance does not make it right. And, enough with the straw-man. This is not me -v- the rest of the world. Just re-working it like this is too easy - it makes it safer for you to be so dismissive.\n \nI don't go into your church saying that god is a goat or questioning the definition theological terms that your church has given an exact meaning. When you say \"God\" I don't point out \"I know you mean your orthodox version of God but shouldn't you point out there is a catholic version of God\".\n\n There is no normative for 'God'. Bad analogy. That there is for 'science', means that when you say 'science' pretty much you are saying the same as what is widely taught in western nations. However, just because it is normative, does not make it right.\n \nIf acted like you every time you mentioned \"your religion\" people I would say that Aztec human sacrifice was a religion and I will ignore any specific thing you say about your beliefs you is just the same as an Aztec priest. When you tried to say that you have a specific meaning in mind I would scoff at you and say \"your religion\" is not \"the religion\". \n\n Sure, I accept that there are many faiths, and I believe mine to be correct. If we need to argue this, lets adjourn to the religious thread.\n However when I say \"I believe in God\", as a sentence, this means nothing to many people because the definition of God is not normative.\n When you say \"science\" most people have the same definition as you do. Was this always the case? No? Should it be? Well that's what really we two are arguing here. I maintain that your 'science' definition is not 'science' but a philosophy of science.\n It is because, just as there are many versions of religions, there are many of the sinensis too, and I'm not talking about the differences between biology, physics, maths etc.\n \nIt is a highly restrictive definition too.

My specific definition of science is not just \"being clever\" it is more precise and restrictive. I fully accept that if there is a god at work influencing nature in non measurable ways then science is a less accurate description of the universe than a \"Montalban science\" including god.\n\n Doesn't it bother you doing such straw-man. Actually a silly question, or you'd not be doing it; the second time in one post; reducing this argument as me -v- everyone else. Calling alternatives 'Montalban science' is so weak. I established two extant streams of scientists who believe in the ability for science and God to not be exclusive, as you believe it should be.\n I mentioned the Intelligent Designers, and also mentioned people such as Lawrence Henderson who wrote about the Fitness of the Environment.\n But lets just ignore that and pretend that it's me against the whole world, as you continually do. It's far easier, and far more comforting for you.\n \nThere is a time and a place for many styles of thought and philosophy. Can't you accept that someone wants to build a plane they want to restrict themselves to the materialistic just for that task?\n\n No problem with that at all. As mentioned with the 'rude poster' who shall otherwise remain unmentioned, I have no problem with science per se. Engineers, fine. They don't set about saying that love was constructed by 'x' means.\n Your evolutionist scientists do touch upon human things which I believe have a purpose.\n The mechanistic evolutionists say that purpose has no purpose.\n \nI don't know why you are always talking about me thinking science totally invalidates other forms of thought. Can't you see I am just being efficient with language? I often use my definition of science and I mean it in the precise way I mean it.

It still, of itself can't be tested. It is because it is not 'science' it is a philosophy of science.\n \n Did you even look at the post I made with regards the \"Fitness of the Environment\" theory?",

The White Rose group new that their organisation would not be widespread - and they knew the reactions the Nazi government would take, yet still they chose to act... on higher principles... something you say are both an unexplained accident, yet part of evolution.\n .\n\n \n Then you assert that believing an action/purpose, with complexities that we have yet to understand, being a result of evolution, is somehow in error. Actually, that's called an educated guess...or maybe even a theory (!). \n \n When I see the moon outside at night, I don't quite know the specifics of where the matter that forms it originated, and why it ended up exactly where it is. It's not entirely an explained thing. But I do presume that it followed the laws of physics, many of which we haven't yet identified (and may never be able to), and was formed through a physical, observable process. So Cosmology, riddled with theories and unknowns can be applied in conjuntion with parsimony to arrive at a fairly well defendable conclusion.\n \n I cannot explain exactly why the moon is where it is. Cosmology (and/or Physics) are of course not absolutes and have many theories.\n \n Yet we can use either to explain a defendable theory about why the moon is where it is, even if I don't fully understand either. If it fails no other rational test, and is based on parsimony, I don't see why you wouldn't agree. Yet with your statement, you must think we're being irrational or illogical about something. \n \n \nOne can measure height scientifically. I'm unaware of a measure for love. Hence I question the analogy.\n\n And I question your sanity. \n \n No, not everyone can measure height scientifically. We can measure height scientifically because we have done the science to be able to. We have not finished the science to be able to quantify the human mind. It's quite complex. Even the simplest life forms are still beyond our ken, while the space shuttle, the most complex machine ever built by humans, is achievable, we cannot create even the simplest life from scratch. We have a long way to go. But our journey so far has answered a lot of historically unknown things, hasn't it? However, there is also nothing that would indicate the riddle of neurology cannot one day be much closer to completion. And nothing to indicate there is anything outside the physical world, making the bundle of nerve fibers and electrical impulses behave a certain way. Are you impatient waiting for the answers and feel compelled to believe in something rather than face the unknown? Don't feel bad, most every superstision results from wanting to identify the fearful unknown. And that process to is most likely a result of evolution...\n \n \nSo, when you love someone it's a compulsion, and not a part of a higher self? I hope you don't speak to your partner in the these terms :) - Instead of \"I love you\" you might say\n \"The chemical imbalance caused by evolutionary necessity to mate has drawn me closer to you\".\n What about love for 'mankind' or 'principles' in general, as the White Rose movement showed?\n\n \n What do humans do that isn't a compulsion? Why is a compulsion bad? Why would understanding a more precise definition be an excuse for poor social skills? Do you speak in neutral scientific lingo when you communicate with other humans about the emotion of love? What do you think \"I love you means\"? What are principles? who has them and who doesn't, and why?\n \n We can attempt to answer these, but why bother? I have yet to see you show why you think they might be a result of something other than physical processes, and namely, the process by which all life on earth was created.\n \n And I'll say again, love, honor, principles, aren't diminished by understanding their physical significance. At least not for me. Just as I know some of the process by which a sperm fertilizes an egg, certainly doesn't diminish the joy of birth. If I were to eat an Edward's Key Lime Pie, I would not busy myself with describing and thinking of the chemical constituents of the pie, how they were made, and what they were doing inside by body. I would, because I'm human, enjoy the euphoria, and probably have another slice.\n \n Is it not the same with you? when you understand something (as far as we can actually understand things), do you suddenly lose interest in them and find yourself unable to enjoy them? Does this then invalidate evolution somehow? How can you try to tie any of this together?\n \n \n -Mach",

I did think we were going to have open honest debate. But straw-man is not a very good tactic. I have not herein argued about the truth of my religious beliefs at all. I've been explicit about this time and again. Not in this current thread - unless you can find it... then you ought withdraw the claim you just made. I am arguing about the truth of sciences. You want to change this debate of mine because it is uncomfortable to face a fact that what you've so long held true - with regards to science is but a philosophy, and when such a dogma is challenged, you are that upset you re-work my statements to imply something else entire!\n Clearly some have missed the normative phrase - science. Religion is not such a phrase when seen in modern usage, therefore there is no connection. It is irrelevant to this debate what my views are -because you're not arguing against Orthodoxy.\n You are trying a very convoluted argument to suggest otherwise - that when people say \"religion\" they mean \"Orthodoxy\".\n \nThat's how I view our conversations Montalban. One person repeal calling the other naive and brainwashed just for the way one uses language is different to the other. \n\n How sad. What I see is I have re-entered this forum. I have said that 'science' is not what you believe. And everyone crying foul because it is tantamount to saying the unspeakable. When I post much about epistemology in the past - I get opinion in return - opinion about me personally, including that ranging from the level of my intelligence to some kind of plot to sweep away science. A lot of emotive stuff has been thrown because people are shocked that there are in fact other views out there... that are just as legitimate. And then I get you re-working my debate about science to be a debate about my belief in Orthodoxy to be correct.\n \nI cannot understand how you say God is not normative and science is. I was exposed to one type of science and I was exposed to one type of God.\n\n You have a definition of God, but when you say \"I believe in God\" it is not the same for you as for me. Your version of God is not normative for society. When you deal with 'science' most people have the same definition - even when I disagree with it, I recognise what you mean by it. That is because we all share the same educational system with regards science. It is dominated and regulated by materialists; science education.\n \nWhen people say god help us it is convention that people are not talking about an Aztec. There is a convention in western society that when you talk about God you are talking about the father of Jesus Christ. People just say God and not the \"Christian god\" and I just say science and not \"materialistic science\". It really is that simple. \n\n This is simply not true. There are loads of non-Christians living in Western societies. For your argument to work there'd have to be a homogony that just does not exist.\n \nAs for your comment about me pretending \"it is you against the world\" that is nonsense.\n\n Of course you did this, that's why instead of recognising that other scientists have different views you termed it as \"Montalban science\" that is, something that is relative only to me, or worse, something invented by me. Despite the fact I've posted ideas of other scientists who in fact believe that science need not be materialist... you have insisted on labelling my ideas as \"Montalban science\". It is a rhetorical ploy to down-grade any thing I have to say - to remove any legitimacy from it. Am I to take it you were unaware of what you were doing?\n \nOn this thread everyone else is using words differently to you and you patronise them all for not using them the way you want to. It is not \"you against the world\" it is you not listening to anyone on this thread and never properly answering questions.\n\n That's rich. I walk into this forum and any version of scientific truth different from the materialistic is at best labelled pseudo-science.\n Further, any belief that there's evidence for the non-material is quickly dismissed because it does not conform to 'science' as you believe 'science' is.\n \nAs for Newton and god tell he me EXACTLY how he was going to use science itself to directly incorporate what is not measurable into science.\n\n Newton wanted to put Christianity on a rational base. I suspect you want me to provide an experiment - as you did when I argued with you over Nazi science. Which I don't have.\n \"Newton's science was closely related to his theology. In the General Scholium of his Principia, he states that its purpose was to establish the existence of God (Westfall, 205,290; Clark, 12; Brooke, p.169; Mandelbrote, p.292,300). It was to combat atheism (Mandelbrote, p.292), challenge the mechanical explanation, and point to the need for a wise and benevolent deity and an intelligent Creator (Harrison, p.27). He believed that the universe was governed by general, natural laws set up by God, but preserved by special providence, i.e., aided by supernatural acts, such as comets (Harrison, p.27; Mandelbrote, p.290).\"\n Bentley gave the first of the lectures established by Boyle to defend religion. In so doing he drew heavily on Newton: the belief that the universe was not mechanical alone, but required an intelligent Creator (Westfall, p.205). Bentley wanted neither self-sufficient natural laws nor ad hoc miracles, but instead wanted natural laws aided by supernatural acts (Harrison, p.27)\n http://www.grisda.org/bclausen/papers/aid.htm\n It is the same as the \"Fitness of Nature\" theory. By discovering that the genes alone are not enough to account for all of the form of life - and by finding laws - it is implied that where we find laws - a plan, we must have a planner.\n \nProving that a scientist can do proper science with a deep love of God and a desire to fully understand the wondrous universe he has given us does not prove your point at all.\n\n It is again irrelevant to this debate whether someone believes in God or not. It is relevant when people dismiss a pursuit of scientific truth because it involves things they believe are outside the scope of science.\n That's what this is about - by defining what is science you add or take away legitimacy from particular scientific pursuits.

   "[QUOTE=Mach]No, not everyone can measure height scientifically. We can measure height scientifically because we have done the science to be able to. We have not finished the science to be able to quantify the human mind. It's quite complex. Even the simplest life forms are still beyond our ken, while the space shuttle, the most complex machine ever built by humans, is achievable, we cannot create even the simplest life from scratch. We have a long way to go. But our journey so far has answered a lot of historically unknown things, hasn't it? However, there is also nothing that would indicate the riddle of neurology cannot one day be much closer to completion. And nothing to indicate there is anything outside the physical world, making the bundle of nerve fibers and electrical impulses behave a certain way. Are you impatient waiting for the answers and feel compelled to believe in something rather than face the unknown?\n So we can't measure height, but we can. That's what those two sentences say.\n Love is not a material thing. It has not been shown to be so in any study I'm aware of. Science, by your definition can't find it.\n \n Don't feel bad, most every superstision results from wanting to identify the fearful unknown.

Later on, Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi represent the materialist tradition, in opposition to Ren\u00e9 Descartes' attempts to provide the natural sciences with dualist foundations. Later materialists included Denis Diderot and other French enlightenment thinkers, as well as Ludwig Feuerbach.\n \n Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, turning the idealist dialectics of Georg Hegel \"upside down\", provided materialism with a view on processes of quantitative and qualitative change called dialectical materialism, and with a materialist account of the course of history, known as historical materialism.\n \n In recent years, Paul and Patricia Churchland have advocated an extreme form of materialism, eliminativist materialism, which holds that mental phenomena simply do not exist at all -- that talk of the mental reflects a totally spurious \"folk psychology\" that simply has no basis in fact, something like the way that folk science speaks of demon-caused illness.\n From Wikpedia\n \n One rude poster was mistaken in suggesting that materialism has nothing to do with evolution.\n \n Although philosophical, http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/Process_Philosophy.html looks at the influence scientific materialism has had on the study of man.

And I want to concentrate on those who answered 'evolution is all there is', plus those who also believe in God - but have unconsciously accepted a version of, or philosophy of science as science.\n \n It is because I realised my approach to these debates was completely wrong. I already accept as true the socialising affects of education, and the various forces at work which guide/hamper science, and consequently that there are many versions of science.\n \n But I started to argue from a point too far removed from most people's threshold of understanding; being as most people don't bother about concepts of epistemology. I have drawn back to the very beginning to examine the notion of science itself. When I debated previously, people acknowledged Marxist science, nationalist science etc as philosophies, but differentiated it from their own view of science, which, although it is couched in terms of materialism, people accepted their own version of science as science. Once established in people's minds that the materialistic version of science is but one version then people may better be able to understand that there are a number of other forms of science (or philosophies of); such as capitalist science, Marxist science etc. And for the people who practice these other 'sciences' they too believe that there version is science.\n \n Also it helps people I believe to not so easily dismiss other forms of evolution such as that put forward by Fitness of Nature theorists et al.

No one claims \"evolution is all there is\". So you're debating nonsense.\n\n Really? Evolution as taught is synonymous with materialism, and I use the terms interchangeably, as materialistic notions are embedded in science teaching - which you accept, not as a philosophy of science, but 'as' science. Dawkins believes that because God can't be proved - or lies outside the realm of science, God doesn't exist. For him, evolution enables him to be a 'well-rounded atheist'.

Because you cannot, this will never happen.\n\n Why do I need to introduce an alternative theory? Evolution shouldn't be the 'theory of default', but should be able to sit on its own merits.\n However, in saying that, I did put forward the \"Fitness of Nature' theory, and you seem to have missed that... but then your 'fitness of the evidence' rests solely on a philosophy of what constitutes evidence. Rather circular. We need really to look at the idea of this theory of evidence, before we can proceed any further.\n \n If you answered #1 that you feel things should be believed in without sufficient evidence, then yes, your premise is irrational, and you cannot debate #2.
