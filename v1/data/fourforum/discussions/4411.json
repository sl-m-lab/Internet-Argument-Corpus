   "On August 6, 1945, the world dramatically entered the atomic age: without either warning or precedent, an American plane dropped a single nuclear bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The explosion utterly destroyed more than four square miles of the city center. About about 90,000 people were killed immediately; another 40,000 were injured, many of whom died in protracted agony from radiation sickness. Three days later, a second atomic strike on the city of Nagasaki killed some 37,000 people and injured another 43,000. Together the two bombs eventually killed an estimated 200,000 Japanese civilians.\n \n Apart from the moral questions involved, were the atomic bombings militarily necessary? By any rational yardstick, they were not. Japan already had been defeated militarily by June 1945. Almost nothing was left of the once mighty Imperial Navy, and Japan's air force had been all but totally destroyed. Against only token opposition, American war planes ranged at will over the country, and US bombers rained down devastation on her cities, steadily reducing them to rubble.\n \n On the night of March 9-10, 1945, a wave of 300 American bombers struck Tokyo, killing 100,000 people. Dropping nearly 1,700 tons of bombs, the war planes ravaged much of the capital city, completely burning out 16 square miles and destroying a quarter of a million structures. A million residents were left homeless.\n \n Full essay:\n \n http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html \n \n \n .",

   "I believe it was more than necessary to drop the bomb on China. The bombing of Hiroshima was necessary, however Nagasaki wasn't necessary. Many would argue that Japan was already in rubbles from the continuous bombings from our fighter planes, and plus the blockade we had around Japan. It is also argued that diplomatic pressure being put on Japan by Russia and China would have bent the will of this Empire. I would have agreed with this being ignorant of the Japanese culture, but they were going to fight to the end if we had invaded and the casualities would have been much more devastating, which we didn't need since we had lost so many men already in the Pacific Theater. We need a quick decisive blow that would deter the Japanese once and for all. The bombing of Hiroshima would also establish the United States as the most powerful nation once and for all. It may have also been a tactic to flex our muscle for the Soviets. Having the power of the nuke at immediate disposal struck fear in Russians and they knew the effects of it's power as well as the extent that the United States would go to in order to bring peace. \n \n As for Nagasaki, it was absolutely a waste and overkill.

   "From a practical standpoint, the question is largely baseless from a moral standpoint, sice even the scientists at the time did not fully grasp the dangers inherent in the bomb. While it was well understood that this was a huge bomb that would devestate an entire city, the radiological aspects were not well understood. \n \n FRom what we know of Truman, I think there is little doubt that the bomb would have been used even if the consequences were fully understood, though whether the bomb would have been used in the manner that it was is questioanable. There were, at the time, suggestions that the bomb be dropped in an unpopulated area as a demonstration ot the Japanese regarding its capability. Had the full consequences of the action been understood, such a sugegstion might have been given more consideration. \n \n At the time, though, we were not even entirely certian what the direct blast of the bomb would be like, since these were the largest atomic weapons that had ever been constructed, and even those who designed them were not entirely sure what their likely yield would be (it was nearly triple Bush's estimate). Leslie Groves, the general who was in charge at the completion of the bomb project, believed that the area affected by deadly radiation would extend less than a mile past the actual blast area, and the radiation would dissipate over the course of a year or two, shorter if there was a lot of rain.\n \n While wew were certainly aware that people involved in the development of the weapon were dying of raditiona sickness, the mechanism as a whiole was not well understood.\n \n Today we have the benifit of distance and hindsight, as well as a better understanding of things like radiation fallout and the long term effects of radiation. At the time they did not have these advantages. As such, it seems a little presumtous for us today to second guess their decision. At the time, it was probably the right thing to do.",

   "For the very first time in all of your rantings, there's truth in this one. While Truman publicly justified using A-bombs to save US casualties, there was a post-war political positioning urgency for Japan to surrender to the US before Stalin became involved. Unlike Roosevelt, Truman did not like or trust Stalin. Truman, Churchill and then Atlee also knew the US and what was left of Europe would be difficult to motivate into war against the USSR over Japan or some Eastern Europe nations after four years of convincing their public the USSR was an ally.",

   "It may have not been necessary, but it was economical.\n\n \n Economizing on cannon fodder, readily available, really wasn't as large a concern as post-war geopolitical positioning in that era. The US and USSR were more concerned about ensuring the English Empire was no more, US intent being capturing as much post-war market as possible to utilize our expanded industrial capacity. USSR interest was focused installing a buffer of captive European countries around their borders.",

   "The U.S. Army was preparing to move to 101st Airborne division and several other ETO units to the PTO specifically for the purpose of invading the home islands before Hiroshima. So evidently someone thought it would be nessecary.\n\n \n The US military had been preparing the resources that would be required to invade Japan for some time before the war ended. And not just the US, the British Commonwealth would have been involved as well (recall there was a signifcant prescence of UK forces in the Pacific theatre).\n \n No doubt when Truman was told he could expect a million US casualties from a land invasion of mainland Japan he would have been less than enthusiastic to pursue such a plan. With the A-bomb project successfully on schedule, and considering the colossal industrial effort it had taken, I guess he felt it was worth trying out to see what effect it could have on the outcome of the war.\n \n Off course the Soviets were preparing their massive ground offensive in the East and this will have also weighed on his mind- an opportunity to demonstate the strategic superiority the US now possessed in nuclear weapons.\n \n So at the end of the day we have at least two good reasons for Truman to use the bomb, but it is very difficult to discern which was the main motivator behind the decision he took. I can't really see in the context of the situation he was in a reason he shouldn't have used them. I don't think the huge potential casualties would have bothered him considering the huge losses the USAF were inflicting with much more mundane, conventional incendary attacks.",
