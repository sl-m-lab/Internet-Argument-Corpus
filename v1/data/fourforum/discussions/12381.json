There simply is no credible evidence that it works. But there are many in President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration that are Keynesians. And before they were in Obama&#8217;s administration, some even laid out what a stimulus package would have to have in order to be even theoretically effective. Before he was appointed to be the head of the White House&#8217;s National Economic Council Larry Summers wrote (thanks to The Atlantic for the link):\n Poorly provided fiscal stimulus can have worse side effects than the disease that is to be cured. This suggests close attention to three issues:\n &#8230;\n Third, fiscal stimulus, to be maximally effective, must be clearly and credibly temporary &#8211; with no significant adverse impact on the deficit for more than a year or so after implementation. Otherwise it risks being counterproductive by raising the spectre of enlarged future deficits pushing up longer-term interest rates and undermining confidence and longer-term growth prospects.\n As we documented this morning, there is nothing temporary about the deficit spending in the economic stimulus bill currently winding its way through the House. David Brooks noticed the same fatal flaw today:\n The bill marked up Wednesday in the Appropriations Committee is a muddled mixture of short-term stimulus haste and long-term spending commitments. It is an unholy marriage that manages to combine the worst of each approach &#8212; rushed short-term planning with expensive long-term fiscal impact.\n &#8230;\n The committee staff took the kernel of President Obama&#8217;s vision &#8212; infrastructure programs to create jobs &#8212; and surrounded it with an undisciplined sprawl of health, education, entitlement and other spending. There&#8217;s money for nurse training, Medicare, Head Start, boatyard support, home weatherization and so on. Eleven of the programs in the bill account for the vast majority of the actual job creation. The rest may be worthy or not, but they have little to do with stimulus. The total package is so diffuse, it costs $223,000 to create a single job.\n So by Summers&#8217; own early and honest criteria, the trillion dollar deficit spending package taking shape is already doomed to fail.Stimulus Destined to Fail by Obama Administration&#8217;s Own Criteria The Foundry\n \n And he expects to do this while cutting the deficit in half by the end of his first term. Obviously only the Obama team and those brainwashed liberals are delusional enough to actually believe this blatant lie since it's totally impossible to accomplish based on the realities of what his plan consists of. But hey, he's the messiah of socialism so many will blindly follow him as they deny what he truly represents.\n I Can See Why They Are Nervous\n JENNIFER RUBIN - 02.24.2009 - 11:44 AM\n David Brooks has discovered the unbridled hubris and radical nature of the Obama administration:\n \n President Obama has concentrated enormous power on a few aides in the West Wing of the White House. These aides are unrolling a rapid string of plans: to create three million jobs, to redesign the health care system, to save the auto industry, to revive the housing industry, to reinvent the energy sector, to revitalize the banks, to reform the schools &#8212; and to do it all while cutting the deficit in half.\n \n True, Brooks still clings to the notion that the Obama team has retained a &#8220;realistic sensibility&#8221; (do all that and get money back!?). But he has at least divined that all of this signifies the greatest American government expansion in our or anyone&#8217;s lifetime, and the eradication of our semi-free market capitalist system as we have known it up until now. So he concedes, &#8220;All in all, I can see why the markets are nervous and dropping.&#8221; Indeed. (One investor summed things up today: &#8220;Basically, the market&#8217;s giving you no vote of confidence on the Obama administration&#8217;s approach to solving the economic woes the country is facing.&#8221;)\n \n And we have seen what happens even before the Obama administration sets to work. The mere prospect of all this hyperventilating combined with a few false starts on a bailout have sent the markets into a record slide. None of this bespeaks of any sort of realism or modesty by the Obama team. They seem entirely delighted by the opportunity to undertake huge, complicated, and interconnected tasks and run them out of the West Wing and Tim Geithner&#8217;s office.\n \n But this is not a Geithner problem per se. Even if Geithner did not have the demeanor of a frazzled grad student, it would be impossible to convince all the key players in the economy that displacement of so much of the private sector was a reasonable or desirable undertaking.\n \n Back in the days of the campaign, the fear of many conservatives was that Obama talked a moderate game but was a radical who had his eye on redesigning the free market and major American institutions. No, no cooed the &#8220;Obamacons&#8221; &#8212; he is at heart a moderate and a man of sophisticated philosophical views! Well, Brooks has helped settle the argument as to which side was right. The result is potentially disastrous for the nation&#8217;s economic health and political confidence.Commentary Blog Archive I Can See Why They Are Nervous\n \n Since when is lying about every aspect of what he's claiming to accomplish moral?",

   "To break down Archie's argument - he argues:\n \n 1. That Obama is promoting socialism.\n 2. That Obama is lying about his economic plan.\n 3. That if the advocate of a system lies about the system then the system is being used immorally.\n 4. That if there is one example of a system being used immorally, the system itself is inherently immoral.\n 5. That capitalism and socialism are opposites.\n 6. That if one thing is inherently immoral then it's opposite is inherently moral\n \n Of those 6 points - 1 is dubious, 2 is really quite dubious, 3 is very dubious, 4 is plain false, 5 is not necessarily the case and 6 is plain false. Given that all points would have to be solid for there to be a case here... I can't see your point.\n \n On-topic - personally, I agree with Jo. There is no reason for a capitalist to be altruistic unless it benefits them personally in some way, and moral behaviour is all about altruism.\n \n EDIT: Proof that the six points are all part of the argument - let's make them specific to this argument. Archie argues:\n 1. That Obama is promoting socialism.\n 2. That Obama is lying about his socialist plan.\n 3. That if Obama lies about his socialist plan then his socialist plan is being used immorally.\n 4.

I don't think anybody is going to disagree with the first statement that human beings \"are capable of being moral beings should they choose to do so.\" This statement clearly implies that humans are also capable of being immoral beings if they choose to do so. This is the concept that you don't seem to grasp.\n \n You paint a picture of capitalism as if it is some kind of self-aware AI, like SkyNet in the Terminator series. You act as if human beings came up with the idea of capitalism and then it started to run amok with no human involvement at all. This is simply not the case.\n \n You are correct that capitalism is incapable of morality. It is also incapable of immorality. Only the people involved in a capitalist society can act in ways that are moral or immoral. By your own admission, morality is a trait of human beings based on their choice. Humans can choose to be moral or immoral. How can you be so sure that the human law and regulation you demand is going to be carried out by humans who choose to be moral?\n \n The answer is: you can't.

   ".... You paint a picture of capitalism as if it is some kind of self-aware AI, like SkyNet in the Terminator series.\n\n Quite the contrary. Capitalism is not self-aware. It is a sort of blind, unfeeling beast which must be led by human governance.\n \n Governance such as a human agreement that enforceable contracts can be made between or among humans and/or corporations and other business entities.\n \n \nYou act as if human beings came up with the idea of capitalism and then it started to run amok with no human involvement at all. This is simply not the case.\n\n Again, no. There is always an element of human involvement such as market manipulation, underselling. monopolies, etc. One has only to study what Wal-mart has done to unscrupulously destroy all competition in its path, what Wal-mart has done to destroy tens of thousands of small U.S. businesses in order to control the labor market. Wal-mart began its path of destruction by using its enormous wealth to corner all suppliers, thereby cutting off small businesses from their source of sales items through either making them totally unavailable or making them too costly for them to carry and make a profit.\n \nYou are correct that capitalism is incapable of morality. It is also incapable of immorality. Only the people involved in a capitalist society can act in ways that are moral or immoral. By your own admission, morality is a trait of human beings based on their choice. Humans can choose to be moral or immoral. How can you be so sure that the human law and regulation you demand is going to be carried out by humans who choose to be moral?\n\n In a democracy we can get rid of those who do not choose to be moral through the ballot.\n \nThe answer is: you can't. Which is why many people argue that regulation actually ends up making things worse.\n\n Could you be so kind as to cite a few instances where regulation \"actually ends up making things worse?\"",

   ".... In other words, regulation does not solve the problem of corporations victimising you. More often than not, regulation is the CAUSE of corporations victimising you, because it is corporations, not you, that have the power to influence political outcomes. Whoever wins, you lose, and you're a fool if you think that will ever change.\n\n As the laws now stand, that is relatively true. \n \n Unfortunately, corporations have been given more power than real persons in the United States owing to the purposeful glitch of a mere law clerk who inserted a headnote in an article on Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company 1886, see following post.\n \nFrom the liberal tradition, as opposed to the totalitarian philosophy you put forward, which is that anything created by humans, speech, thought, happiness, should be controlled by the government (which is in turn controlled by the corporations you supposedly oppose).\n\n You deliberately choose to malign the \"liberal tradition\" in regard to speech, thought, happiness or its pursuit. \n \n Conservatives, Republicans, are the chaps who like to control speech, thought, who like to deny happiness to anyone but the super rich.\n \nMises - Human Action. The entire book is dedicated to the topic. If that's too difficult for you, Henry Hazlitt's \"Economics in One Lesson\" you might be able to get your head around, it distills much of the same knowledge to a 3rd grade level.\n\n Ah, the esteemed economics scholar Ludwig von Mises:\n \nSprinkled throughout Mises' scholarly and erudite explanations of market operations are many colorful descriptions of economic phenomena. For instance, on the difference between economic and political power: \"A 'chocolate king' has no power over the consumers, his patrons. He provides them with chocolate of the best quality and at the cheapest price. He does not rule the consumers, he serves them. The consumers ... are free to stop patronizing his shops. He loses his 'kingdom' if the consumers prefer to spend their pennies elsewhere.\" (p. 272)\n \n http://mises.org/Books/humanaction.pdf\n \n Hmmm, chocolate king. Let's examine the Hershey chocolate empire.\n \n The Hershey corporation pretty much controls the candy market in the U.S. \n \n Do they put out a top quality product? Nope, not according to my tastes. But they've duped the American public into believing that they do through marketing and advertising.\n \n Marketing and advertising is an aspect of the economy and can be good, evil or amoral, according to the will of its creators, not to mention deliberately misleading in most instances.\n \n It is very hard to think of an instance where an advertisement or a marketing campaign actually tells the truth.\n \n To those who are stringent in the enforcement of truth, this might create a moral problem but I discount the lies of advertising and marketing as an absolute given of those mediums and I ignore them.\n \n Hmm, there you have it. Here am I, a flaming liberal, saying that advertisers and marketing companies have the right to lie or, at the very least, I'm not going to interfere with their right to lie unless I see someone being harmed by it.\n \n Hmmm, like all those innocent, now obese little American children who were taken in by the glorious lies of the fast food industry?",

   "Damnation! I hate economics because it is so involved and complex and requires long wordy explanations.\n \n Here goes on why there is the concept of corporate personhood in America -- and, by the way, I consider the concept of \"corporate personhood\" to be a thing which endangers real persons.\n \n Let me start out by quoting the stirring words of William Jennings Bryan:\n \nThe Theft of Human Rights\n The first thing to understand is the difference between the natural person and the fictitious person called a corporation. They differ in the purpose for which they are created, in the strength which they possess, and in the restraints under which they act.\n \n Man is the handiwork of God and was placed upon earth to carry out a Divine purpose; the corporation is the handiwork of man and created to carry out a money-making policy.\n \n There is comparatively little difference in the strength of men; a corporation may be one hundred, one thousand, or even one million times stronger than the average man. Man acts under the restraints of conscience, and is influenced also by a belief in a future life. A corporation has no soul and cares nothing about the hereafter. &#8230;\n \n A corporation has no rights except those given it by law. It can exercise no power except that conferred upon it by the people through legislation, and the people should be as free to withhold as to give, public interest and not private advantage being the end in view. -- William Jennings Bryan, address to the Ohio 1912 Constitutional Convention\n\n ThomHartmann.com\n \n More to come in the next post.\n \n Cursed economics!",

   "Again, from the Thom Hartmann citing above:\n \n.... No laws were passed by Congress granting that corporations should be treated the same under the constitution as living, breathing human beings, and none have been passed since then.\n \n It was not a concept drawn from older English law.....\n \n But something happened in 1886, even though nobody to this day knows exactly what or why.....\n\n That something was a lawsuit ... a lawsuit brought by Southern Pacific Railroad against Santa Clara County in regard to taxation of railroad properties:\n \nThe case is most notable for the obiter dictum statement that juristic persons are entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n \n .... California had created a law which provided for taxation of railroad property. The taxpaying railroads challenged this law. They raised numerous defenses, including claims that the taxes violated equal protection. The lower court had entered judgment for the railroads, holding that the tax assessments were void because they improperly included property which was outside the jurisdiction of the agency that assessed the tax.\n \n The Supreme Court never reached the equal protection claims. Nonetheless, this case is sometimes incorrectly cited as holding that corporations, as juristic persons, are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Reference to be made to the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, Section 1 only to give an idea of the general tenor of the amendment:\n \nSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n This case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice Morrison P. Waite -- for a splendiferous portait of the old geezer see:\n Waite, Chief Justice, U.S. Supreme Court\n \n At any rate, Thom Hartmann waxes rhapsodically over over the characters and the scenarios of this case, but the gist of it is that the Court did not rule in favor of corporate personhood in its ruling. \n \n The extremely conservative nature of Waite's court is revealed in this paragraph:\n \nIn 1886 the supreme court justices were Samuel F. Miller, Stephen J. Field, Joseph P. Bradley, John M. Harlan, Stanley Matthews, William B. Woods, Samuel Blatchford, Horace Gray, and chief justice Morrison. R. Waite. Never heard of a one of them? These men subjected African Americans to a century of Jim Crow discrimination; they made corporations into a vehicle for the wealthy elite to control the economy and the government; they vastly increased the power of the Supreme Court itself over elected government officials. How quaint they are forgotten names. In all fairness, Justice Harlan dissented from the infamous Plessy v. Ferguson decision [163 U.S. 537 (1896)], which, as he said, effectively denied the protection of the 14th Amendment to the very group of people (former slaves and their descendants) for whom it was designed.\n\n The Santa Clara Blues: Corporate Personhood versus Democracy by William Meyers\n \n But these stalwart conservatives, every one, did not rule in corporate personhood...\n \n See next post....",

Southern Pacific Railroad and it was later misterpreted as part of the Supreme Court decided law.\n \n Here is a short discussion of that headnote:\n \nthe letter from Supreme Court Chief Justice Morrison Remick Waite to court reporter J.C. Bancroft Davis informing Davis that it didn't much matter whether or not he included a comment about the arguments before the court that corporations were persons \"as we avoided meeting the constitutional questions in the decision.\" \n \n The decision did not rule that corporations are persons: Davis added it in the headnotes (commentary) on his own, and subsequent courts have incorrectly based decisions since 1886 on the headnotes and not the case.

Bancroft Davis collection of personal papers in the National Archives in Washington, DC, where they had been sitting, unnoticed, for over a century.)\n \n The letter from Davis to Waite asking if he got the comments right precedes Waite's response.

Our ethos was decided by those who those who crafted our laws - and if citizens don't participate and engage the economy and culture out of a sense of duty... or at least a basic human sense of self preservation; but favor one of apathy or indifference should be shamed into correction, or ignored altogether; but an ideal somehow espouses an undue sense of entitlement but imploring they should receive political \"alms\" from those who do contribute - that's stealing.\n \n \"Any people that would give up liberty for a little temporary safety deserves neither liberty nor safety.\" Benjamin Franklin\n \n \n \"...The foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; ...the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained...\" George Washington, First Inaugural, April 30 1789\n \n \n The blind, unfeeling beast must be regulated by the governance of humans.\n \n \n Well... that is true, from a certain point of view. Government recieves it's marching orders from the laws that give it direction - not the other way around. Now if you mean government must itself be the arbiter of such, you're wrong that is not what we have here. Capitalism has had more interference from minds like yours than it has has had from any God fearing, law abiding citizen. Those who will not submit to the rule of law are the problem... those cold unfeeling, monolithic Gordon Geko-like, Tsun Tsu reading Marxist ideologues in capitalist clothing have done more to wreck markets and economies here with their OPM schemes than any other mindset in the market before their day. I hope you weren't trying to point any fingers... that would be most unfortunate.\n \n I'll leave you with more hints about just what our laws were formed on so you have more of a solid understanding of what our government is actually built instead of feeling your way aorund the subject. \n \n \"Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\" John Adams\n \n \"Political interest [can] never be separated in the long run from moral right\" Thomas Jefferson\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be sure when we remove their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people, that these liberties are a gift from God? \" Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n \"Government is not reason; it is not eloquence. It is force. And force, like fire, is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.\" George Washington\n \n \"A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicity.\" Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address.\n \n \n If Thomas Jefferson... who was the first democrat ever elected had engaged his duties with balance and propriety in his mind [such traits were etched into the Federalist Papers - which is the foundation the Constitution was drafted from] ] where are you going with this rant? Capitalism [again] is just a vehicle that serves only a means to serve an end... it feels not, it knows not... it only responds to a certain type of input and takes you where you need to go. It does this most effectively without government over reach, and rewards those who engage it with open minds and innovation... and their God given talents with wealth based on what the market will bear out. Not what the government will give out... That is what our founders gave us; there are just those who ignore the rule in place in favor of what they want.\n \n \n \n -That Darn Republican",

[German National Socialist Party]\n\n \n Uh...the fact that I am not ignoratn about virtually every subject I post about (unlike certain others) and I recognize that regardless of the party name, The nazis were, if anything fascists. I reality, though, among people who actually DO know what they are talking about (not you) nazism is actually its OWN system.\n \n Myth: Hitler was a leftist\n \n \nThe primary basis for this claim is that Hitler was a National Socialist. The word \"National\" evokes the state, and the word \"Socialist\" openly identifies itself as such.\n \n However, there is no academic controversy over the status of this term: it was a misnomer. Misnomers are quite common in the history of political labels. Examples include the German Democratic Republic (which was neither) and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's \"Liberal Democrat\" party (which was also neither). The true question is not whether Hitler called his party \"socialist,\" but whether or not it actually was.\n\n \n \nAnd what of Nazi Germany? The idea that workers controlled the means of production in Nazi Germany is a bitter joke. It was actually a combination of aristocracy and capitalism. Technically, private businessmen owned and controlled the means of production. The Nazi \"Charter of Labor\" gave employers complete power over their workers. It established the employer as the \"leader of the enterprise,\" and read: \"The leader of the enterprise makes the decisions for the employees and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise.\" (1)\n\n \n \nBullock writes of Hitler's views on Marxism:\n \n \"While Hitler's attitude towards liberalism was one of contempt, towards Marxism he showed an implacable hostility&#8230; Ignoring the profound differences between Communism and Social Democracy in practice and the bitter hostility between the rival working class parties, he saw in their common ideology the embodiment of all that he detested -- mass democracy and a leveling egalitarianism as opposed to the authoritarian state and the rule of an elite; equality and friendship among peoples as opposed to racial inequality and the domination of the strong; class solidarity versus national unity; internationalism versus nationalism.\" (33) \n\n \n Adolf Hitler\n \n \nHitler saw socialism as part of a Jewish conspiracy. Many of the socialist leaders in Germany, including Kurt Eisner, Rosa Luxemburg, Ernst Toller and Eugen Levine were Jews. So also were many of the leaders of the October Revolution in Russia. This included Leon Trotsky, Gregory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Dimitri Bogrov, Karl Radek, Yakov Sverdlov, Maxim Litvinov, Adolf Joffe, and Moisei Uritsky. It had not escaped Hitler's notice that Karl Marx, the prophet of socialism, had also been a Jew.\n\n \n \nWow...\n \n \n Yes. Wow. How could you possibly be so ignorant on this? I mean, you are so far off it is not even funny...not even in the right ballpark. \n \n \nP.S. Karl Marx is the father of modern socialism, Josef Stalin took the model but used the military as their economic model - which is why they are the rouge arms deal par excellence today. Stay off the Kool-Aid channels - and leave the History Channel alone too... they aren't much good either.\n\n \n \n Modern socialism was an integral part of the french system of government 100 years before Marx was even born.\n \n If you really wanted to look for the origins of socialism, 360 BC...Plato....Republic was probably the original socialist puff piece. Marx was the father of communism, not socialism. The two are not the same. The French Revolution of 1789 was \"The socialist revolution\"\n \n If you go to Google there is a box in the middle of the screen that you can type things in and then click the search button and it will point you toward pages on the internet with all kinds of information on them. Using it will help keep you from looking like such a fool. For example, you could have typed in \"History of socialism\" and it would have popped up all kinds of results showing conclusively that Marx was NOT the father of ANY socialism. \n \n Just saying.....",

Hitlers hatred and opression of socialists is well documented. The act that the workers did not own the means of production in Nazi germany, which is the definition of socialism, is well documented. The fact that the nazis DID practice corporatism, a form of centrally planned capitalism, is also well documented. These are all well established historic facts. You can do all the thrashing around you want, but we are not debating anything here. You exposed the fact that you are apparently completely ignorant when it comes to nazism, socialism, history, and corporatism. I corrected you. There was no debate, and this is not a question of different points of view. You were factually WRONG. INCORRECT. IGNORANT OF ALL PERTINENT FACTS. \n \n Once your statements were shown to be factually inaccurate, you started down a course of what can only be defined as \"Blustering BS\" which has done nothing to prove your case, but has done a LOT to establish the fact that allegations made here regarding your honesty are accurate.

This book reveals socialisms nasty little secret.\" William Cooper\n \n Excerpt from Chapter One.\n In 1933, when Hitler did establish the system he had promised, he did not find it necessary to forbid foreign travel. Until World War II, those Germans who wished to flee the country could do so. The overwhelming majority did not. They were satisfied to remain.\n \n The system which Hitler established -- the social reality which so many Germans were so eager to embrace or so willing to endure -- the politics which began in a theory and ended in Auschwitz -- was: the \"total state\". The term, from which the adjective \"totalitarian\" derives, was coined by Hitler's mentor, Mussolini.\n \n The state must have absolute power over every man and over every sphere of human activity, the Nazis declared. \"The authority of the Fuhrer is not limited by checks and controls, by special autonomous bodies or individual rights, but it is free and independent, all-inclusive and unlimited,\" said Ernst Huber, an official party spokesman, in 1933.\n \n \"The concept of personal liberties of the individual as opposed to the authority of the state had to disappear; it is not to be reconciled with the principle of the nationalistic Reich,\" said Huber to a country which listened, and nodded. \"There are no personal liberties of the individual which fall outside of the realm of the state and which must be respected by the state... The constitution of the nationalistic Reich is therefore not based upon a system of inborn and inalienable rights of the individual.\"\n \n If the term \"statism\" designates concentration of power in the state at the expense of individual liberty, then Nazism in politics was a form of statism. In principle, it did not represent a new approach to government; it was a continuation of the political absolutism -- the absolute monarchies, the oligarchies, the theocracies, the random tyrannies -- which has characterized most of human history.\n \n In degree, however, the total state does differ from its predecessors: it represents statism pressed to its limits, in theory and in practice, devouring the last remnants of the individual. Although previous dictators (and many today; e.g., in Latin America) often preached the unlimited power of the state, they were on the whole unable to enforce such power. As a rule, citizens of such countries had a kind of partial \"freedom\", not a freedom-on-principle, but at least a freedom-by-default.\n \n Even the latter was effectively absent in Nazi Germany. The efficiency of the government in dominating its subjects, the all-encompassing character of its coercion, the complete mass regimentation on a scale involving millions of men -- and, one might add, the enormity of the slaughter, the planned, systematic mass slaughter, in peacetime, initiated by a government against its own citizens -- these are the insignia of twentieth-century totalitarianism (Nazi AND communist), which are without parallel in recorded history. In the totalitarian regimes, as the Germans found out after only a few months of Hitler's rule, every detail of life is prescribed, or proscribed. There is no longer any distinction between private matters and public matters. \"There are to be no more private Germans,\" said Friedrich Sieburg, a Nazi writer; \"each is to attain significance only by his service to the state, and to find complete self-fulfillment in his service.\" \"The only person who is still a private individual in Germany,\" boasted Robert Ley, a member of the Nazi hierarchy, after several years of Nazi rule, \"is somebody who is asleep.\"\n \n In place of the despised \"private individuals,\" the Germans heard daily or hourly about a different kind of entity, a supreme entity, whose will, it was said, is what determines the course and actions of the state: the nation, the whole, the GROUP. Over and over, the Germans heard the idea that underlies the advocacy of omnipotent government, the idea that totalitarians of every kind stress as the justification of their total states: COLLECTIVISM.\n \n Collectivism is the theory that the group (the collective) has primacy over the individual. Collectivism holds that, in human affairs, the collective -- society, the community, the nation, the proletariat, the race, etc. -- is THE UNIT OF REALITY AND THE STANDARD OF VALUE. On this view, the individual has reality only as part of the group, and value only insofar as he serves it; on his own he has no political rights; he is to be sacrificed for the group whenever it -- or its representative, the state -- deems this desirable.\n \n Fascism, said one of its leading spokesmen, Alfredo Rocco, stresses:\n \n ...the necessity, for which the older doctrines make little allowance, of sacrifice, even up to the total immolation of individuals, on behalf of society... For Liberalism (i.e., individualism), the individual is the end and society the means; nor is it conceivable that the individual, considered in the dignity of an ultimate finality, be lowered to mere instrumentality. For Fascism, society is the end, individuals the means, and its whole life consists in using individuals as instruments for its social ends.\n \n \"The higher interests involved in the life of the whole,\" said Hitler in a 1933 speech, \"must here set the limits and lay down the duties of the interests of the individual.\" Men, echoed the Nazis, have to \"realize that the State is more important than the individual, that individuals must be willing and ready to sacrifice themselves for Nation and Fuhrer.\" The people, said the Nazis, \"form a true organism,\" a \"living unity\", whose cells are individual persons. In reality, therefore -- appearances to the contrary notwithstanding -- there is no such thing as an \"isolated individual\" or an autonomous man.\n \n Just as the individual is to be regarded merely as a fragment of the group, the Nazis said, so his possessions are to be regarded as a fragment of the group's wealth.\n \n \"Private property\" as conceived under the liberalistic economy order was a reversal of the true concept of property [wrote Huber]. This \"private property\" represented the right of the individual to manage and to speculate with inherited or acquired property as he pleased, without regard for the general interests... German socialism had to overcome this \"private\", that is, unrestrained and irresponsible view of property. All property is common property. The owner is bound by the people and the Reich to the responsible management of his goods. His legal position is only justified when he satisfies this responsibility to the community.\n \n Contrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public ownership of the means of production. They did demand that the government oversee and run the nation's economy. The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is secondary; what counts is the issue of CONTROL. Private citizens, therefore, may continue to hold titles to property -- so long as the state reserves to itself the unqualified right to regulate the use of their property.\n \n If \"ownership\" means the right to determine the use and disposal of material goods, then Nazism endowed the state with every real prerogative of ownership. What the individual retained was merely a formal deed, a content-less deed, which conferred no rights on its holder. Under communism, there is collective ownership of property DEJURE. Under Nazism, there is the same collective ownership DE FACTO.\n \n During the Hitler years -- in order to finance the party's programs, including the war expenditures -- every social group in Germany was mercilessly exploited and drained. White-collar salaries and the earnings of small businessmen were deliberately held down by government controls, freezes, taxes. Big business was bled by taxes and \"special contributions\" of every kind, and strangled by the bureaucracy. At the same time the income of the farmers was held down, and there was a desperate flight to the cities -- where the middle class, especially the small tradesmen, were soon in desperate straits, and where the workers were forced to labor at low wages for increasingly longer hours (up to 60 or more per week).\n \n But the Nazis defended their policies, and the country did not rebel; it accepted the Nazi argument. Selfish individuals may be unhappy, the Nazis said, but what we have established in Germany is the ideal system, SOCIALISM. In its Nazi usage this term is not restricted to a theory of economics; it is to be understood in a fundamental sense. \"Socialism\" for the Nazis denotes the principle of collectivism as such and its corollary, statism -- in every field of human action, including but not limited to economics.\n \n \"To be a socialist\", says Goebbels, \"is to submit the I to the thou; socialism is sacrificing the individual to the whole.\"\n \n By this definition, the Nazis practiced what they preached. They practiced it at home and then abroad. No one can claim that they did not sacrifice enough individuals.\n \n Excerpted from Chapter 1 of THE OMINOUS PARALLELS, by Leonard Peikoff... most probably the most important book written in modern times.

   "Really daewoo? And because your link says this, it is then an absolute fact? Here's an opposing opinion by someone who is more interested in historical facts than promoting an ideological bent. To deny that Hitler's Germany was Socialist when the word was in the Political Parties name is the epitome of denial and irrational historical recollection. \n\n \n No, what you have posted is absolutely and 100% an opposing opinion by somebody who excludes ALL historical fact and is absolutely promoting an ideological bent. We will deconstruct it in detail so everybody here can see why no INTELLIGENT person EVER quotes Peikoff, who is commonly known as \"Ayn Rands heir head\". Quoting this particular bit of idealogical garbage is particularly interesting because besides being contradictory and in many ways illogical, it does not support your premise. More on that in a minute. \n \n \n \n \nTHE OMINOUS PARALLELS, by Leonard Peikoff...\n \n\n \n First, you will notice that even Peikoff does not have the balls to claim that the 2 are the same...only that there are \"ominous parallels\". Some other ##### who did not understand what he was reading added the fascism = socialism part. This article was written to show parallels between the governments and the totalitarian world view. It does not establish, or seek to establish, a single common root for their economic systems. The ##### who added the fascism = socialism was apparently not bright enough to understand it (which is sad considering the fact it is from a decidedly second rate intellect), and apparently you are not either. \n \n \nThe system which Hitler established -- the social reality which so many Germans were so eager to embrace or so willing to endure -- the politics which began in a theory and ended in Auschwitz -- was: the \"total state\". The term, from which the adjective \"totalitarian\" derives, was coined by Hitler's mentor, Mussolini.\n\n \n First of all, he states RIGHT HERE that Mussolini was Hitlers mentor.\n \n \"Socialism is a fraud, a comedy, a phantom, a blackmail.\"\n - Benito Mussolini\n \n A little bit on mussolini and socialists:\n \n Fascist Italy\n \n \nAfter his initial success, Mussolini became more violently anti-Bolshevik than ever in order to win more support from the property class. He stopped attacking the monarchy, the Catholics and capitalists. He promised a strong government which could suppress the socialists' disturbances and a strong foreign policy which could bring national glory to Italy. Economically, he championed economic liberalism and an improvement in the conditions of the workers. As a result of Mussolini's new tactics, finances poured in from the industrialists. Fascist membership jumped up from 20,000 in 1920 to 248,000 in 1921, and to 300,000 in 1922.\n \n From the early spring of 1921, the Fascists, the Black Shirts, carried out a systematic terrorist campaign against the Socialist and Communist groups. During 1922 the Fascists and Communists fought bitter street battles against each other. The government army officers were friendly to the Fascists and equipped the Fascists with arms. Very soon, armed Fascists were ruling some small towns with tacit approval from the government and the property class. \n \n\n \n So right up front we find that Hitlers mentor was a man who LOATHED socialism. He loathed socialism the way only a former socialist can (at one time he was the head of the socialist party in italy). He KILLED socialists. \n \n Your theory about fascism being the same as socialism is not looking real hot here. \n \n \nThe state must have absolute power over every man and over every sphere of human activity, the Nazis declared. \"The authority of the Fuhrer is not limited by checks and controls, by special autonomous bodies or individual rights, but it is free and independent, all-inclusive and unlimited,\" said Ernst Huber, an official party spokesman, in 1933.\n \n \"The concept of personal liberties of the individual as opposed to the authority of the state had to disappear; it is not to be reconciled with the principle of the nationalistic Reich,\" said Huber to a country which listened, and nodded. \"There are no personal liberties of the individual which fall outside of the realm of the state and which must be respected by the state...

Over and over, the Germans heard the idea that underlies the advocacy of omnipotent government, the idea that totalitarians of every kind stress as the justification of their total states: COLLECTIVISM.\n\n \n This is where he makes the leap from statism to collectivism. Note, however, that he is not talking about any particular economic system, but rather TOTALITARIAN SYSTEMS. \n \n \nCollectivism is the theory that the group (the collective) has primacy over the individual. Collectivism holds that, in human affairs, the collective -- society, the community, the nation, the proletariat, the race, etc. -- is THE UNIT OF REALITY AND THE STANDARD OF VALUE. On this view, the individual has reality only as part of the group, and value only insofar as he serves it; on his own he has no political rights; he is to be sacrificed for the group whenever it -- or its representative, the state -- deems this desirable.\n\n \n Yep. That would be collectivism. Note that he still does not claim any ECONOMIC similarity, merely that both practice entirely different forms of collectivism. \n \n \n \n\"Private property\" as conceived under the liberalistic economy order was a reversal of the true concept of property [wrote Huber]. This \"private property\" represented the right of the individual to manage and to speculate with inherited or acquired property as he pleased, without regard for the general interests... German socialism had to overcome this \"private\", that is, unrestrained and irresponsible view of property. All property is common property. The owner is bound by the people and the Reich to the responsible management of his goods. His legal position is only justified when he satisfies this responsibility to the community.\n\n \n This is where he starts getting a little out there. He clarifies further along. \n \n \nContrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public ownership of the means of production. They did demand that the government oversee and run the nation's economy. The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is secondary; what counts is the issue of CONTROL. Private citizens, therefore, may continue to hold titles to property -- so long as the state reserves to itself the unqualified right to regulate the use of their property.\n\n \n First of all, note the bolded portion. That IS the definition of socialism. He says RIGHT HERE that the nazis WERE NOT socialists. He does go on to explain an important difference in the last section, though, in that in nazi germany, private citizens had the right to retain title to their propery, but the STATE had the right to regulate use of the property in question. That is Statism, that is Corportism. That is NOT and never has been socialism. \n \n \nIf \"ownership\" means the right to determine the use and disposal of material goods, then Nazism endowed the state with every real prerogative of ownership. What the individual retained was merely a formal deed, a content-less deed, which conferred no rights on its holder. Under communism, there is collective ownership of property DEJURE. Under Nazism, there is the same collective ownership DE FACTO.\n \n\n \n Here is where he makes a MAJOR leap. If there was the same collective ownership de facto under Nazism, there is collective ownership defacto under jeffersonian democracy because what he is talking about is LITERALLY eminent domain...the right of a government to take private property for its own use or for the good of the nation. If we chose to use his definition, the US is AT LEAST as guilty as the nazis of this because during WWII we took MASSIVE swaths of previously private property and turned it into military bases and wartime production facilities. In addition, we opened up the entire USPTO to the government and defense contractors to use whatever they desired without compensation...which was the taking of intellectual property. We took IP imminent domain to even higher levels by negating ALL new IP patents that were defense related. \n \n \nDuring the Hitler years -- in order to finance the party's programs, including the war expenditures -- every social group in Germany was mercilessly exploited and drained. White-collar salaries and the earnings of small businessmen were deliberately held down by government controls, freezes, taxes. Big business was bled by taxes and \"special contributions\" of every kind, and strangled by the bureaucracy. At the same time the income of the farmers was held down, and there was a desperate flight to the cities -- where the middle class, especially the small tradesmen, were soon in desperate straits, and where the workers were forced to labor at low wages for increasingly longer hours (up to 60 or more per week).\n \n\n \n Now he is COMPLETELY out in left field. What he is talking about here is wage controls and taxation....wage controls JUST like the ones we had in the US during WWII and taxation just as high as ours was (did you know that we actually had a 90% tax bracket?) \n \n \nBut the Nazis defended their policies, and the country did not rebel; it accepted the Nazi argument. Selfish individuals may be unhappy, the Nazis said, but what we have established in Germany is the ideal system, SOCIALISM. In its Nazi usage this term is not restricted to a theory of economics; it is to be understood in a fundamental sense. \"Socialism\" for the Nazis denotes the principle of collectivism as such and its corollary, statism -- in every field of human action, including but not limited to economics.\n\n \n So, here he establishes beyond any doubt that the nazi definition of \"socialism\" is NOT the same as the definition of the economic system referred to as \"Socialism\". He literally states it...in black and white...and in no uncertain terms. How could you have missed this? \n \n You missed it because some other retard did not understand the article either so they mis-tagged it. Unless of course you want to argue that what DarmRepublican meant all along was that the nazis economic system had almost nothing in common with modern/standard socialist systems but they used the name despite the fact it was a misnomer.

Statism is just another word for, and synonym for the definition of socialism. Here is what statism/socialism has done today to the worlds economy.\n A Crisis of Global Statism\n Mises Daily by Pierre Lemieux | Posted on 9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM\n \n \n The current financial turmoil is a \"crisis of capitalism,\" said a spokesman for Britain's Socialist Workers Party, as good Marxists have been repeating for more than a century. \"[A]n unregulated financial system is a disaster,\" echoed Sheila Rowbotham, professor of gender and labor history at Manchester University. Added a leftist London mayoral candidate, \"Capitalism has had its chance and failed; now it's socialism's turn.\"\n \n I wonder what they have been smoking.\n \n Remember that the financial crisis opened last year with the meltdown of the American subprime mortgage market. At that time, half of the residential mortgages in the United States were already held or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two so-called \"government sponsored enterprises\" (GSE). Over the past year, the two GSEs have financed four out of five mortgages. Fannie Mae was created in the wake of the Great Depression by Franklin D. Roosevelt; Freddie Mac by Congress in 1970. Private investors happily bought securities issued by the two GSEs because they knew the federal government would never let these companies fail - which proved true last week when they were entirely taken over by Washington. Before the crisis started, the American mortgage market was a paragon of socialism, unparalleled in any other Western country.\n \n The 1997 Community Reinvestment Act, which prevents mortgage lenders from \"discriminating\" against minority applicants, did not help sound financial decisions. At every turn of a financial decision, some regulator is lurking.\n \n The American financial system is tightly regulated. Created in 1934, the powerful Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces regulations on all kinds of financial transactions, from registration of securities to disclosure of corporate information. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act further extended the intervention domain of the SEC. The US Department of Justice prosecutes CEOs and entrepreneurs, and the convicted targets are often given long jail sentences. On Thursday, the New York attorney general - a would-be Eliot Spitzer or Patrick Fitzgerald - announced that he has started a \"wide-ranging investigation into short selling in the financial market.\"\n \n When Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson says, \"I don't believe in raw capitalism without regulation,\" he is not revealing a scoop.

   "The crux of Peikoff's thesis is that even though Hitlers form of socialism doesn't fit with your narrowly defined modern version of it, doesn't mean that the principles of socialism weren't inherent in the way his Nationalist socialist party governed. Then you quoted and responded to this statement<\n\n \n Or ANY recognized definition of it. \n \n \n \nHis reference to Marxism is to say that Nazi Germany wasn't COMMUNIST in that it didn't promote PUBLIC OWNERSHIP of the MEANS OF PRODUCTION as the USSR and CHINA did at the time. Are you completely unaware of the difference between communism and socialism? Don't the socialist countries around the world today allow private ownership of businesses? While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany? Statism is just another word for, and synonym for the definition of socialism. Here is what statism/socialism has done today to the worlds economy.\n\n \n Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it. \n \n Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?\n \n \nIt is government intervention and the forced regulations which promoted giving mortgages to people who couldn't afford them which caused this crisis in the first place. It is socialism which has failed now and proved to be unsustainable, just as it did in Hitler's Germany.\n\n \n This is COMPLETELY off topic, but in the future anything you read that claims the community reinvestment act us somehow to blame for the mortgage mess you can automatically classify as being written by an amateur, and #####, or a partisan whack job. It has been conclusively proven that the CRA either had no impact on the mess or a POSITIVE impact on the mess. CRA loans have not been defaulting, Morning Star. Additionally, anybody who tries to equate government regulation with socialism is likewise mentally challenged. The very idea is preposterous. It is a frivolous argument.",

   "\"Market pricing, private property rights, etc.... Capitalist principals. Welcome to the the english language\"\n \n Moot point - no one challenged that. \n \n \"You have still not put forth a logical or factual argument showing that the nazis were socialists. You apparently dont like my sources, but seem unable to refute them.\"\n \n Your sources supported your perceptions, making it all too easy to pick apart; and not entirely factual. You have not fallen in line with the reality of what history, society and revelation bore out as well. You act as though, and use illustrative language as though you actually know what you're talking about but, you're ignorant and foolishly biased. When you've made a point that I had to agree with - I did, and cited so. But on this subject - you're just plain wrong. Hitler may have used fascistic tactics at the end out of deperation. But Hitler did not stray too far off the infrastructure laid by the Wiemar republic he derailed, that is a fact... \n \n \n \"The simple fact of the matter is that the only way you can come to the conclusion that Nazism embraced socialism is if you are ignorant enough to automatically classify government intervention in the economy as being socialist.\"\n \n \n You're the only one saying that... the fact that you are using a moot liberal talking attempting to discredit people by labeling them as ignorant because they cite an element of familiarity is propagandistic in itself.\n \n \n \"What???? As my links established, and as is WELL supported in history, Hitler loathed socialism. He viewed it as a jewish conspiracy and socialists under nazism went to labor camps.\" \n \n \n I understand that... and agree in part, but how he felt and what he did are to different things. But as to your links... they are moot because they are going to support your purview and not entierly out the reality of what took place to get him where he was in the end.\n \n \n \n \"Read it again you retarded monkey. The guy is saying that while many have given MArx the title of \"The father of socialism\" the fact is that Marxs socialist ideas were much older than him. \"\n \n \n What did you call me Behindstein? You better form it up... ignorant jackals like youself think you know what you're talking about, but are clueless. I hope you didn't think that made your argument... Darwin's \"theories\" of naturalistic evolution were not his originally... they were those of his father's. But yet Darwin gets the credits for it. Because he a) published his thoughts first and b) had populist favor with them, kinda like the Kool Aid syndrome going on with Brobama right now. You're argument that Marx wasn't the original designer of socialism is competely irrelevant. As King Solomon put it... as it pertains to human vanity, there is nothing new under the sun... What is relevant is that he is post modern, and in that, influenced the the minds of minds like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Poht... etc. \n \n \n Foolish, and irreconcilably baseless rebuttals... you need to reread through this thread, and still bear in mind that people too are aware of history but don't add the topspin on it for comfort sake. I know how Hitler started up and how he ended up... so does anyone else without a softspot for his policies and politics. If not for what he did in the beginning... he'd have been routed much sooner. In the end... people know what happened and don't need you to coddle then down a path other than what relality already has firmly laid out - there was no way I was going to let you get away with that drive-by BS'ing - get a hint and a life Daewoo, seriously.\n \n \n \n \n -That Darn Republican",
