   "It's very possible that the realm of public sentiment will keep Pluto thought of as a planet whether scientists like it or not.\n \n This might not be a bad thing . . . I think sometimes scientists get too hung up trying to set standards for everyone else. In the end, there's nothing that says the public has to answer to anyone in whether or not it thinks of Pluto as a planet. The very fact it has been thought of as a planet for so long may very well be enough reason for it to remain so with many people. \n \n It may end up being a lot like metric versus english measurement standards. Scientists have long been frustrated by the fact that the public at large insists on using farenheit over celsius, lbs over kilos, and inches over centimeters. But the public can do what it wants--no one ever said scientists should set everyone's standards. It's not necessarily bad for scientists to not carry the day on every society standard. It keeps them humble. emoticon_xangel It wouldn't surprise me one bit if that same phenomenon happens in regards to the way the public views Pluto.",

They simply want people to be able to use metric (actually not so much metric as S.I. units) as well if they're going to do science, because it makes it a whole lot easier.
