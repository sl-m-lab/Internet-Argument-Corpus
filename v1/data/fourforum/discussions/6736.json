That's kind of scary.\n\n \n I agree. If this were a court with all blacks and hispanics and the President nominated a white person in the name of diversity people would go crazy screaming racism and I would be with them. You can't have it both ways. A justice should be decided on merit, race shouldn't be considered. If you think he picked him because he was white you have an issue, but if you're upset just because he isn't Hispanic, then I'm glad you weren't nominating justices (note that the second person is responding to the person quoted, not the poster)\n \n So far actually I've liked what I've seen.

   "So, does Reid actually think a SCOTUS judge should be nominated on the basis of ethnicity or gender???? That's kind of scary.\n\n \n Many political appointments are...appointments... you know, chosen by individuals based on their own personal reasons. Appointing a nominee based on being a conservative, that can mean it affects, directly, their influences and their decisions. Ethnicity or gender are for all intents and purposes, not related to decision making.\n \n For any appointment there are no doubt many \"qualified\" people to choose from. In a white-male-christian run nation, that presently and historitcally has battled gender, race, and religious issues of inequality, it can by some, be considered a positive move to appoint one of the qualified minorities, to set the example, to lead, to uplift, and to make it clear that the U.S. is for equality.\n \n As religious as I recall you seem to be, you'd think you might support freedom and equality, leading by example, etc. Is that not the case? Ultimately people are chosen for whatever reasons the chooser decides. Once again, if everyonen picked from is \"qualified\", picking a minority can indeed be a positive.\n \n -Mach",

As we all know conservates tend to believe there should be limits on freedom\n\n \n I think you could say that the minority have learned to use fillabusters that way, but we don't know if that's why it was put in as a senate option. And yes, conservatives do believe freedom has it's limits. Anyone should know this. If it didn't have limits, we would have social anarchy with no laws.\n \n Conservatives, BTW, are not the ones who try to pack the courts with idealogues. A fair judge is by nature, conservative, in the very fact that he/she is fair. This is the way it is from criminal courts to appeals courts and all the way up. If a judge is not conservative, he might be, say, too liberal in administering punishment, or allow too much crime. The very nature of conservatism is that it holds back. If there is any place in govt. where conservatism is important, it's in the judiciary where OVER-interpreting the constitution is very dangerous. Historically, the Supreme Court has been conservative and the idea of liberal Supreme Court is a mid to late 20th century phenomenon.",
