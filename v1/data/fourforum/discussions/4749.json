   "Is that inherently a bad thing? The #1 obstacle for Iraq outside of the insurgency is legitamacy. Basically giving the finger to America would help them along quite a bit that way. \n\n \n From a practical standpoint, this is probably best for Iraq, even though it is bad for the US. For them to end up with a pro US government of their own free will would have been unimaginable. Nobody on the planet would have believed we did not rig things. As is, we did the best we could to rig things, but underestimated both the iraqis hatred of the US and their unofficial communications channels, namely theri system of communication through religous centers. \n \n think about it. There were almost 3000 canidates all told. The only ones that were allowed any TV or radio time (radio and TV in Iraq is still government controlled) were our hand picked guys. The odds of anybody BUT our hand picked guys, based just on that, were abysmal. The \"no name canidate\" vote would have virtually ensured defeat for other canidates based soley on number.\n \n The clerics, particularly Sistanis guys, did a good job of making this clear to Iraqis, and making it clear that if they wanted something other than a government that was essentially a puppet to the US, they would have to band together and vote a list, and they did. \n \n \nWhere exactly is our dear backstabber Chalabi in this chaotic picture?\n\n \n Not prime minister, which is a little surprising. I guess he wasn't fundamentalist enough for them, so they are apparently going to go with Ibrahim al-Jaafari. This is a guy who makes Bin Laden look catholic.",
