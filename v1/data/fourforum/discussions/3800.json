There were certainly isolated incidents, but you didn't see nearly the number of incidents as are reported now. \n \n I read a story the other day from some british newspaper about a guy who had been arrested by british cops for taking starter pistols and turning them into firing weapons. they suspected he had done dozens of them. \n \n Since they have outlawed guns, a man with a gun in his pocket has become a powerful figure. He can move secure in the knowledge that the average, law abiding, joe on the street cannot hope to counter his destructive capability, and that is a guy with a converted starter pistol in his pocket. Theives and criminals who are inclined to violence, and have practice in beating and bludgening people, have a decided advantage over your average citizen.\n \n In all reality, it is a rather brutish way to live,not a more civil one. Power at the street level is decided by who is bigger, who is the alpha male, who is the better fighter. From a reasonable standpoint, your average citizen has no real hope if a bad guy decides to target them. \n \n Here in America, having a gun in your hand doesn't make you especially powerful, because there are so many others who also have them. \n \n It has been said that god created man, and Sam Colt made them all equal. There is some truth to that. Without weapons, we are ruled by brute force. Those who are bigger, stronger, and more violent, are free to prey on the rest of us (with the exception of the 20% or less that the police actually manage to catch).\n \n While having the government protect you is a good idea, it has never been one that actually worked. There has always been crime, and there likely always will be. There is no escaping this. Nobody can babysit you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but you. Even in Soviet Russia, where penalties for crime were in many cases barbaric, there was still crime (it could also be argued that the really nasty criminals were running things). \n \n It would be nice if someday we evolved to the point that such things were unneeded, but it is unlikely, and we certainly haven't gotten there yet. We are still just animals, and as such are ruled by animal instincts and passions. Sure, we wrap our darker impulses in a think cloak of \"civilization\", but they are still there, and in many people that thin cloak tears rather easily.",

States have specific rules governing the restoration of rights stripped from people convicted of a felony. In Virginia (where I live), you must first petition the Governor for restoration of your civil rights (like your right to vote). Once he does that (and your case seems a likely one for restoration), then you are allowed to further petition the Circuit Court of your city or county for restoration of your RKBA. You end up with a nice certificate from the Governor and an order from a judge restoring your rights. Your convictions still exist for record checking purposes, but the VCIN/NCIC criminal record history database would also list your rights as restored.",

Nor am I sure he could support his claim of illegal firearm production.\n \n These facts would seem to contradict his view.\n \n The U.S. has a high gun murder rate, whereas a country like England with strict gun controls has almost no gun murders and a very low murder rate. \n \n Homicide rates per million (rounded upwards) -\n The first figure is for homicides by firearm per million\n the second is total homicides per million\n and the last figure is the percentage of households which contain guns\n \n \n USA 37 57 39%\n UK 1 14 4%\n \n It should be further noted that of the 4% of British households which contain guns, almost none would hold handguns of the sort which might be concealed.

You see no need to obtain a firearm, (very difficult to obtain a pistol, even illegally, and a rifle or shotgun is not easy to conceal,) or the necessity to carry one, as you are unlikely to encounter an irate householder armed with a Magnum, or Smith & Wesson. If the robbery goes wrong, you flee the scene, and even any policeman you may encounter is certain to be unarmed.\n \n The same situation in the USA, is fraught with the dangerous situation of (a) the householder being armed, and (b) the burglar being similarly armed because the householder is likely to be. The robbery goes wrong, and either one or both of them are likely to be shot and killed.\n And even in the event the robber flees the household, any police he encounters is certain to be armed, and the same possiblity of injury and death exists.\n \n (You are 57 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Britain, even though the murder rate is only a little under 3 times as high.)\n \n The British police were recently given the choice of carrying firearms, and universally refused on the basis that it would only encourage the criminal element to do likewise.\n \n How then can it be preferable to have a high incidence of guns, especially hand guns, in any society?\n \n \n Leo",

   " If that doesn't count in your opinion, then why does homocide rates? Both show numbers between societies with differing amounts of firearms ownership. \n\n \n Clearly, the reason for discussing the incidence of gun related crimes, and homicide in particular, between societies with differing incidence of firearms, is to examine whether the greater incidence of firearms results in a greater incidence of firearm related crime.\n \n The comparison between the UK and the USA would appear to support the latter conclusion.\n \n You seem to be arguing that, in the USA, a high incidence of gun ownership, by virtue of its deterrent value, contributes to making it a less violent society. Accepting an already high incidence of firearm ownership, you may well be correct, but only under the particular circumstances obtaining in your society. \n \n Let us assume, for the purposes of discussion, that your assumptions are correct within American society. Can you not see that these assumptions do not apply to a society such as Great Britain, wherein gun ownership is virtually non-existent? \n \n Starting from the point that firearms are extremely rare here, extensive gun ownership would make this society, (and many others around the world,) less safe than they are now. It may have no effect upon the incidence of criminal behaviour, but an armed criminal fraternity as well as an armed population and police force, would certainly increase the incidence of lethal assault, (whether intentional or in self defence.) There are not many incidents of 'drive-by coshings, or knifings'. Are there?\n \n Furthermore, under British law, you are not entitled to use any more force than absolutely necessary to deter would be robbers and thieves. So if you shoot someone who is in the process of breaking into your home, you will be charged with either manslaughter or assault, depending upon whether you kill or merely injure him. Similarly, if you shoot and kill someone who is attacking you, but unarmed with a lethal weapon, you will be charged with manslaughter at the very least, and are liable to be charged with murder. Reasonable force is all that British law allows to be employed.\n \n There was a case some years ago of a farmer who lay in wait, with a hunting shotgun, for a group of teenagers who were breaking into his home. He waited until they had actually broken in, and then shot and injured one of them. He went to gaol for a very long time.\n \n \n Those are actually low estimates, high estimates hit 2.5 million. That said, these numbers are research and supported by a number of people, one of the most popular would probably be John Lott. \n\n \n I am sorry, but I haven't the foggiest idea of who John Lott is! But what I am questioning is the methodology employed to estimate crimes which might have been committed. Such estimates can only be a matter of surmise.\n \n \n Why? If some comes at you a with a bat or knife and you own a firearm within easy reach, are you going to shoot or ask them to please stop? Shooting someone who makes an attempt on your life, no matter the weapon, is self-defense and you are allowed to defend yourself with a gun. Many police defend themselves from instruments other than guns with gun fire every year, and are justified. \n\n \n A correct assumption, in the event that you have a firearm to hand. And such action would be supported by any court of law, provided that it was obvious that the assailant intended taking your life. Under British law, you would have to prove his intention to kill you, beyond any reasonable doubt. Not always an easy task, given that the victim is dead and cannot testify to his intention. The weapon utilised would have to be of an unequivocally lethal nature, and you would have to prove not only his intention, but his ability to do you lethal harm. An attack with a deadly weapon is a crime under our law, but it is not automatically equated with the intention to commit murder. \n \n Furthermore, as I am sure you are aware, the British police do not carry firearms, and they defend themselves equally well against attacks from criminals armed with lethal weapons. The difference lies in the fact that fewer criminals, and policemen, are shot dead in the UK. Surely this is a preferable situation?\n \n \n Big surprise; more guns equals more use in crime. Take them out of society, the crime proceeds as normal with new weapons. It can even increase crime because you prevent people from defending themselves and criminals loose the deterent of the home owner resisting with deadly force. Say, how's knife usage over there in the UK? Aus has already put heavy regulations on swords due to 'incidents'. \n\n \n Mirabile Dictu! We may actually agree upon at least one point! :) Yes, more guns do equal a greater incidence of firearms in crime. Thank you for making my point for me. :) \n \n I also take your point about the deterrent effect of armed home owners upon those intent upon burglary. \n \n As for knife usage in the UK, I am not sure quite what you are implying. Britain is not known as a violent society, and certainly not known for knife related assault. So I suspect that implication was a case of clutching at straws.\n \n As for Australia and swords, I can only assume you are joking. Australia is a highly developed modern society, and at no time in its history has the sword been a weapon of choice. The number of even ceremonial swords extant in Austra;ian society would be negligible. I know of the legislation to which you are referring, which came about as a reaction to one ioncident, and was simply a part of a larger crackdown on all weapons which could prove lethal. The idea that Australians are charging about the place weilding broadswords is more than a little fanciful.\n \n \n Facts: Reducing guns in society does not stop crime. \n\n \n No! That is opinion. Something to which you are entitled, but do not confuse it with fact. \n \n Be that as it may, I have not, at any stage, contended that reducing the number of firearms in society has an effect upon the overall incidence of crime. I do, however, contend that an increase in the number has the effect of increasing the incidence of firearms used in the committing of crimes, something with which you have agreed in an earlier paragraph.\n \n \n Crime rates in the US are declining. Crime rates in the UK and Aus are increasing. \n\n \n Again, that is a matter of somewhat convenient opinion. I have seen no statistics or evidence to support those contentions. During a recent holiday in the USA, I saw the Bronx and Harlem. So let us not hear about how violent are the societies of Great Britain and Australia!\n \n Leo",

One argument is just as legitimate as the other with the numbers provided.\n \n \nStarting from the point that firearms are extremely rare here, extensive gun ownership would make this society, (and many others around the world,) less safe than they are now.

There are not many incidents of 'drive-by coshings, or knifings'. Are there?\n\n \n I'm not saying what works here will work there, but if you can make assumptions based off numbers, the same ones can be made right back at your society. Neither really addresses why the numbers are what they are, even the best researchers haven't figured that out. But if you proved firearms increase the crime rate, you would be the first to do so. Can't say I've ever seen a drive by myself, but they are rare when it comes to crime. Most confrontations happen within 7 yards according to statistics, this what police and self-defense instructors train for. A knife is very lethal at that range and is of utmost concern for police, because your typical bullet-resistant vest won't stop a knife.\n \n \nFurthermore, under British law, you are not entitled to use any more force than absolutely necessary to deter would be robbers and thieves. So if you shoot someone who is in the process of breaking into your home, you will be charged with either manslaughter or assault, depending upon whether you kill or merely injure him.

Reasonable force is all that British law allows to be employed.\n\n \n This isn't the UK. In the US, you have a right to protect yourself and your family. My state constitution specifically grants me the right to firearms for self-defense. If the person breaks into your house and had the means to kill you, chances are in a shooting that you will get the benefit of the doubt in a court case because they broke into your house and started the confrontation. Many people are killed with hands and feet every year, they are lethal devices if used in such a capacity, especially to an old person or a female of small stature. Other weapons offer varying degrees of lethality that only get greater with use.\n \n \nThere was a case some years ago of a farmer who lay in wait, with a hunting shotgun, for a group of teenagers who were breaking into his home. He waited until they had actually broken in, and then shot and injured one of them. He went to gaol for a very long time.\n\n \n You can clearly see that wasn't self-defense.\n \n \nI am sorry, but I haven't the foggiest idea of who John Lott is!

The difference lies in the fact that fewer criminals, and policemen, are shot dead in the UK. Surely this is a preferable situation?\n\n \n Not when it comes to protecting my family since there are no police where I live. You have to remember, the US populat is approximately 50% in a rural area with no police force. Our police are also no responsible for our welfare, they are there to enforce the law and act after a crime has taken place. Too late if it was your murder. Police deaths in the US only number around 300 or less I believe, not a large number by any means.\n \n \nAs for knife usage in the UK, I am not sure quite what you are implying. Britain is not known as a violent society, and certainly not known for knife related assault. So I suspect that implication was a case of clutching at straws.\n\n \n Might want to look into that. I've talked to other people from the UK who seem to run into knives a lot more than anything else. Heck, there is even a group over there trying to get all knives carried on your person banned (you did know this right?). You get a lengthy sentence for anything with a blade over 3\", and a slap on the wrist for possesing a 3\" or less blade. I'd hate to see the looks on their face when they found out my Remington pocket knige had two 4\" blades.\n \n \nAs for Australia and swords, I can only assume you are joking. Australia is a highly developed modern society, and at no time in its history has the sword been a weapon of choice. The number of even ceremonial swords extant in Austra;ian society would be negligible.

The idea that Australians are charging about the place weilding broadswords is more than a little fanciful.\n\n \n How does passing a law on one incident, limited to swords, crack down on other crimes? Seems like an excuse for further government controls rather than something useful to society.\n \n \nNo! That is opinion. Something to which you are entitled, but do not confuse it with fact.\n\n \n Try finding some evidence that contradicts my \"opinion\", if you find it you'll have made history. Once again, when firearms aren't available, criminals find other means of causing crime. Otherwise, how did crime exist before the late middle ages?\n \n \nAgain, that is a matter of somewhat convenient opinion. I have seen no statistics or evidence to support those contentions. During a recent holiday in the USA, I saw the Bronx and Harlem.

Criminals wouldn't be complying with a gun ban!\n \n 2]I would like to let Leo know that there is a NYC law which specifically FORBIDS concealed carry in NYC for those of us with concealed carry permits from the rest of NY State. You can get a permit to carry a gun through the city. The procedure is insane. [I went to my cousin, a NYC cop, to bring our gun through the one time we took it]\n \n To RooK:\n I live in the country. My county has very low crime rates; the nearest city has high ones. We also, as a county, have the highest number of pistol permits in a county in the state - lots of target shooters. As to self defnse, we also have a long turn around on police response. And, we live \n near 2 prisons. If there is a break, sirens go off. That's when I load the shotgun and put it in an easy place to access. Otherwise, our guns remain unloaded except at the 2 ranges we use.\n -----------------------------------------------------\n \n I am sorry some do not see the gun as a tool. It is used to bring down our number of deer and turkey. it is used to compete in rifle and pistol matches. It is something you do not play with; it is not a toy. It can be used for self defense.

   "From the BBC world news service @\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4581871.stm\n \n Doctors' kitchen knives ban call  \n \n Doctors say knives are too pointed\n A&E doctors are calling for a ban on long pointed kitchen knives to reduce deaths from stabbing. A team from West Middlesex University Hospital said violent crime is on the increase - and kitchen knives are used in as many as half of all stabbings. They argued many assaults are committed impulsively, prompted by alcohol and drugs, and a kitchen knife often makes an all too available weapon. The research is published in the British Medical Journal. The researchers said there was no reason for long pointed knives to be publicly available at all. They consulted 10 top chefs from around the UK, and found such knives have little practical value in the kitchen. None of the chefs felt such knives were essential, since the point of a short blade was just as useful when a sharp end was needed. \n The researchers said a short pointed knife may cause a substantial superficial wound if used in an assault - but is unlikely to penetrate to inner organs. \n \n Kitchen knives can inflict appalling wounds\n In contrast, a pointed long blade pierces the body like \"cutting into a ripe melon\". The use of knives is particularly worrying amongst adolescents, say the researchers, reporting that 24% of 16-year-olds have been shown to carry weapons, primarily knives. The study found links between easy access to domestic knives and violent assault are long established. \n French laws in the 17th century decreed that the tips of table and street knives be ground smooth. A century later, forks and blunt-ended table knives were introduced in the UK in an effort to reduce injuries during arguments in public eating houses. The researchers say legislation to ban the sale of long pointed knives would be a key step in the fight against violent crime. \"The Home Office is looking for ways to reduce knife crime. \n \"We suggest that banning the sale of long pointed knives is a sensible and practical measure that would have this effect.\"\n \n Government response  \n Home Office spokesperson said there were already extensive restrictions in place to control the sale and possession of knives. \"The law already prohibits the possession of offensive weapons in a public place, and the possession of knives in public without good reason or lawful authority, with the exception of a folding pocket knife with a blade not exceeding three inches. \"Offensive weapons are defined as any weapon designed or adapted to cause injury, or intended by the person possessing them to do so. \"An individual has to demonstrate that he had good reason to possess a knife, for example for fishing, other sporting purposes or as part of his profession (e.g. a chef) in a public place. \"The manufacture, sale and importation of 17 bladed, pointed and other offensive weapons have been banned, in addition to flick knives and gravity knives.\" A spokesperson for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: \"ACPO supports any move to reduce the number of knife related incidents, however, it is important to consider the practicalities of enforcing such changes.\"",

   "For those who argue that in the U.S. more guns = more gun violence....\n \n See the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findings\n \n This is a sample of what you would find:\n \n \"Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.\"\n \"Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.\" \n \"After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.\"\n \"Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.\"\n \n Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):\n \n http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htm\n \n \n From 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can't say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)\n \n When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:\n \n In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. \n \n How then do we square the argument that more guns = more gun violence with these studies?",

An iron bar will do just as well and I have seen no evidence that British thugs are particularly sqeamish about using violence to accomplish their ends.\nYou don't need a firearm, you're not at threat of your life, you will not kill the victim\n \n \nI suggest you deal with the social reasons then and leave guns alone.\nI'm happy leaving guns as they are now. But making them mor available in the current climate of violence would fuel the fire.\n \n \n \nSo people who accidentally kill themselves in a pool's lives are worth less?\nYou take responsibility for your own actions. Murder is illegal, suicide isn't. That's the way society has to operate.\n \n \nAnd once again, you are arguing minute numbers. For every life taken in a gun accident, hundreds of crimes are stopped. Even the most conservative numbers you can find shows a ratio of 80 to 1.\nSo eighty thefts are stopped but one person accidentally blows someone's head off? Is that worth it.

The way you deal with sick kids is to treat them, not try to reorder society as a mental institution.\nwhen have killings of such a scale happened before? people who would never dare to attack someone with a knife where they could lose are libreated by a gun to kill. And the fact, if its a fact, that such crimes were non-existent when there was more gun availability is little reason to ignore the fact that NOW guns facilitate such action. I don't know if your 'who own their own gun' thing is true, but if so then they must have gained them from more 'responsible' members of society. If guns are so prevalent it makes them easy to get hold of. I would have no idea of how to get a gun if I wanted one here in the UK. I could get any drug under the sun, but no gun.\n \n \nAny object that is misused can kill, and many objects kill more people and more easily than guns.\nI can only think of far more necessary objects such as cars.\n \n \n \nGuns require safe handling, but it is remarkably simple to avoid accidents. Treat every gun as if it was loaded, point it in a safe direction and keep your figure off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.\n \n There, you just prevented almost all firearms related accidents.\nBut obviously these messges don't get through. And then the little tykes steal someone's gun (it only takes one irresponsible person, you can be as careful as you like).\n \n \nI will point out that if you are around someone who doesn't know how to handle a gun you are STUPID and deserve what you get.\nSo everyone else has to somehow make sure they're not around some gun nut? It's their responsibility.\n \n \nI have watched newbies pick up a gun and point it in the wrong place. The response from seasoned shooters is immediate and forceful.\n \n So yes, people who get hit often deserve what they get, just as people who clown around in and around swimming pools can expect to die.\n \n If guns caused accidents and death simply by their mere presence, the two most dangerous places in the world would be shooting clubs and gun shows. Funny, they are among the safest places out there.\nWho gets hit, the newbie or the seasoned shooter? Being near someone incompetent with a gun doesn't merit death.\n Dangerous dogs are being restricted in the UK because they maul and kill people, particularly infants. This probably rarely happens at dog training centres.\n \n \nOnce again you miss the point: No one should be deprived of rights because of the actions of a very small criminal minority.\n \n Speech can be used to incite hatred and death, in fact there's a pretty solid track record of hateful speech killing lots of people in Europe in particular.\n \n Does this mean we should embrace state control over everything written, broadcast or spoken?\nI think you've missed what I was saying. I'm not against cars because of a criminal minority: I'm against them because they cause accidents and harm.",

   "That's pretty much what I've been trying to drive home. Despite the US having more guns than ever, accidents, violent crime, murder - all of these things are going down.\n \n It isn't the guns that cause crime.\n \n There are a couple of things that caught my eye, though:\n \n \nYou said that black Americans 'policed and protected themselves' with guns. This is vigilantiasm, particularly the POLICED part,\n\n \n There was a poor choice of words on my part. Blacks didn't \"police\" themselves in the sense of develop their own code, enforce it and so forth. They simply acted to protect themselves from extralegal violence - lynchings and intimidation.\n \n When confronted with racists willing to kill, guns are the only way to survive. One of the little-told stories about how and why civil rights succeeded in the US was because the victims were armed and could fight back.\n \n When Malcolm X asserted that it was a choice between the ballot or the bullet, he was right. That is why I don't agree with the argument that the police make guns unnecessary: Sometimes you need guns to protect yourself from them.\n \n \nI've now looked at the site, and considering there are over 600 armed robber suspects in the group, I suspect the gun number reflects either getting the wrong people or only seizing illegal guns. Otherwise it just seems massively unrealistic.\n\n \n An amusing choice of words. Are you saying the federal government is too stupid to find the guns, or that they're lying?\n \n Or are you simply choosing to disbelieve a fact that doesn't fit with your preconceptions?\n \n \nSo eighty thefts are stopped but one person accidentally blows someone's head off? Is that worth it.\n\n \n Where do you get that they are thefts? Once again, you refuse to confront the facts.\n \n Some of those crimes may well be murders and rapes.\n \n When you take away guns, you disarm victims at a far greater rate than you disarm criminals. It's elemental logic.\n \n 100 percent of law-abiding citizens will hand in their guns if you ban them. That is why we can them \"law-abiding.\"\n \n You may make it harder for criminals to get guns, but a far lower percentage will be affected. \n \n Furthermore, you guarentee that criminals will gain an advantage: The ones with guns now have a monopoly, making guns something highly sought after since even the cops don't have them. That's why replica guns are the going thing.\n \n But you also make clubs, knives and bare hands more effective since old, frail or weak people can't protect themselves.\n \n The violent crime rate in the UK is already higher than that in the US. You're more likely to be mugged in London than New York.\n \n Now you can counter that you're less likely to be murdered, but even that isn't strictly true. Murders aren't equally distributed across the US. In fact, if you discount the urban nightmare, the US is actually safer than most of the world in terms of murder rate and violent crime.\n \n \n Then you add non-fatal gun accidents, murders and suicides made possible or far easier by guns....\n\n \n Hold on there. You can't blame suicides on gun availability. Other countries with far less gun ownership have far higher suicide rates. People will kill themselves with whatever is handy. \n \n Same with accidents. Anyone stupid enough to play with a loaded gun is probably stupid enough to play with a downed power line. You can't ban stupidity.\n \n Innocents bystanders killed by gun accidents are so rare as to be statistically insignificant.\n \n Yes, every death is a tragedy, but more children are drowned in buckets  than killed by guns in the US.\n \n When you advocate a policy, you can't just rely on emotionalism.\n \n \nBut guns kill others, and are designed to do so. They are a needless extra risk to your family and strangers as well as yourself.\n\n \n So are knives, electricity and medical science.\n \n Yes, doctors kill more people than guns. Quite a bit more, actually.\n \n \nwhen have killings of such a scale happened before? people who would never dare to attack someone with a knife where they could lose are libreated by a gun to kill. And the fact, if its a fact, that such crimes were non-existent when there was more gun availability is little reason to ignore the fact that NOW guns facilitate such action. I don't know if your 'who own their own gun' thing is true, but if so then they must have gained them from more 'responsible' members of society. If guns are so prevalent it makes them easy to get hold of. I would have no idea of how to get a gun if I wanted one here in the UK. I could get any drug under the sun, but no gun.\n\n \n The problem is that you are blaming the object for failings on the part of parents and schools.\n \n If you look at the school shootings in the US, all of them were preventable. All of them should have been stopped well before they happened. These kids did everything but spray paint the date and time of their rampage on the side of the building - and in some cases they came damn close to doing that much.\n \n Nothing will stop that. If you disarm citizens, they'll steal the guns from cops, as they did in Minnesota.\n \n Blaming guns allows the real criminals to walk away and pretend the problem is solved. It isn't.\n \n It's also worth mentioning that several of those shootings were stopped by private citizens using their own guns or kids who knew enough about guns to tackle the shooter when he had to reload.\n \n One final thing: I used to buy into gun control. The problem is that it doesn't work, has never worked and will never work.\n \n In my home state we passed a shall-issue concealed carry law making it easier for people to carry concealed handguns. What do you think happened?\n \n Violent crime went down. Shocking.\n \n Maybe the law didn't do it. Maybe 100,000 more people carrying guns in their pockets didn't deter criminals or stop crime.\n \n But they didn't make it worse, which is what all the gun control people were swearing would happen.\n \n So when you frame your policy position, please explain that this inconsistency - and why concealed pistol license holders are some of the least violent people in society.",

I'm not sure about if violent crime and murder are falling in the US. If that's true then you could reasonably ask if the violent crime and murder would have fallen faster without guns. \n \n \n\n When you take away guns, you disarm victims at a far greater rate than you disarm criminals.

And thus you have a greater chance of escaping with your life. We can hypothesize about all sorts of scenarios. We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents. Thus they will have a greater advantage than before. However, I think if you look at the empirical evidence you find that the US generally has higher homicides rates than other developed nations and it's hard to prove that gun control affects non fatal crime one way or the other. \n \n \n\n Now you can counter that you're less likely to be murdered, but even that isn't strictly true. Murders aren't equally distributed across the US. In fact, if you discount the urban nightmare, the US is actually safer than most of the world in terms of murder rate and violent crime.\n\n Well if you don't include urban areas then you shouldn't include urban areas in other nations. However, you did that to prove your point about muggings. \n \n \n\n Hold on there. You can't blame suicides on gun availability. Other countries with far less gun ownership have far higher suicide rates. People will kill themselves with whatever is handy.\n\n More correctly, people will attempt to kill themselves with what is handy. Whether they succeed in their attempt or not depends a lot on what method they use. People are much more likely to survive a suicide attempt if sleeping pills are used rather than guns. A person who takes a lot of sleeping pills may regret what they've done and may be able to call 911. But if you use a gun to kill yourself then it kind of hard to call 911 if you already have a bullet in your brain. One study done on the matter concluded that \"Ready availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home. Owners of firearms should weigh their reasons for keeping a gun in the home against the possibility that it might someday be used in a suicide.\"\n http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/7/467\n \n \n\n Same with accidents.

   "I've posted this before, but since it seems to fit the current topic on this thread I'll chime in again on it.\n \n In my opinion, there are fundamental problems with cross-national/cultural comparisons of firearm homicide rates. I believe you really are talking about apples and oranges when we try to do this. You can't compare the Netherlands or England, for example, with the United States and draw any logical conclusions without considering the vast difference in social and economic issues which drive the violence rates. The same problem arises when those on my side of the debate try to compare America with Switzerland, which has an extraordinarily high percentage of private gun owners while enjoying an extraordinarily low violent crime rate. You can't compare these nation's crime rates with America's because the social and economic issues which drive violent crime in these countries are different. If you compare violent crime statistics from these nations, you will see that America has a much higher violent crime rate then these other nations, whether a firearm is involved or not. \n \n We do not have a gun violence problem in America, we have a violence problem in general, and the presence of the weapon does not give rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends. There are no evil little voices calling from the gun cabinet to plague American homeowners. England and the Netherlands have not avoided these sinister voices advocating gun violence with a ban on guns. The people of Switzerland are not collectively so hard of hearing that they have proven immune to the subliminal demands of their guns to be loaded and unleashed on the innocent.\n \n I have seen people on my side of the debate argue that if a crime rate drops after a state passes a CCW statute then the deterrent effect of armed citizens must be responsible for the drop. Listen, I am as strong a supporter of the individual RKBA as there is, but I cannot find sufficient evidence to prove that crime rates go down just because we pass a CCW bill. It's the same problem gun control proponents have: we all want to believe what we want to believe, and we are prepared to claim that a statistical correlation equals cause and effect when it suits our purpose. \n \n What I do know, however, is that the overall violent crime rate in America is not tied to the number of privately available firearms. More guns does not equal more violence. \n \n Here is why I say this:\n \n First see the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findings\n \n This is a sample of what you would find:\n \n \"Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.\"\n \"Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.\" \n \"After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.\"\n \"Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.\"\n \n Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):\n \n http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htm\n \n \n From 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can't say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)\n \n When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:\n \n In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. I cannot say that millions more guns in the civilian marketplace is the cause of this crime rate drop. (in fact, I have another theory for the crime rate drop). What I can say, however, is that adding millions of new firearms to our civilian market did not cause the streets to run red.\n \n ---\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the [second] article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution.

   "So why do places such as the UK and the Australia have such low levels of gun crime compared to the US? If criminals can easily obtain guns in these nations because anti gun legislation has no effect then why don't they use guns to commit crimes very often?\n\n \n Gun crime is an irrelevat statistic. A gas station attendant doesn't care if he is held up by someone with a knife, a gun, or a bloodfilled syringe. A murder victim doesn't care if they were stabbed, bashed, or shot.\n \n Here in Australia, we tightened our firearms laws in 1996 as a response to a shooting spree. In 1997, the rate of armed robbery doubled. Yes, doubled. Assault, serious violent crimes, homicide and armed robbery are all at higher rates today than they were in 1995-1996. But at least the criminals aren't using guns, right?",

   "I've posted this before, but since it seems to fit the current topic on this thread I'll chime in again on it.\n \n In my opinion, there are fundamental problems with cross-national/cultural comparisons of firearm homicide rates. I believe you really are talking about apples and oranges when we try to do this. You can't compare the Netherlands or England, for example, with the United States and draw any logical conclusions without considering the vast difference in social and economic issues which drive the violence rates. The same problem arises when those on my side of the debate try to compare America with Switzerland, which has an extraordinarily high percentage of private gun owners while enjoying an extraordinarily low violent crime rate. You can't compare these nation's crime rates with America's because the social and economic issues which drive violent crime in these countries are different. If you compare violent crime statistics from these nations, you will see that America has a much higher violent crime rate then these other nations, whether a firearm is involved or not.\n\n I'm not convinced that America has a much higher violent crime rate compared to other developed nations. \n \"Whether measured by surveys of crime victims or by police statistics, serious crime rates are not generally higher in the United States than England.\"\n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/html/cjusew96/highs.htm\n \n \n\n We do not have a gun violence problem in America, we have a violence problem in general, and the presence of the weapon does not give rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends.\n\n I don't think that anyone is arguing that guns increase the motive to commit crimes. I do think they increase the means to commit murder. If criminals are not armed with guns then their intended victims have a greater chance of escaping with their life. You can outrun a person with a knife, but try outrunning a bullet. \n \n \n\n There are no evil little voices calling from the gun cabinet to plague American homeowners. England and the Netherlands have not avoided these sinister voices advocating gun violence with a ban on guns. The people of Switzerland are not collectively so hard of hearing that they have proven immune to the subliminal demands of their guns to be loaded and unleashed on the innocent. I have seen people on my side of the debate argue that if a crime rate drops after a state passes a CCW statute then the deterrent effect of armed citizens must be responsible for the drop. Listen, I am as strong a supporter of the individual RKBA as there is, but I cannot find sufficient evidence to prove that crime rates go down just because we pass a CCW bill.

To counter the argument you present above, gun control advocate David Hemenway points out that the actual percentage of the population owning guns in the US has been decreasing. More and more of the population is moving into urban areas where they feel less of a need to own a gun.",

   "Isn't that circular logic? Gun control laws do not deprive gun ownership for those who do not follow laws. Your premise lacks reality in that it disarms only law abiding potential victims.\n\n \n I agree to an extent, however if you can stop guns being imported or manufactured illegally, the criminals will not have any guns. In countries such as Britain where guns are banned the police are generally not doing enough to stop illegally obtained weapons. \n \n Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.\n \n Basically, gun bans don't work because the police haven't done enough, therefore the ban increases crime rates.\n \n While removing the ban is one solution, another is to increase the police's efforts to crack down on guns.\n \n \n Of course I'm not saying it's a perfect solution, there are various problems with it just don't judge the ban when it's not properly enforced.",

   "See, this is great stuff. Solid, well-thought-out arguments of a gun control supporter's view from Galileo. Who says gun control supporters don't have the spine to engage in reasonable debates on this cite which is dominated by pro-gun supporters? Bravo. This deserves a response, and I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to the blog.\n \n I've seen the study you cite comparing England's crime rate with America's. I believe the reason why England was compared with America was because England was a European aberration which caught up with America in some crime statistics, most notably the per capita robbery rate. The other industrialized countries do not share the across the board violent crime rate we do. The survey you cited was performed in 1998 using statistics which ended in 1996, which ended a period in which England saw a dramatic increase in certain crimes (particularly robbery) that caught it up to American crime rates. \n \n This study has been cited by gun proponents before as support for the tempting cross-national assumption that: \"England severely restricts gun possession and sees a rise in robbery rates that now exceeds armed America.\" But I think there are too many problems with the survey methods for my gun supporting brethren to argue anything concrete, and certainly not enough to suggest cause and effect exists from a supposed correlation. \n \n One significant fact to note from this survey is that our per capita murder rate is approximately 8 times higher than England's. Now firearms are used in American homicides about 68% of the time according to the survey, and that sounds right because the firearm murder rate (as a percentage of total homicides) has steadily hovered in the middle to upper 60% range. Yet if you remove every single American firearm related murder from this survey (and assume that no homicide occurs due to the lack of the firearm) you still have a murder rate nearly three times that of England's. But again, I think all comparisons are suspect for the reasons below... \n \n There is a more comprehensive survey of crime rates from 1981 to 1999, which was performed in 2004: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cnscj.htm. One of the issues it addresses is the difficulty of cross-national comparisons of crime rates. For example, there is no uniform definition of certain crimes in other countries, and other statistical references like victim surveys of weapons used are not uniform and vary widely in reporting methods depending on the country. In the end, I find cross national comparisons (whether cited for or against gun possession) to be suspect. \n \n In America, the increased population dilution effect theory you cite is interesting, and arguably between the 1990 and 2000 census you see a population growth of approximately 37 million compared to approximately 20 million new firearms produced. Yet I don't think it tracks crime statistics very well. For example, see the survey released in 2000 for firearm injury and death from crime, (from years 1993 to 1997) which can be found here: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/fidc9397.htm. Even with the steady rise in both population and available firearms, the total number (not per capita) of reported gunshot wounds from crimes fell 39% during this period. To state it otherwise, during a period in which we put millions of new firearms into the market to be purchased by an ever-increasing population, we see that the total number of crime-generated gunshot wounds drop by nearly 40%. \n \n See also the survey of the types of weapons used in violent crimes from 1993 to 2001: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/wuvc01.htm. \n \n For the total number (not per capita) of non-fatal violent offenses, those involving use of a firearm fell 63% during this period. I don't think we can say that the percentage of population growth during this period outpaced the percentage of newly produced firearms by 63%. And the rates of firearm-use for non-fatal violent crime remain low: For the total number (not per capita) of violent assaults/rapes/robberies that were reported during the entire survey, the percentage of those committed by a firearm wielding assailant was 8.3% for handguns and 1.2% for other firearms. By contrast, about twice that number, (16.4%), were committed by an assailant with a weapon other than a firearm, while the vast majority of these crimes, (65.9%), were committed by an unarmed assailant. (assuming, again, that victim reporting of the types of weapons used is accurate enough to be relied upon). Where firearms continue to lead the pack, however, is in the percentage of total homicides. \n \n I just don't think we can make any assumption that more guns = more gun crime. Likewise, I don't think we can make the deterrent argument that more guns = lower violent crime rates based upon these studies. What I can argue is that it appears the vast majority of violent crime is committed by assailants who are either unarmed or armed with a weapon other than a firearm. Common sense tells us that when such a person is confronted by a victim armed with a firearm it is the assailant who is placed at a disadvantage. \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764",
