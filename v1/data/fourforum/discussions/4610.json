   "Well, to tell the truth I don't read Guardian often but not long ago I found a very interesting article. It reported that International Tribunal defendant Serb Goiko Yankovich hid in Russia. Well, it could be but I think that by this article Guardian tried to turn world opinion off from concealment problem in GB. Because of GB gives the refuge for some Islamite Organizations representatives who flooded British capital last time. Moreover some of them GB doesn't want to deliver up to it own ally - USA! Because of GB have own secrets in the sphere of collaboration with Muslim terrorists organizations. And of course British need to keep it from Americans because last one is a main target for terrorists. I'm sure that this article was made to order! They try to close world eyes but it will not. People see everything!",
