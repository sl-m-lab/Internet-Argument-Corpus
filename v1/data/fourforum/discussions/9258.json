She's given everything for our family, so I'm sure she's not \"trying to control women's bodies\".

And I will tell that story later (or find as I have posted it before) - women who also gave all for their families.\n \n And for the record - being raised with certain moral guidelines does not make you brain-washed, whoever said that is silly.\n \n Welcome - whether I will consider your stance sexist will depend on factors much greater than whether you are pro-life. Your stance on birth control, sex education, rape victims, and what you actually think can be done to reduce abortion will tell me more about how I think you view women than merely being pro-life will.\n \n Ta~",

I'm a man (boy in this case) too, in fact I'm only in the eighth grade, but I am pro-choice which does not make me a hypocryte.\nA hypocrite is one that says one thing and does another. By definition you can't really be a hypocrite if you a pro-life male unless you say abortion is wrong but then work at an abortion clinic (or something). \n \n Secondly, many pro-lifers looks at it as a two people as opposed to your view of one person. Considering everyone has been born they are capable of making an argument from experience even if not getting birth.\n \n Third, and most important, the argument made above doesn't even matter because one does not need to experience something or be able to experience something in order to make a moral judgment on it. In fact, you saying you are pro-choice would violate your own stance here. Pro-choice is a stance on abortion and you already stated that being a male you can't make a stance. Therefore, you don't know if women are better off with abortion or no abortion and you should have no opinion on abortion other than an opinion of no opinion. So I think you need to explain to me how being in that situation is the only way to have the ability to comment on abortion.\n \n \nAlso, what are the reasons you think you should make the descision over a woman's body, without knowing her full circimstances and \"being in her shoes\" as they say? And, most women don't share your view on abortion. Why should your views be forced on them?\nAgain, this appeal is irrelevant.

Secular has no more moral backing then a religious argument. \"I think theft is wrong for secular reasons\" is still a moral view just like a religious one. In fact, being untrue to yourself makes you look like an idiot so don't listen to the first bullet. If many people here are atheist why should the religious cater to them? Do the atheists have to make religious arguments when talking to a religious person? Odd.\n \n The second bullet is kind of odd as this part of the thread almost implies that you know whats best for him to not look like an idiot.

I was raised to be pro-life and to this day I still consider myself a firm pro-lifer. I got flamed on another board for stating my pro-life upbringing outright, with pro-choicers saying I was \"brainwashed,\" but I'm willing and able to defend my beliefs.\n \n Most pro-choice arguments I've seen seem to depend on this notion of pro-lifers having some sexist agenda, or wanting to control women's bodies, but my own mother is firmly pro-life, and only because she believes a human life is a gift from God, and not anybody else's to decide.

Any action to ban abortion because one has a belief that life is scared then tries to apply that belief to a woman who doesn't feel that way takes away the latters choice. It is the womans body after all would your mother deny another woman breast cancer surgery? After all some woman may just view pegnacy as a form of cancer or a parsitical infection. Why must others try and force their moral beliefs upon others? I for one think abortion is one of the most evil practices in the world, however, I would defend a womans right to control her own body. I do not want to force my moral belief upon her in an aspct of life that concerns her and not me.",

   "honestly, I don't.\n\n \n Lets just leave it at they shouldn't be making decisions for other people period.\n \n \n \n \nA person that has blacked out due to drinking won't remember but they still had an experience..but, as I said, this doesn't matter.\n\n \n But what would he have learned from it? If you're going to use that analogy, then lets say the last thing he remembers is walking to the bar. What would he learn or have experienced?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNot if you think the damage is worse for the opposing party.\n\n \n There is no opposing party. The embryo has not even one sign of intelligence and is not aware of its existence. And furthermore, no one knows if it is really bad for the embryo. Therefore that argument is irrelevant.\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of abortion, pro-life believes the life of a human, in this case the fetus, is more important than the womens danger, pain, or what have you.\n\n \n My hair is human. My nails are human. What distinguishes an embryo from a parasite or an organ. It fits the description of both.\n \n \n \n \n \nThat is still a moral choice though. You choose the view that abortion is not morally wrong.\n\n \n That is what the pro-life movement has framed us to be. Many of us think that abortion is in fact immoral and wrong, we just don't believe that people's private lives should the legislated, and that people should make decisions regarding their own body, no body else. The \"moral choice\" you must be referring to is is not making a choice. We believe that the individual should make the choice, not the Government.\n \n \n \n \nI choose the opposite...kinda like murder or theft. I want murder or theft to be illegal because I believe it to be wrong. Because I haven't stolen nor have I killed anyone doesn't make me any less qualified to say it is wrong.\n\n \n You do not choose the opposite at all. The opposite of your opinion would be forcing the woman to have an abortion. Choice is a middle ground we can all reach, just pro-lifers are too stubborn. Murder and theft harms other living breathing human beings with feelings and emotion, and is bad for society. Murder and theft laws do uphold the constitution. However, criminalized abortion laws fit none of the above.\n \n \n \nNo it isn't.\n\n \n Can you provide any reason as to why it is not?\n \n \n \n \nBut I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against \"choices\" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.\n\n \n But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.\n \n \n \n \n \nIt was an example. You don't need to \"be in their shoes\" to make a decision on whether it is right or wrong. Just like you don't have to murder or be murdered to make a decision on that one...or any crime for that matter.\n\n \n Murder is an invasion on another's life, liberty, and freedom. If your views on right and wrong were implemented into law, then It would harm a vital party in our political system. I state again, murder laws uphold the constitution and are good for society. Criminalized abortion is an invasion on another's privacy, life, and liberty, and does have many negative social side effects, therefore should never be implemented into law.\n \n \n \n \n \nreally? So no murder law? No theft law?\n\n \n Of course. Murder and theft do not have to do with a select few's morals and are bad for society.\n \n \n \n \n \nliberty and freedom are moral stances.\n\n \n Abortion criminalization invades on a womans liberty and freedom. Therefore abortion laws are immoral? Yet you think differently.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe constitution is a set of laws so I am not sure why you would make laws to ensure the constitution. Laws to ensure laws?\n\n \n Lets break this down real simple. Most laws do have some morality to them. But most are to benefit society and ensure the freedom and happiness of its citizens. Going so deep into morals then implementing that into laws make no sense. Just because a select view's morals are different from society's and invade on our citizens life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness does not mean that that party's morals are more important than everyone else's. Most everyone agrees that murder should be illegal. This is not so with abortion.\n \n \n \n \nSince when?\n\n \n \n Since the beginning of this country, my friend.\n \n \n \nlife and liberty are moral values.\n\n \n How can you say that when abortion criminalization invades on life and liberty?\n \n \n \n \nYou realize the constitution does not cover everything for our society right?\n\n \n So you ARE a strict constructionist.\n \n \n \n \nyou said \"don't make religious arguments\". I think that is stupid. Why not? They are just as valid as any other argument.\n\n \n They are not. Most religious arguments cannot be proven, and therefore are not credible arguments.\n \n \n \n \nBecause it is a bulleted list.... Surely you have Microsoft Word on your computer. Open it up....go to Format and you will see \"bullets and numbering\" as it is a way to do a list.\n\n \n Oh, i thought \"bullet\" was some sort of slang term. Never mind.\n \n \n \n \nGod forbid you use the legislature to make laws!\n\n \n If these laws impede on my and my fellow citizens life and liberty then damn right.\n \n \n \n \n \nI think it is\n\n \n Thats your view. Not everyone else's, therefore it should not be legislated. Your view is that your view should be forced on everyone else. Go ahead and have that view, but no way we're making any legislation forcing that view on other people.\n \n \n \n \n \nYou are the one that brought up knowledge and I think it is very relevant if you are going to be talking about what the constitution says. Furthermore, I have stated that I don't believe abortion involves just one person.\n\n \n Science says differently.\n \n \n \n \nTo be honest, Jito and Simone have rather poor arguments that normally resort to calling someone a woman hater or something like that.

I don't adhere to the idea that I can rank humans.\n\n \n Are you saying you wish to make haircutting murder? Are you saying that I am not more important than my nails?

   "Lets just leave it at they shouldn't be making decisions for other people period.\n Ok, I disagree with this.\n \n \nBut what would he have learned from it? If you're going to use that analogy, then lets say the last thing he remembers is walking to the bar. What would he learn or have experienced?\nYou don't have to learn in order to have experienced something. Thats my point. The point is still irrelevant.\n \n \nThere is no opposing party. The embryo has not even one sign of intelligence and is not aware of its existence. And furthermore, no one knows if it is really bad for the embryo. Therefore that argument is irrelevant.\nDo you have to be aware of existenting in order to be considered someone? I don't think so. Once again, pro-lifers believe there are two involved...not one.\n \n \nMy hair is human. My nails are human. What distinguishes an embryo from a parasite or an organ. It fits the description of both.\nThen so do you. Is human and is a human are different. The embryo, fetus, etc, is both. \"Human\" is not defined by intelligence or something like that...it just means belonging to homo sapien species. Very simple. I don't go into the business of determining a what point you are not \"human\" anymore....at one point people claimed blacks were not human but sub-human. These were scientists I might add.\n \n \nThat is what the pro-life movement has framed us to be. Many of us think that abortion is in fact immoral and wrong, we just don't believe that people's private lives should the legislated, and that people should make decisions regarding their own body, no body else. The \"moral choice\" you must be referring to is is not making a choice. We believe that the individual should make the choice, not the Government.\nThen why isn't murder left up to an individual instead of the Government making the choice? The answer is obvious and applies to abortion as well.\n \n \nYou do not choose the opposite at all. The opposite of your opinion would be forcing the woman to have an abortion. Choice is a middle ground we can all reach, just pro-lifers are too stubborn. Murder and theft harms other living breathing human beings with feelings and emotion, and is bad for society. Murder and theft laws do uphold the constitution. However, criminalized abortion laws fit none of the above.\nUphold the constitution? What does that have to do with anything? Either way, why does a law have to hurt a living breathing human with feelings and emotions? If I have no feelings or emotions can I be killed? Surely not. Your standard is selective and requires you to make a judgement on which humans are worthy of having rights and which aren't. I choose to say you can't discriminate against some humans. We have done it in the past and it doesn't work.\n \n \nCan you provide any reason as to why it is not?\nBecause you have the opinion that abortion is not so wrong that it has to be banned like murder or theft. You really can't have a \"no opinion\".\n \n \nBut the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. \nAnd you are a clump of flesh outside the womans body. What's your point?\n \n \nScience proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.\nthe embryo qualifies as a human with regards to science. \"Person\" is a philosophy question...science has nothing to say on the matter. I don't see why \"intelligence\" or \"emotions\" matter. Someone with less intelligence is not less of a person. Once again, you get into the dangerous ground of deciding who is worthy and who is not. This is a game I don't think we should be allowed to play. \n \n \nMurder is an invasion on another's life, liberty, and freedom. If your views on right and wrong were implemented into law, then It would harm a vital party in our political system.\n My views aren't always implemented. We vote and decide what we think the laws should be and thus we set up a \"right\" and \"wrong\".\n \n \n I state again, murder laws uphold the constitution and are good for society.\nWhat does that even mean? \"Uphold the constitution\"? Laws don't need to \"uphold the constitution\"....they can't violate it (unless amended), but the document doesn't state you need to \"uphold\" any set of values when deciding a law.\n \n \nCriminalized abortion is an invasion on another's privacy, life, and liberty, and does have many negative social side effects, therefore should never be implemented into law.\nWell I think abortion has negative social side effects such as killing innoncent humans. Life and liberty are not even guarnteed a 100% with the constitution. You can loss life, liberty, and property with due process of law. There is nothing more to it then that.\n \n \nOf course. Murder and theft do not have to do with a select few's morals and are bad for society.\n\"Bad for society\" is a moral principal! No matter how you slice it, murder and theft are only illegal because we believe these things to be WRONG...which is a moral stance you have taken. \n \n \nAbortion criminalization invades on a womans liberty and freedom. Therefore abortion laws are immoral? Yet you think differently.\nperhaps they do but abortion invades on a fetus, embryos liberty and freedom...my point was that you took a moral stance! You make laws based on morals all the time and it is not wrong to do so. If you don't, we have no laws.\n \n \nLets break this down real simple. Most laws do have some morality to them. But most are to benefit society and ensure the freedom and happiness of its citizens. Going so deep into morals then implementing that into laws make no sense. \nSo now you admit that we use morals in a societies laws...an abortion law is not too different. \n \n \nJust because a select view's morals are different from society's and invade on our citizens life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness does not mean that that party's morals are more important than everyone else's. Most everyone agrees that murder should be illegal. This is not so with abortion.\nTrue, which is why we have a democracy to decide these things. Gambling is fairly evenly divided...we vote on this and decide if it should be illegal or not. But lets assume it gets to the point that 90% of people think abortion is wrong...does this mean that all of a sudden it is not an \"invasion on a citizens life, liberty, and puruit of happiness\"? \n \n\n Since the beginning of this country, my friend.\nPerhaps you should look at the history books again. You quote the Declaration of Indepedence often which sets out an entire moral position: \"endowed by a creator with certain inalienable right\". This is not a law but many laws in our early years were moral stances. Some states even had a state religion (even after the 1st amendment)! And you want to tell me that we have never made laws based on morals and morals alone? Crazy.\n \n \nHow can you say that when abortion criminalization invades on life and liberty?\nI just said they were moral values. If I believe abortion does the same to another human then it seems one would need to legislate some moral stance here.\n \n \nSo you ARE a strict constructionist.\nNo, I can read the document. It says some things and doesn't say others. It certainly doesn't cover privacy, abortion, gay rights, and numerous other topics. How can you say it did (much less permit them) when they were criminal before, during, and way after the constitution was created...and the 14th amendment for that matter.\n \n \nThey are not. Most religious arguments cannot be proven, and therefore are not credible arguments.\nPhilosophy can't be proven either...anything with morals can't be \"proven\" (to your meaning of the word). You can't prove that abortion is good or bad in your science sense of the word.\n \n \nIf these laws impede on my and my fellow citizens life and liberty then damn right.\n Yet probably 90% of our laws impede on your life and liberty. They aren't wrong nor are they against our constitution.\n \n \nThats your view. Not everyone else's, therefore it should not be legislated. Your view is that your view should be forced on everyone else. Go ahead and have that view, but no way we're making any legislation forcing that view on other people.\nYou need 100% of the people in order to make a law? Non-sense\n \n \nScience says differently.\nscience doesn't take stances of philosophy. I'd like you to show otherwise\n \n \nBut can you answer simone or jito's argument's successfully and counter their posts? If you can't, then in essance, they won. \n \nhaha, they are hard to argue with because they change the subject too often. And what does winning have to do with anything?\n \n \nAre you saying you wish to make haircutting murder? Are you saying that I am not more important than my nails? Are you saying that I am worth no more than the organs inside me?\nThis is known as a strawman argument by the way.\n \n Anyway, to answer your question, no. Your hair is not a human. You are and so is a fetus or embryo or whatever.\n \n \nGood point, but that wasn't my intention. I meant to tell you to stop acting like your opinion is worth more than mine, or to stop with the \"I know everything and no one can prove me wrong\" attitude. So, it goes hand in hand with what I said before.\nI just said I knew more about the constitution and overall life than you. This is a true statement. I never said that my opinion is worth more because of it...and if I did I take it back.",

Laws don't need to \"uphold the constitution\"....they can't violate it (unless amended), but the document doesn't state you need to \"uphold\" any set of values when deciding a law.\n\n \n The constitution ensures life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Violating a woman's right to that by forcing her to carry out an unplanned pregnancy is unconstitutional. Thats already been ruled in the supreme court (Roe V.

No matter how you slice it, murder and theft are only illegal because we believe these things to be WRONG...which is a moral stance you have taken.\n\n \n Murder and theft hurt people. Most of the country agrees on that. Half of the country are divided on the abortion issue. Therefore we cannot go this deep into morals.\n \n \n \n \nperhaps they do but abortion invades on a fetus, embryos liberty and freedom...my point was that you took a moral stance!\n\n \n Embryos are not citizens or even people for that matter.

Its not fair to force your morals on them!\n \n \n \nSo now you admit that we use morals in a societies laws...an abortion law is not too different.\n\n \n But no one really knows for sure if that moral or not. The country is divided. Legislating that would defy and force your views on half the country who doesn't share them. You pro-lifers can launch massive campaigns to discourage women to stop having abortions, and give speeches, launch TV ads. But legislating this and FORCING them to adhere to your beliefs which they do not share is wrong.\n \n \n \n \n \nTrue, which is why we have a democracy to decide these things.

But lets assume it gets to the point that 90% of people think abortion is wrong...does this mean that all of a sudden it is not an \"invasion on a citizens life, liberty, and puruit of happiness\"?\n\n \n Yes, if 90% of the people want abortion criminalized then i would go with it. However, they don't, and our country is divided. Therefore forcing your morals and beliefs on half the country is unfair.\n \n \n \n \nPerhaps you should look at the history books again.

How can you say it did (much less permit them) when they were criminal before, during, and way after the constitution was created...and the 14th amendment for that matter.\n\n \n I dunno, ask the supreme court.\n \n \n \n \nPhilosophy can't be proven either...anything with morals can't be \"proven\" (to your meaning of the word). You can't prove that abortion is good or bad in your science sense of the word.\n\n \n That is correct. Then it would be wise to err on the side of choice, to make abortions available for those who do want them, and give people who don't want them an option to not have them. That is the best answer at the moment, since none of these can be proven. Choice is a good middle ground.\n \n \n \n \nYet probably 90% of our laws impede on your life and liberty.

Maybe 3/4 to legislate people's lives at the level you are proposing.\n \n \n \n \nThis is known as a strawman argument by the way.\n\n \n Nonsense, i am merely exaggerating your point and asking you something. I never said you made any argument. Come on steeve, you of all people should know a strawman when you see one.\n \n \n \nAnyway, to answer your question, no. Your hair is not a human.\n\n \n You are biologically incorrect. My hair shares my DNA.\n \n \nYou are and so is a fetus or embryo or whatever.\n\n \n Of course it is.

There is nothing that requires intelligence, feelings, not living off someone else, that makes you less of a human. Once again, I don't rank humans based on arbitrary criteria.\n \n \nAgain, my hair is of the homo sapien species. What distinguishes that from an embryo?\nNo it isn't. Either way you are playing word games. The embryo is what it is and it is a human. This point is often not refuted. The philosophical question of \"person\" is what normally comes up. A piece of hair is not a human...but it is human hair. You are taking the noun and using as an adjective.\n \n \nDid blacks have intelligence? Do blacks share the same DNA and feelings as we do? This is a moot analogy, as blacks were people. Embryo's are not people...yet.\nWait! There definition of a person was wrong? All you are doing is setting up a different standard for deciding which humans are people and which humans are not. This is the basis for all genocide. There is nothing that says \"intelligence\" is a requiring factor to have rights. I prefer to just assume all humans are persons as to avoid deciding who has rights and who doesn't. Perhaps with your \"intelligence\" arguments we could say that the mentally handicapped are no longer persons as they lack a certain intelligence. Eugenics is not a far step from what you speak of...and it isn't like we haven't done it before.\n \n \nNo, it doesn't. Abortion isn't even remotely related to murder. Toasters are more relevant than this argument. Abortion rights are like drinking rights. We have a right to our own body, and it is our decision. Not the governments. We have life, liberty, and freedom in this country. No pro-life propoganda should be obstructing that.\n this isn't a hard concept. If you believe another human or person is involved then abortion is the exact same as murder. \n \n\n Maybe, if it isn't even born yet. It has had no interaction with society, no sign of intelligence, is a parasite, and is nothing more than a hunk of flesh living off of someone.\n \nborn yet. So that is when you all of a sudden gain rights in your world?

My fingernails do not have rights. It just takes common sense, something the PL movement lacks.\nYou keep making the same stupid idea that human means hair and fingernails. Would you prefer me to use the term human being which is the meaning when using the word \"human\" as a noun? Stop with the fallacies and present some real arguments.\n \n \n \nAgreed. We shouldn't be denying women the right to their own bodys, as they have a right to that as anyone else does.\nso human in this case means the women? But you just claimed a piece of hair is a human...so now women are the same as hair which is the same as an embryo. \n (I wrote: \"I choose to say you can't discriminate against some humans.\")\n \n funny how you chose the noun usage of the word this time.\n \n \n\n My opinion is that I shouldn't have an opinion. Thats like calling atheism a religion.\nSo you don't know if abortion is wrong? If you don't know then pro-life and pro-choice are not options as an opinion for you. Your opinion on the matter should be \"I don't know enough to make a decision\" which doesn't lend you support for either side.\n \n \nI do not live like a parasite off of another human being. I have feelings and a consciousness. I feel pain, I am a part of society. I have friends and enemys, and I interact with others of my species.

Why the inconsistent thinking?\n \n \nExaclty. Rights come into play when the being shows first signs of intelligence. We have a PETA (people for the ethical treatment of animals), yet we do not have a PETP (people for the ethical treatment of plants).\n \nBut we do have people trying to preserve endangered plants...whats the point in that? What logic do you have that intelligence is needed to gain rights? How much intelligence are we talking about?\n \n \nSo you equate my hair to a living human being?\n\n There you go again emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nCorrect, but someone with no intelligence that hasn't even existed as a human yet is.\nAnd now back to the noun usage of the word human.\n \n \nAnd staying off of this ground makes women suffer and society slowly start to be destroyed. Thats like saying plants and animals are equal. We use common sense in our laws. You can weed your garden but you cannot shoot your dog.\nYou can shoot your dog. Futhermore, we had abortion illegal before...society didn't become destroyed. In fact, it was criminal in many places for in the US for nearly 200yrs!\n \n \nThe problem is, you make everyone who doesn't share your view suffer. Yet, if you don't get your way, you don't suffer do you?\nPerhaps i do. Either way, the ability to suffer is not a requirment for laws...and never has been.\n \n \nThe constitution ensures life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Violating a woman's right to that by forcing her to carry out an unplanned pregnancy is unconstitutional. Thats already been ruled in the supreme court (Roe V. Wade).\nRoe V. Wade (and later Casey) are incorrect rulings that are based on the idea of \"substantive due process\". Furthermore, if you can show where \"pursuit of happiness\" is in the constitution, I will mail you $50 today. And beyond that....the constitution doesn't ensure it indefinitily. It says \"without due process of law\".\n \n \nAre you saying that all of our rights are not rights but merely privelages given to us by the state that can be taken away at any moment? You are starting to sound more and more like a socialist.\nAnother strawman! You need to clean up your arguments.\n \n That is not what I said. I said the 14th amendment (which you referred to) does not say you get the 100% guarntee of life, liberty, and property. The phrase \"due process of law\" after that says the government can take life, liberty, or property away with due process of law. And this is true! You can be put to death, you can be jailed, and you can have your house condemned. All of which can't be done without due process...in most cases a court trial.\n \n \nMurder and theft hurt people. Most of the country agrees on that. Half of the country are divided on the abortion issue. Therefore we cannot go this deep into morals.\nyou've already stated this. Half of the country is divided on a number of issues that are law. You only need half plus 1 to make a law. Your may want it to be a certain way but we certainly don't have to make laws that way.\n \n \nEmbryos are not citizens or even people for that matter. Therefore the constitution is irrelevant.\nI agree they are not citizens as defined in the constitution. \n \n \nBut half the country disagrees with you! Its not fair to force your morals on them!\nIt is fair if 50% plus 1 think it is fair. You have to force your morals on one side or the other.\n \n \nBut no one really knows for sure if that moral or not. The country is divided. Legislating that would defy and force your views on half the country who doesn't share them. You pro-lifers can launch massive campaigns to discourage women to stop having abortions, and give speeches, launch TV ads. But legislating this and FORCING them to adhere to your beliefs which they do not share is wrong.\nYou can force beliefs by law all the time. Just look at a prositution law, drug law, enviromental law, and just about every other law...some of which are not liked by close to half of the people. You know how we decide these close ideas? Via a vote. And for the record, most people support restricting abortion more than is currently allowed...and this isn't a half/half split.\n \n \nYes, if 90% of the people want abortion criminalized then i would go with it. However, they don't, and our country is divided. Therefore forcing your morals and beliefs on half the country is unfair.\nhaha, so \"morally wrong\" just changes based on whether 90% feel it is wrong or not. That makes no sense and goes against a democracy. Our country has always had the 50% plus 1 prinicpal. Do you know how many vote in congress come down to 51/49 % vote? Are all of these invalid? Your idea is crazy and hinders a democracy...not helps it.\n \n \nI believe one of those is your right to your own body.\nOk, can you show me why you believe this? Where did the creator say this?\n \n \nIf these \"morals\" harm society, and are forced upon many citizens who do not share the same morals, then yes.\nYou are wrong. Laws have always been based on morals..sometims they are forced upon citizens who do not share them. This is backed up by the history of the US...and I gave you an example of that.\n \n\n If you think abortions are wrong, then don't have one. Plain and simple. Pro-choicers aren't forcing you to do anything, you shouldn't force us.\nIrrelevant when you think another party is involved.\n \n \nI dunno, ask the supreme court.\nIt doesn't take a top lawyer to figure those out. Either you believe in substantive due process or you believe in the constitution as adopted. I choose the later.\n \n \nThat is correct. Then it would be wise to err on the side of choice, to make abortions available for those who do want them, and give people who don't want them an option to not have them. That is the best answer at the moment, since none of these can be proven. Choice is a good middle ground.\nI'd beg to differ. I would error on the side of no choice since you don't know if you are, in fact, killing someone or not. The only way it is wrong is if you are killing someone. Allowing choice concedes that it is ok...and a pro-lifer doesn't support that.\n \n \nYet we agree with them and abide by them. We do not with abortion laws.\nNot all of us....why do you think we have jails?\n \n \nNo, but you better have a damn good majority. Maybe 3/4 to legislate people's lives at the level you are proposing.\nWhat? This makes no sense and clearly goes against our countries views. We legislate peoples lives at \"my level\" all the time. It takes 50% plus 1...no more no less. Any other way is going to be unfair to a majority of people.\n \n \nNonsense, i am merely exaggerating your point and asking you something. I never said you made any argument. Come on steeve, you of all people should know a strawman when you see one.\nYou exaggerated my point to someone I didn't say and then drew an inferred conclusion from that which I don't support. Thus a strawman.\n \n \nYou are biologically incorrect. My hair shares my DNA.\nThat it does...but it is not a human. This is the fourth or fifth time you change tenses for the word human to fit your need. Enough with the word games.\n \n \nOf course it is. Yet is does not have intelligence and is in no way entitled to rights over its host.\nPlus establish where intelligence is required for anything...what level...and why this is so.\n \n \nYou may, but that does not make your opinion worth more than mine. By stating you have more intelligence, you imply that you know more than me, and therefore your opinion is worth more than mine.\nthats a faulty conclusion. The only thing I imply is that I know more than you. I don't see how that relates to whether or not an opinion is worthy.",

   "That is what the pro-life movement has framed us to be. Many of us think that abortion is in fact immoral and wrong, we just don't believe that people's private lives should the legislated, and that people should make decisions regarding their own body, no body else. The \"moral choice\" you must be referring to is is not making a choice. We believe that the individual should make the choice, not the Government.\n\n \n The fact that you are missing is that, upon conception, you are now dealing with two lives, not just one. The legislation is in the interest of the second life. While your hair and fingernails are made up of human tissue, they are not a human. There is a big difference. Your hair and fingernails do not grow into another life; a fetus will. Comparing the two is really quite silly and weakens your argument more than anything. Why can't you understand that there are two lives present? In fact, you and I were at one point in such a stage of life, and we are certainly different living beings than our mothers. You can spin it any way you want, but, in reality, you support a woman's right to murder and try to rationalize it by minimizing the significance of the developing fetus.",

   "yet most of our laws are restricting \"personal choice\" and or freedom. That is just the nature of laws...\n\n \n Correct. That is why we must keep unnecessary laws to a minimum.\n \n \n \n \nThats not the point. In fact, there never really was...I was only pointing out that an \"experience\" is irrelevant.\n\n \n Ok. I was trying to point that out too.\n \n \na plant is not a human.\n\n \n So? It is still a life. What makes a difference if its human or not?\n \n \n \n \n \nTell me, what species is the embryo or fetus? If you said homo sapien then you are right! There is nothing that requires intelligence, feelings, not living off someone else, that makes you less of a human. Once again, I don't rank humans based on arbitrary criteria.\n\n \n So you do value my hair as much as you do me or anyone else. So why aren't you trying to charge haircutters with murder?\n \n \n \n \nNo it isn't. Either way you are playing word games.\n\n \n Right. Attempt to refute my statement, say I'm playing word games, then run. \n \n \n \n \nThe embryo is what it is and it is a human. This point is often not refuted.\n\n \n Of course. But there are many other human things inside of my and your body. What distinguishes them from a real human?\n \n \n \n \nThe philosophical question of \"person\" is what normally comes up. A piece of hair is not a human...but it is human hair. You are taking the noun and using as an adjective.\n\n \n Hair is of the homo sapein species. At least mine is. It contains DNA, and is a part of me.\n \n \n \n \nWait! There definition of a person was wrong? All you are doing is setting up a different standard for deciding which humans are people and which humans are not. This is the basis for all genocide.\n]\n \n That is a common folly pro-lifers use. A black person is obviously human. It has arms, legs, intelligence, emotions, brains, the works. What does an embryo have that is of the homo sapien species? A heart? A brain? Arms? Legs? No. With you logic, I can say \"Deciding that plants are worth less than humans is a base for genocide\". You have to draw a line and use common sense. Or else people will suffer. Blacks are obviously people. The people of that time knew that they had intelligence, similar DNA, and emotions. We all acknowledge that an embryo is far different than a human. It can't even live on its own.\n \n \n What the woman giveth, she can taketh away.\n \n \n \nThere is nothing that says \"intelligence\" is a requiring factor to have rights.\n\n \n And why not. We don't give plants rights, yet we give dogs rights. We don't give organs or hair rights yet we give fish rights. Why should someone without intelligence deserve rights at all? They aren't even aware that they exist, and we don't know if they would enjoy these rights or not.\n \n \n \nI prefer to just assume all humans are persons as to avoid deciding who has rights and who doesn't.\n\n \n That line of thinking has caused a lot of pain and misery in this country.\n \n \n \nPerhaps with your \"intelligence\" arguments we could say that the mentally handicapped are no longer persons as they lack a certain intelligence.\n\n \n Of course not. The mentally ill have intelligence. Anything that has intelligence deserves rights, even if it has very little. But something with no intelligence whatsoever does not.\n \n \n \n \nEugenics is not a far step from what you speak of...and it isn't like we haven't done it before.\n\n \n How come all pro-lifers start to cry \"eugenics\" when cornered?\n \n \n \n [/quote]this isn't a hard concept. If you believe another human or person is involved then abortion is the exact same as murder.[/quote]\n \n Maybe, but the thing is, many don't.\n \n \n \n \nborn yet. So that is when you all of a sudden gain rights in your world?\n\n \n When you gain intelligence. Thats when your world starts, when you have intelligence. You don't really exist, at least in terms of consciousness, without even a slight bit of it.\n \n \n \nI'd like to know what features exist 1 minute before birth and one minute afterwards that make you a human now.\n\n \n I'm not for late term abortions or partial-birth. But when an embryo gains intelligence, then it has truly entered our world.\n \n \n \n \nYou keep making the same stupid idea that human means hair and fingernails.\n\n \n Scientists agree. They ARE human...\n \n \n \n \nWould you prefer me to use the term human being which is the meaning when using the word \"human\" as a noun? Stop with the fallacies and present some real arguments.\n\n \n So you cannot refute my statement? All you can do is get nit-picky with english?\n \n \n \n \nso human in this case means the women? But you just claimed a piece of hair is a human...so now women are the same as hair which is the same as an embryo.\n\n \n Embryo's and hair lack intelligence.\n \n \n \n \n(I wrote: \"I choose to say you can't discriminate against some humans.\")\n \n funny how you chose the noun usage of the word this time.\n\n \n A hair contains human DNA and life. My skin does too. Therefore what makes them unhuman?\n \n \n \n \n \nSo you don't know if abortion is wrong?\n\n \n Of course its wrong. Just not wrong enough to be legislated. Like you said before, laws obstruct on our personal freedom.\n \n \n \n \nIf you don't know then pro-life and pro-choice are not options as an opinion for you. Your opinion on the matter should be \"I don't know enough to make a decision\" which doesn't lend you support for either side.\n\n \n You sound as though being pro choice is making a decision on abortion. Its not. Its letting the person its actually happening to make the decision.\n \n \n \n \nYour species? You mean the human species? The same one that an embryo belongs to? Why the inconsistent thinking?\n\n \n The same reason nail cutting is inconsistent.\n \n \n \n \nBut we do have people trying to preserve endangered plants...whats the point in that?\n\n \n Thats to help preserve the ANIMALS that live off of the plants, and to balance our ecosystem.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat logic do you have that intelligence is needed to gain rights? How much intelligence are we talking about?\n\n \n Because what good are rights if you don't even know you have them?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere you go again emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Its a perfectly legit point that you haven't refuted yet.\n \n \n \n \nAnd now back to the noun usage of the word human.\n\n \n Stop being a grammar nazi and start debating.\n \n \n \n \nYou can shoot your dog. Futhermore, we had abortion illegal before...society didn't become destroyed. In fact, it was criminal in many places for in the US for nearly 200yrs!\n\n \n The last 200yrs of the US hasn't been too pretty let me remind you.\n \n \n \n \n \nPerhaps i do. Either way, the ability to suffer is not a requirment for laws...and never has been.\n\n \n Then you're entitled to have that view. You're not entitled to force it on anyone else.\n \n \n \n \nRoe V. Wade (and later Casey) are incorrect rulings that are based on the idea of \"substantive due process\".\n\n \n I don't care, take it up with the supreme court.\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, if you can show where \"pursuit of happiness\" is in the constitution, I will mail you $50 today. And beyond that....the constitution doesn't ensure it indefinitily. It says \"without due process of law\".\n\n \n \n And...?\n \n \n \nAnother strawman! You need to clean up your arguments.\n\n \n Make false accusations all you want. You haven't been debating me at all the last few posts, only making more flase accusations.\n \n \n \n \nThat is not what I said. I said the 14th amendment (which you referred to) does not say you get the 100% guarntee of life, liberty, and property. The phrase \"due process of law\" after that says the government can take life, liberty, or property away with due process of law. And this is true! You can be put to death, you can be jailed, and you can have your house condemned.

Half of the country is divided on a number of issues that are law. You only need half plus 1 to make a law. Your may want it to be a certain way but we certainly don't have to make laws that way.\n\n \n No one in laws past if making people suffer the way you are proposing. If half the country plus one was for bringing back concentration camps for jews, would you agree with it? Laws this harmful should have a larger majority than half plus 1. Besides, whether abortion is legalized or criminalized does not concern of affect you in anyway.\n \n \n \n \n \nI agree they are not citizens as defined in the constitution.\n \n It is fair if 50% plus 1 think it is fair. You have to force your morals on one side or the other.\n\n \n If i proposed that ever pro-lifer in the nation, including you, were starved, tortured, and put in concentration camps and we got a 50.000000001% majority would you still want this to happen? The thing is, these laws don't affect you at all. If the pro-choicers have it their way, then no one is hurt. If the pro-lifers have it their way, many women will suffer.\n \n \n \n \nYou can force beliefs by law all the time. Just look at a prositution law, drug law, enviromental law, and just about every other law...some of which are not liked by close to half of the people. You know how we decide these close ideas? Via a vote. And for the record, most people support restricting abortion more than is currently allowed...and this isn't a half/half split.\n\n \n Then how come almost every pro-life legislation in the country was rejected? These laws do not affect you, therefore you should leave it up to the person who it is affecting to make the descision.\n \n \n \n \n \nhaha, so \"morally wrong\" just changes based on whether 90% feel it is wrong or not.\n\n \n If it affects you or you advocates in no way, only affects the other side, then, well, yes.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOk, can you show me why you believe this? Where did the creator say this?\n\n \n When did he say this right was taken away.\n \n \n \n \n \nYou are wrong. Laws have always been based on morals..sometims they are forced upon citizens who do not share them.\n\n \n But usually does not make them suffer, and benifits the winning party. In this case, anyone who does not share the pro-lifers beliefs or wants an abortion will suffer, while the pro-lifers never suffer no matter if they lose or win. Why is this even your buisness anyway?\n \n \n \n \nThis is backed up by the history of the US...and I gave you an example of that.\n Irrelevant when you think another party is involved.\n\n \n But relevant when half the country thinks theres not.\n \n \n \n \n \nIt doesn't take a top lawyer to figure those out. Either you believe in substantive due process or you believe in the constitution as adopted. I choose the later.\n\n \n I believe you mean latter. I disagree with you anyway.\n \n \nI'd beg to differ. I would error on the side of no choice since you don't know if you are, in fact, killing someone or not. The only way it is wrong is if you are killing someone. Allowing choice concedes that it is ok...and a pro-lifer doesn't support that.\n\n \n Tolerating pro-life laws forces people to suffer, which we DO KNOW FOR SURE is wrong. If an embryo has not intelligence, then it is not different than a plant. Heck, should we make any kind of killing, from taking a shower, to disinfecting a cut, to weeding your garden illegal because we want to error on the side of \"life\". Life is just a fancy word for \"force\".\n \n \n \n \nNot all of us....why do you think we have jails?\n\n \n Jails are for people who hurt others. Having an abortion is hurting no one. It may hurt something, but whatever it is it is not a person.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat? This makes no sense and clearly goes against our countries views. We legislate peoples lives at \"my level\" all the time. It takes 50% plus 1...no more no less. Any other way is going to be unfair to a majority of people.\n\n \n Yes, but this is in now way benifiting you. Its only hurting your opponents. Why do you continue if you have nothing to gain, and the other side has only to loose? That takes more. At least it should.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou exaggerated my point to someone I didn't say and then drew an inferred conclusion from that which I don't support.\n\n \n I never made any statements or drew any conclusions. It was a question.\n \n \n \n \n \nThat it does...but it is not a human.\n\n \n Well, I think it is! Haircutting is murder!\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is the fourth or fifth time you change tenses for the word human to fit your need. Enough with the word games.\n\n \n HAHAHA! Are you kidding me? Read your own post before you critisize mine.\n \n \n \n \n \nPlus establish where intelligence is required for anything...what level...and why this is so.\n\n \n No levels. Either you have it or you don't. You are in no way entitled to rights if you don't even know you exist. If you don't even have a, erm, \"soul\" as you speak. Why would you want to grant these rights if the embryo cannot enjoy it?\n \n \n \n My final question remains. Why should you, a man, with no experience in baby making or any of that, and nothing to loose, make the decision for someone faced with a painful life and a hard choice? You are not hurt in any way, yet the women you are forcing are. Why do you care if a woman aborts an embryo? She has a hard life, let her make the decision. She knows her circumstances best. And no, don't use the murder analogy, because you are hurt if murder is legalized. Your life is in danger. However here, you have absolutely nothing to loose, and you are only hurting more people. Why do you persist? Because you have a different view than us of mere morals?",

Just look at the definition of the word. But what you call it is irrelevant. The only point to be made is that if you have dignity for a certain kind of being then abortion is wrong. If you have dignity for a certain kind of being but these beings have to meet certain random criteria then you could support abortion. I think the latter is stupid and inconsistent. If you accept some criteria for limitation you can't say that limtations are bad...like someone saying you can abort up to one year of age.\n \n \n \nWhat the woman giveth, she can taketh away.\n Really, kills her son of 43 yrs old is fine with you?\n \n \nAnd why not. We don't give plants rights, yet we give dogs rights. \nWhich is odd, you find a dog to be more important then some humans...interesting. And yes, some plants have rights.

They aren't even aware that they exist, and we don't know if they would enjoy these rights or not.\nWhat do you mean by intelligence? Any? Whats the standard?

Its letting the person its actually happening to make the decision.\nYet it is. Allowance is making a decision.\n \n \nBecause what good are rights if you don't even know you have them?\n \nSo you need to know your rights in order to have intelligence. Wow, we can abort around 75% of the US.\n \n \nIts a perfectly legit point that you haven't refuted yet.\nChanging tenses is not a legit point. It is a cheap tactic of debating.\n \n \nStop being a grammar nazi and start debating.\nThen start reading my argument the way they are presented and stop running away by changing tenses.\n \n \nThe last 200yrs of the US hasn't been too pretty let me remind you.\nHuh?\n \n \nThen you're entitled to have that view. You're not entitled to force it on anyone else.\nYes I am.\n \n \nI don't care, take it up with the supreme court.\nObviously you don't care. the document that founded and established this country shouldn't mean too much to you emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nAnd...?\nAnd it is very clear you don't understand our law system.\n \n \nThe can be done with due process of law. Not indefinitly.\nHuh?\n \n \nNo one in laws past if making people suffer the way you are proposing. If half the country plus one was for bringing back concentration camps for jews, would you agree with it? Laws this harmful should have a larger majority than half plus 1. Besides, whether abortion is legalized or criminalized does not concern of affect you in anyway.\nyes it does (but oddly enough concentration camps for jews wouldn't \"affect\" me in the same way you mean as I am not jewish). Furthermore, assuming concentration camps could come back with 50% +1 (in other words, minus a few amendments) then no I wouldn't support the law but yes I would support the way it was done. People seem to think that a democracy can only produce good results...works both ways.\n \n \nIf i proposed that ever pro-lifer in the nation, including you, were starved, tortured, and put in concentration camps and we got a 50.000000001% majority would you still want this to happen? The thing is, these laws don't affect you at all. If the pro-choicers have it their way, then no one is hurt. If the pro-lifers have it their way, many women will suffer.\nAnd? A law only effects the ones that do that activity. If you ban smoking in buildings it only hurts smokers. Your logic is flawed there.\n \n\n Then how come almost every pro-life legislation in the country was rejected? These laws do not affect you, therefore you should leave it up to the person who it is affecting to make the descision.\nThey aren't rejected by the people...they are rejected by the courts.\n \n\n When did he say this right was taken away.\nEndowed means given to, not taken away. You stated the Creator endowed you with this right...where and how?\n \n \nBut usually does not make them suffer, and benifits the winning party. In this case, anyone who does not share the pro-lifers beliefs or wants an abortion will suffer, while the pro-lifers never suffer no matter if they lose or win. Why is this even your buisness anyway?\nIts my business because people have an obligation to protect the ones that can't protect themselves.\n \n \nI believe you mean latter. I disagree with you anyway.\nYou disagree with what? That substantive due process is XXXX? I seriously doubt you even understand the concept....which would be hard to prove because you would just go read wikipedia and post something from there instead of just admitting you don't really know what it means, where it came from, and why we have it today.\n \n \nTolerating pro-life laws forces people to suffer, which we DO KNOW FOR SURE is wrong. If an embryo has not intelligence, then it is not different than a plant. Heck, should we make any kind of killing, from taking a shower, to disinfecting a cut, to weeding your garden illegal because we want to error on the side of \"life\". Life is just a fancy word for \"force\".\nThey are not a human being though...if you do not have any dignity for a human being then just say so.\n \n\n Jails are for people who hurt others. Having an abortion is hurting no one. It may hurt something, but whatever it is it is not a person.\nI think its a person...therefore I think it is hurting someone and therefore believe you should disallow it. \n \n \nI never made any statements or drew any conclusions. It was a question.\nThen it was a terrible question which was a strawman in nature.\n \n \nHAHAHA! Are you kidding me? Read your own post before you critisize mine.\nSarcasm is not your strong suit I see.\n \n \nNo levels. Either you have it or you don't. You are in no way entitled to rights if you don't even know you exist. If you don't even have a, erm, \"soul\" as you speak. Why would you want to grant these rights if the embryo cannot enjoy it?\nok...what defines intelligence? Give me the standard.\n \n \n\n My final question remains. Why should you, a man, with no experience in baby making or any of that, and nothing to loose, make the decision for someone faced with a painful life and a hard choice? You are not hurt in any way, yet the women you are forcing are. Why do you care if a woman aborts an embryo? She has a hard life, let her make the decision. She knows her circumstances best. And no, don't use the murder analogy, because you are hurt if murder is legalized. Your life is in danger. However here, you have absolutely nothing to loose, and you are only hurting more people. Why do you persist? Because you have a different view than us of mere morals?\n The answer is obvious and pro-choicers never seem to read it. If you are killing another then there is no \"decision\" to be made. It is wrong and you shouldn't be allowed to do it. If you place no value on human life then you can obviously have a different view. Do you place value on human life?",

I don't think there are 2 people envolved. \n \n \n \n \nthird strawman.\n\n \n Nice way of weaseling out of a debate.\n \n \n \n \nyou play word games...grow up.\n\n \n I'm starting to see some victories on my part here...\n \n \n \n \nwow, if you are going to play word games by deciding how you want to use the word \"human\" everytime then just stop talking. Some of us are trying to present real arguments.\n\n \n On account of your last posts, you're obviously not one of them.\n \n \n \n \n \nso now you mean human as a piece of hair or what?\n\n \n Yes. And i mean person, or human being, as a living breathing human with feelings.\n \n \n \n \n \nI suppose you haven't taken biology yet.\n\n \n 2nd victory.\n \n \n \n \nYou mean they are hair! Oh my!\n\n \n Heh, interesting to see what a pro-lifer will sputter out when faced with losing a debate.\n \n \n \n \nwe all don't acknoledge that an embryo is far different from a human (or as you call it...hair). In fact, many don't dispute that the embryo is a human. Just look at the definition of the word.\n\n \n Well I don't. And embryo is as different as a plant is to an animal.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe only point to be made is that if you have dignity for a certain kind of being then abortion is wrong.\n\n \n Common baseless pro-life assumption.\n \n \n \n \n \nIf you have dignity for a certain kind of being but these beings have to meet certain random criteria then you could support abortion.\n\n \n No one supports abortion. You either support choice, or force. There is no \"pro-abortion\". Choice advocates have really no criteria. We just ask that they be human in order to have rights over a woman's body.\n \n \n \n \n \nI think the latter is stupid and inconsistent. If you accept some criteria for limitation you can't say that limtations are bad...like someone saying you can abort up to one year of age.\n\n \n What is this criteria you speak of? Its called common sense, not criteria. If it just sits there, and is no one. With no intelligence, it is no one. There is no one inside of it. Its pretty much empty. How is it entitled to rights over something that DOES live, breath, and have feelings for itself. At most its a parasitical infection or an embryo.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nReally, kills her son of 43 yrs old is fine with you?\n\n \n She has not giveth the son. He has giveth to himself. The mother giveth while in the womb.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhich is odd, you find a dog to be more important then some humans...interesting.\n\n \n Finally, I was waiting for a strawman on your part.\n \n \n \n \nAnd yes, some plants have rights. They are endangered plants.\n\n \n Well of course. They are vital to the rest of the ecosystem? What about weeds? You're being a hypocryte, you're saying that some plants have rights and some don't. Why didn't you say that weeds have rights. Why must plants meet a certain \"criteria\" to have rights or to just exist.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat do you mean by intelligence? Any? Whats the standard? You seem to have none.\n\n \n Steeve is getting more childish when he's faced with losing. This is getting quite fun.\n \n \n \n \n \nSo you don't support abortion past the first few months?\n\n \n Nope.\n \n \n \n \nits the same line of thinking if you are consistent.\n\n \n *starts snickering*\n \n \n \n \nand when does this begin? You have no standard!\n\n \n Slow down and reread my post.\n \n \n \n \n \nIts because you stink at arguments when you do this. When you use \"human\" its automatically taken as the noun...but when I use it, you resort to taking which ever tense you want to try and refute my argument. Its a cheap tactic and you need to learn to avoid it\n\n \n Have you heard of reverse psycology? If a pro-lifer can't refute my argument, and starts to tell me that I shouldn't use it, then its usually a damn good argument.\n \n \n \n \n \nWait, abortion is wrong? Why is it wrong?\n\n \n Because its killing. Killing of anything is wrong. Bug squishing is wrong, overfishing is wrong. But, it is OK if necessary, such as hunting, or fishing without overfishing.\n \n \n \n \n \nYet it is. Allowance is making a decision.\n\n \n W/E, your opinion.\n \n \n \nSo you need to know your rights in order to have intelligence. Wow, we can abort around 75% of the US.\n\n \n Circular logic, such as many of your arguments. I mean if you can't even enjoy your rights, or if your rights can't benifit you, then whats the point of having them.\n \n \n \n \n \nChanging tenses is not a legit point. It is a cheap tactic of debating.\n\n \n When did I change tenses? You still haven't refuted.\n \n \n \n \nThen start reading my argument the way they are presented and stop running away by changing tenses.\n\n \n Running away? Look who's talking Mr. \"you have no intelligence\".\n \n \n \n \n \nHuh?\n\n \n Were you literally born yesterday?\n \n \n \n \n \nYes I am.\n\n \n Ok, then, when you're waiting for a proposed bill to be signed, I'm going to be right behind you trying to pass that legislation forcing all pro-lifers into zoos for my and my fellow pro-choicer's entertainment.\n \n \n \n \n \nObviously you don't care. the document that founded and established this country shouldn't mean too much to you emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Wow, the cheap tactics never stop coming.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnd it is very clear you don't understand our law system.\n\n \n Jeez, its getting pretty clear to me. You're digging yourself in deeper with these cheap personal attacks. You'd look better if you just quit.\n \n \n \n \nHuh?\n\n \n Read my post again, instead of just saying \"huh\" whenever you don't understand something or you cannot refute my argument.\n \n \n \nyes it does (but oddly enough concentration camps for jews wouldn't \"affect\" me in the same way you mean as I am not jewish).\n\n \n Exactly.\n \n \n \nFurthermore, assuming concentration camps could come back with 50% +1 (in other words, minus a few amendments) then no I wouldn't support the law but yes I would support the way it was done. People seem to think that a democracy can only produce good results...works both ways.\n\n \n Wow, thats pretty sick.\n \n \n \n \nAnd? A law only effects the ones that do that activity.

You stated the Creator endowed you with this right...where and how?\n\n \n And? You haven't made it clear how my logic is flawed.\n \n \n \n \nIts my business because people have an obligation to protect the ones that can't protect themselves.\n\n \n And thats the major flaw of the pro-life arguments. \"It's my job to force my opinion on other people, its my obligation\".\n \n \n \n \nYou disagree with what? That substantive due process is XXXX?\n\n \n Substantive due process is what I believe in.\n \n \n \nThe answer is obvious and pro-choicers never seem to read it. If you are killing another then there is no \"decision\" to be made. It is wrong and you shouldn't be allowed to do it. If you place no value on human life then you can obviously have a different view. Do you place value on human life?\n\n \n Of course I do. But an embryo is not a human life form deserving of rights. Skin cells arent, kidneys arent, embryo's arent. Skin cells shouldn't be equated to human beings. It just takes common sense, pro-lifers just seem to not understand that.",

   "There are trillions upon trillions of life forms in your body. Should attempted suicide be 200 trillion counts of murder?\n \n\n \n Is this a joke? Bacteria in my stomach is not another person. I don't understand why you can't seem to grasp this simple concept.\n \n \nI understand it. But if the latter life possesses no intelligence, then what is the point of giving it power over its host's body.\n\n \n So you measure life based on the level of intelligence possessed? In that case, you must support executing mentally handicapped children. In fact, why don't we just set an IQ limit, like 100, and kill everybody who has an IQ lower than that?\n \n \nYou anthropomorphize the embryo. In reality, you want to force any women to carry out an unplanned pregnancy. You do not know her circumstances. You have not experienced having a baby, getting raped, or raising children. Who are you to have so much power to force all women to have babys?\n\n \n This has been pointed out many times before, but I guess I will have to do it again. You do not have to experience something in order to know it is wrong. Most people know that murder is wrong, yet they haven't murdered anybody. By your logic, only murderers would be qualified to make a moral judgment regarding murder. Also, I wouldn't force a woman who was raped to have the baby. I am talking about people who don't want to deal with the consequences of the activity in which they choose to engage. \n \n \nYou can wiggle and squirm, and manipulate words all you want, but that does not change the facts. Life without intelligence is not way entitled to power over life with intelligence, period. Its hard to believe what some of you lifers want. We think abortion is horrible too, but we wish to stay out of the issue, as it is a mothers and a mothers choice only. Notice that the majority of women are pro-choice, and men pro-life? That should tell you something. No one should be forced to that extent by people who aren't benifiting from it and don't even understand it.\n\n \n How am I manipulating words? Where are the statistics saying a majority of women are pro-choice and a majority of men are pro-life? Frankly, if those stats are true, it proves my point. Think about it - you said yourself the men aren't benefitting from it. So who usually makes better decisions about something - people who have nothing to gain (men, according to you) or people who are emotionally involved (women)? You can minimize an embryo as much as you want, but the fact is it will, if left undisturbed, grow into a person. Stopping this process from occuring is ending that person's life, period, and is no different than shooting a newborn. Just because the person is less developed or, as you say, unintelligent, it doesn't mean it is okay to discard.\n \n \nMight I add that one of my friend's mother was on the pill when she had her sister? What do you say to people like that? \"Sorry, were going to have to force you to carry out your pregnancy. Those men over there made the decision.\" Thats just wrong.\n\n \n But it's right to end that person's life? When you engage in an activity that results in the creation of a new life, you better be prepared to deal with it. The answer isn't a doctor with a vacuum.",

Abortion is different, and thats a moot point anyway. Murder endangers your life, while abortion does not affect you at all. You don't gain or loose if any legislation is passed. You just sit back and try to make decisions for others, even though you do not know their circumstances. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlso, I wouldn't force a woman who was raped to have the baby. I am talking about people who don't want to deal with the consequences of the activity in which they choose to engage.\n\n \n Well, I'm glad you're not a complete psycopath, but sex is a normal activity in a healthy relationship. You have to draw a line somewhere. But leaving your house, is it your fault if you get hit by a buss and die? If you decide to take a walk and you're mugged and murdered, is it all your fault for taking a walk?

You can minimize an embryo as much as you want, but the fact is it will, if left undisturbed, grow into a person.

Because every second you are killing a person by not having as much sex as you can.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nperiod, and is no different than shooting a newborn.\n\n \n So? Thats not my belief. An embryo can be viewed as a parasitical infection, and a woman has every right to remove any parasite or cancer from her body regardless of your opinions. No matter how much you manipulate words, it wont change any facts. An embryo fits the defonition of an organ and a parasite.\n \n \n \n \n \n [/quote]Just because the person is less developed or, as you say, unintelligent, it doesn't mean it is okay to discard.[/quote]\n \n If this has huge benifits for society and women, and if it has no intelligence, and is something composed of cells with no purpose, living completely off of a host's resources and food, then yes, it is OK.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBut it's right to end that person's life? When you engage in an activity that results in the creation of a new life, you better be prepared to deal with it.

Or, if they're poor single, have 4 children, and are 14 years old. The answer should be to try to reduce abortions to very little. And yes, It can be done.

I mean consciousness as thinking, awareness, self awareness. A line has to be drawn somewhere. We cannot give plants excessive rights and bar gardeners from weeding their gardens. We cannot make trimming hedges illegal. You can call it \"criteria\" all you want, but it really takes common sense.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurther, why is consciousness sufficient for one to have rights (why isn't more required)?\n\n \n Because, consciousness is one of the basic fundamentals of human lives. It cannot be a human being if it has no brain, cannot think, has no awareness of anything, and is pretty much as dead as a doorknob. We cannot equate human beings to such. But when it becomes self-conscious and aware, even if its only slight, it deserves rights, because it can enjoy those rights.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI do not think that it is a reasonable conclusion to go from the fact that \"X does not posses consciousness\" to the claim that \"Therefore, X does not deserve (or have) rights.\" That is not as self-evident as you have presented it here.\n\n \n First of all, why are you using X?
