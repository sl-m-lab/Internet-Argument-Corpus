   "I know many folks who run small banks in small towns and they are wondering why they are paying 10 times as much for insurance they can't receive and frankly don't need. If MomPop Bank makes a bad move they are gone for good and since they probably live in the town the chances of the towns people tearing apart their house is pretty high. That is more than enough incentive to make smart decisions. Some MomPop banks tried to do the risky thing and they went under but that didn't cause our economy to tank overnight. \n \n In short, saving a national bank or nationalizing a national bank to save it is not a viable solution for a host of reasons.\n\n \n When all this mess started I checked to make sure the little home town bank I use to hold my cash was secure and not part of the mess. The guy told me \"we never engage in anything risky like that on the grounds that if we screw up our customers accounts, one of them is likely to execute us on our front lawns\". Nothing like a little personal accountability to encourage good behavior. \n \n \n \n \nI can barely count on my bank to handle a deposit correctly. No, the last line of defense is paperwork. If the government wants to seize my accounts they have to fill out a form and tell the judge to sign it and approve it and make up a reason. That could take some government assistant a solid day to complete. If you are the bank you could do it to an infinite amount of a accounts within an hour. So one at a time in a day vs many at once in an hour. That's a win!\n\n \n You SERIOUSLY underestimate the governments efficiency when it comes to stealing from the taxpayers. Why do a different order for each account holder? That can just do one for the whole bank...or all banks. And that is if they dont just use an obviously illegal executive order to do it like Bush did with his surveillance plan. After all, the presidents power to seize all private assets because he wants to is laid out right there in the constitution right between his power to hold people indefinitely without charges and your right to a federally funded abortion. A lot of people mistakenly believe it is part of the \"F you, we can do it because we said so\" power of congress, but it is actually at the END, as part of the third amendment, right after the part of the second amendment that requires strict control over guns that might be either scary looking, or could be used to hurt people. \n \n\n In most states they can't seize your car for doing nothing...which reminds me I owe $35 to Maryland for a parking ticket.\n\n \n \n Actually that is federal law (asset forfeiture), so any state CAN do it. Most just dont have the guts.",

All I do is look at government accounts and collection efforts are not a strong suit. With our government bank example, it would get down but it would take 10 people to do it which takes time. I guess my point is my line of defense is government inefficiency. If they improve that (which taking over the banks would oddly enough be one) than that is it.",
