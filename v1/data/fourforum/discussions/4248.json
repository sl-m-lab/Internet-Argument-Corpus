   "Well, that's your own strong bias speaking. Many of the courts and scholars have disagreed with you.\n\n \n Maybe you could point us towards some that have actually made a compelling argument for the collective rights theory. You have tried before, and always failed miserably. Do you have some new sources, or just the same old same old....finkleman rambling on about piracy and activist jusdges who have ruled for the collective rights interpetation but never supplied any legal rational for their argument. \n \n Maybe you should take a look at the DOJ's stance on the issue. The one good thing the bush Administration has done has been to have the DOJ research and prepare a compelling brief regarding the collective rights/individual rights interpetation. Thus far, nobody has managed to sucessfully challenge it. The beauty of their interpetation is that traditionally, it will stand as far as the DOJ is concerned until it can be discredited. \n \n Simple fact of the matter.........collective rights does not hold up to scrutiny. There is no historic evidence suggesting the collective rights interpetation is correct, there is really no legal evidence that the collective rights interpetation is correct. \n \n You are a true beliver in a faulty system of beliefs. You have posted so much \"proof\" here that I cannot even count the numebr of times you have been smacked down. Are you ever going to just give it up and accept the fact that you are wrong? that things are not as you wissh them to be? Until you do, you will never reach your goal, because as the law stands, you can only go so far with gun control before it crosses the line that gun owners have effectively drawn in the sand. \n \n The supreme court has done a pretty good job of staying out of the gun control controversy. It seems to be reaching the point where they no longer can. There is a gun case right now waiting on the courts ruling. It is not a second ammendment case, but it is certainly an important gun case. 10 years ago, they would not even have considered hearing it. Today they really have no choice.\n \n You anti gun folks need to get to work on that constitutional ammendment rather than running around telling the same old \"collective right\" lie. Before long, it looks like there are going to be new machine guns on the street, in civilian hands, as our founding fathers intended. You folks are wasting your time ont he old arguments. Latest polls show that less than 12% of Americans buy the \"collective rights\" theory. 10 years ago the number was close to 50%. \n \n Nobody is buying your lies anymore. Even the democratic party is backing off of gun issues, since they now blame not only Al Gores loss in the presidential campaign, but the loss of the senate and house, largely to their canidates views on gun control.\n \n You might get lucky and have anotehr wave of school shootings. Dead kids are always good for your cause. Doesn't it bother you that you have alinged yourself with a cause that benifits fromt the death of shildren at the hands of lunatics?",

According to the collective rights theory, we have no individual right ot keep and bear arms, we have a \"collective\" right, that is, the states individually have a right to a militia, but the individual has no right to own weapons. \n \n They have pushed this for years, despite the fact that those who wrote the bill of rights specifically stated, to a man, on more than one occasion, that the second ammendment did indeed convey an original right, and one that was uninfringable. The collective rights theory enjoyed some popularity for a while, but has largely burned out. The only scholar left who regularly and vocally supports it is Paul Finkleman (if you even want to call him a scholar). In the past, there have been some federal court decisions that relied on the collective rights interpetation. None of these decisions have ever given any legal basis for the interpetation. Also, Perhaps:\n \n \n Second Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n \n Can we look at the sentence gramatically? That would probably tell easily what they meant.\n \n The \"being necessary to the defense of the security of the free state, [and] the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" seems like an extra piece of information to be more specific.\n \n To me, it seems like it's saying a well regulated miliita shall not be infringed, but this \"militia\" is further explained in the two comma separated sentences to make it clear.\n\n \n \n Actually, a grammatical analysis of the second ammendment yields the exact opposite of what you have suggested here. The 2 clause construction of the second ammendment was not unusual at the time, nor is it really unusual in certian quarters today (mostly technical writing). Teh frist clause is called the justification clause. The second is the actionable clause. The justification caluse provides (as the name implies) a possible justification for the actionable clause, but the actionable clause is in no way limited by the justification clause. Eugene Volokh explains it fairly well. You can read a brief analysis by him at http://www1.law.ucla.edu/~volokh/common.htm . Eugene is a pretty interesting guy, his work bears study. He graduated from law school with a full beliefe that the collective rights theory was correct. It is what he was taght in law school, it is what his text books say (this is the dnager of putting too much faith in text books that do not provide data or expalin thier conclusions.). On researching the collective rights theory for a lecture he was to give (he is a law professor), he found that there was really no legal or historical basis for viewing the second ammendment as anything BUT an individual right. \n \n The courts in US Vs emerson touched on the language of the second ammendment. Here is their statement on the subject:\n \n \n\"Collective rights theorists argue that addition of the subordinate clause qualifies the rest of the amendment by placing a limitation on the people's right to bear arms. However, if the amendment truly meant what collective rights advocates propose, then the text would read \"[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the States to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" However, that is not what the framers of the amendment drafted. The plain language of the amendment, without attenuate inferences therefrom, shows that the function of the subordinate clause was not to qualify the right, but instead to show why it must be protected. The right exists independent of the existence of the militia. If this right were not protected, the existence of the militia, and consequently the security of the state, would be jeopardized.\" (U.S. v. Emerson, 46 F.Supp.2d 598 (N.D.Tex. 1999)) \n \n \n There are several old threads here regarding the collective rights interpetation, and more than one which discusses the language of the second ammendment if you are interested. VOR will likely come back with a quote from a couple of historians who have done their own analysis of the langauge of the second ammendment. If/when she does, print it and take it to an english professor. I did. I took it to an english professor at our local college who said that not only is the assesment incorrect, it does not even make sense. She called it \"gobblygook\", and she is about as anti gun as you can get.\n \n The problem from teh anti gun standpoint is that to recognise the second ammendment as an individual right severely limits the amount of gun control that we can have. \n \n The supreme court has already ruled on more than one occasion that you cannot limit a reight as a pre-emptive measuyre to avoid criminal behavior (i.e while it may be illegal to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater, you cannot sew somebodies mouth shut to prevent it). Background checks are, under the individual right theory, undoubtedly illegal since the courts have alredy ruled that you cannot require a permit for the exercise of a right (though some places have enacted laws that require a permit for protests, the permit is for the use fo public property, not actually to protest, which you are welcome to do on private propert with the consent of the owner at any time. Additionally, even protest permit laws have almost all been thrown out by the courts). The NFA would absolutly be illegal under the individual rights interpetation, since the supreme court has also ruled that you cannot tax a right (poll taxes).\n \n Oddly enough, registration would almost certainly NOT be illegal, so long as there were no pre-qualifying conditions and no fee involved for the gun pwner (which would be along the same lines as a tax). You could not require a background check with registration, since even with background checks, the government essentially does the check and essentially issues a verbal permit for you to purchase the weapon through your retailer (and permits for a right are illegal).",

   "Alright, here is my $.02 worth on how to interpret the \"militia\" clause of the Second Amendment:\n \n \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" 2nd. Amendment. \n \n In short, I believe that our founding fathers feared a standing professional army, and this clause in the Amendment is a preamble asserting the belief that a standing professional army should be avoided as dangerous to individual liberty. Here is why I think this way:\n \n I believe we must first remember that our founders had witnessed their own government's use of a professional army to oppress them. T.J. wrote for them all when he drafted the Continental Congress' justification for a call to arms to fight their oppressors:\n \n \"We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\"  \n Quote from the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, July 6, 1775. taken from Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990) beginning at p. 295.\n \n These are obviously strong words which reflect the severity of the crisis our founders found themselves in. I'll skip the war because we all know who won. But, having survived that trial of force with their own government's professional army, does anyone seriously suggest that our founders did not fear a repeat of the same if a standing army were raised in America's future? I believe they carried a healthy fear of a standing army with them when they sat down to frame their new governments, and you can see ample evidence of it in the various state constitutions. Here are just a few examples:\n \n \"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"  From the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, June 6, 1776.\n \n \"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"  From the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, August 16, 1776.\n \n \"That a well regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government. That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought to be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.\"  From the Constitution of the state of Delaware, September 11, 1776.\n \n \"That the people have a right to keep and bear arms, that a well regulated militia, including the body of the people capable of bearing arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state.\"  From the Constitution of the state of New York (sorry, the year escapes me, but I know it predated the BoR)\n \n [Incidentally, here lies a tremendous problem for the collective right theory. If the language of the Second Amendment was merely designed to protect the \"right\" of the states to equip a state militia free from federal governmental interference, then why were these provisions written into the various state constitutions? At the time the state constitutions were drafted and ratified the only parties to these social compacts were the state and its citizens. These provisions clearly recognize an individual liberty interest which needed protection from tyrannical state governmental encroachment. If our founding fathers felt that they needed the individual right to protect them from their state governments, then why wouldn't they want they want the same protection from the new federal government's ability to abuse its power?] \n \n In any event I believe it is easy to see that this is where the language \"well regulated militia\" comes from. But what was the militia of the times? How were they armed?\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\"  U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n Why then a militia composed of men bearing private arms? I believe the system was designed to reduce, as much as possible, the need to maintain the much feared professional army. Additionally, our founders felt that maintaining these arms in private hands deterred tyranny. See, for example, the following:\n \n \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights.\"  Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840). Significant because it was cited with approval by SCOTUS in U.S. v. Miller, Miller at p. 178. (and people still think Miller was a \"collective\" right opinion)\n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\"  John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped. . . .This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if any inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens.\"  Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers #29, reprinted at page 185 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter.\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\"  Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n \"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\"  Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n Now I think we come to the reason for inclusion of the Second Amendment in the BoR. The individual citizen's RKBA was widely accepted as necessary to prevent the rise of domestic tyranny at the state level. But the newly proposed federal constitution did not prohibit a future tyrannical federal government from totally disarming the individual citizen's ability to \"appear bearing arms supplied by themselves\" as a state militia to resist federal oppression. Remember Patrick Henry's complaint of a federal constitution without a BoR:\n \n \"My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants....\"\n \"The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.\"  Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n So then, when we finally got our BoR, who did James Madison use to support his push for ratification? His good friend and fellow federalist, Tench Coxe. Coxe had already written an eloquent response to the anti-federalist's fears of the federal government's ability to neuter the state militias by disarming the people:\n \n \"My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.\"  Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n To assist his friend's push for adoption of the BoR, Coxe wrote a treatise entitled Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. In his Remarks, Coxe described the Second Amendment as follows:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\"  Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n Coxe forwarded his Remarks to Madison, who was at the time campaigning in New York for adoption of his BoR. Madison wrote him back and informed him that his Remarks were being published in the local papers, and he thanked Coxe by noting that his proposed amendments were \"therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen.\"  James Madison, 12 Madison Papers, p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789]. \n \n Coxe wasn't the only founding father who believed that the proposed Second Amendment recognized an individual RKBA. Here are a few more examples:\n \n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.\"  Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .\"  William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789] (apparently Grayson felt that his friend Patrick Henry needed the assurance of his opinion that the proposed BoR preserved individual liberty).\n \n Therefore, in light of what I suggest is an accurate rendition of \"the spirit of the debates,\" I believe that the phrase \"a well regulated militia being necessary to the SECURITY of a FREE state\" is a preamble which expresses a universally accepted principle that the best way to provide for the security of a FREE state (ie. A state in which the individual citizen need not fear the tyrannical ambitions of his elected leaders) is by the employment of a well-regulated militia and the avoidance, as far as practical, of a long service professional standing army. In my opinion this assertion of a cornerstone of free government does not act to restrict the individual RKBA that is asserted in the phrase which follows in the amendment. To summarize the principle behind the militia preamble another way:\n \n \"Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.\"  M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n In addition to this, I believe that there are other clues to this individual right intention for the amendment. For example, when Madison drafted the BoR he knew that the Constitution contained, in Article I sec. 8, a provision for state authority over their militias (the authority to appoint militia officers). If Madison believed the 2nd. Amendment should merely recognize a collective \"state\" authority to arm their militia members free from federal interference, then he could have easily saved us much confusion by placing the amendment alongside the other recognition of state militia authority. Instead, he chose to place the right within a body of individual liberties.\n \n He also chose to use the word \"people.\" The collective right theory would edit this specific term to have the amendment read \"the right of the states.\" But Madison knew there was a distinct difference between the \"states\" and the \"people\" (see the 10th. Amendment, for example). If he wanted to signify a power of the states, then I believe he would never have used the word \"people.\" \n \n Finally, I don't believe Madison can be blamed with a typographical error, because he used the distinct phrase \"right of the people\" more than once, and each time it was intended to recognize an individual liberty interest. The First Amendment reads the \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble....\" The Second Amendment reads \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms....\" The Fourth Amendment reads \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures....\"  Nicholas Johnson noted this posed a difficult problem for the collective right theory; namely, that it requires an Orwellian exercise in double-think to conclude that:\n \n \"[T]he term \"the People\" was intended to protect the rights of private individuals to assemble peaceably and petition the government in the First Amendment, was somehow transformed in the Second into a right of states, and then miraculously was returned to a right of private individuals to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects in the Fourth Amendment.\" Nicholas J. Johnson, Shots Across No Man's Land: A Response to Handgun Control, Inc.'s, Richard Aborn, 22 Fordham Urb. L.J. 448 (1995).\n \n I myself am not capable of such blind mental gymnastics. Therefore, I believe that the Second Amendment was drafted to recognize an individual citizen's RKBA. The DOES NOT mean that the right must be absolute. It must of necessity be subject to some rational limitation, but that is another issue for another day. In the meantime, I reject the collective right theory for what I believe it to be: a fraudulent twisting of the plain language of an individual right for the purpose of justifying a policy of individual disarmament. \n \n --------------------------------------------\n \"On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.\"  Thomas Jefferson, The Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].",

It's not a \"liberal\"\n book either.\n\n \n Gun control or the abolition of our second ammendment rights is not just a liberal issue. If you look at who votes in favor of gun control bills, even rediculous ones, plenty of \"conservatives\" vote for them. Our constitution was written by a bunch of folks who had just thrown off the yoke of a tyrannical government. They were specifically writing a documant meant to ensure that the ultimate power in the united states would lie with the people, not the politicians or the government. Many constitutional commentators of the day said that the BoR, and specifically the second ammendment insured that US politicians would always lead with a gun to their head. \n \n Bad news, politicians don't like to lead, they like to rule, and they certianly don't like to do it with a gun to their head. Over the years, as our political system has effectively become a 2 party system, neither side really has to make much of a pretense regarding protecting your rights, because the other guy is juts as bad. \n \n \nIt's very odd that they all mention that there are at least 2 left, and no one wants to touch the firearms issue. Hmm. Oh well.\n \n I checked out the site here \n \n http://www.gunsite.com/home.htm\n \n Is that it?\n\n \n Nope, www.guncite.com (I put a comma instead of a period in the original link, sorry). The specific portion that deals with supreme court cases is located at http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndsup.html \n \n \n \n1. U.S. v. Cruikshank involved members of the Ku Klux Klan depriving black victims of their basic rights such as freedom of assembly and to bear arms. The court decided that neither the First nor Second Amendments applied to the states, but were limitations on Congress. Thus the federal government had no power to correct these violations, rather the citizens had to rely on the police power of the states for their protection from private individuals.\n\n \n This is mostly correct, except that according to the decision, the states are OBLIGATED to protect these rights. Effectively the ruling was that you cannot sue another person in federal court for depriving you of your rights. You can, however, sue your state for violating these rights, or for failing to protect them (which happened more than once during the civil rights movement). The basis is the fact that these are considered, by the government of the united states as laid forth on our consitution, natural rights. They are not granted by the federal government, and they are not granted by our state governments. They did not say that the federal government had no power to correct the violations, they said the federal government had no power to correct these violations between individuals. \n \n You must remember that in 1876, the federal government had no real police type force of its own. Law enforcement was left almost entirely to the state. This was later partially overturned in that during the 50's and 60's the supreme court ruled that if an individual could not get justince in regards to civil rights violations from the state, they could petition the federal government for relief.\n \n \n2. Presser v. Illinois ruled that the states had the right to strictly regulate private military groups and associations. It also reaffirmed the Cruikshank decision that the Second Amendment acts as a limitation upon the federal government and not the states.\n\n \n This was an interesting one because it seperated militia from the right to bear arms, including specifically stating that a state cannot deprive a person of that right. Their logic is a little different in this, in that they claim that to do so would deprive the federal government of their militia. \n \n \n3. Miller v. Texas (1894): the court wouldn't even consider whether Miller's rights had been violated under the Fourteenth Amendment because he had not filed such a claim in his original trial.\n\n \n Yep, thats about it. Miller needed a better attorney :) \n \n \n4. U.S. v. Miller (1939): Frank Layton and Jack Miller were charged with violating the 1934 National Firearms Act, which regulated and taxed the transfer of certain types of firearms, and required the registration of such arms. The Miller court held the following:\n \n 1) The National Firearms Act was not an unconstitutional usurpation of police power reserved to the states.\n\n \n The supreme court ruled that the NFA was not an usurpation of state polic power, however.....\n \n The Supreme court did not rule on whether the NFA was consitutional or not. Nowhere in the miller proceeding does it make any judgement regarding the constitutionalilty of the NFA (though we now know that, if the second ammendment is indeed an individual right, the NFA is void, since it is an act which specificallty taxes the ownership of certain types of weapons, and if posession of those weapons is a right, they cannot be taxes). What the miller court decided was that the weapon in question, a sawed off shotgun, must be shown to be militarily useful to be protected by the second ammendment. \n \n The question was wider in scope than merely \"does the NFA usurp the states police power\". The real question was whether or not it violated the second ammendment. Here is the courts ruling on this:\n \n \n \n\"In the absence of evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length,' which is the subject of regulation and taxation by the National Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, it cannot be said the the Second Amendment to the Federal Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument, or that the statute violates such constitutional provision.\"\n\n \n Keep in mind that miller was not there, he had jumped bail by this time. We can only speculate that, had he been there, things likely would have gone differently since he was a WWI vet, and would have been well familiar with the use fo short barreled and sawed off shotguns in trench warfare (shotguns sawed off to pistol size were common). \n \n In reality, the paragraph above should have been the end of the controversy, but it was not. The Miller case is probably one of the most mis-cited (usually intentionally) rulings the supreme court has ever turned out, and it is largely by mis-citing the miller case that the collective rights folks back up their rediculous argument.\n \n There is an interesting read abuot just this at http://www.guncite.com/journals/dencite.html",

So if the power lies with the people then the people should be able to have gun control if they want it. The people favor gun control more than Congress. Your statements about the people who wrote the Constitution are a gross oversimplification of US history. \n \n Perhaps the Secret Service should be eliminated so that we can be more sure that our presidents are leading with a gun to their heads. \n \n\n Bad news, politicians don't like to lead, they like to rule, and they certianly don't like to do it with a gun to their head.

I don't hear a lot of people saying in reference to these assassinations- \"Oh that's an example of how politicians lead with a gun to their head.\" \n \n \n\n This is mostly correct, except that according to the decision, the states are OBLIGATED to protect these rights.

The Supreme Court has ruled that some other portions of the Bill of Rights do apply to the states.\n \n \n\n Actually, a grammatical analysis of the second ammendment yields the exact opposite of what you have suggested here. The 2 clause construction of the second ammendment was not unusual at the time, nor is it really unusual in certian quarters today (mostly technical writing). Teh frist clause is called the justification clause. The second is the actionable clause. The justification caluse provides (as the name implies) a possible justification for the actionable clause, but the actionable clause is in no way limited by the justification clause. Eugene Volokh explains it fairly well. You can read a brief analysis by him at http://www1.law.ucla.edu/~volokh/common.htm . Eugene is a pretty interesting guy, his work bears study. He graduated from law school with a full beliefe that the collective rights theory was correct. It is what he was taght in law school, it is what his text books say (this is the dnager of putting too much faith in text books that do not provide data or expalin thier conclusions.). On researching the collective rights theory for a lecture he was to give (he is a law professor), he found that there was really no legal or historical basis for viewing the second ammendment as anything BUT an individual right. \n \n The courts in US Vs emerson touched on the language of the second ammendment. Here is their statement on the subject:\n \n \n \n There are several old threads here regarding the collective rights interpetation, and more than one which discusses the language of the second ammendment if you are interested. VOR will likely come back with a quote from a couple of historians who have done their own analysis of the langauge of the second ammendment. If/when she does, print it and take it to an english professor. I did. I took it to an english professor at our local college who said that not only is the assesment incorrect, it does not even make sense. She called it \"gobblygook\", and she is about as anti gun as you can get.\n\n Since you believe so much in what English professors say about the second amendment, you might want to consider this statement from an English professor-\n \"The Second Amendment does guarantee the personal right to kill. It is about dominion -- not hunting, not protection.\" \n http://archive.harktheherald.com/archive_detail.php?archiveFile=./pubfiles/prv/archive/2002/November/08/Commentary/45422.xml&start=0&numPer=20&keyword=second+amendment+in+action+sniper&sectionSearch=&begindate=1%2F1%2F1997&enddate=2%2F10%2F2005&authorSearch=&IncludeStories=1&pubsection=&page=&IncludePages=1&IncludeImages=1&mode=allwords&archive_pubname=The+Daily+Herald%0A%09%09%09\n \n But I don't think that an analysis of the of the language of the second amendment without history can yield a true understanding of the second amendment. \n \n \n \n\n The supreme court has already ruled on more than one occasion that you cannot limit a reight as a pre-emptive measuyre to avoid criminal behavior (i.e while it may be illegal to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater, you cannot sew somebodies mouth shut to prevent it).\n\n So is it okay if guns are outlawed as long as your hands aren't tied together to prevent you from firing a gun?\n \n \n\n Background checks are, under the individual right theory, undoubtedly illegal since the courts have alredy ruled that you cannot require a permit for the exercise of a right (though some places have enacted laws that require a permit for protests, the permit is for the use fo public property, not actually to protest, which you are welcome to do on private propert with the consent of the owner at any time. Additionally, even protest permit laws have almost all been thrown out by the courts). The NFA would absolutly be illegal under the individual rights interpetation, since the supreme court has also ruled that you cannot tax a right (poll taxes).\n \n\n An extreme position.

The people favor gun control more than Congress. Your statements about the people who wrote the Constitution are a gross oversimplification of US history. \n\n \n No, because that is not how our system works. The genius of the constitution was that it was the first document of its kind to include, right there in the text of the dovcument, provisions for changing it. Incorporated into the system for changin it is provisions that ensure that we do not easily discard rights today that we may need tomorrow. A simple majority of votes is not enough to do it.\n \n Besides, I think you will find that pro gun control sentiment is downa across the boaerd. In the latest ABC poll, less than 8% of Americans believed gun registration led to reduced crime, and less than 5% believed that background checks had any influence on crime. The problem the anti gunners face is obvious.......you cannot lie to all the people all the time. eventually they DO realise that there are no facts that back up your position.\n \n \n \nThat brings to mind the shooting deaths of John F.

I don't hear a lot of people saying in reference to these assassinations- \"Oh that's an example of how politicians lead with a gun to their head.\" \n \n \n Hopefully it also brings to mind the countless tyrannical regimes that have existed throughout history that have disarmed their public.

The Supreme Court has ruled that some other portions of the Bill of Rights do apply to the states.\n\n \n the first and second ammendments are different form the others. They are natural rights. It also says the states are obligated to protect those rights, as well as specifically stating that the states may not deprive people of their right to bear arms. We have been over this before here, and you were involved. You need to quit ignoring things you don't like. No matter how tight you close your eyes, the booger man will still get you. \n \n \n \n \nSince you believe so much in what English professors say about the second amendment, you might want to consider this statement from an English professor-\n \"The Second Amendment does guarantee the personal right to kill.

Here is the full paragraph you pulled your little snippet out of:\n \n \nSome say it is hypocrisy for governments to forbid us from killing when governments can execute. On the contrary: The Second Amendment does guarantee the personal right to kill. It is about dominion -- not hunting, not protection. If the snipers do convince a jury they are justified, they could be released.\n\n \n \n It is about capitol punishment, not whether the second ammendment is an individual or a collective right, and certainly not a grammatical analysis of the secodn ammendment. It says that the issue of capitol punishment is one of dominion, and that the second ammendment has nothing to do with it. \n \n I enjopy debating you sometimes, but the academic dishonesty you constantly display borders on rediculaous. Can't you people just debate honestly as opposed to constantly lying to support your case? \n \n \n \nBut I don't think that an analysis of the of the language of the second amendment without history can yield a true understanding of the second amendment. \n \n \n If youa re talking about a grammatical analysis, nothing has really changed but the definition of militia, and the fact that the 2 clause construction of the ammendment has gone out of style. If you are talking historical analyisis of original intent.......well, that is quite clear, and you don't have a pot to **** in or a window to throw it out on that one, and we both know it. \n \n \n \nAn extreme position. The Supreme Court has found no conflict between the background check of the Brady Bill and the second amendment.\n\n \n Since the supreme court has never examined the Brady Bill inregards to asecond ammendment challenge, the fact that they have not found a conflict is not surprising.\n \n 11 times the supreme court has ruled that you cannot require a permit or charge a tax on a right. There is absolutly no question of this. It is crystal clear and non-debatable. If the second ammendment is indeed an indivdual right, and was legally accepted as such, the brady bill owuld be unconstitutional, as would the NFA (which charges a tax on machine guns and destructive devices). There is absolulty no question of this.\n \n In Printz v. United States, the court noted (clarence thomas writing):\n \n \nThe Second Amendment similarly appears to contain an express limitation on the Government's authority. That Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" This Court has not had recent occasion to consider the nature of the substantive right safeguarded by the Second Amendment.[Footnote 1] If, however, the Second Amendment is read to confer a personal right to \"keep and bear arms,\" a colorable argument exists that the Federal Government's regulatory scheme, at least as it pertains to the purely intrastate sale or possession of firearms, runs afoul of that Amendment's protections.[Footnote 2] As the parties did not raise this argument, however, we need not consider it here. Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correct when he wrote that the right to bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00a7 1890, p. 746 (1833). In the meantime, I join the Court's opinion striking down the challenged provisions of the Brady Act as inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment.\n\n \n and:\n \n \n[Footnote 2] Marshaling an impressive array of historical evidence, a growing body of scholarly commentary indicates that the \"right to keep and bear arms\" is, as the Amendment's text suggests, a personal right. See, e.g., J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 162 (1994); S. Halbrook, That Every Man Be Armed, The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (1984); Van Alstyne, The Second Amendment and the Personal Right to Arms, 43 Duke L. J. 1236 (1994); Amar, The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 1193 (1992); Cottrol & Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309 (1991); Levinson, The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 637 (1989); Kates, Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204 (1983). Other scholars, however, argue that the Second Amendment does not secure a personal right to keep or to bear arms. See, e.g., Bogus, Race, Riots, and Guns, 66 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1365 (1993); Williams, Civic Republicanism and the Citizen Militia: The Terrifying Second Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 551 (1991); Brown, Guns, Cowboys, Philadelphia Mayors, and Civic Republicanism: On Sanford Levinson's The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 661 (1989); Cress, An Armed Community: The Origins and Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms, 71 J. Am. Hist. 22 (1984). Although somewhat overlooked in our jurisprudence, the Amendment has certainly engendered considerable academic, as well as public, debate.\"\n\n \n That is the CURRENT supreme court, and seems to suggest rather heavily that whether the brady bill is constitutional or not at the very least deserves consideration. Odds are we will never see it, though. It will likely never hit the supreme court for the simple fact that people are not generally porsecuted under the Brady bill. Retailers who have been caught selling guns without doing checks are not prosecuted, and criminals who have attempteds to purchase guns also are not (since there have only been a few criminals stopped by the brady background check, though, this doesn't say much). In fact, case law has already been established that implies that you CANNOT prosecute a felon for failure to register a gun, because in doing so they would be incriminating themselves. It would stand to reason that prosecuting them for information provided on the Brady background check forms would be the same.\n \n Personally, I would like to see the Brady bill in the supreme court. It is worthless legislative trash that nobody can show has had any effect on criminal use of firearms at all, and yet we spend millions per year on it. Why? So delusional people like yourself can feel like they have accomplished something?",

   "Presser v. Illinois did indeed hold that the 2nd. Amendment provided NO protection from state action to infringe upon the individual citezen's RKBA. This is how the Court addressed the reach of the BoR:\n \n \"[A] conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the National Government, and not upon that of the States.\"  116 U.S. 252, 265 (1886).\n \n The same doctrine was also used to hold that the 2nd. Amendment did not protect a black man's RKBA from infringement by a Klansmen [again, pre-14th. Amendment] in United States v. Cruishank [note how SCOTUS defines the right here, though]:\n \n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this. . .means no more than it shall not be infringed by Congress.\"\n \n To me these decisions were nothing more that a repeat of the doctrine first announced in 1833 by Chief Justice John Marshall (in Barron v. Baltimore) that the BoR was enacted solely as a limitation upon the power of the federal government. \n \n The 14th. Amendment changed all of this, however. It was enacted as a specific response to the racist de facto slavery laws southern states enacted after the war. I believe that its purpose was to \"totally incorporate\" the first 8 amendments of the BoR as limitations on the power of the states to deal with their citizens, whether black or white. \n \n TO MY KNOWLEDGE, SCOTUS HAS NEVER DECIDED WHETHER THE 14TH. AMENDMENT DOES OR DOES NOT INCORPORATE THE 2ND. AMENDMENT AGAINST THE SATES. This is due primarily to SCOTUS' use of an ill-advised doctrine of \"selective incorporation.\"--- a case-by-case analysis of each right brought before it, where SCOTUS has incorporated some rights (or even portions thereof) and rejected incorporating others. It is a slippery doctrine for me to follow, and in my attempts to understand the proper scope or application of this doctrine I have felt like a blind man, in a dark room, trying to catch a black cat, that isn't there. The best I can say is the doctrine allows each justice the unfettered ability to use his or her own private prejudices to decide whether a particular right in the BoR is \"worthy\" of incorporation against state infringement:\n \n \"A collection of the catchwords and catch phrases invoked by judges who would strike down under the Fourteenth Amendment laws which offend their notions of natural justice would fill many pages. Thus it has been said that this Court can forbid state action which \"shocks the conscience,\" Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, sufficiently to \"shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution,\" Irvine v. California, 347 U.S. 128, 138 (concurring opinion). It has been urged that States may not run counter to the \"decencies of civilized conduct,\" Rochin, supra, at 173, or \"some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105, or to \"those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples,\" Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 417.\" Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 527 [at footnote 4] (1965).\n \n These are the standards by which SCOTUS has incorporated some rights and rejected others. To me this smacks of an Orwellian determination that \"all rights in the BoR are equal, but some are more equal than others.\" I fail to see where this has any foundation in the 14th. Amendment. \n \n Justice Hugo Black was a champion of the total incorporation theory, and he resisted the claimed ability of justices to \"pick and choose\" what rights they felt were important enough for incorporation against the states. \n \n \"[this doctrine holds that] particular provisions of the Bill of Rights could be breached by the states in part, but not breached in other respects, according to this Court's notions of 'civilized standards,' 'canons of decency,' and 'fundamental fairness'....I fear to see the consequences of the Court's practice of substituting its own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the language of the Bill of Rights....To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution....[and to do so would allow justices to] roam at will in the limitless area of their own beliefs as to reasonableness and actually select policies, a responsibility which the Constitution entrusts to the legislative representatives of the people.\" Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, at pp 75-92 (Black, dissenting)\n \n My point is this: Selective Incorporation is so open ended and ill-defined that SCOTUS has used it to assume the role of a super-legislature in upholding or striking down state laws, not because they violate a particular guarantee in the BoR, but because SCOTUS does not like the public policy goal the law intends to reach. This is a primary reason why we fight so much over SCOTUS appointments. We don't fear this awesome power we have allowed the Supremes to assume, rather, we fear only those who would use that power to rule against our particular public policy goals. For example, gun prohibitionists who favor the collective right theory of the RKBA don't fear this near limitless discretion of a SCOTUS justice, rather, they fear appointing someone who has a private opinion favorable to an individual RKBA, who would use his power to declare that the RKBA is individual and then incorporate it as a limitation on the power of the states to infringe upon it. Gunnies, by contrast, fear the justice who favors the collective right theory. They know that the collective right theory is championed by some because it could deprive the individual citizen of the RKBA for any weapon, at any time, for any reason. If accepted by SCOTUS, then there would be nothing to prevent the \"tyranny of irritated ministers\" from completely baring the private possession of any firearm. There are undoubtedly some who believe this to be a worthy public policy goal, but I am not one of them. \n \n I believe that the RKBA is an individual and fundamental right. I also believe that it should be incorporated (along with the other 7 individual liberty amendments in the BoR) as a limitation on state infringement of the right. But this does NOT mean I believe the right to be absolute. I believe that far too many gun control proponents push the collective right theory because they fear that admitting an individual RKBA exists would deny the government any authority to regulate the possession of firearms. I do not believe this to be the case. No right can be absolute. The real issue for me is what is the proper scope of the individual RKBA? What does it protect? What limitations upon it are permitted? \n \n ------------------------\n \"The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.\" Dickerson v. U.S., 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) [Scalia, dissenting]",

   "No, because that is not how our system works. The genius of the constitution was that it was the first document of its kind to include, right there in the text of the dovcument, provisions for changing it. Incorporated into the system for changin it is provisions that ensure that we do not easily discard rights today that we may need tomorrow. A simple majority of votes is not enough to do it.\n\n Irrelevant. Who is trying to discard rights with a majority vote?\n \n \n\n Besides, I think you will find that pro gun control sentiment is downa across the boaerd. In the latest ABC poll, less than 8% of Americans believed gun registration led to reduced crime, and less than 5% believed that background checks had any influence on crime. The problem the anti gunners face is obvious.......you cannot lie to all the people all the time. eventually they DO realise that there are no facts that back up your position.\n\n This poll?\n http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/guns_poll020514.html\n \n \n \n\n Hopefully it also brings to mind the countless tyrannical regimes that have existed throughout history that have disarmed their public. Yea, occasionnaly some wack job kills a politician or shoots up a school yard without cause. **** happens.\n\n I'm sure you could find a lot of tyrranical regimes in which people believe that 2+2=4. Try using some critical thinking skills. \n \n \n \n\n the first and second ammendments are different form the others. They are natural rights. It also says the states are obligated to protect those rights, as well as specifically stating that the states may not deprive people of their right to bear arms. We have been over this before here, and you were involved. You need to quit ignoring things you don't like. No matter how tight you close your eyes, the booger man will still get you.\n\n You're very good at reading what you want into a piece of text.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You do like to qyote out of context, don't you? Here is the full paragraph you pulled your little snippet out of:\n \n \n It is about capitol punishment, not whether the second ammendment is an individual or a collective right, and certainly not a grammatical analysis of the secodn ammendment. It says that the issue of capitol punishment is one of dominion, and that the second ammendment has nothing to do with it. \n \n \n I enjopy debating you sometimes, but the academic dishonesty you constantly display borders on rediculaous. Can't you people just debate honestly as opposed to constantly lying to support your case? \n \n\n You're the one that is lying. The statement I quoted is about the second amendment. Try pulling the beam out of your own eye before you try to pull the mote out of another's eyes. \n \n \n\n If youa re talking about a grammatical analysis, nothing has really changed but the definition of militia, and the fact that the 2 clause construction of the ammendment has gone out of style. If you are talking historical analyisis of original intent.......well, that is quite clear, and you don't have a pot to **** in or a window to throw it out on that one, and we both know it.\n\n Very questionable claims. I know of historians that disagree with you. I think history is one of my strongest points. \n \n \n \n \n\n Since the supreme court has never examined the Brady Bill inregards to asecond ammendment challenge, the fact that they have not found a conflict is not surprising.\n \n 11 times the supreme court has ruled that you cannot require a permit or charge a tax on a right. There is absolutly no question of this. It is crystal clear and non-debatable. If the second ammendment is indeed an indivdual right, and was legally accepted as such, the brady bill owuld be unconstitutional, as would the NFA (which charges a tax on machine guns and destructive devices). There is absolulty no question of this.\n\n The key word is \"if\"\n \n \n\n In Printz v. United States, the court noted (clarence thomas writing):\n The Second Amendment similarly appears to contain an express limitation on the Government's authority. That Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" This Court has not had recent occasion to consider the nature of the substantive right safeguarded by the Second Amendment.[Footnote 1] If, however, the Second Amendment is read to confer a personal right to \"keep and bear arms,\" a colorable argument exists that the Federal Government's regulatory scheme, at least as it pertains to the purely intrastate sale or possession of firearms, runs afoul of that Amendment's protections.[Footnote 2] As the parties did not raise this argument, however, we need not consider it here. Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correct when he wrote that the right to bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00a7 1890, p. 746 (1833). In the meantime, I join the Court's opinion striking down the challenged provisions of the Brady Act as inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment. \n \n \n and:\n [Footnote 2] Marshaling an impressive array of historical evidence, a growing body of scholarly commentary indicates that the \"right to keep and bear arms\" is, as the Amendment's text suggests, a personal right. See, e.g., J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 162 (1994); S. Halbrook, That Every Man Be Armed, The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (1984); Van Alstyne, The Second Amendment and the Personal Right to Arms, 43 Duke L. J. 1236 (1994); Amar, The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 1193 (1992); Cottrol & Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309 (1991); Levinson, The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 637 (1989); Kates, Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204 (1983). Other scholars, however, argue that the Second Amendment does not secure a personal right to keep or to bear arms. See, e.g., Bogus, Race, Riots, and Guns, 66 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1365 (1993); Williams, Civic Republicanism and the Citizen Militia: The Terrifying Second Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 551 (1991); Brown, Guns, Cowboys, Philadelphia Mayors, and Civic Republicanism: On Sanford Levinson's The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 661 (1989); Cress, An Armed Community: The Origins and Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms, 71 J. Am. Hist. 22 (1984). Although somewhat overlooked in our jurisprudence, the Amendment has certainly engendered considerable academic, as well as public, debate.\" \n \n \n That is the CURRENT supreme court, and seems to suggest rather heavily that whether the brady bill is constitutional or not at the very least deserves consideration. Odds are we will never see it, though. It will likely never hit the supreme court for the simple fact that people are not generally porsecuted under the Brady bill. Retailers who have been caught selling guns without doing checks are not prosecuted, and criminals who have attempteds to purchase guns also are not (since there have only been a few criminals stopped by the brady background check, though, this doesn't say much). In fact, case law has already been established that implies that you CANNOT prosecute a felon for failure to register a gun, because in doing so they would be incriminating themselves. It would stand to reason that prosecuting them for information provided on the Brady background check forms would be the same.\n \n Personally, I would like to see the Brady bill in the supreme court. It is worthless legislative trash that nobody can show has had any effect on criminal use of firearms at all, and yet we spend millions per year on it. Why? So delusional people like yourself can feel like they have accomplished something?\n\n In reference to the Printz v. United States you are quoting from Justice Thomas' concurring opinion so it's deceptive of you to say the court noted such and such. You're not quoting from the majority opinion which was delivered by Justice Scalia.",

   "This poll?\n http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/guns_poll020514.html\n\n \n Nope, the poll in question was specifically regarding different gun control regulations currently on the books (it was at the end of the AWB, and the first question was about whehter people believed it was effective in lowering crime or providing for public safety. i have an archived copy. iw ill try to find it on the web. It makes for an interesting read.\n \n \n \n \nI'm sure you could find a lot of tyrranical regimes in which people believe that 2+2=4. Try using some critical thinking skills. \n \n \n Huh?\n \n \n \nYou're the one that is lying. The statement I quoted is about the second amendment. Try pulling the beam out of your own eye before you try to pull the mote out of another's eyes. \n \n \n Lets look at it again:\n \n Here is the preceding paragraph:\n \n \nThere is something creepy about the enthusiasm of various jurisdictions jockeying to execute the snipers first. Whether \"organizations \" that own Nevada casinos or governments -- beware when entities are anxious to make long lists of offenses punishable by death. Fondness for institutionalized death solutions is a sign of corruption.\n\n \n Here is the paragraph in question:\n \n \nSome say it is hypocrisy for governments to forbid us from killing when governments can execute. On the contrary: The Second Amendment does guarantee the personal right to kill. It is about dominion -- not hunting, not protection. If the snipers do convince a jury they are justified, they could be released.\n\n \n Here is the following paragraph:\n \n \nReaction to this sniper tragedy is a reminder that Utah's Legislature should annually review our statutes and legislate accordingly to keep the death penalty in Utah just and fair.\n\n \n Here is the title of the article:\n \n \nDeath penalty in Utah needs to remain just, fair\n\n \n Here is the only other section that deals with the second ammendment:\n \n \nThis incident illustrates the limitations of the Second Amendment. Amendment supporters claim it protects us by ensuring that an armed citizenry has the necessary means to \"take out \" crazed maniacs doing evil deeds.\n \n Not quite. In this case, the Second Amendment provided the snipers an offensive weapon that no average citizen would need for \"self defense. \" This is the Second Amendment in action -- death first, protection maybe\n\n \n Now, lets look at the paragrph you calim is an alaysis of the second ammendment:\n \n \nSome say it is hypocrisy for governments to forbid us from killing when governments can execute. On the contrary: The Second Amendment does guarantee the personal right to kill. It is about dominion  -- not hunting, not protection. If the snipers do convince a jury they are justified, they could be released.\n\n \n In the context of the paragraph, which I will admit is badly written (the whole article is badly written, it is almost like the author started out writing one article and ended writing another). In this context, saying the second ammendment is about dominion makes no sense. Saying that the death penalty is about dominion certainly makes sense. So, they are effectivley saying that the death penalty is about dominion, not about hunting or protection which are implied to be the purpose of the second ammendment. \n \n Are you really having trouble understanding this? \n \n \n \nVery questionable claims. I know of historians that disagree with you. I think history is one of my strongest points. \n \n \n If history is one of your strong points, you are in a great deal of trouble. In all the time you have posted here, you have yet to post a single historical opinion that actually held up to scrutiny. The closest you have come is a posting of a quote by hamilton, which was BADLY, BADLY out of context, and was shown to be such. \n \n If you have evidence to the contrary, please present it. \n \n \n \n \nThe key word is \"if\"\n\n \n Yes, the key word is \"if\". fortunatly, the pro gunners seem to be winning that battle as of late. Since the other side seems to lack any historical evidence to support their theory, it seems to be a rather one sided debate. Again, if you have such evidence, please present it. \n \n \nIn reference to the Printz v. United States you are quoting from Justice Thomas' concurring opinion so it's deceptive of you to say the court noted such and such. You're not quoting from the majority opinion which was delivered by Justice Scalia.\n\n \n I stand corrected. I had that misfiled.",
