   "what im about to say does not go for all theistic believers, gansao being one of them (whassap brotha), but recently i met someone who really checked off these points quite clearly, and after reading some of the posts from people on this forum, they check them off just as well, its just not as obvious as crazy christian girl i met.\n \n general arrogance\n \n ive noticed that if a crazy theistic person meets another theistic person with a different belief or an atheistic person, they will look down their nose at them. this one girl i met simply laughed at me when i told her i was an atheist - as if not believing in magic man in the sky was a joke. ive noticed that these type of people really love to tell other people how to spend their lives - as if there is only one valid option. i dont think ive pressured anyone to drop their religious beliefs, i just hold my own. whats the problem with that? why is it so necessary to insist that everyone act the same way you do? what makes life great is the variety of it all. why not celebrate that variety instead of chopping it down? to this girl, religion is the only criteria for friendship status.\n \n rudeness\n \n i usually ignore rudeness, but if its directed at something like religious belief, im not having it. there was a point in the conversation with this girl that went along the lines of 'youre a really bad person if you dont believe in Jesus' or something like that. judging me after being introduced to each other just 10 minutes ago. so i go on to talk about the good things i do and whatnot, all of which matter not because i dont do them in the name of an unjustifyable man.\n \n threats\n \n she didnt do much threatening, but thats because i got really mad at her. as soon as she mentioned hell, i knew threats of me going there were next. then i remembered some of the threats EZ has said to the atheists on this forum, about hell; then i remembered the death threats put onto judge John E Jones III after the Dover trial; then i remembered the threats to Richard Dawkins about getting hit by a church van; then i remembered the threats i was given as a child, studying in christian schools and going to church. i never really bought any of the religious doctine, i think im somewhat of an original atheist. i suppose its because my parents didnt shove the bible down my throat, which i thank them for. but it wasnt until my teen years that i started proudly calling myself an atheist. i always knew i was an atheist, but i was scared to expose my beliefs because of the threats i would get. so i got to thinking, if my whole life has been surrounded by religious threatening, and Richard Dawkins gets threatening emails regularily, and judge Jones and the plantiffs in the Dover trial get letters threatening their families lives, all from none other than religious people, the same people who claim to have a spiritual connection to the man who has the most love in his heart, how unchristlike is it all? how ungodlike is it all? as ive mentioned in my other thread on this forum, God approves of killing people, and God obviously approves of threatening people's lives as well. then i continued to think - what good has theistic religion brought to society? what good does religion do for the people who believe in it? so far as i can tell, religion does no good for anyone; if anything, harm is done long before anything positive.\n \n so how ungodlike is it all? not very.",

   "thanks for proving my third point. but i must ask, how do you know the bible is right? how do you know it's the word of God?\n\n \n Because HIS Holy Spirit which indwells all believers from the day of our salvation which is the day we accept Jesus as our Savior tells us so. God Himself indwells us via His own spirit and we become one with Him at that moment. That is why things that were foreign to us before being saved, and remain lost to unbelievers like you are now obvious to us. We were blind but now we see, we were deaf but now we hear, we were dead in our sins but now we are alive in Christ and dead to the sins of this world.\n \n All of this is gibberish to you but that's only because you are spiritually dead just as we once were. We have been where you are now which is why we attempt to get you to seek Him rather than believe us or any man. Salvation comes only from God not from any man. There is only one mediator between God and Man and He is Christ Jesus who died for our sins once and for all time and you can deny this reality for your complete life but in the end you will only learn how eternally wrong you were if you never humble yourself before HIM and seek His face.\n \n \nalso, if i enjoy my life without hurting anyone, and that sends me to hell, ill take a one-way ticket please. \n\n \n Your ignorance of true holiness and Gods absolute truths will be your eternal downfall. The bible says that we are either for Him or against Him, we either love Him or we hate Him. You are too ignorant to appreciate that by denying Him on these forums and attempting to justify your denial of Him you are doing irreparable harm to those who ignorantly believe the lies you tell. You are condemning others to the same fate which awaits you by spreading your false gospel of secularism and atheism, but as usual, you are too blind and spiritually dead to appreciate your folly.\n \n So don't think for a minute that you are innocent of hurting others in life.

   "As I've said before..\n Reinterpreted and reinvented throughout the ages, the Bible has become the ultimate tool in justifying and perpetuating war, torture, murder, genocide, hatred, rape, slavery, racial hatred, infanticide, and gender subjugation.\n Using the Bible as \"Truth\" has led to 5,000 years of imperialist war and genocide by the Jewish people, as well as the terrible war of genocide against the Jews by the Third Reich. Christians tortured to death other Christians for having the wrong Bible. Christian conquerors murdered nations of people in \"Holy Wars\". Muslims use it to justify throwing acid in the faces of young girls who try to go to school, suicide bombing of innocent people, and flying jets into office buildings. Churches use the Bible to control and fleece their members of their wealth. Churches organize a web of protection for pedophiles and sexual abusers. While leaders and politicians of all countries use the Bible to wage wars of pure profit for the ruling class. And\n every horror has been executed with the justification that the perpetrator is simply following the word of a loving God.\n The sad fact is that most believers in the Bible have not read the book for themselves. They have been taught an interpretation of it from their family, pastor, or someone else. Many have read parts of the Bible, but only the parts that support their own preconceived ideas and prejudices. \n Religious Zealots speak of the Bible as if it's the Literal word of God when in FACT it's nothing more than a compilation of old song, poems, and fairy tales with a little bit of Hebrew History mixed in. The scroll it was written on were scattered throughout the Middle east, Not written as THE BIBLE. The Bible was put together by MEN. Men who intentionally left out parts that contradicted the teachings they wanted to spread to the world. You Religious zealots try to Force your Religion on others and when you don't get your way you do like EZ does and resort to name calling and threats. Like in one of my previous posts according to YOUR own Bible it makes most Christians Hypocrites. You think that because some of us Are Atheists that we don't know the Bible from which you preach, but you would be surprised that in fact Most Atheists know more about your book than you do. That's why I'm an Atheist. I realize it's all a Lie. I realize there is no GOD. I realize that Jesus was not real. And the FACT is you can't prove me wrong. There is no evidence to support your religion other than a questionable Book written centuries ago ... other than that you have nothing.....",

   "science is an example of our society threatened by religion. education is another. Dawkins is a scientist and a teacher, so you can see how he can be threatened.\n\n \n Scientists are free to practice science. What is the problem?\n Moreover, some of the best science in history came from religious people. Science would not be where it is today if not for religious people. (Newton, Kelvin, Faraday, etc.) The idea that religion and science are juxtapositions is fallacious.\n Second, in the last few decades the anti-theist movement has been far more active in trying to remove religion from schools than religion has been in removing science from schools. It is scientists being intolerant of religion, not so much the other way around. Movements to remove science from schools are relatively rare now; evolution is the standard. On the other hand reactionary scientists tend to freak out every time they hear of creationism being even present in a school. I hold to evolution myself, but there's no doubt there's way too much paranoia and over-reaction over creationism.\n \n Oh and Dawkins is no scientist--he's a charlatan. He's built a business out of bashing religion with incendiary and offensive statements. He tells anti-theists what they want to hear and they love it, because they are already prejudiced to begin with. He's sort of a Fred Phelps of the anti-theist movement.\n \n \nyou may not be one that forces religion onto people, but there is no question about it, religious people go out of their way to force their religion onto other people. you get jehovah's witnesses harrassing you at your doorstep, you get christian fundamentalists guilting and threatening you into religion\n\n \n Having someone come to your door and try to persuade you of their views is not 'forcing' you to do anything. Frankly, I think you live a pretty sheltered life if that's really what you think. (Though I wonder if you're just looking for anything to say bad about religion, more than anything.) Nor is it 'harassing.' I've never had a Jehovah's Witness not walk away if you politely tell them your not interested. It's not that hard to do. \n \n It's sad that people like yourself, in our society, have gotten so intolerant of someone coming to your door to share their views and try to persuade you that you refer to such actions as \"forcing\" you to do something. I think you know very well that it's not. The reason our society is less pluralistic and the marketplace of ideas is not there much any more is because of that very attitude: one that isn't willing to listen to another view. And that's why your take of taking issue with religion's 'attitude' is ultimately hypocritical on your part. \n \n Re. Christian fundies, no one is making you listen to them, and they can't force you to do anything. You're free from religion in this country--you don't have to be religious. So your idea that anyone 'forces' religion on you is, well, baloney.\n \n \nconsider those people in america who stand on the street and ask people things like \"if you died today, how would God judge you?\" that is forcing religious beliefs onto people!\n\n \n Um, no it's not. That's not forcing anything on you. How is it even possible to force someone to believe something? Do you think they have some kind of mind-control device in their pocket with a button they can push that turns you into a zombie or something? You're being absolutely ridiculous.\n \n \ni am an atheist and she is more of a fence sitter. they asked us about our religious beliefs and i told them i was an atheist, and they steered very clear of me. when my girlfriend told them of her beliefs, they started reeling her in... this makes the agenda very clear for these religious people, and its apparent that all religions do the same. ive met others, its not just mormons.\n\n \n Well yeah, because she was more tolerant than you. Your girlfriend sounds like an open-minded person. Kudos to her. In the same way, if there was a group of atheists trying to compel her with their views, and she indicated she was open to having her mind changed on the issue, then they too would focus on persuading her. Why shouldn't either group?\n \n \nwhat i mean by religious people being arrogant because of religion, i dont mean its written in the scriptures, i mean it comes with being religious.\n\n \n And I'm telling you my experience doesn't bear that out at all. Religion crosses all walks of life. I think you're talking about something thats more of a personality trait rather than religion. Religion is like any other ideology: it can be used for bad or good. The likes of ML King and Mother Theresa have been influenced by their religion toward enormous compassion. Conversely the likes of some very evil people have been influenced by their religion. Religion by itself is not sentient--it can't be evil or good in action as it's not really action. It's belief in God or the divine.",

   "Scientists are free to practice science. What is the problem?\n Moreover, some of the best science in history came from religious people. Science would not be where it is today if not for religious people. (Newton, Kelvin, Faraday, etc.) The idea that religion and science are juxtapositions is fallacious.\n Second, in the last few decades the anti-theist movement has been far more active in trying to remove religion from schools than religion has been in removing science from schools. It is scientists being intolerant of religion, not so much the other way around. Movements to remove science from schools are relatively rare now; evolution is the standard. On the other hand reactionary scientists tend to freak out every time they hear of creationism being even present in a school. I hold to evolution myself, but there's no doubt there's way too much paranoia and over-reaction over creationism.\n \n Oh and Dawkins is no scientist--he's a charlatan. He's built a business out of bashing religion with incendiary and offensive statements. He tells anti-theists what they want to hear and they love it, because they are already prejudiced to begin with. He's sort of a Fred Phelps of the anti-theist movement.\n\n \n no doubt that great scientists were and are religious, and no doubt science would not be where it is without religious people. thats not what im saying. im saying its currently under threat because the evolution/creationism war is far from over. and the science that is evolution is being attacked by the religion that is creationism, so you can see how dangerous this is to schools and ultimately science as a whole. creationism is not the only religious threat to science, you know. i somewhat agree, there is an over-reaction to creationism, but if we didnt put up such strong defenses, bad stuff could happen.\n \n Dawkins is a scientist, he has a Ph.D in zoology and has written a variety of books, some of them being important, accepted scientific theories. he was a professor at Oxford and UCLA and he was also the professor of public understanding at Oxford. he is a very important figure in the scientific community.\n \n \nHaving someone come to your door and try to persuade you of their views is not 'forcing' you to do anything.

Do you think they have some kind of mind-control device in their pocket with a button they can push that turns you into a zombie or something? You're being absolutely ridiculous.\n\n \n youve got to be joking. threatening someone's life is pretty much forcing someone. if someone pointed a gun to your head and asked you for all of your money and you gave it to him, would you then say that he forced you to give him your money? of course you would. he doesnt need to guide your hands to your wallet, just the use of the gun threatening your life is enough to consider an action forceful. if someone comes up to you and tells you that you have to follow this religious doctrine or else you will be thrown into a pit of fire for the rest of your life... thats a threat which might as well be considered forceful.\n \n \nAnd I'm telling you my experience doesn't bear that out at all. Religion crosses all walks of life. I think you're talking about something thats more of a personality trait rather than religion. Religion is like any other ideology: it can be used for bad or good.

Religion by itself is not sentient--it can't be evil or good in action as it's not really action. It's belief in God or the divine.\n\n \n again... im not talking about you specifically. i dont care if your experience contradicts what i said, im talking about the subsidiaries that come with religion. im also not saying that there arent any good religious people. im saying that those religious people who do bad things do them because of religion. religious belief encourages this attude, whether you choose to buy into it or not, its still there. religious people with a sour attitude have that attitude because of religious authority and politics.",

   "so what youre saying is you know the bible is true because you believe it is.\n\n \n No, that's not what I said at all, but it's no surprise that's how you would interpret it. I clearly said that the PERSON of God through His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers affirms for us what is truth and what isn't His established truth. See, here is what I said again in a quote, how interesting it is that you are incapable of interpreting plain english. It reflects on your intelligence just as I said earlier.\n \n \nBecause HIS Holy Spirit which indwells all believers from the day of our salvation which is the day we accept Jesus as our Savior tells us so. God Himself indwells us via His own spirit and we become one with Him at that moment. That is why things that were foreign to us before being saved, and remain lost to unbelievers like you are now obvious to us. We were blind but now we see, we were deaf but now we hear, we were dead in our sins but now we are alive in Christ and dead to the sins of this world.\n\n \n \nim doing harm to people because i lack a religious belief and dont push my beliefs onto others?? how in the hell... \n\n \n You sure are, and you obviously don't even know it. Here's an eye opener for you: \n Eph 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\n So, we are in a spiritual battle here in this life, but since you are spiritually dead and completely unaware of your place in that WAR, you will find yourself DOA when you come before the King of Kings one day. That is assuming you never humble yourself before Him before that day comes.\n \n And this:\n Luk 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and man.\n So, you see? Whether you acknowledge it or not you serve a master. If you don't serve our Father who created us in His image for fellowship because He loves us as a parent loves his own child, then you are serving Gods enemy who seeks to destroy you in order to deny God His child whom Satan knows God loves so much that He became flesh and sacrificed HIMSELF on Calvary's Cross in order to redeem Humanity and return us to Himself. This is the crux of the war between God and Satan for which we are the ultimate prize. How sad that you lack any understanding of your place in Gods creation.\n \n And there is this also:\n Jhn 14:26 \"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.\n This passage confirms my real life experience which testifies that Gods Holy Spirit indwells me and guides my life daily. Neither I nor any believer is alone in this world.\n \n \nyou dont know what fate is in store for me, you dont even know what fate is in store for yourself. to say that you know is arrogant.\n\n \n You're partially right. I don't know what fate is in store for you. The book isn't written on your life yet which is why I'm sharing these truths with you in order to enlighten you to the salvation which is available to you here and now as you live and breathe. But there is nothing arrogant at all about telling you of the fate which awaits you if you remain in the willful rebellion and ignorance you are so fervently clinging to.\n \n \nand only God's opinion counts in the end... great. everyone spends their lives doing things for no reason whatsoever because only God's opinion counts in the end.\n\n \n God is the final and ultimate judge who each of us will stand before. And all of your willful and stubborn denials wont change a thing, The only question which remains is will you be a sheep or a goat?\n Mat 25:32 \"All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.\n Mat 25:33 \"And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.\n Mat 25:34 \"Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\n Mat 25:35 'for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;\n Mat 25:36 'I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.'\n Mat 25:37 \"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?\n Mat 25:38 'When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?\n Mat 25:39 'Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'\n Mat 25:40 \"And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.'\n Mat 25:41 \"Then He will also say to those on the left hand, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:\n Mat 25:42 'for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;\n Mat 25:43 'I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.'\n Mat 25:44 \"Then they also will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?\n Mat 25:45 \"Then He will answer them, saying, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.'\n Mat 25:46 \"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\"\n Now, read verse 34 above carefully, notice it is the King (Jesus) speaking for His Father (God) So Jesus whom you deny will be the judge on that Throne we will all stand before.\n \n \n how wonderful a belief. i wonder if Thor or Allah or Apollo have any say...\n\n \n Since neither of these man made gods in fact created us or even exist at all as true GODS, they obviously have nothing at all to say. How sad that you are too lost and deceived to recognize the difference between them and the living God who created you in love and in His image. emoticon_cry",

That is assuming you never humble yourself before Him before that day comes.\n \n And this:\n Luk 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and man.\n So, you see? Whether you acknowledge it or not you serve a master. If you don't serve our Father who created us in His image for fellowship because He loves us as a parent loves his own child, then you are serving Gods enemy who seeks to destroy you in order to deny God His child whom Satan knows God loves so much that He became flesh and sacrificed HIMSELF on Calvary's Cross in order to redeem Humanity and return us to Himself. This is the crux of the war between God and Satan for which we are the ultimate prize. How sad that you lack any understanding of your place in Gods creation.\n \n And there is this also:\n Jhn 14:26 \"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.\n This passage confirms my real life experience which testifies that Gods Holy Spirit indwells me and guides my life daily. Neither I nor any believer is alone in this world.\n \n \n \n You're partially right. I don't know what fate is in store for you. The book isn't written on your life yet which is why I'm sharing these truths with you in order to enlighten you to the salvation which is available to you here and now as you live and breathe. But there is nothing arrogant at all about telling you of the fate which awaits you if you remain in the willful rebellion and ignorance you are so fervently clinging to.\n \n \n \n God is the final and ultimate judge who each of us will stand before. And all of your willful and stubborn denials wont change a thing, The only question which remains is will you be a sheep or a goat?\n Mat 25:32 \"All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.\n Mat 25:33 \"And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.\n Mat 25:34 \"Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\n Mat 25:35 'for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;\n Mat 25:36 'I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.'\n Mat 25:37 \"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?\n Mat 25:38 'When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?\n Mat 25:39 'Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'\n Mat 25:40 \"And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.'\n Mat 25:41 \"Then He will also say to those on the left hand, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:\n Mat 25:42 'for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;\n Mat 25:43 'I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.'\n Mat 25:44 \"Then they also will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?\n Mat 25:45 \"Then He will answer them, saying, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.'\n Mat 25:46 \"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\"\n Now, read verse 34 above carefully, notice it is the King (Jesus) speaking for His Father (God) So Jesus whom you deny will be the judge on that Throne we will all stand before.\n \n \n \n Since neither of these man made gods in fact created us or even exist at all as true GODS, they obviously have nothing at all to say. How sad that you are too lost and deceived to recognize the difference between them and the living God who created you in love and in His image. emoticon_cry\n\n \n Why is Christianity right (That means lumping the 30k different denominations into one group) and Islam, Hindu and Judaism wrong?",

Job 2:8, 19:4, 22:27, 33:13, 48:10, 59:13, 61:2, 65:5, 72:8 for references to a flat earth. \n \n Before you say but \n \n Proverbs 8:27- When he prepared the heavens, I was there, When he drew a circle on the face of the deep\n \n Isaiah 40:22- It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And it's inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.\n \n are references to a round earth these describe a pancake not a sphere.\n \n Light is pure was a popular position, the colors were a distortion and evil\n \n Let's not forget Galileo or curd chewing bunnies and four legged flying mammals.\n \n Oh and speaking of Genesis did you notice when God decides Adam needs a helper he introduces him to all the animals first then makes Eve.

   "I never claimed to be a scientist.. But it's a known FACT recognized by scientists all over the world that this world is much older than your Bible claims. \n\n \n Again, my bible gives no date for the earth which is confirmed by your inability to post the verse that states the age. And explain how scientists have gotten soft tissue from a 60+ million year old T-Rex fossil if it really is 60+ million years old. Can you imagine that length of time and soft tissue surviving that amount of time? I can't. Maybe 15 or 20,000 years, but 70 million? Not on your life... Here's a link and a quote from the article. Now prove how utterly gullible you are by accepting this just because so called scientists say it is so. Soft Tissue Found in 70 Million Year Old T Rex Bone\n HEADLINE SCIENCE: Dino Discovery Scientists see the softer side of Tyrannosaurus rex. When paleontologists find fossilized dinosaur bones during a dig, they usually do everything in their\n power to protect them, using tools like toothbrushes to carefully unearth the bones without inflicting any\n damage. However, when scientists found a massive Tyrannosaurus rex thigh bone in a remote region of\n Montana a few months ago, they were forced to break the bone in two in order to fit it into the transport\n helicopter. This act of necessity revealed a startling surprise: soft tissue that had seemingly resisted\n fossilization still existed inside the bone. This tissue, including blood vessels, bone cells, and perhaps\n even blood cells, was so well preserved that it was still stretchy and flexible.\n A scanning electron microscope revealed that the dinosaur blood vessels, which are 70 million years old,\n are virtually identical to those recovered from modern ostrich bones. The ostrich is today's largest bird,\n and many paleontologists believe that birds are the living descendants of dinosaurs. Scientists may be\n able to confirm this evolutionary relationship if they can isolate certain proteins from the recently\n discovered T. rex tissue. These proteins could also help solve another puzzle: whether dinosaurs were\n cold-blooded like other reptiles or warm-blooded like mammals.\n Does this discovery of soft dinosaur tissue mean that scientists will soon be able to clone aTyrannosaurus rex? Probably not - most scientists believe that DNA cannot survive for 70 million years. Then again, before this discovery, most scientists believed that soft tissue could not survive for 70 million years either.\n \n Carbon dating, and fossils are not theory, so that statement is absurd. You can't show any evidence that your God is real either, so what have you got?.. the bible?.. do you really think that is enough for a Rational person to believe? I don't have Blind Faith, I require a bit more proof before I waste my life following a pipe dream.....\n\n \n This one discovery raises serious questions about both of your examples of carbon dating and fossils being absolute evidence of anything you believe. You see, christians don't reject the available evidence at all, we just interpret it differently than you secularists do. Especially since evolution science determined what outcome the evidence must come to a hundred and fifty years ago and they have been manipulating the evidentiary outcome ever since.",

And you are further admitting that this claim is a modern day assumption which isn't based on any scriptural claims at all but is the result of doing math. \n \n Not all believers cling to any date for the age of the earth even though we do reject the so called evidence of animals being here more than 70 million years ago and going back 300 million years as evolutionists claim. \n \n \nRadiometric dating, specifically radiocarbon and uranium-lead dating are hardly what I would term \"theoretical\". They are based on known constants.\n\n \n Your so called known constants are precisely what are theoretical according to my definition of the science. Here's what I mean, U-Pb dating is based upon three basic \"assumptions\": \n \n 1) A constant decay rate--this is a reasonable assumption based upon current modern observed physical properties. But it is impossible to assume that physical conditions on earth over millions and billions of years never affected decay rates. Just imagine the effects of the many meteor and astroid collisions with the earth over the last alleged 3 or 4 billion years. Are you saying these wouldn't interfere with decay rates, or a loss or gain in Uranium or lead at various and diverse levels of strata?\n \n 2) No loss or gain of Uranium or Lead during the \"life\" of the rock.--To avoid this problem, paleontologists choose specimes that appear to have no erosion forces acting on it. This is difficult to objectively guarantee, but it is nonetheless assumed to be a reasonable assumption by modern day scientists. The subjectivity involved in choosing specimens to test is mind boggling in the possible unknowns involved in the history of the rock being considered.\n \n 3) Most importantly though, It is assumed that NO Lead was in the specimen when it was formed. This assumption is illogical, and is actually the entire basis for U-Pb dating. Why wouldn't there be Lead in the specimen when it was formed? Why would there be Uranium and no Lead? How do we know that there was no Lead in the specimen when it was formed? The answer is we don't, yet the entire basis of U-Pb dating rests upon this assumption so how do you insist that this science is reliable? The answer is it requires as much faith to accept as does your myth of evolution.\n \n \nAs far as your \"chemicals\" go, here they are...\n\n \n You call this an answer to my question which was this: show me the chemicals which combined to lead to the first spontaneous life on Earth this alleged 4.5 billion years ago. Are you saying that a combination of all the chemicals on the periodic table resulted in spontaneous life appearing on earth? Then why didn't you post the link to the repeatable experiments which confirmed these assumed conclusions, sparky?\n \n \nPay attention sparky, cuz this is important. The oldest samples of terrestrial material tested thus far have measured about 4.404 billion years old, and the oldest samples of meteorites have been found to be about 4.567 billion years old.

It is based on scripture, just as I pointed out. I said it is from Genesis 5 and 11. It gives the geneology from Adam down to Abraham, which accounts for about 2000 years. Abraham lived about 4000 years ago, so simple math (yes, using that evil science math...) tells us that the bible represents the earth as 2000+4000= 6000 years old. Grab a calculator if you need one. \n \n \nNot all believers cling to any date for the age of the earth even though we do reject the so called evidence of animals being here more than 70 million years ago and going back 300 million years as evolutionists claim.\n \n Wrong again. Life has been here for about 3.8 billion years, not 70 or 300 million. Heck, between 230 -65 million years ago, we did indeed have life, they were called dinosaurs...perhaps you have heard of them? (then again, maybe not, since they don't seem to appear in the bible...god forgot to tell people to write about them) Single celled organisms appear in the fossil record about 3.6-3.8 billion years ago, with multi-celled organisms appearing about 2 billion years later. Vertebrates did not show up until about 525 million years ago. \n \n \n \nYour so called known constants are precisely what are theoretical according to my definition of the science. Here's what I mean, U-Pb dating is based upon three basic \"assumptions\": \n \n 1) A constant decay rate--this is a reasonable assumption based upon current modern observed physical properties. But it is impossible to assume that physical conditions on earth over millions and billions of years never affected decay rates. Just imagine the effects of the many meteor and astroid collisions with the earth over the last alleged 3 or 4 billion years. Are you saying these wouldn't interfere with decay rates, or a loss or gain in Uranium or lead at various and diverse levels of strata?\n \n 2) No loss or gain of Uranium or Lead during the \"life\" of the rock.--To avoid this problem, paleontologists choose specimes that appear to have no erosion forces acting on it. This is difficult to objectively guarantee, but it is nonetheless assumed to be a reasonable assumption by modern day scientists. The subjectivity involved in choosing specimens to test is mind boggling in the possible unknowns involved in the history of the rock being considered.\n \n 3) Most importantly though, It is assumed that NO Lead was in the specimen when it was formed. This assumption is illogical, and is actually the entire basis for U-Pb dating. Why wouldn't there be Lead in the specimen when it was formed? Why would there be Uranium and no Lead? How do we know that there was no Lead in the specimen when it was formed? The answer is we don't, yet the entire basis of U-Pb dating rests upon this assumption so how do you insist that this science is reliable? The answer is it requires as much faith to accept as does your myth of evolution.\n\n It is not my job to educate you. However, I am feeling generous, and all the answers you are looking for can be found here.\n \n \nYou call this an answer to my question which was this: show me the chemicals which combined to lead to the first spontaneous life on Earth this alleged 4.5 billion years ago. Are you saying that a combination of all the chemicals on the periodic table resulted in spontaneous life appearing on earth? Then why didn't you post the link to the repeatable experiments which confirmed these assumed conclusions, sparky?\n\n No, I am not saying a combination of all of them...those are your words. The most common needed are Oxygen, Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulfer, Sodium, Magnesium, Calcium... Many others are needed as trace elements. Also, different types of life use different things in different amounts. Nobody has a recipe that tells us what combined or even what made it happen. We do know that carbon seems to be the one element common in all observed life.",

Just to be clear, and perhaps to help me understand where you are coming from:\n \n When do you think life began on earth?\n How old do you believe earth is?\n Do you believe dinosaurs and humans lived together?\n \n \n My answer was very clear for any person of average intelligence so I guess that explains your difficulty. \n\n How christian of you to lower yourself to childish insults.\n \n \nAnd the bible does mention dinosaurs even though the actual name \"Dinosaurs\" didn't exist then, but here, explain these 2 creatures if you can and there are more references than these if you do some research. \n\n A few vague references to creatures that could be easily explained by currently existing animals don't say dinosaur to me. You would think that if man and dinosaurs lived together, there would be plenty of reference to them in the bible. We see a lot of other animals referenced frequently, but nothing about big scaley monsters eating the villagers. You would think that something like that would have figured prominently. \n \n \nAlso, you lose me evertime you go back and spout your multi billion year old events since you are discussing times we cannot even fathom from our perspective.\n\n Speak for yourself. You cannot fathom the term billions. I have absolutely no trouble with it. Sure, it's a lot of time, but it's a definable number. How hard is that really? I'll let you in on a scientific secret that mathematicians have been hiding from the general public since the beginning of time. A billion is nothing more than a million with 3 more 0's at the end. Just because you can't comprehend something does nothing to make it any less true or possible.\n \n \n And remember, I don't doubt the single celled creatures have been discovered, I just reject the placement and interpretations of the available evidence whereas you place all of your faith in the conclusions of flawed scientists who force the discovered evidence to fit the predetermined outcome. I know you'll reject that opinion, but it stands nonetheless.\n\n Absolutely I reject it. You are basically saying that science is nothing more than a big conspiracy. I must ask...why? What axe do you have to grind with science? The first thing a good detective always asks is this: Who benefits? I find that to be a rather appropriate question right now. What possible benefit would science have in falsifying evidence to fit a pre-determined slot? \n \n \nNo, actually since you posted the periodic table in answer to my question about what chemicals led to spontaneous life appearing on earth, that was precisely your snarky answer as if it was to make any sense at all. And you mention this as if it is some formula to be relied upon when all it is, is wild speculation and your imaginings with no basis in actual fact at all: \n\n Don't presume to tell me what my intentions were behind a particular post. Talk about arrogance. What I was saying, if you please, was that all life contains a combination of some/many of these elements, and life would not be possible without them. Again, I don't know the exact \"recipe\" for life, neither does the scientific community. However, the fact that we do not know it does not mean that there is no \"recipe\". Newton did not know why gravity worked, yet he knew that it was there. \n \n \nAnd I notice you don't even squirm at the thought or suggestion of spontaneous life appearing randomly in a very hot and chaotic world with an atmosphere of sulphuric acid and ammonia. What blows my mind is you can't prove any of this yet you accept it as easily as I do traditional conservatism.\n\n Why should I squirm? I know for a fact that life can exist under these types of conditions. Science can prove it. Ever heard of something called an Extremophile? I'm guessing not. See, the problem is that the scientific community being the secretive and conspiratorial group that it is, in a move designed purely to prevent the free spread of such information, has concealed this knowledge in books. Unfortunately, it is not in the bible, which I am sure is why you have never heard of it. Might not hurt to read something other than your bible once in a while. There is a whole world out there full of wonderous things...you are missing it.",

The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\"\n \n 2. The prophet said: \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him.\" Has the awful treatment of the Jewish people (so contrary, by the way, to the teaching of Jesus to love everyone) really been God's pleasure, as is said of the suffering of the servant in Isaiah 53:10 ? If, as some rabbis contend, Isaiah 53 refers to the holocaust, can we really say of Israel's suffering during that horrible period, \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him?\" Yet it makes perfect sense to say that God was pleased to have Messiah suffer and die as our sin offering to provide us forgiveness and atonement.\n \n 3. The person mentioned in this passage suffers silently and willingly. Yet all people, even Israelites, complain when they suffer! Brave Jewish men and women fought in resistance movements against Hitler. Remember the Vilna Ghetto Uprising? Remember the Jewish men who fought on the side of the allies? Can we really say Jewish suffering during the holocaust and during the preceding centuries was done silently and willingly?\n \n 4. The figure described in Isaiah 53 suffers, dies, and rises again to atone for his people's sins. The Hebrew word used in Isaiah 53:10 for \"sin-offering\" is \"asham,\" which is a technical term meaning \"sin-offering.\" See how it is used in Leviticus chapters 5 and 6. Isaiah 53 describes a sinless and perfect sacrificial lamb who takes upon himself the sins of others so that they might be forgiven. Can anyone really claim that the terrible suffering of the Jewish people, however undeserved and unjust, atones for the sins of the world? Whoever Isaiah 53 speaks of, the figure described suffers and dies in order to provide a legal payment for sin so that others can be forgiven. This cannot be true of the Jewish people as a whole, or of any other mere human.\n \n 5. It is the prophet who is speaking in this passage. He says: \"who has believed our message.\" The term \"message\" usually refers to the prophetic message, as it does in Jeremiah 49:14. Also, when we understand the Hebrew parallelism of verse 1, we see \"Who has believed our message\" as parallel to \"to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed.\" The \"arm of the Lord\" refers to God's powerful act of salvation. So the message of the speaker is the message of a prophet declaring what God has done to save his people. \n \n 6. The prophet speaking is Isaiah himself, who says the sufferer was punished for \"the transgression of my people,\" according to verse 8. Who are the people of Isaiah? Israel. So the sufferer of Isaiah 53 suffered for Israel. So how could he be Israel?\n \n 7. The figure of Isaiah 53 dies and is buried according to verses 8 and 9. The people of Israel have never died as a whole. They have been out of the land on two occasions and have returned, but they have never ceased to be among the living. Yet Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.\n \n Why Israel Cannot be the Suffering Servant in Isaiah 53\n \n Answer those points, pappi? Enjoy.",

   "I did in the links I gave you which you had no answer for just asked questions that have already been shown not to support Jesus.\n\n \n Your links were a disaster and full of distortions and errors.\n \n The Rabbis' Dilemma: A Look at Isaiah 53\n \n Our ancient commentators with one accord noted that the context clearly speaks of God's Anointed One, the Messiah. The Aramaic translation of this chapter, ascribed to Rabbi Jonathan ben Uzziel, a disciple of Hillel who lived early in the second century C.E., begins with the simple and worthy words:\n \n Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high, and increase, and be exceeding strong: as the house of Israel looked to him through many days, because their countenance was darkened among the peoples, and their complexion beyond the sons of men. (Targum Jonathan on Isaiah 53, ad locum)\n \n We find the same interpretation in the Babylonian Talmud:\n \n The Messiah -- what is his name? . . . The Rabbis say, the leprous one; those of the house of Rabbi say, the sick one, as it is said, \"Surely he hath borne our sicknesses.\" (Sanhedrin 98b)\n \n Similarly, in the Midrash Rabbah, in an explanation of Ruth 2:14:\n He is speaking of the King Messiah: \"Come hither\" draw near to the throne \"and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,\" this refers to the chastisements, as it is said, \"But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities.\"\n \n In the same manner also in a later midrash, the Midrash Tanhuma, parasha Toldot, end of section, it says:\n \n \"Who art thou, O great mountain?\" (Zechariah 4:7) This refers to the King Messiah. And why does he call him the \"great mountain?\" Because he is greater than the patriarchs, as it is said, \"My servant shall be high, and lifted up, and lofty exceedingly.\" He will be higher than Abraham who said, \"I raise high my hand unto the Lord\" (Gen. 14:22), lifted up above Moses, to whom it is said, \"Lift it up into thy bosom\" (Numbers 11:12), loftier than the ministering angels, of whom it is written, \"Their wheels were lofty and terrible\" (Ezekiel 1:18). And out of whom does he come forth? Out of David.\n These are a few of the ancient interpretations attributing this chapter to the suffering and exalted Messiah.\n \n Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzchaki, 1040-1105) and some of the later rabbis, though, began to interpret the passage as referring to Israel. They knew that the older interpretations referred it to Messiah. However, Rashi lived at a time when a degenerate medieval distortion of Christianity was practiced. He wanted to preserve the Jewish people from accepting such a faith and, although his intentions were sincere, other prominent Jewish rabbis and leaders realized the inconsistencies of Rashi's interpretation. They presented a threefold objection to his innovation. First, they showed the consensus of ancient opinion. Secondly, they pointed out that the text is in the singular. Thirdly, they noted verse eight. This verse presented an insurmountable difficulty to those who interpreted this passage as referring to Israel. It reads:\n \n He was taken away from rule and from judgment; and his life who shall recount? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; through the transgressions of my people was he stricken.\n \n Were the Jewish people, God forbid, ever cut off out of the land of the living? No! In Jeremiah 31:35-37, God promised that we will exist forever. We are proud that Am Israel Chai -- \"The people of Israel are much alive.\" Likewise, it is impossible to say that Israel suffered for the transgressions of \"my people,\" which clearly means Isaiah's people. Surely Isaiah's people are not the Gentiles, but the Jews.\n \n Moshe Kohen, a 15th-century rabbi in Spain, explains the section:\n \n This passage, the commentators explain, speaks of the captivity of Israel, although the singular number is used in it throughout. Others have supposed it to mean the just in this present world, who are crushed and oppressed now...but these too, for the same reason, by altering the number, distort the verses from their natural meaning. And then it seemed to me that... having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined \"after the stubbornness of their own hearts,\" and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah.*\n \n For the same reason, Rabbi Moshe Alsheikh, Rabbi of Safed, late 16th century, points out this fact saying:\n \n I may remark, then, that our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the King Messiah.*\n \n Much to the point is the commentary of the great Jewish educator, Herz Homberg (1749-1841), who says:\n \n According to the opinion of Rashi and Ibn Ezra, it relates to Israel at the end of their captivity. But if so, what can be the meaning of the passage, \"He was wounded for our transgressions\"? Who was wounded? Who are the transgressors? Who carried out the sickness and bare the pain? The fact is that it refers to the King Messiah.*\n \n One of our greatest Jewish religious poets, Eliezer HaKalir, paraphrased this chapter in the 9th century into rhyme and metric poetry. It is recited in the Yom Kippur prayer of Kether:\n \n Messiah, our righteousness, hath turned from us: we are in terror and there is none to justify us! Our iniquities and the yoke of our transgressions He did bear for He was wounded for our transgressions: He carries our sins upon His shoulders, that we may find forgiveness for our iniquities and by His stripes we are healed. O eternal One the time is come to make a new creation: from the vault of heaven bring Him up, out of Seir draw Him forth, that He may make His voice heard to us in Lebanon, a second time by the hand of Yinnon.**\n \n The Rabbis' Dilemma: A Look at Isaiah 53\n \n You don't have anything in the Jewish Targum or Talmud or Midrash that says Isaiah 53 is Israel, do you?",

   "Lies Damned Lies and What the Missionaries Claim the Rabbis say part 2\n \n \n In a previous article[1] I pointed out the errors made about rabbinic writings by Rachmiel Frydland, Risto Santala, David Stern[2], and Michael Brown[3] in their books. In this article I will turn to another top scholar of 'Messianic Judaism', Arnold Fructenbaum. My purpose here is not to read through their books and find all their mistakes. Every author knows that it is impossible to write a book without some errors appearing. The purpose is to point out errors of a type that indicates a greater problem. These are errors that affect the rationality of accepting the authors and their works as 'authoritative'. Minor issues do not do that.\n \n \n \n In these articles I concentrate on a specific type of error; those applying to rabbinic writings or beliefs. The importance to these authors of the rabbinic writings is twofold: First Rabbinic sources are brought to 'prove' that Christianity (Messianic Judaism) maintains older beliefs then Judaism (Rabbinic Judaism.) Second, it is to show that their beliefs have legitimacy within the accepted range of Jewish belief. I believe that I am showing that these people are not to be believed in statements of this kind.\n \n \n \n Let us now turn to Arnold Fructenbaum. In his work, Messianic Christology we find these two passages:\n \n \n \n \"All the ancient Jewish writings - the Mishnah[4], the Gemara, (the talmud), the Midrashim and many others - all regard this portion of Scripture as relating to the Messianic Person. The first rabbi to suggest otherwise was Rashi, around 1050 A.D. Every rabbi prior to Rashi, without exception, viewed this passage as describing Messiah. When Rashi first proposed that this passage spoke of the nation of Israel, he sparked a fierce debate with his contemporaries. The most famous of these was the Rambam[5], perhaps better known as Maimonides. Rambam stated very clearly that Rashi was completely wrong in going contrary to the traditional Jewish viewpoint. \"[6]\n \n \n \n \"To interpret Isaiah 53 as speaking of Messiah is not non-Jewish. In fact, if we are to speak of the traditional Jewish interpretation, it would be that the passage speaks of the Messiah. The first one to expound the view that this referred to Israel rather then the Messiah was Shlomoh Yizchaki, better known as Rashi (c. 1040-1105). He was followed by David Kimchi (1160-1235). But this was to go contrary to all rabbinic teaching of that day and of the preceding one thousand years. Today, Rashi's view has become dominant in Jewish and rabbinic theology. But that is not the Jewish view. Nor is it the traditional Jewish view. Those closer to the time of the original writings, and who had less contact with the Christian apologists, interpreted it as speaking of the Messiah.\"[7]\n \n \n \n Let's summarize what he is saying: The original Jewish view of over 2000 years ago was that the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 was the Messiah. And further, that until Rashi in the 11th century, it was the ONLY Jewish view, with no exceptions.\n \n \n \n My purpose here is NOT to show why Rashi's view is the correct one and the one based on the Tenach. It is not even to prove that it is really the more ancient one (although it is.) That is for other articles. What I will address here, are three issues:\n \n \n \n 1. Did everyone, without exception, as claimed by Fructenbaum, before Rashi apply it to the Messiah?\n \n 2. Was Rashi the first to present his view that the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 applied to Israel and did not apply to the Messiah?\n \n 3. If this is not the case, then were these sources showing this available to Fructenbaum, and he just ignored those which would contradict his thesis or were they too obscure for him to know of them?\n \n \n \n When one looks at the sources for Fructenbaum's quotations[8] we see that they all come from a work by Driver and Neubauer called \"The Fifty Third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters.\"[9] This has been reprinted under the name \"The Suffering Servant of Isaiah.\"[10] I shall use that work, exclusively, to prove my point. All quotes from rabbinic works appearing here will be their translation.[11]\n \n \n \n Let us first see what Rashi has taught on Isaiah 52:13: [12]\n \n \n \n \"Behold in the later days my servant Jacob, i. e. the righteous who are in him, will prosper.\"\n \n \n \n Rashi goes on to explain all the verses in the context that it refers to the suffering of the righteous and their eventual exaltation in the Messianic Age. What are the proofs brought by Fructenbaum that this view was invented by Rashi? Being the oldest, the first source that Fructenbaum brings is the Targum[13]. He states:\n \n \n \n \"Among the earliest Targums are those of Jonathan ben Uzziel dating from the first century A. D. His Targum on this passage of Isaiah begin with these words: 'Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper...'\"\n \n \n \n His quote from the Targum is fine as far as it goes, but we need to see what the whole Targum states to understand his view. When we do we see a different picture. Here is the translation according to his source, Driver and Neubauer[14]. (I have added in bold the original verses from Isaiah that the Targum is referring to.)\n \n \n \n 52:13 Behold, My servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.\n \n 52:13. Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high, and increase, and be exceeding strong:\n \n \n \n 52:14 According as many were appalled at thee-so marred was his visage unlike that of a man, and his form unlike that of the sons of men-\n \n 52:14. as the house of Israel looked to him during many days, because their countenance was darkened among the peoples, and their complexion beyond the sons of men,\n \n \n \n 52:15 So shall he startle many nations, kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they perceive.\n \n 52:15. so will he scatter many peoples; at him kings shall be silent, and put their hands upon their mouth, because that which was not told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have observed.\n \n \n \n 53:1 'Who would have believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the LORD been revealed?\n \n 53:1. Who hath believed this our glad tidings? and the strength of the mighty arm of the Lord, upon whom as thus hath it been revealed?\n \n \n \n 53:2 For he shot up right forth as a sapling, and as a root out of a dry ground; he had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him.\n \n 53:2. The righteous will grow up before him, yeah, like blooming shoots, and like a tree which sends forth its roots to streams of water will they increase - a holy generation in the land that was in need of him; his countenance no profane countenance, and the terror at him not the terror at an ordinary man; his complexion shall be a holy complexion, and all who see him will look wistfully upon him.\n \n \n \n 53:3 He was despised, and forsaken of men, a man of pains, and acquainted with disease, and as one from whom men hide their face: he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n \n 53:3. Then he will become despised, and will cut off the glory of all the kingdoms; they will be prostrate and mourning, like a man of pains and like one destined for sicknesses; and as though the presence of the Shekhinah had been withdrawn from us, they will be despised, and esteemed not.\n \n \n \n 53:4 Surely our diseases he did bear, and our pains he carried; whereas we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\n \n 53:4. Then for our sins he will pray, and our iniquities will for his sake be forgiven, although we were accounted stricken, smitten from before the Lord, and afflicted.\n \n \n \n 53:5 But he was wounded because of our transgressions, he was crushed because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our welfare was upon him, and with his stripes we were healed.\n \n 53:5. But he will build up the Holy Place, which has been polluted for our sins, and delivered to the enemy for our iniquities; and by his instruction peace shall be increased upon us, and by devotion to his words, our sins will be forgiven us.\n \n \n \n 53:6 All we like sheep did go astray, we turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath made to light on him the iniquity of us all.\n \n 53:6. All we like sheep had been scattered, we had each wandered off on his own way; but it was the Lord's good pleasure to forgive the sins of all of us for his sake.\n \n \n \n 53:7 He was oppressed, though he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb; yea, he opened not his mouth.\n \n 53:7. He prayed, and he was answered, and ere even he had opened his mouth he was accepted; the mighty of the peoples he will deliver up like a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before her shearers; there shall be none before him opening his mouth or saying a word\n \n \n \n 53:8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away, and with his generation who did reason? for he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due.\n \n 53:8. Out of chastisements and punishment he will bring our captives near; the wondrous things done to us in his days who shall be able to tell? For he will cause the dominion of the Gentiles to pass away from the land of Israel and transfer to them the sins which my people have committed.\n \n \n \n 53:9 And they made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich his tomb; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.'\n \n 53:9. He will deliver the wicked into Gehinnom, and those that are rich in possessions into the death of utter destruction, in order that those who commit sin may not be established, nor speak deceits with their mouth.\n \n \n \n 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to crush him by disease; to see if his soul would offer itself in restitution, that he might see his seed, prolong his days, and that the purpose of the LORD might prosper by his hand:\n \n 53:10. But it is the Lord's good pleasure to try and to purify the remnant of his people, so as to cleanse their souls from sin; these shall look on the Kingdom of their Messiah, their sons and their daughters shall be multiplied, they shall prolong their days, and those who perform the Law of the Lord shall prosper in his good pleasure.\n \n \n \n 53:11 Of the travail of his soul he shall see to the full, even My servant, who by his knowledge did justify the Righteous One to the many, and their iniquities he did bear.\n \n 53:11. From the subjection of the nations he will deliver their souls, they shall look upon the punishment of those that hate them, and be satisfied with the spoil of their kings; by his wisdom he will hold the guiltless free from guilt, in order to bring many into subjection to the law; and for their sins he will intercede.\n \n \n \n 53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\n \n 53:12. Then will I divide for him the spoil of many peoples, and the possessions of strong cities shall he divide as prey, because he delivered up his soul to death, and made the rebellious subject to the Law: he shall intercede for many sins, and the rebellious for his sake shall be forgiven\n \n \n \n \n \n I have explained this source in detail in another article[15]. Here we need only look at a few of the Targum's comments and we will see that the picture is different. The Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53 IS NOT the Messiah.\n \n \n \n 52:14. as the house of Israel looked to him during many days, because their countenance was darkened among the peoples, and their complexion beyond the sons of men,\n \n 53:1. Who hath believed this our glad tidings? and the strength of the mighty arm of the Lord, upon whom as thus hath it been revealed?\n \n 53:2. The righteous will grow up before him, yeah, like blooming shoots, and like a tree which sends forth its roots to streams of water will they increase - a holy generation in the land that was in need of him; his countenance no profane countenance, and the terror at him not the terror at an ordinary man; his complexion shall be a holy complexion, and all who see him will look wistfully upon him.\n \n \n \n Here we see that the suffering servant is Israel, and eventually the righteous of Israel become exalted. But this is exactly what Rashi is saying!!! While there are Biblical sources for this, Rashi's primary rabbinic source appears to be the Targum on these verses.\n \n \n \n If you think I am misunderstanding the Targum look at what the Christian missionary scholar Dr. Louis Goldberg writes in his pamphlet 'A Jewish Christian response'[16] where he summarizes what appears in the Targum.[17] He states that \"all the verses which relate to exaltation were applied to a (sic) personal Messiah, while the remainder of the passage relating to suffering was applied to the nation\". Obviously he disagrees with Fructenbaum about the Targum.\n \n \n \n This is pretty devastating to his argument, but there is really much more. While he selectively quotes from rabbinic sources, he ignores those that show him wrong. Let me quote only those in his source[18] where Isaiah 53 is stated as referring to either Israel or the Righteous of Israel.[19]\n \n \n \n The Talmud, Brachos 5a, is one a significant passages in that it uses multiple verses from Isaiah 53, as opposed to a single verse.[20] Here we see that the righteous are meant:\n \n \n \n \"\"Rabba states on the authority of R. S'horah that R. Huna said, The Holy One bruises with chastisement every one in whom he has pleasure, as it is written, 'And the Lord was pleased to bruise him, he made him sick.' It might however be thought, that this was the case even with those who do not accept the chastisement willingly; the words thereafter added, 'If his soul makes a trespass-offering,' for as the 'trespass-offering' implies a knowledge of the sin, so the chastisement to come by the pleasure of G-d ought to be known by the person who has to receive it. When, then, he had received them so, what is his reward? 'He shall see seed, and lengthen days;' and moreover that the study of the law shall be established by his hands, as it is written, 'And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands.'\"[21]\n \n \n \n Then we have the Midrash Rabbah on Deuteronomy:\n \n \n \n \"I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey (Cant. V. I): because the Israelites poured out their soul to die in the captivity, as it is said, 'Because he poured out his soul to die.'\"[22]\n \n \n \n He mentions a single passage in the Zohar[23], but leaves out those many passages which disagree totally with his view.\n \n \n \n \"He began and said, Behold my servant, etc. Happy is the portion of the just, to whom the Holy One reveals the paths of the law for them to walk in...\"[24]\n \n \n \n \"The children of the world are members one of another. When the Holy One desires to give healing to the world, he smites one just man amongst them, and for his sake heals all the rest. Whence do we learn this? From the saying, 'He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised of our iniquities.'\"[25]\n \n \n \n \"At the time when the Holy One desires to atone for the sins of the world, like a physician who to save the other limbs, bleeds the arm, he smites their arm and heals their whole person: as it is write, 'He was wounded for our iniquities,' etc\"[26]\n \n \n \n \"Come, consider the congregation of Israel, how it is called a lamb, as it is said, 'Like a lamb that before her shearers is dumb.' Why was it dumb? Because while the other nations ruled over it, it was deprived of speech and made dumb.\"[27]\n \n \n \n I could go through many of the sources he has used and whether under examination they really prove his point. I will just make one comment about a single one. He states:\n \n \n \n \"Also from the second half of the sixteenth century are the writings of Rabbi Moshe Le Sheich or Al Shech, who was a disciple of Joseph Caro, author of the Shulchan Aruch. He, too, demanded that all Jewish interpreters return to the more traditional interpretation when he wrote: '...our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the King Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view...'\"[28]\n \n \n \n However, the words that follow DIRECTLY after what he has quoted state: \"for the Messiah is of course, David, who was 'anointed' as is well known...\"[29] He then discusses how it applies to David. Later he explains verses 53:9-12 as applying to Moses!!![30] We see that here he has misused this source. A source which actually provides an alternate view to the one he claims.\n \n \n \n Actually Fructenbaum ignored many sources where Isaiah 53 is applied to others besides Israel and the righteous. For example Moses appears in a number of sources like the Talmud[31], Yalqut[32] and Zohar[33]. Saadiah Gaon applied it to Jeremiah[34].\n \n \n \n Some of the sources that he uses can not be used because they do not reflect authentic Rabbinic belief. Yepheth ben 'Ali[35] was a Karaite and not a follower of the Rabbis!!! 'Rabbi' Moshe Kohen Ibn Crispin[36] was not even a Rabbi!!![37]\n \n \n \n With almost ever Rabbi quoted, and with all those he leaves out we see a different picture then the one he is claiming. While this selective ignoring of sources is disturbing the following quote from his book raises some disturbing questions.\n \n \n \n \"The Gospels make it very clear that Jesus' death took the apostles by surprise. Their confusion arose largely because of their lack of knowledge concerning the full program of the Messiah. They had fully expected Jesus to overthrow their enemies and establish His Kingdom on earth. They were very familiar with the prophecies concerning this aspect of the messianic program. What they had failed to grasp was that the Messiah had to come twice: first to suffer, and, then, later to come in victory.\"[38]\n \n \n \n \n \n From whom did the apostles learn their 'erroneous' views of the Messiah? Was it not from the teachers of their times, the Pharisees?? They apparently were not teaching of a Messiah who first suffered and then died. (This can be seen from Bar Kochbah who died and no one ever posited that he was fulfilling the first part of his messianic job by dying.) The gospels themselves don't hide this fact. If that is the case how could the Rabbis have taught that Isaiah 53 is about the first coming of a Messiah who comes and suffers, when they did not teach that the Messiah had to die in the first place? It seems that according to Fructenbaum, this belief was not taught at first, and then the Rabbis started teaching it. Then we have Rashi coming and rejecting this newer teaching of the Rabbis? I think he is very confused here.\n \n \n \n To conclude, is it true as Fructenbaum claimed that, \"All the ancient Jewish writings - the Mishnah, the Gemara, (the talmud), the Midrashim and many others - all regard this portion of Scripture as relating to the Messianic Person.\" NO. We see it applied to Israel and others.\n \n \n \n Is it true as Fructenbaum claimed that: \"Every rabbi prior to Rashi, without exception, viewed this passage as describing Messiah.\" NO. We see that the Targum, the Talmud and Midrash have other subjects for this passage.\n \n \n \n Is it true as Fructenbaum claimed that: \"The first rabbi to suggest otherwise was Rashi, around 1050 A. D.\" NO.\n \n \n \n It is not only false what he has claimed but it can be shown to be false from the very source that he used and quoted from!!\n ",

   "Why Isaiah 53 cannot refer to the nation of Israel, or anyone else, but must be the Messiah \n \n 1. The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\"\n \n 2. The prophet said: \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him.\" Has the awful treatment of the Jewish people (so contrary, by the way, to the teaching of Jesus to love everyone) really been God's pleasure, as is said of the suffering of the servant in Isaiah 53:10 ? If, as some rabbis contend, Isaiah 53 refers to the holocaust, can we really say of Israel's suffering during that horrible period, \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him?\" Yet it makes perfect sense to say that God was pleased to have Messiah suffer and die as our sin offering to provide us forgiveness and atonement.\n \n 3. The person mentioned in this passage suffers silently and willingly. Yet all people, even Israelites, complain when they suffer! Brave Jewish men and women fought in resistance movements against Hitler. Remember the Vilna Ghetto Uprising? Remember the Jewish men who fought on the side of the allies? Can we really say Jewish suffering during the holocaust and during the preceding centuries was done silently and willingly?\n \n 4. The figure described in Isaiah 53 suffers, dies, and rises again to atone for his people's sins. The Hebrew word used in Isaiah 53:10 for \"sin-offering\" is \"asham,\" which is a technical term meaning \"sin-offering.\" See how it is used in Leviticus chapters 5 and 6. Isaiah 53 describes a sinless and perfect sacrificial lamb who takes upon himself the sins of others so that they might be forgiven. Can anyone really claim that the terrible suffering of the Jewish people, however undeserved and unjust, atones for the sins of the world? Whoever Isaiah 53 speaks of, the figure described suffers and dies in order to provide a legal payment for sin so that others can be forgiven. This cannot be true of the Jewish people as a whole, or of any other mere human.\n \n 5. It is the prophet who is speaking in this passage. He says: \"who has believed our message.\" The term \"message\" usually refers to the prophetic message, as it does in Jeremiah 49:14. Also, when we understand the Hebrew parallelism of verse 1, we see \"Who has believed our message\" as parallel to \"to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed.\" The \"arm of the Lord\" refers to God's powerful act of salvation. So the message of the speaker is the message of a prophet declaring what God has done to save his people. \n \n 6. The prophet speaking is Isaiah himself, who says the sufferer was punished for \"the transgression of my people,\" according to verse 8. Who are the people of Isaiah? Israel. So the sufferer of Isaiah 53 suffered for Israel. So how could he be Israel?\n \n 7. The figure of Isaiah 53 dies and is buried according to verses 8 and 9. The people of Israel have never died as a whole. They have been out of the land on two occasions and have returned, but they have never ceased to be among the living. Yet Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.\n \n Answer the arguments this time, preppie? Let's just take the first one:\n \n 1. The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\"\n \n Can't do it, can you?",

However, instead of denying the resurrection, or maintaining the current dogma, Maimonides posited a third way: That resurrection had nothing to do with the messianic era (here in this world) or with Olam Haba (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;) (the purely spiritual afterlife).

Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). \n \n Page Not Found - Chabad.org\n \n The &#8220;Prophet Daniel&#8221; found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n &#8220;Comment: It is interesting to note that every chapter of Daniel is represented in these manuscripts, except for Dan 12. However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that &#8216;it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.&#8217; \n \n \n Was the Book of Daniel originally in the Prophetic Section of the Tenakh? \n \n &#8220;The Book of Daniel would not be out of place in the prophetic section, Joshua, Judges and Kinds are included in the Prophets, and the translators of the Septuagint version of the Jewish Scriptures placed Daniel there also.&#8221; Joseph D. Wilson, &#8220;Did Daniel Write Daniel,&#8221; page 84.\n \n &#8220;&#8230;the present position of the Book (of Daniel) in the Hebrew Canon is not its original position. We have it on the authority of the Jewish historian Josephus that that at the close of the first century A.D. the Canon of the Old Testament books was differently arranged from that at present accepted among the Jews; and it is also evident from the writings of the Early Fathers that a change must have been made in the arrangement of the Jewish Canon between the middle of the third and the end of the fourth century A.D.&#8221; - Charles Boutflower, &#8220;In and Around the Book of Daniel,&#8221; pages 276-277.\n \n Josephus in Contra Apionem 1:8 writes, &#8220;We have but twenty-two (books) containing the history of all time, books that are justly believed in; and of these, five are the books of Moses, which comprise the laws and earliest traditions from the creation of mankind down to his death. From the death of Moses to the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia, successor of Xerxes, the prophets who succeeded Moses wrote the history of the events that occurred in their own time, in thirteen books. The remaining four documents comprise hymns to God and the practical precepts to men.&#8221; \n \n Daniel was included in those 13 books (of the Prophets. \n \n Professor R.D. Wilson states: &#8220;All the direct evidence, then, that precedes the year 200 A.D., supports the view that Daniel was in the earliest times among the Prophets&#8230;..Thus Origen, at A.D. 250, and Jerome, at A.D. 400, both of whom were taught by Jewish Rabbis and claim to have gathered their information from Jewish sources, put Daniel among the Prophets and separate the strictly prophetical books from those which are more properly called historical.&#8221;  R. D. Wilson, &#8220;Studies in the Book of Daniel,&#8221; page 49.\n \n One other important distinction should be noted was that Daniel was not a Prophet in the classical sense associated with Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah &#8211; the classical sense meaning a prophet who&#8217;s sole function was operating as a spiritual mediator between God and a theocratic community (Israel). Daniel had a gift of prophecy, but it was not his appointed office per se. Those books of the Prophets contained Prophets whose main calling was to be a Prophet / Mediator to the people. Daniel was chiefly an administrator over the affairs of the Babylonian government, although he did also have a prophetic gift. And whereas the Torah also was not contained in the Prophetic Books, no one seriously denies that Moses was also considered a Prophet. Likewise, Daniel.\n \n \n What you have to believe if Daniel didn&#8217;t write the Book of Daniel\n \n &#8220;The (critics of Daniel) cannot believe in miracles and predictive prophecy which involve nothing but a simple faith in a wise and mighty and merciful God intervening in behalf of his people for his own glory and their salvation; BUT THEY CAN BELIEVE that a lot of obstreperous and cantankerous Jews who through all their history from Jacob and Esau down to the present time have disagreed and quarreled about almost everything, or nothing, could have accepted, unanimously and without a murmur, in an age when they were enlightened by the brilliant light of Plato&#8217;s philosophy, and Aristotle&#8217;s logic, and the criticism of the schools of Alexandria, a forged and ficticious document, untrue to the well remembered facts of their own experience and to the easily ascertained facts concerning their own past history and the history of the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, and Greeks of whom the author (of the book of Daniel) writes.  R.D. Wilson, Studies in the Book of Daniel, pages 268, 269\n \n &#8220;The Sanhedrin of the second century B.C. was composed of men of the type of John Hyrcanus; men famed for their piety and learning; men who were heirs of all the proud traditions of the Jewish faith, and themselves the sons of successors of the heroes of the noble Maccabean revolt. And yet we are asked to believe (by the critics of Daniel) that these men, with their extremely strict views of inspiration and their intense reverence for their sacred writings&#8230;.used their authority to smuggle into the Jewish Canon a book which, ex hypothesi, was a forgery, a literary fraud, and a religious novel of recent date.&#8221; R.

   "It has to do with the Messiah dying, which matches Isaiah 53. And your 164 to 162 bce dating is horse dung.\n \n \n \n Another lie.\n \n The Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet\n \n Hatach. Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). \n \n Page Not Found - Chabad.org\n \n The \"Prophet Daniel\" found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n \"Comment: It is interesting to note that every chapter of Daniel is represented in these manuscripts, except for Dan 12. However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that 'it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.' \n \n \n Was the Book of Daniel originally in the Prophetic Section of the Tenakh? \n \n \"The Book of Daniel would not be out of place in the prophetic section, Joshua, Judges and Kinds are included in the Prophets, and the translators of the Septuagint version of the Jewish Scriptures placed Daniel there also.\" Joseph D. Wilson, \"Did Daniel Write Daniel,\" page 84.\n \n \"...the present position of the Book (of Daniel) in the Hebrew Canon is not its original position. We have it on the authority of the Jewish historian Josephus that that at the close of the first century A.D. the Canon of the Old Testament books was differently arranged from that at present accepted among the Jews; and it is also evident from the writings of the Early Fathers that a change must have been made in the arrangement of the Jewish Canon between the middle of the third and the end of the fourth century A.D.\" - Charles Boutflower, \"In and Around the Book of Daniel,\" pages 276-277.\n \n Josephus in Contra Apionem 1:8 writes, \"We have but twenty-two (books) containing the history of all time, books that are justly believed in; and of these, five are the books of Moses, which comprise the laws and earliest traditions from the creation of mankind down to his death. From the death of Moses to the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia, successor of Xerxes, the prophets who succeeded Moses wrote the history of the events that occurred in their own time, in thirteen books. The remaining four documents comprise hymns to God and the practical precepts to men.\" \n \n Daniel was included in those 13 books (of the Prophets. \n \n Professor R.D. Wilson states: \"All the direct evidence, then, that precedes the year 200 A.D., supports the view that Daniel was in the earliest times among the Prophets.....Thus Origen, at A.D. 250, and Jerome, at A.D. 400, both of whom were taught by Jewish Rabbis and claim to have gathered their information from Jewish sources, put Daniel among the Prophets and separate the strictly prophetical books from those which are more properly called historical.\"  R. D. Wilson, \"Studies in the Book of Daniel,\" page 49.\n \n One other important distinction should be noted was that Daniel was not a Prophet in the classical sense associated with Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah - the classical sense meaning a prophet who's sole function was operating as a spiritual mediator between God and a theocratic community (Israel). Daniel had a gift of prophecy, but it was not his appointed office per se. Those books of the Prophets contained Prophets whose main calling was to be a Prophet / Mediator to the people. Daniel was chiefly an administrator over the affairs of the Babylonian government, although he did also have a prophetic gift. And whereas the Torah also was not contained in the Prophetic Books, no one seriously denies that Moses was also considered a Prophet. Likewise, Daniel.\n \n \n What you have to believe if Daniel didn't write the Book of Daniel\n \n \"The (critics of Daniel) cannot believe in miracles and predictive prophecy which involve nothing but a simple faith in a wise and mighty and merciful God intervening in behalf of his people for his own glory and their salvation; BUT THEY CAN BELIEVE that a lot of obstreperous and cantankerous Jews who through all their history from Jacob and Esau down to the present time have disagreed and quarreled about almost everything, or nothing, could have accepted, unanimously and without a murmur, in an age when they were enlightened by the brilliant light of Plato's philosophy, and Aristotle's logic, and the criticism of the schools of Alexandria, a forged and ficticious document, untrue to the well remembered facts of their own experience and to the easily ascertained facts concerning their own past history and the history of the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, and Greeks of whom the author (of the book of Daniel) writes.  R.D. Wilson, Studies in the Book of Daniel, pages 268, 269\n \n \"The Sanhedrin of the second century B.C. was composed of men of the type of John Hyrcanus; men famed for their piety and learning; men who were heirs of all the proud traditions of the Jewish faith, and themselves the sons of successors of the heroes of the noble Maccabean revolt. And yet we are asked to believe (by the critics of Daniel) that these men, with their extremely strict views of inspiration and their intense reverence for their sacred writings....used their authority to smuggle into the Jewish Canon a book which, ex hypothesi, was a forgery, a literary fraud, and a religious novel of recent date.\" R. Anderson, Daniel in the Critics Den, pages 104-105\n \n You sure are gullible, Trebor.\n\n \n \n Wow.. don't yhou love pointing to 'page not found'\"\n \n You are such a fraud you know.\n \n Let's look at what your 'BIble and science' says about the book of daniel. You know.. that place you love to quote from all the time.\n \n From IBSS - Biblical Archaeology - Dead Sea Scrolls\n \n \n Daniel and the Dead Sea Scrolls\n \n Scholars believe that the book of Daniel was completed sometime between 167 and 164 BC during the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes.

   "Daniel chapter 9 shatters your theory completely. Verses 25 and 26 actually contain the Hebrew word for Messiah - Mashiyach (Strongs # 4899). It says the Messiah will be 'cut off' (die) AND THEN WAR WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL THE END. So much for your universal peace (show me the universal peace scripture that has the Hebrew word for Messiah in it?). \n \n And before you go on that this is another Christian invention or twisting of scripture, once again Jewish rabbis confirm Daniel chapter 9 is speaking of the Messiah.\n \n In the 12th Century A.D., Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), one of the most respected rabbis in history, said:\n \n \"Daniel has elucidated to us the knowledge of the end times.\n However, since they are secret, the wise (rabbis) have barred\n the calculations of the days of Messiah's coming so that the\n untutored populace will not be led astray when they see that\n end times have already come but there is no sign of the \n Messiah.\"\n \n In addition, Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said regarding the time of the Messiah's coming:\n \n \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have\n not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except\n in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written\n in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\"\n \n In the Targum of the Prophets, in the Tractate Megillah 3a, the Rabbi Jonathan ben Uzziel noted, concerning Daniel's prophecy:\n \n \"The date of the Messiah was foretold in it.\"\n \n Rabbi Elias wrote:\n \n \"The world endures 6000 years; Two thousand before the law\n (before Moses), two thousand with the law and two thousand\n with the Messiah.\" (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 96b - 99a)\n\n \n First I have just two question and an honest answer would be nice.\n \n How many of these Rabbis that you have quoted believe Jesus is the Jewish Messiah?\n \n Which of them in referring to The Messiah mean Jesus?\n \n \n \n Now to other tidbits.\n \n In the 12th century, the preeminent Jewish scholar Maimonides elucidated the core principles of Judaism, writing \"[God], the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity.\"[9]\n \n Some Jewish scholars note that though Jesus is said to have used the phrase \"my Father in Heaven\" (cf. Lord's Prayer), this common poetic Jewish expression may have been misinterpreted as literal.[10]\n \n It should be noted that many well known Kabbalistic mystics called some Biblical figures and Hasidic Tzaddikim \"pure Divinity\", \"God enclothed in a body of a man\", \"first-born son of God\" or even just \"God\". Such statements caused much anger among the opponents of Hasidism and were one of the major reasons of anti-Hasidic antagonism.\n \n For example, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev wrote that Jacob was an aspect of Divinity and was called \"God\" by God Himself, therefore it was appropriate to bow to him.[11] Rabbi Naftali Zvi of Ropshitz wrote that Moses, as well as every true Tzaddik is God, therefore the numerical value of the Hebrew phrase \"Moses, our teacher\" is identical to the expression \"Lord, God of Israel\". According to the Ropshitzer Rebbe, Moses' prayers were identical to the prayers of Shechina, the feminine aspect of God.[12] Rabbi Jacob Koppel Lifshitz, who is revered by the Hasidim as a great pre-Hasidic Kabbalist, wrote that Moses was \"first-born son of God\" and a \"God-man\".[13] Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, also made similar statements about his father-in-law and Tzaddikim in general, which fueled the controversial radical trends in the Chabad Messianism.[14]\n \n However, such statements are just a part of the general acute emanationism or pantheism of the same Hasidic authors, who believed that God is the only true reality of everything, including inanimate matter. In the contrary, many Christians would consider such pantheistic views fundamentally anti-Christian.\n \n a presumed messiah who dies before completing the task (i.e., compelling all of Israel to walk in the way of Torah, repairing the breaches in observance, fighting the wars of god, building the Temple in its place, gathering in the dispersed exiles of Israel) is not the Messiah. Maimonides states, \"But if he did not succeed in all this or was killed, he is definitely not the Moshiach promised in the Torah... and God only appointed him in order to test the masses.\"[17]\n \n Jews believe that the Messiah will fulfill the messianic prophecies of the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel.[18][19][20][21] According to Isaiah, the Messiah will be a paternal descendant of King David[22] via King Solomon.[23] He is expected to return the Jews to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, reign as King, and usher in an era of peace[4] and understanding where \"the knowledge of God\" fills the earth,[5] leading the nations to \"end up recognizing the wrongs they did Israel\".[24] Ezekiel states the Messiah will redeem the Jews.[25]\n \n Therefore, any Judaic view of Jesus per se is influenced by the fact that Jesus lived while the Second Temple was standing, and not while the Jews were exiled. He never reigned as King, and there was no subsequent era of peace or great knowledge. Jesus died without completing or even accomplishing part of any of the messianic tasks, instead promising a second coming. Rather than being redeemed, the Jews were subsequently exiled from Israel. These discrepancies were noted by Jewish scholars who were contemporaries of Jesus, as later pointed out by Nahmanides, who in 1263 observed that Jesus was rejected as the Messiah by the rabbis of his time.[26]\n \n Further, Judaism sees Christian claims that Jesus is the textual messiah of the Hebrew Bible as being based on mistranslations[27][28][29] and Jesus did not fulfill the Jewish Messiah qualifications.\n \n However, not all traditional rabbinical authorities viewed Jesus in negative terms. Maimonides wrote that Jesus helped to \"pave the way\" for the future true Messiah, by introducing the basic concepts of Judaism to Gentiles. Rabbi Jacob Emden considered Jesus a righteous man, who brought the light of faith and morality to the world, but not a Messiah.\n \n [U]Deuteronomy 13:1 states simply, \"Be careful to observe only that which I enjoin upon you; neither add to it nor take away from it[/U\n \n Even if someone who appears to be a prophet can perform supernatural acts or signs, no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Bible\n \n Judaism teaches that salvation or repentance from sin cannot be achieved through sacrifice on another's behalf (\"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin\")[37], and the faith instead focuses on the requirements of personal repentance.[38]\n \n In addition, Judaism focuses on understanding how one may live a sacred life according to God's will in this world, rather than the hope of or methods for finding spiritual salvation in a future one. Judaism views Jews' divine obligation to be living as a \"holy people\" in full accordance with Divine will, as a \"light unto the nations,\" and Judaism does not purport to offer the exclusive path to salvation or \"the one path to God.\" Accordingly, the implications of the Christian conception of Jesus massively diverge from the Jewish worldview.\n \n The name Yeshu (alt: Jeshu, Yeishu, Heb: &#1497;&#1513;\"&#1493;) appears in various works of classical Jewish rabbinic literature including the Babylonian Talmud (redacted roughly before 600 CE) and the classical midrash literature written between 250 CE and 700 CE. Scholars continue to debate the meaning of the name, which has been used as an acronym for the Hebrew expression &#1497;&#1502;&#1495; &#1513;&#1502;&#1493; &#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493; (yemach shemo vezichro - \"May his name and memory be obliterated\").\n \n In all cases of its use, the references are to individuals who (whether real or not) are associated with acts or behaviour that are seen as leading Jews away from Judaism to minuth (a term usually translated as \"heresy\" or \"apostasy\"). Therefore, whether Yeshu equates with \"Jesus\" has historically been a delicate question, as \"Yeshu\" is portrayed in a negative light, and negative portrayals of Jesus in Jewish literature might incite, or be used as an excuse for, antisemitism among some Christians.\n \n Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon) lamented the pains that Jews felt as a result of new faiths that attempted to supplant Judaism, specifically Christianity and Islam. Referring to Jesus, he wrote:\n \n \"Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be Messiah and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by Daniel. So that it was said, \"And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled\" (Daniel 11.14). Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the prophets spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God.\"\n \n Judaism's view of Jesus - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I hope this helps your misunderstanding of history",

Which of them in referring to The Messiah mean Jesus?\n\n \n I honestly have no idea how many, or if any, received Jesus before they died. If they didn't receive him they screwed up royally.\n \n But there are plenty of Jews - i.e. Messianic Jews - who believe in Jesus.\n \n \n\n \n Now to other tidbits (Judaism's view of Jesus)....\n \n ...a presumed messiah who dies before completing the task (i.e., compelling all of Israel to walk in the way of Torah, repairing the breaches in observance, fighting the wars of god, building the Temple in its place, gathering in the dispersed exiles of Israel) is not the Messiah.

It's clear in Isaiah 53 and elsewhere that the Messiah would die and be resurrected and (taking into account the 2nd Coming) complete the remainder of the Messianic prophecies.\n \n \n\n Further, Judaism sees Christian claims that Jesus is the textual messiah of the Hebrew Bible as being based on mistranslations[27][28][29] and Jesus did not fulfill the Jewish Messiah qualifications.\n\n \n More hogwash. I've demonstrated via the Great Isaiah (Dead Sea) Scroll that your translation of Isaiah 53 is the one that's been revised by biased Jewish commentators.\n \n \n[U]Deuteronomy 13:1 states simply, \"Be careful to observe only that which I enjoin upon you; neither add to it nor take away from it[/U\n\n \n Shall we throw out the rest of the Tanakh too?

Jesus is the Jewish Messiah.\n 2. The Jews were judged in his era because they did not recognize their Messiah / God, and rejected him (Luke 19:44, etc.).

The fact is, in Leviticus, Romans, 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy, homosexuality is mentioned in the context of sexual and immoral behavior!

   "Both \"fora\" and \"forums\" are correct.\n \n Speaking of words, I can't help but note that another trademark of theists is their tendency to act like Humpty Dumpty and re-define words to mean what THEY want them to mean, rather than what the words are generally understood to mean, what dictionaries say they mean, or even what the person or persons who coined the words say they mean.\n \n Not to mention their refusal to even consider what the original Hebrew or Greek texts actually said, to consider their historical antecedents, or the context in which they appear. For them, it's perfectly okey-dokey for modern translations to include the word--for example-- \"homosexual\" (first included in 1947, btw), despite the fact that a) it wasn't coined until the late 1800's, and b) bronze-age shepherds, not being behavioral scientists, couldn't have had the least clue about what we understand today about the nature of sexual orientation. \n \n But you see, it fits their anti-gay fundamentalist mindset to ignore the actual translation--what the original words really MEAN (which in this example is vague at best)--and go with an anachronistically modern interpretation that adheres more closely to their personal prejudices.\n\n \n Wow, this very well may be the most ironic post I've ever seen in these fora. It's the very thing this post is talking about that is the basis for the eisegesetic approach of re-reading the scriptures in a way that tries to take out any alluding to same-gender sexual actions. In other words, it is more what those who argue against theists are doing, not the other way around.\n \n And folks, once again, everyone including theists and fundies are well aware the Bible doesn't say the words \"homosexuality\", \"sexual orientation\", \"gay\", etc. Please, stop with that red herring. It's like claiming the Bible never refers to the Holy Spirit or the Son or the Father just because the word \"trinity\" happens to never appear in the text anywhere. We ALL know the Bible doesn't say the word \"homosexuality\" or even refer to it as a state of being. It doesn't change the fact the Bible does discourage same-gender sexual activity. And that IS coming from using language studies.",

   "im not so sure. almost every religious person has been brought up to believe in that one religion, practically everyone who grows up in a strictly religious family will take in the exact beliefs of their parents - religious belief, faith in general revolves around authority and parents to a child are authority figures. the reason religious people have certain prejudice against gays or women or blacks in the first place is because they were raised in a family who believed that sort of thing. i agree that the religious scriptures someone believes conform to the person's character, but thats because they were raised that way. and if you follow the generations back to the first parent to pick up the scripture, he may have been bigotted and found the scripture which justifies his bigotry, but today, very few people choose the religion they believe in, they have it forced upon them in childhood along with the prejudice from authority figures.\n\n \n I think that often happens (a certain religion \"forced\") up to a certain age as kids are in the care of their parents, but in my experience almost everyone goes though a time of questioning of their religion and during that time weighs it against other ideas, reason (yes, reason), other religion, doubt, etc. Sometimes people abandon it sometimes they don't. But it's not fair for those who do abandon it to assume that, just because some don't come to the same conclusions, that they TOO didn't put their religion through that process. \n \n I also think that, if you look more closely, most people don't in fact \"take in the exact beliefs of their parents\" or at least remain in them. Most people's religion is quite a bit different than their parents, and this is the reason that the church today takes a much more socially-conscious approach on, say, the issue of racism. Sure, they may still abide by the central tenets of the religion (the resurrection, the incarnation, etc.) but those aren't moralistic social matters; they're doctrinal ones. And even then, they are sometimes different than their parents'. \n \n Another evidence of this is that religions and churches often change a lot between generations of people. If you could go back in time and look at churches in the 1940s, and churches of today, you'd see many dramatic differences on many issues. That's because the people didn't follow the same exact beliefs of their parents. Even the Catholic church, which prides itself on stable traditions over the centuries is much different than just a few generations ago. (Compare Vatican II with the decades before and you see what I mean.)\n \n One other thing: it's really not fair to lump things like bigotry against women and blacks with this as if that wasn't a central part of this whole question about gay-related issues and society. In other words, that lumping-together is an example of begging the question. Sure, there are elements against gay people that we can ALL agree on are bigoted (like the recent statements of the Arkansas school superintendent for example, or the words of Topeka pastor Fred Phelps) but those are examples fundies themselves often condemn, and certainly theists around the world. In other words, it's unfair to just associate that sort of thing with theism, as if those things are a religious problem. They're not--think about it: some of the most virulently bigoted people are bigoted against religion! (Chris Hitchens, for example. Ironic isn't it, that his very virulence exemplifies the reality that bigotry isn't a 'religion-thing') It's also begging the question and unfair to lump taking a moralistic stand on the morality of same-sex behavior with racism and misogyny. \n \n \nus atheists know of this first hand.\n\n \n Religious people know this first-hand too. Unquestioned dogma is never good, no matter if it's religion, atheistic, or any other take. You're trying to associate religion with lack-of-questioning, and that's an age-old tactic theistic apologists have seen right through for ages.

The unhealthy or innutritious parts are separated, and only the wholesome parts are taken into the system. &#8220;This agrees with all that has since been discovered of the process of digestion and of the support of life. The food taken into the stomach is by the gastric juice converted into a thick pulp called chyme. The nutritious part of this is conveyed into small vessels, and changed into a milky substance called \"chyle.\" This is poured by the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein and mingles with the blood, and conveys nutriment and support to all parts of the system. The useless parts of the food are thrown off.&#8221; (Barnes' Notes)\n \n As for the sentence: (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\")? It simply doesn&#8217;t appear in the original Greek. Jesus is not changing dietary directions here. He is pointing out the process of digestion that separates the wholesome from the unwholesome parts of food. What makes a person unclean or sinful is &#8220;For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man `unclean.'&#8221;\n \n \n Not that it matters, since the dietary restrictions were made for the Jewish people, and Christians aren't Jews.",

Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?\" Thus he declared all foods clean. - Mark 7:18-19\n \n And don't forget - God didn't demolish any seafood restaurants, but he did demolish Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n \n \n Let's look at what Mark says Jesus said, not what Paul wanted Jesus to say. \n \n Notice the story is not about food, but traditions that the Jewish people were becoming obsessed with. To the point that their traditions were becoming more important than God's commandments, putting man made rules before God's.\n \n 1The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and 2saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed. 3(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 4When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.a)\n \n \n So the food is not what is unclean it is their hands and that is what the Jews question Jesus about.\n \n \n 5So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\"\n \n \n Not according to God, but men.\n \n \n 6He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:\n \n \"'These people honor me with their lips,\n \n but their hearts are far from me.\n \n 7They worship me in vain;\n \n their teachings are but rules taught by men.'b\n \n 8You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\"\n \n \n Again nothing about food, but that they are making rules, which is not their place. God gave instructions and they are adding to those as if God forgot or didn't think of it.\n \n \n 9And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observec your own traditions! 10For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,'d and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'e 11But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), 12then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 13Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\"\n \n \n Not about food, but traditions\n \n \n 14Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 15Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'f\"\n \n \n The things that a person does or says is it makes him unclean. Washing your hands is not what causes someone to be righteous, that is just something man made up trying to compete with each other on who is better or saying I have power because you must do as I say because I know God's will (sound familiar)\n \n \n 17After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18\"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? 19For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\")\n \n \n These are the people we are supposed to trust that understood Jesus the best\n \n He doesn't say anything so simple as food at any point only what enters a man from outside (I guess bacteria were not present in Jesus' time) \n \n \n 20He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' 21For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" \n \n Personal responsibility. It isn't everything external that makes people do these things, it is from themselves that they act in these ways. So having something like dirty hands doesn't make you a sinner (try telling mom that) and washing them thinking it makes you more righteous is what comes out of you and is against God.\n \n I am pressed for time so I breezed thru this the explanation is really much longer, but this is the best that time will permit",

   "Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n 2 \"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 4 \"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 5 \"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 8 \"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9 Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11 \"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 `Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13 \"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14 \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \n \n \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" \n \n Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14\n \n Let the WISE understand and receive Jesus Christ.\n \n emoticon_xagree",
