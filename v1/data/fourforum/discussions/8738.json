   "You first need a few handy facts.\n \n 1 - Crimes commited with guns is a meaningless statistic. If X people are killed, then X people are killed, and it doesn't matter if they were shot, or beaten to death with a high-heeled shoe.\n \n 2 - Gun laws were tightened in England and Australia in 1996.\n \n After we absorb those two facts, we can then look at rates of reported crime:\n \n http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page39.asp\n \n http://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/violence.html\n \n By which we can see that rates of violent crime (including assault, homicide and sexual assault) have either remained constant, or actually increased despite the expensive gun buy-back schemes.",

   "I have attempted to provide some statistics to show more guns does not equal more gun deaths here: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=204332#post204332\n \n \n But I would also counter with the emotional side of the issue that gun right's supporters often fail to consider. You will likely have horrifying statistics of gun deaths in America thrown at you. Don't give up the emotional side of the debate without a fair fight. When the opponent suggests it is too dangerous for us to have firearms, ask whether the black men in Mississippi during reconstruction who were lynched would have agreed. Ask your opponent to speculate what they would have said about the virtue of the gun control law which ordered \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865)? Would they agree that it was better for them to have gone unarmed from their beds in the night to confront roaming bands of racist whites? And I would take it further.\n \n I would ask your opponent if he remembers the millions of unarmed peasants who were murdered in Russia by Stalin's forced collectivization? Does he remember the millions of dead in Auschwitz and other similar camps? Does he remember the millions of dead lying in the killing fields of Cambodia? Does he remember the mass graves filled with the unarmed victims of \"ethnic cleansing\" in the Balkans? I would ask him if he believes those victims would agree with him that it was better to have been unarmed. \n \n If you do so, then I expect you will get a smug reply that in America today we are more enlightened than those before us. If so, then let them lie to themselves all they want. But ask them whether they really accept such a gratifyingly false belief that we have evolved beyond petty lusts for power over our fellow man--that we have ended the vices of envy, greed, anger, hatred, revenge, and racism. Then I would tell them that such a view is pure fantasy, and that it has no more founding in reality than that form of government envisioned as Plato's utopia. \n \n And of course your opponent may also seek to dismiss the history of our nation's founding on the grounds that what a bunch or dead white men said over 200 years ago means nothing to the problems they think you face today. I would respond by saying that tyrants would say the same of \"the right of the people\" to free speech, press, and to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. So I would challenge them to go ahead and carry forward their encouragement of others to use their logic to undermine portions of the Bill of Rights they might hold dear. \n \n I would tell them our founding fathers could not have imagined the scale of genocide perpetrated by governments in the last century against their unarmed citizens. But I argue that they had a clear understanding of the avarice of unchecked rulers, and they had a healthy respect for the right of self defense against state-sponsored oppression. I would say that they believed, as Noah Webster stated, that \"The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888). \n \n And would tell them that the founder's knowledge of the right of self defense was not limited to that exercised against governments. I would tell them they understood the right of private self defense, a right each and every one of us has against individual violence. And I would say they knew, as Thomas Paine stated, that \"the supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property.\" Thomas Paine, Thoughts on Defensive War, 1775. I Writings of Thomas Paine at 56 (1894). \n \n I would tell them the Second Amendment merely reflects this wisdom. I would tell them the freedom of speech that allows them to call for the abolition or unreasonable restriction of privately held arms is protected by the very right to keep and bear arms they disparage. \n \n Finally, if they want to ban guns, then I would say this: You have deluded yourself into believing that a ban on guns would equal a ban on violence, that that if you take away the gun the motive to harm another would evaporate. You allow your fear to consume any wisdom and sense of justice you may possess, and lacking these qualities you justify to yourself a right to demand that the innocent should suffer for the crimes of the wicked.",

   "You dont need statistics. Because, lets say, when there is gun control there is violent crime. That suggests that if gun control didnt harbor violent crime then it would be OK. Possesing guns is a Right that cannot be taken away, no matter how unsafe society may be.",
