The current administration and its rubber stamp congess are solely responsible for the largest expansion in federal spending EVER with the exception of during WWII. They have even expanded federal spending more quickly than it expanded during WWI. \n\n \n So the current conservative administration isn't conservative enough, so the solution is to replace it with far left liberals? If there is an outbreak of Malaria, an emotional action may be to stock all nearby bodies of water with mosquito larva, but it wouldn't do much to solve the problem, would it? Reason, not emotion, are the best ways to deal with both these types of issues. Hopefully, at least some voters will do that. \n \n The events that happened during the current administration have to be taken into consideration when criticizing it for spending. I take it that you believe WWII was a good reason for much spending. More people were killed on 9/11/01 than were killed at Pearl Harbor. Hurricane Katrina was a far worse disaster than anything that happened in several past Democrat administrations. An emotional, anti Republican bias may tell us that a Democrat administration would have been far more responsible with taxpayer money concerning hurricane relief, or with national security concerning terrorism, but past experience and common sense don't tell us that. \n \n I agree that things like the Medicare prescription drug plan were too expensive, but that type of spending is a small percentage of all that was spent, and would have been spent by even a Democrat administration, considering the uncontrollable events that happened. And how does this prescription plan compare to all the safety and environmental spending that didn't happen, that would have happened under Democrats? \n \n \n \n \nThe idea that the evil democrats are going to cut off Iraq spending and shut it all to social programs also flies in the face of recent actions by that party. \n\n \n What actions were those?\n \n \nClinton is the only president in 30 years that balanced the budget, and there was a \"D\" after his name. \n\n \n Congress holds the purse strings, not the president. Clinton had the 'election of 94' Republicans, fresh and at least somewhat uncorrupted, to help him along with budget balancing. The current congress isn't quite as fresh and uncorrupted as that one was, but is still better than what Reagan had. \n \n \nSo, you advocate sticking with the folks who are responsible for record spending expansion and government expansion, becuase the other guys MIGHT spend the same amount of money, only spend it here at home helping our own citizens ratehr than abroad killing people and making us less safe? \n\n \n Yes. I take it by the part I highlighted above that you think domestic spending and meddling automatically \"helps our citizens\". Does an increase in the minimum wage help our citizens, help our economic situation? Would a higher minimum wage make an economic crash easier, or harder to cope with? In the event of an economic crash, do you think the Democrats will spring into action to eliminate, or reduce a minimum wage? \n \n \nEven if your \"nightmare\" scenario comes to pass, and they end up killing off all Iraq spending, and start spending the same amount of money at home on social programs, as far as I am concerned, we will STILL be miles ahead of where the current bunch of jackasses has put us. \n\n \n That is a main talking point of far left, liberal Democrats, yes. \n \n \n \nThe current crop has spent trillions on a war with another country that has BROUGHT US NO GAIN AT ALL AND INCREASED DEANGER TO THE US. They spent trillions of dollars to screw up. If the othe bunch wants to spend the same trillions of dollars to feed the poor, I can live with that. \n\n \n So can Howard Dean, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, and middle east terrorist leaders. \n \n \n While I do not generally support increased social spending (primarily because so much of it is wasted) I woudl rather have that money doing something potentially useful here at home, rather than doing things detrimental to our safety abroad.\n\n \n So ALL social spending is potentially useful?\n \n What bothers me the most is that the losses that Republicans sustain tomorrow will be taken by many as a sure sign that U.S. citizens favor a big cut and run in Iraq, and renewed fears of global warming. It will actually be nothing more than a typical U.S. election. \n \n ~The average first midterm election loss for every elected president since 1914 is 27 House seats and three Senate seats. The average sixth-year midterm election, like this year, is much worse for the president's party, which typically loses 34 seats in the House and six seats in the Senate.~\n \n We'll see how tomorrows sixth year midterm elections go compared to averages in the past, and how our unbiased friends at Reuters and the NY Times reports them.",

From the earliest moments of the investigation, O'Neill was sure Bin Laden was responsible. \n \n However, from the start, his efforts to work the case were sabotaged by US ambassador to Yemen, Barbara Bodine. Bodine refused to cooperate in the investigation or to encourage Yemenis to cooperate. Despite repeated death threats against agents, she refused to allow them to carry the type of weapons O'Neill considered adequate. O'Neill reportedly called Louis Freeh in the middle of the night once expressing anxiety about the safety of his men. The clash between O'Neill and Bodine went steadily from bad to worse, peaking when Bodine publicly called O'Neill a liar. Incredibly, Bodine claimed that through her actions, she was merely trying to keep diplomatic relations running smoothly. \n \n But a look at Ms. Bodine's history suggests a very different motivation.

From six years at a ringside viewing seat, I'd say nothing could be farther from that regardless of political affiliation. This group is morally and fiscally corrupt from top to bottom.\n\n \n I think the problem is that people are finally waking up to the fact that spending decades in Washington causes one to lose one's soul to the highest bidder.\n I don't hold out any hopes of things changing with the Dems in control. It's just a reshuffling of the deck chairs on the Titanic. It's an exercise in futility.\n True accountability to the people will only come when Congress is continuously auditted from outside of the Beltway. Follow the money, watch the actions. emoticon_xgood",

It's just that the public of the 7th got so sick and tired of liberal republicans lying that they threw the whole lot of them out.\n \n What amuses me is that you run away the second someone brings up the issue of liberal republicans, your own party has embraced the ideology you criticize",

There is a huge difference between winning because your agenda has power and winning because your opponent is so grossly unethical and incompetent that you win because the electorate is sick of them. The Democrats have to know they have no mandate. However you have to remember that several of those elections with relatively small vote advantages were won in states with small populations. A 2,500 vote victory in Montana may seem slim, but not when you consider the voting population. Now a 5,000 vote win in New York is essentially razor thin.",
