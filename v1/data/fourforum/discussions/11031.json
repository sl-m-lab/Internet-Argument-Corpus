   "Let's look at this is a logical manner. The \"well regulated militia\" argument is a completely dead subject, and anybody who tries to argue it is without mental standing.\n \n The argument that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is directly contingent upon the people's service in the militia is completely illogical. If you're not allowed to own guns unless you serve in the militia, but you can't serve in the militia without guns, how can you own guns in the first place? This is a chicken or the egg position that is doomed to failure.\n \n Let's say that if people couldn't buy their own guns for militia duty then it's the job of the government to step up and take on the task of outfitting the militia with arms for service. This is completely illogical. Let's say that it's determined that the militia referred to in the Second Amendment truly is all able-bodied citizens of a certain age and without a criminal record. Let's say that the number of people that can qualify as member of the militia is a conservative 65% of the American population. That's 195 million people that must be outfitted with government purchased firearms. \n \n If the government sees fit to only supply sidearms and service rifles, the M4 carbine costing approximately $1,600 each, and the M9 pistol costing about $600 each, that's a total of $2,200 the government will be required to spend for each of those 195 million individuals, meaning that to outfit the militia the government will need to spend that would be approximately $4.3 TRILLION! Just supplying the service weapons to the militia would be more expensive than the annual funding bill of the War in Iraq. And that doesn't factor in training or ammunition cost or anything else, that's just for the guns themselves.\n \n Further making the \"well regulated militia\" argument completely illogical, is the supposed belief that anybody who fails to fall in for regular training or take part in deployment would lose their right to own guns. This position basically states that the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is meaningless and can be violated at anytime.\n \n The entire first part of the Second Amendment is directly contingent on the second part of the Second Amendment being upheld, meaning that the militia is entirely dependant on the ability of American citizens to freely own guns, meaning that gun control laws directly harm the militia and are a crime against America.\n \n Even further making the entire argument without basis is the notion that the Founding Fathers of America would institute a way of granting the government power, while at the exact same time wording this power into a list of rights the citizens are to enjoy that the government can't infringe upon. This means that the Bill of Rights sets limits on governmental power, while at the same time giving it the power to control people as it sees fit.",

   "A plain reading of the text implies that the purpose of the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain the militia.\n \n \n You have it exactly backwards . . . The militia can only be maintained and remain a viable force to support the security of the nation if the pre-existing right of the citizen to keep and bear arms forever remains inviolate. \n \n To quote a esteemed constitutional commentator approved by the Supreme Court (and cited in US v Millerin its famous footnote 3):\n [*]\"It may be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms, and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.\" -- Thomas M. Cooley, The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America (1891)\n To remain consistent with its prior determinations regarding the right to keep and bear arms the Supreme Court will certainly uphold the lower court (I predict 9-0) and one can only hope that the hydra of all your illegitimate anti-gun interpretations will finally be slain with a thoroughly encompassing opinion.\n \n \nI know the gun nuts like to use the constitution to avoid having to argue the merits of their case but it just doesn't fly.\n\n \n I have no problem using the constitution to support my position and furthermore, I can promise the added benefit of my arguments being in alignment with the fundamental principles the founders embraced such as equal rights and equal standing before government and most importantly, the purely American maxim of \"all not conferred is retained\" by the people.\n \n See, you proudly claim exactly where your incorrect interpretation comes from, \"a plain reading.\" Detaching the text from the principles it is rooted in often results in the misconstructions you proclaim; applying modern definitions to the lexicon of the founders only forces more egregious perversions.\n \n The collective right side's \"interpretations\" can not pass muster upon inspection of the fundamental principles . . . To argue that there is only a select corps of government approved and enrolled arms bearers and the common citizen is purposefully excluded from the protections of a provision of the Bill of Rights is a proposition too absurd to even consider. \n \n Keep reading that Cooley exposition until it sinks in for it directly addresses and refutes your ignorant \"plain reading.\" \n \n Your \"plain reading,\" devoid of any reference to establishing principle, permits you to construct \"an interpretation not warranted by the intent\" of the provision.\n \n Good luck with that . . .",

   "The entire \"well regulated\" discussion is an unnecessary diversion forced to the forefront by the anti-gun side's complete ignorance of the lexicon of the founders and their obstinate refusal to even consider what words meant back then. Their resistance to accepting that the definition of \"regulated\" (as used in the 2nd Amendment), has nothing to do with legislative regulations, is based in their progressive nature; it is just abhorrent to them that an obsolete definition controls the meaning. It also is an indictment of the \"living constitution\" school of thought, that the document means whatever the people think it means NOW . . . \n \n My position is that the word \"regulate[d]\" has alternate meanings; granted, the ones I am claiming are obsolete now but they certainly were in common use and enjoyed a universal understanding in the Revolutionary period through the first half of the 19th century. \n \n The acquisition of a comprehensive dictionary is important to this discussion because once we agree that regulate[d] has a specific and differentiated meaning when used to describe the condition of military corps, we can examine contemporaneous usage examples and apply critical thinking skills tempered with intellectual honesty, not political ideology.\n \n The Random House College Dictionary (1980) gives four definitions for the word \"regulate.\"[*]regulate1) To control or direct by a rule, principle, method, etc. \n \n 2) To adjust to some standard or requirement as for amount, degree, etc. \n \n 3) To adjust so as to ensure accuracy of operation. \n \n 4) To put in good order. [obs.]b. Of troops: Properly disciplined. [Obs. rare] The past tense, \"regulated\" would then describe the performance / function of the troops after their training, displaying \"good order\" and \"proper discipline.\" \n \n So, as used in the 2nd Amendment, describing the militia, \"well regulated\" has nothing to do with any law or regulation. To be clear, I am not to saying that regulations can not be written for the militia; just that the -authority to write- or the -demand they be written- or the -demand that the citizens who make up the militia must be strictly \"regulated\" by law- is not conveyed by the term, \"well regulated\" as used in the 2nd Amendment.\n \n BECAUSE\n \n \"Well regulated\" as used in the 2nd Amendment or when discussing military corps in general is an assessment of their function as a fighting unit and a characterization of their preparedness for battle; it means nothing more than said corps are in operational order and condition. \n \n When one is reading the 2nd Amendment and you arrive at \"well regulated,\" substituting \"properly functioning\" would preserve perfectly the correct context, meaning and intent of the declarative clause of the 2nd Amendment.\n \n When discussing the meaning of \"well regulated\" I find it interesting to ask a simple question: \n \n What is the antonym of \"well regulated?\" \n \n What term conveys to you, a concept in complete opposition to what \"well regulated\" means to you? \n \n For me, that term is \"ill regulated.\" \n \n The definition of \"ill regulated\" is without dispute and exists free of any kind of politically motivated misconstruction or redefining. \"Ill regulated\" is a characterization assigned to troops not equipped properly, who demonstrate substandard military discipline and whose general condition renders them unfit for battle. \"Ill regulated\" has been used for centuries to describe such substandard military condition and readiness and amazingly, it just chugs quietly along under the political radar, being used in modern times just like it was in the 1600's.\n \n \"Ill\" being the antonym of \"well,\" I think it makes perfect sense.",

   "If the right to keep and bear arms is not for the purpose of the militia, why is the militia mentioned at all? \n\n \n Your premise begins from an incorrect foundation. The individual citizen's right to keep and bear arms is not granted, given, created, conferred or otherwise established by the 2nd Amendment. The Supreme Court has said that the citizen's right to arms is not dependent in any way on the Constitution for its existence. \n \n If the right exists without any reference to the 2nd, how can the words and construction of the 2nd have any impact on the scope or exercise of the right? No power was ever granted to government to impact the private arms of the individual citizen, so none exists. \n \n All the 2nd Amendment does is redundantly forbid the federal government to exercise powers it does not possess.\n \n \nFast forward to today, the militia is no longer necessary or sufficient for national defence, the US has one of the most expensive armed forces in the world, and can project force far beyond its borders in a manner never imagined in 1776. It also has a semi-professional and centrally equipped defence force in the national guard.\n\n \n Back in the Federalist series of articles explaining the powers of the proposed constitution, Madison put forth ratios of \"total numbers of souls\" and the nation's carrying capacity of \"standing army.\" Madison said the standing army could not feasibly number more than 1% of the total population. For this discussion he also made some statements regarding militia (remember, this is 1788, before the Constitution was ratified).\n \n In the lexicon of the founders militia were considered to be every male capable of bearing arms and capable of working in concert; that was the only criteria. Madison put the number of the militia at about 20% of \"the whole number of souls.\" Back then with a total population of about 3 million souls he considered the militia to number roughly 600,000 people (minus the 25-30,000 in the \"standing army'). Madison acknowledged that the mass of citizens actually having \"arms in their hands\" numbered only 500,000, . . . Remember, you only needed to be CAPABLE of bearing arms, I guess the 70,000 or so citizens without a gun would need to borrow one from their neighbor if events required action. \n \n If we were to run his ratios today we find that they remain spot on! Active and reserve military number about 2.9 million, 1% of our current population of 300,000,000 +/- and with an estimated 65 million gun owners we have bettered Madison's 220 year old ratios by a couple percentage points. That's no surprise, Americans are a bunch of wacky gun-nuts after all!\n \n Madison's point was that he envisioned any \"standing army\" being outnumbered (\"opposed\" was the word he used) by armed citizens by a factor of 17 to 1; in present day America that ratio may have widened to as much as 25 to 1 (if upper estimates of the number of gun owners are to be accepted). \n \n A side note just to put some perspective on things:\n \n Estimates of the number of Iraqi insurgents in 2006 ranged between 8000-20,000 (US) up to 40,000 (Iraqi intelligence). With 160,000 troops in country our guys enjoyed at worst a 4 to 1 advantage and at best a 20 to 1 advantage. And in the opinion of many we were losing . . . and losing bad. \n \n Imagine if there were 2.8 million insurgents (Madison's 17-1 ratio) and many of them were completely familiar with American military weapon platforms and endeavored to seize and offensively use those weapons instead of just blowing themselves up? How about if there were 4 million insurgents (25-1 ratio of present America)? \n \n While the founders did not envision every person being armed they certainly desired a significant percentage to be properly situated to resist with violence. That is the condition they intended to preserve with the enactment of the 2nd Amendment. \n \n \nFinally, who cares what the founders of the US meant? They were not beings endowed with God-like powers of perception and wisdom.\n\n \n I care and many other citizens care. I personally do not believe it is a good idea to discard the rules that constrain government's power.\n \n Can't we just accept that the amendment is archaic and argue the point on reason and evidence?\n\n NO because I fear your \"reason and evidence\" will be neither logical, reasonable nor compelling; only dangerous to liberty.",

   "Alright, I'm gonna have some fun with this one...\n \n \nIf the right to keep and bear arms is not for the purpose of the militia, why is the militia mentioned at all?\n\n \n Here's the thing, that's not even the issue at hand. You like to make it the argument but it's really not. If the RKBA really was connected to the militia then only select arms would be protected for ownership. \n \n Back in colonial days there were only two types of longarms, the smoothbore musket and the rifled musket. Each one was available with varying barrel lengths anywhere from 26\" to 36\", with calibers ranging from the small .36 all the way up to the massive .75 caliber, with a few specimens actually having a 1\" bore. Now with all these calibers and configurations available it could create problems for drilling and actual use. If the RKBA really was all about the miltia then certain requirements would be spelled out to eliminate possible supply issues, like a requirement to only own smoothbore muskets with maximum .58 caliber size and 32\" barrel, since this is what most historians say was used during those times. That would mean you could own this type of firearm, but no other at all since they were never mentioned in the use of the militia. No pistols, no blunderbusses, no double barreled muskets, just one select breed. And if that were the case the .58 caliber would be the only model to ever exist in colonial times. But it wasn't.\n \n How exactly do you explain so many models being made, bought and sold by everybody, if only one specific model was ever to be used for the militia and thus only one model was ever to observe protection of the Second Amendment?\n \n If the RKBA was solely about ensuring that the militia could still function then firearms selection laws would truly be interesting. Walk into a gunstore wanting to buy a Marlin 336 lever-action rifle, get told that you can't own one since it's not on any checklist of militia equipment, then informed that you can either own an M14 SOCOM or an M16A3 rifle since they're recognized as militia firearms.\n \n The RKBA-Militia argument is really destructive to the gun control argument. If the RKBA was about supplying militia members were specific arms that means everybody who buys a gun would have to buy high-capacity magazines that can hold 30 rifle rounds, it would be a crime to deny sale of armor piercing ammunition or .50 BMG rifles or anything like that. That would mean bans on \"assault weapons\" would be unconstitutional because they violate the miltia clause of the Second Amendment.\n \n Hell, if you wanna argue that the Second Amendment was solely about keeping the miltia armed, that would be an argument FOR the lawful ownership of machineguns and automatic rifles. That would mean the machinegun importation ban of 1968 and the machinegun manufacture ban on 1986 would be illegal and have to be overturned.\n \n \nAt the time of the amendment, there was no intention for the US to maintain a standing army, the militia was to be the first and only line of defence, much as the yeomanry of England or the clansmen of Scotland had been historically.\n\n \n And the significance of thie sentence is...what?\n \n \nTherefore it was necessary for them to keep weapons in order to be proficient in their use.\n \n \n This sentence is confusing. Since in the colonial era only men were enrolled in the militia, does that mean that women had no right to bear arms? When someone was retired from the militia due to age does that mean that they were no longer able to bear arms? Is the right dependant on age and gender then?\n \n That would basically mean that the Founding Fathers were sexist and age discriminatory in their views and what they were doing.\n \n \nFast forward to today, the militia is no longer necessary or sufficient for national defence, the US has one of the most expensive armed forces in the world, and can project force far beyond its borders in a manner never imagined in 1776.\n\n \n So much for not tolerating standing armies during times of peace.\n \n Here's another fact for you. Troop levels are at an all time low. The war in the Middle East has taken a huge toll on our armed forces and they're spread way too thin, and new ones are becoming hard to get. If we were ever attacked on our own soil by a mobilized foreign organization it might just come down to regular people like me armed with whatever we've got to repel them. The army sure can't be pulled out of Iraq and redeployed in America to deal with whomever is on the warpath, not with the necessity of being in the Middle East and the current number of troops.\n \n Also another fact. While it's no longer 1776 and the militia is no longer the first and foremost defense of the state, that doesn't mean it's outdated. I don't need any arugment supporting that the right to free speech or the right to trial by an impartial jury are out of date and no longer relevant since it's not 1776 anymore.\n \n \nIt also has a semi-professional and centrally equipped defence force in the national guard.\n\n \n There's the standing army during times of peace again...\n \n \nFinally, who cares what the founders of the US meant?\n \n \n Everybody, that's who! Every side of the aisle is aruging what the Founding Fathers meant when they wrote the Second Amendment. Even the anti-gun side cares about what the meaning is, just so long as they can make it say what they want it to say.\n \n Keep in mind, if the Founding Fathers were wrong in one amendment they could easily be wrong in every other one as well.\n \n \nThey were not beings endowed with God-like powers of perception and wisdom.\n\n \n This is true. They were just regular people like you and me, armed with the best education that was possible back then. However this doesn't mean that a somewhat ambiguous sentence is incorrect or a typo or a hiccup. It was put there for a reason and it must be observed.\n \n Nobody seems to question their intelligence when they drafted the First Amendment...\n \n \nCan't we just accept that the amendment is archaic and argue the point on reason and evidence?\n\n \n I'm honestly amazed anytime somebody actually has the audacity to write something like this, I really am.\n \n Well princess, if you wanna argue that then you're going to have to prove a counterargument to how the other nine amendments in the Bill of Rights AREN'T archaic and still deserve to remain in place when the second is stripped as being meaningless in this day and age.\n \n All amendment were written within the same timeframe, within the same year by the same people. There's no protecting in the Bill of Rights that would allow for one amendment to be determined archaic while all others must be determined as relevant to today's society and necessary in ensuring that the government keep from growing too big. If the second can be determined to be out of date then why would any of the others really be anymore relevant?\n \n Seriously, if nobody needs guns then does anybody really need to practice religion since we can't talk about God at school or observe prayer vigils? Do you really need to speak freely when complaining about the government? Do you really need an attorney when facing a trial, afterall you wouldn't be on trial for something unless you were obviously guilty were you? You don't need protection from double jeapordy now do you? The police don't really need a warrant before they can search your home, do they, it's not like you have anything to hide...do you?",

   "Here are some of my thoughts (again) on the militia clause and the individual/collective right debate. Agree or disagree as you will....\n \n Our Constitution was born from a process of compromise between competing principles. The power to raise a standing army in time of need competed with the preference for reliance on militias: \"that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" (Constitution of Virginia, June 6, 1776). \n \n Now look for a moment at the federal Constitution's broad grant of Congressional authority over both a standing army and the state militias (Art. I sec. 8):\n \n To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n To provide and maintain a navy;\n To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\n \n Consider also the proposed power of the president over both the army and the militias (Art. II sec. 2):\n \n The President shall be the commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States....\n \n Note that all of the state constitutions of the time maintained a public policy preference for militias over standing armies-while the federal Constitution was silent on this issue. Anti-federalists would not let the issue rest: \n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n The militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment-A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state-is in reality nothing more than a restatement of this principle. \n \n How then do we best reach that goal? This was a question for our founders. A tremendous point of contention with the proposed federal Constitution was the grant of authority to congress over the militias. Hamilton argued that if you wanted to see this public policy goal become reality you must give Congress the power to make the militias a credible alternative to a standing army, including the ability to prescribe uniform arms, training, and discipline: \n \n \"This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress.\" Alexander Hamilton, Federalist #29.\n \n This is a key point to consider in the individual/state's right debate. If the 2nd. Amendment was intended to create a state's right, then by its very nature it destroys an efficient system of singular uniformity in favor of permitting the several states to arm their militias as they pleased, even to the point of making their weapons and equipment incompatible with one another. Such a system would serve only to encourage Congress to establish and rely upon a standing army. \n \n Uniformity aside, however, a particular anti-federalist fear was that a federal tyrant might corrupt the militia. Hamilton ridiculed this fear and claimed the power of the states to appoint officers would prevent that fear from becoming reality: \n \n \"What reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the sole and exclusive appointment of the officers? If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.\" Id.\n \n But there was an even more serious rub for anti-federalists: Congress can create a standing army and then completely disarm the state militias simply by refusing to exercise its exclusive power to arm, train, and discipline them: \n \n \"Let me here call your attention to that part which gives the Congress power 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States - reserving to the states, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' By this, sir, you see that their control over our last and best defense is unlimited. If they neglect or refuse to discipline or arm our militia, they will be useless: the states can do neither - this power being exclusively given to Congress. The power of appointing officers over men not disciplined or armed is ridiculous; so that this pretended little remains of power left to the states may, at the pleasure of Congress, be rendered nugatory.\" Patrick Henry, Speech of June 5, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, beginning page 199, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum. \n \n The federalist response contains another key point to understanding the individual/state's right debate-it does not matter if Congress refuses to exercise its power to arm the militias because the public already enjoys an individual RKBA which will be an adequate check against a federal tyrant. Consider the following example: \n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n See here also federalist James Madison (the author of the 2nd. Amendment) note the armed populace advantage:\n \n \"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation. . . .Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. . . .\" James Madison, The Federalist Papers # 46, reprinted at pages 294-300 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter. (Note: edited out are portions of Madison's address which further emphasis another key for him to preventing centralized federal tyranny-the residual authority of the states over the militias)\n \n Again, the reality of a pre-existing individual RKBA is critical to understanding where the 2nd. Amendment places the right. In addition to proclaiming the preference for militias over standing armies, the amendment was intended to deny Congress a monopoly over the true badges of liberty. The founders could have done so in one of two ways:\n \n 1. They could have given concurrent power to the states to arm their militias, or\n 2. They could have recognized and protected the established individual RKBA.\n \n The idea of the states holding concurrent power had been discussed during the original Constitutional debates. Consider Patrick Henry again, as he questioned the possibility of an implied concurrent power: \n \n \"May we not discipline and arm them, as well as Congress, if the power be concurrent? so that our militia shall have two sets of arms, double sets of regimentals, &c.; and thus, at a very great cost, we shall be doubly armed. The great object is, that every man be armed. But can the people afford to pay for double sets of arms, &c.? Every one Who is able may have a gun. But we have learned, by experience, that, necessary as it is to have arms, and though our Assembly has, by a succession of laws for many years, endeavored to have the militia completely armed, it is still far from being the case. When this power is given up to Congress without. limitation or bounds, how will your militia be afraid? You trust to chance; for sure I am that that nation which shall trust its liberties in other hands cannot long exist. If gentlemen are serious when they suppose a concurrent power, where can be the impolicy to amend it? Or, in other words, to say that Congress shall not arm or discipline them, till the states Shall have refused or neglected to do it? This is my object. I only wish to bring it to what they themselves say is implied. Implication is to be the foundation of our civil liberties; and when you speak of arming the militia by a concurrence of power, you use implication. But implication will not save you, when a strong army of veterans comes upon you. You would be laughed at by the whole world, for trusting your safety implicitly to implication.\" Patrick Henry Speech of June 14, 1778.\n \n Problems arise, however, from having concurrent authority. In the same speech Henry noted that if the powers are concurrent, then what would prevent Congress from claiming concurrent power to appoint officers? Concurrent power was the path of confusion, and I argue that to deny the monopoly to Congress the founders instead chose to recognize what they already knew existed-the individual RKBA.\n \n Other writers here have described the founders to be \"wordsmiths.\" I don't disagree with that assumption. Had the founders desired to grant concurrent power to the states to arm their militias, then the Amendment would have read something like \"the states shall have the power to arm their militias independent of the Congress.\" We know, however, that the Amendment reads \"the right of the people.\" \n \n Consider the advantages for a moment of this plain reading of this text-the individual citizen's RKBA. One the one hand, it does nothing to alter the efficiency of Congress' power to create a uniform militia system (and hopefully thereby rendering a standing army unnecessary), while on the other hand it insures Congress cannot remove the check (an armed populace) that Webster and others argued would be a sufficient defense against a federal tyrant. It's not a perfect solution by any means, but as Tench Coxe noted, it was the one which was chosen:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (Emphasis added).\n \n ---\n \n \"On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.\" Thomas Jefferson, The Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].\n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . .\" Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).",

   "A plain reading of the text implies that the purpose of the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain the militia. This suggests a system akin the swiss, where guns must be kept secured at home except when training or in the event of an invasion. I know the gun nuts like to use the constitution to avoid having to argue the merits of their case but it just doesn't fly.\n\n Nope. A plain reading of the text, along with total confirmation in the writings of the founders, STATES, not \"implies\", that the purpose of the right to keep and bear arms is so individuals (\"the people\") can keep and bear arms. It suggests nothing like what you say it does. You couldn't be more wrong.",
