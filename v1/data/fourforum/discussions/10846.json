   "I heard on the ready-0h tis morning that the misguided global warming alarmists are planning a \"Teach-In\" at several campuses across the nation to wake people up to the \"facts\" regarding the human contribution to global warming.\n \n Have any of you heard something similar?\n \n I'm betting it's nothing more than orchestrated reading of the talking points generated thus far without any substantial proof of validity.\n \n We all agree the earth is warming. We just don't all believe there's a magic thermostat by which we can reverse the warming.\n \n http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200801/CUL20080123a.html",
