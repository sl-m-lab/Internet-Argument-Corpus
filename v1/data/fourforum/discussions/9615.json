   "Charles Darwin wrote his book, On the Origin of the Species, nearly 150 years ago. Since that date, science has revealed wonders that he could never have imagined. For example, Darwin believed the cell was, for all intents and purposes, a blob of microscopic jelly, \"a simple blob of protoplasm,\" in the words of Ernst Haeckel. Yet it has turned out to be so complex that it literally takes thousands of pages just to describe how it works. In the light of the incredible advances that science has made since Darwin, I believe it is reasonable to ask if the theory of evolution can still account for the life that we find on earth, namely most of the microscopic biochemical systems that have been discovered, especially in the light of the recent revival of the theory of Intelligent Design. Before we can look into the details of this question, however, it is necessary to define our terms.\n \n The term evolution, as used by the writer, means the belief that all life came from a common ancestor that existed a considerable period of time ago. Thus, for our present purposes, evolution is the belief that, in most cases, the life that we observe around us is the result of a gradual increase in complexity. The driving mechanism behind evolution is an idea called \"natural selection,\" which states that the fittest organisms are more likely to survive, and will, therefore, produce more offspring. Therefore, evolution would be expected to produce cumulative complexity.\n \n A cumulatively complex system, as far as the term applies to comparatively simple biochemical systems, is a system that can have each part removed in a certain way, with each removal resulting in slightly less benefit, and, therefore, slightly less selective advantage. In other words, Darwin would have expected to be able to apply reverse evolution to each biochemical system that we find under the microscope.\n \n An irreducibly complex system is a biochemical system that consists of multiple, closely fitting, interacting protein parts, each of which is necessary to make the system work. In other words, if any protein part is removed from an irreducibly complex system, it will cease to function, because all parts are necessary to the function of the system.\n \n As an analogy, consider a mousetrap. Each part of a mousetrap is made to fit into each other part perfectly, and if any part of the system is removed, the system ceases to function. No mice can be caught with a mousetrap that does not work. Thus, since any mousetrap in the process of being built would not work, a mousetrap is irreducibly complex.\n \n An important concept to remember when discussing irreducible complexity is called the irreducible core. By irreducible core, I mean the parts of the system under discussion which are absolutely necessary for the system to function. Thus, while the system under discussion may be simplified somewhat, it can only be simplified until the core is reached. For example, rat traps often have two springs in order to provide extra speed and strength to the hammer, as opposed to a single spring in the mousetrap. If one of the springs were removed from the system, it would still work, though not as well. But would the trap work if it had no springs? There is a point at which the trap, and irreducibly complex systems, cannot be simplified further.\n \n Thus, we can see that an irreducibly complex system, if it did exist, would pose a significant problem for evolution, since evolution produces cumulatively complex systems. But does such a system exist? The answer to that question is a simple yes. Practically speaking, most biochemical systems are irreducibly complex. Michael Behe, a professor of biochemistry and former evolutionist, documented the irreducible complexity of more than 5 such systems in his book, Darwin's Black Box. I will be explaining the irreducible complexity of two example systems - first, the bacterial flagellum and, second, the system by which blood clots.\n \n Our first example, the bacterial flagellum, is one of the transportation systems that bacteria use to move from one place to another. Mike Behe, the professor of biochemistry I mentioned earlier, has called it the most efficient, ultracomplex motor know to mankind. It can rotate at up to 100,000 revolutions (turns) per minute, or about 28 revolutions per one hundredth of a second. That is by far faster than the quickest cars that have been made by man. Yet it can also completely switch directions and start going at 100,000 rpm's in the opposite direction within just one fourth of a turn. Amazingly, the flagellum is also so small that 8 million of them could fit in the cross section of the average human hair.\n \n The bacterial flagellum is similar in many ways to a man made outboard motor, since it contains many of the same kinds of parts, namely a rotor, motor, and paddle. Each of these fundamental parts is necessary for the system to function. Even at the simplest level, then, the bacterial flagellum is irreducibly complex. A rotor and motor are useless without a paddle; likewise, a motor/paddle or rotor/paddle combination are both equally useless. Thus, even when the question is utterly simplified, the evidence shows that the bacterial flagellum could not have evolved. \n \n But it gets much more complicated. The core of the simplest bacterial flagellum contains about twenty-seven, separate, closely fitting, and interlocking protein parts. If any of these parts are absent from the system, the flagellum will not work and the bacteria will die because it is unable to move about and find various things that are necessary for its survival. Therefore, it is likely that any of the bacteria that were in the process of evolving a flagellum would have died, because a working flagellum is necessary for survival. Regardless of whether or not the flagellum is necessary for survival, it is easy to see that a working flagellum could not be produced by natural selection, because it would not have any selective advantage until it worked.\n \n The second example, blood clotting, is the delicate system that our bodies use to stop our blood from flowing out of us. When you are cut, one protein is turned into its active form. This protein activates another protein, which activates another protein, which activates yet another protein, etc, etc. This process of activation goes on for 20 proteins, splitting is several directions. Setting aside the middle of the cascade, where details of the process are still cloudy, the blood clotting system is irreducibly complex. If any of the 5 or so proteins that start the process are removed, one of two things will happen. Either your entire blood stream will turn into one giant clot, or you will bleed to death. Therefore, if the blood clotting system evolved from a single protein, any of the evolving creatures would either have bled to death or had their entire blood stream turn into one giant clot. Neither of these options are beneficial! Therefore, blood clotting could not have evolved via natural selection.\n \n Yet, while we have seen that natural forces could not have created the irreducibly complex systems in nature, we also see that the bacterial flagellum, blood clotting, and a space shuttle all have something in common. When we study them, or see representations of how they work, the idea of \"designed\" pops into our head. This is because certain features on given objects can reliably indicate that they were designed or not designed. Scientists have known about detection of design for a long time - just take a look at the generation of random numbers, the SETI program (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), and cryptography. In each case, scientists know that there are certain features of any object that indicate design. Perhaps the best study of what features indicate design was done by William Dembski in his book, The Design Inference. Essentially, Dembski came to the conclusion that a factor called CSI (complex, specified information) reliably indicates design.\n \n By complex, specified information, I mean information that is not only complex, but also has a specific way that it would look if it was designed which is different from the way that it would look if it was created by nature. The information that a given object contains is located in the arrangement of its parts. Just as a statue and the boulder that it was created from contain and lack information, information and the matter that is made of are two different things.\n \n But why must the information be specified? To understand this, consider an arrow randomly shot at a wall. The odds of that arrow hitting any specific point on the wall are incredibly low - yet the arrow has to hit somewhere. Thus, the information given to the arrow is not specified information. But if the arrow were to hit the center of a painted target on the wall, we would need to question our conclusion that it was shot randomly, since the information given to it was highly specified. Likewise, as we have seen, if the flagellum or blood clotting systems were created by chance, it would have had to have been without natural selection. The chances of the flagellum being created by chance mutations without natural selection are incredibly low - yet nothing irreducibly complex had to develop in the first place. Thus, the information in irreducibly complexly systems like the flagellum is specified.\n \n Therefore, the presence of complex, specified information indicates an Intelligent Designer. Intelligent agents create complex specified information every day. Biochemical systems are not the only systems that contain the CSI factor - everything from a mousetrap, to a car, to a painting, to a space shuttle contains specified complexity, all created by intelligent agents. CSI is a common factor in many designs, but is never a factor in objects that we observed being created by chance. Thus, we can reliably conclude that, since the bacterial flagellum and blood clotting systems contain complex, specified information, they were designed. This is simply an inference to the best explanation. It does not come from any religious book or belief system - it springs naturally from the data itself.\n \n Common objections.\n \n 1: \"This is just god of the gaps\"\n \n Synonyms: \"This is just an argument from ignorance,\" \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\" and \"scientists will eventually find an answer.\"\n \n Representation. \n \n The ancients believed that lighting or some other process was caused by God, since they did not know the real cause. Today, modern people apply the same logic to irreducibly complex systems. Of course, say the advocates of this argument, science will someday find the natural answer.\n \n Response.\n \n First, Michael Behe's ideas should not be equated with god of the gaps, simply because the conclusion of intelligent design is not based upon ignorance of how the flagellum and blood clotting work, it is based upon more than 40 years of hard work by biochemists. The ancients made their assumption based upon lack of data - we come to our conclusion of design based upon knowledge of data.\n \n Second, while god of the gaps can be a problem, \"evolution in the gaps\" is also a problem. If we are ignorant about something, we are just that: ignorant. That means that we have to make due with the data that we have and come to the best conclusion that we can. That is what science is all about. Yet those who make this objection refuse to accept the conclusion of a designer, simply because of their naturalistic bias.\n \n Third, this objection commits the logical fallacy of begging the question. Without reasoning, it assumes that all scientific research will eventually find natural origins for all things, which is exactly what those who make it are trying to prove. As evidence for this sweeping assertion, those who make it point out that the ancients were wrong about lightning or some other process. Assuming what you are trying to prove is true does not make it true.\n \n Lastly, some evolutionists have claimed to \"know how the research is progressing.\" In other words, scientists in the field doing the research can tell a good deal about the direction in which the research is progressing. Some have claimed to have a sort of \"sense\" that research will eventually vidicate evolution on this issue. My objection to this claim is simply that it is not quantifiable. How can one know what one might discover tomorrow? Scientists know what they are trying to discover what they have discovered, but it is impossible to predict what will happen tomorrow.\n \n 2: \"Evolution can build irreducibly complex systems using genes that were already around for other purposes.\"\n \n Representation.\n \n Advocates of this objection point out biochemical homologies in order to show that two or more separate systems may have evolved independently. The two or more independent systems would then be place together into a single system by one mutation. Thus, instead of a gradual evolution, protein by protein, all the way to a complete flagellum, they would tell you that parts of the flagellum evolved for different purposes and were stapled together.\n \n Another way to argue this objection is simply to claim that the system that was to become the flagellum was not a flagellum at one time. In other words, the \"flagellum\" was a secretion system at some time, or some other kind of system. Therefore, it did not need all forty parts because it had a different function.\n \n Response. \n \n This objection greatly simplifies the problem of irreducible complexity in several ways.\n \n First, in any irreducibly complex system, the parts that it is made of must closely fit into each other. This is a general rule, not only with biochemical systems, but also manmade machines. For example, consider once again the common mousetrap. It would be impossible to build a working mousetrap by trying to use a popsicle stick for the base, a crowbar for the hammer, and a spring from a grandfather clock. This illustrates that parts must fit into each other in order for the system to work. The problem gets even worse when it comes to biochemical systems. Indeed, Behe wrote in his chapter in Debating Design: \"The parts of an irreducibly complex molecular machine must have surfaces that closely matched to each other to allow specific binding.\" (pg 358) Perhaps the best illustration of how close fitting biochemical systems are is the web page at http://naturalselection.0catch.com/Files/Flagellum.html Thus, parts taken from another system will only fit into that system.\n \n Second, this objection ignores the incredibly intricate construction process of irreducibly complex machines, particularly the bacterial flagellum. The information used for the construction of the flagellum lies within the way the proteins fit. If the information is not in the proteins, a flagellum will not be produced. Thus, even if all of the parts of the flagellum were present in homologous structures, the proteins would still be missing the information about how to become a flagellum. No flagellum could be produced. \n \n Third, many parts of irreducibly complex systems are not used anywhere in the cell except in the irreducibly complex system under discussion, especially in the case of blood clotting. Obviously, you cannot have different proteins serving different purposes come together to form an irreducibly complex system if there are no other purposes around the body for those proteins in the first place.\n \n Lastly, and more subtly, systems such as the bacterial flagellum and the Type 3 secretion system have control mechanisms. Biochemists observe that bacteria move their flagellums in response to their environment - the movement of the flagellums is not random, because something is controlling the movement of the flagellum. Likewise, the secretion system also does not move randomly. Both have a control mechanism of some kind. Therefore, since at some point the pre-flagellum system must become a flagellum, more than one mutation must be required to make the new system work. Even if all of the parts of the secretion system were lined up in such a way to work as a flagellum, the bacteria would still try to use the new \"flagellum\" as a secretion system, because the control mechanism would not have been changed.\n \n 3: \"Irreducibly complex systems simply evolved by an indirect route.\"\n \n Representation.\n \n Advocates of this objection would say that an arch built of bricks could also be called \"irreducibly complex.\" In other words, they believe that irreducibly complex systems may have had other, now unseen, parts supporting their evolution. Since the irreducibly complex systems evolved, the evidence of their evolution has disappeared. Thus, the systems in question were supposedly cumulatively complex, but later became irreducibly complex.\n \n Response.\n \n It is, to be sure, possible that this mechanism could explain a given irreducibly complex system. However, most systems in the cell are irreducibly complex. Other examples include cellular respiration, protein transport, the bodies immunity system, essentially any given organelle, and the cilium. Irreducible complexity is the norm, not the exception, yet we are expected to believe that in every one of these cases, the evidence for evolution has just mysteriously disappeared. It seems fishy. Though remotely possible, it is incredibly unlikely that, under the indirect route hypothesis, irreducible complexity would develop in almost every single case around the cell.\n \n \n 4: \"Irreducibly complex systems can be simplified.\"\n \n Representation.\n \n Evolutionists point out that some parts of irreducibly complex systems can be removed. Thus, they believe, since the system can be simplified, it could also have evolved via Darwinian means. Perhaps the most commonly cited example of this sort of objection is the \"knock-out\" mice experiment cited by blood clotting expert Russell Doolittle in his joint review of Behe's book and Richard Dawkin's Climbing Mount Improbable.[1]\n \n Essentially, Doolittle believed that the results of an experiment showed that when, not one, but two of the parts of the blood clotting cascade were removed, the blood clotting system worked just fine. The implication is that perhaps the irreducibly complex systems can be simplified more and more, until it really turns out that they are cumulatively complex.\n \n Response.\n \n This objection ignores the problem of the irreducibly complex core, which was discussed earlier in this essay. It is, therefore, true that it is possible for some components of some irreducibly complex systems to be removed. However, when the facts are brought out and examined, such examples of \"simplification\" of the core invariably turn out to be either misrepresentations of the experiments done or simply the removal of redundancy, as in the rat trap example that was given earlier.\n \n In the case of Russell Doolittle, the results from the experiment were misread. Those doing the experiment removed the part of the blood clotting cascade which is the actual material of the clot, which is what you see on the cut the clot has formed, from a group of mice. The second step was to eliminate the protein that is used by the body to remove the blood clot after it has formed from another group of mice. When the two breeds of mice were crossed, a breed lacking both parts of the cascade was produced. Thus, they were not only unable to remove the clotting material, but could not clot their blood in the first place. Indeed, the authors of the paper that Doolittle references note in their abstract: \"Mice deficient in plasminogen and fibrinogen are phenotypically indistinguishable from fibrinogen-deficient mice.\" [2] (plasminogen is the clot remover - fibrinogen is the fiber of the clot)\n \n 5: \"Simpler versions of irreducibly complex systems exist in nature.\"\n \n Representation.\n \n Some critics of irreducible complexity have pointed out that while some kinds of flagellums use 40 protein parts, others use fewer parts. Also, the blood clotting system used by dolphins has only 19 proteins, not 20. The implication, some would say, is the same as in objection 4: since irreducibly complex systems can be simplified, they must simply be cumulatively complex.\n \n Response.\n \n The common mousetrap is not the only way to catch mice. You could, for example, shoot the mouse with a shotgun, or use a glue trap. Theoretically, you could catch the mouse with a hole in the ground. But none of these systems could be evolved step by step into a common mousetrap in the Darwinian sense. Therefore, they are not Darwinian precursors to the common mousetrap, but are only conceptual precursors. Thus, the fact that some kinds of mousetraps have fewer (or more) parts than the common mousetrap does not indicate that the mousetrap could have had each part added step by step in the Darwinian sense.\n \n The same logic applies to the bacterial flagellum and blood clotting system. Just as a mousetrap cannot be made to work without extensive modification if it has several parts missing, the simpler flagellums in nature are not the more complex flagellums minus a number of parts. They are different versions of a concept; conceptual precursors, not Darwinian precursors. Likewise, the blood clotting system in dolphins is a different system altogether. \n \n References.\n \n 1.

   "Sinjin, while the debate you link to makes an interesting read, the side of Intelligent Design was inadequately represented. Many of the arguments brought up in the opening post were entirely missed by Clive14's opponent.\n \n \nYou have demonstrated to me the danger of home schooling though.\n\n \n This objection, if it is an objection, is a form of the logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem.

However, as I also mentioned in the opening post, all of the attempts (or, at least, all that I am aware of) have thus far proven inadequate.\n \n \nThe bateria flagellum has also been refuted as being an IC system.

The ACLU's misrepresentations of Behe were subsequently copied by the judge. Subsequent comparisons, such as the Discovery Institutes \"A Comparison of Judge Jones' Opinion in Kitzmiller v. Dover with Plaintiffs' Proposed \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\" found that more than 90% of Jones ruling was practically copied from an error riddled document the ACLU had submitted to him early in the trial.",

The examples used to illustrate their point always involve obvious artifacts which everyone recognizes. There is a subtle begging of the question here where the biological system in question is already assumed to be designed because it has a function and is organized like the artifacts (the statue in this case) being used in the analogy. To me, what counts as specified information is very subjective and is based on what is meaningful to the observer. \n \n \n \n Prodi:\n But why must the information be specified? To understand this, consider an arrow randomly shot at a wall. The odds of that arrow hitting any specific point on the wall are incredibly low - yet the arrow has to hit somewhere.

What if there were an infinite number of possible targets that could have been painted on that wall? The reason I bring this up is that there are an uncountable number of ways proteins could have come together to form a locomotor organelle. In fact, the flagellum of eukaryotes is completely different than that of bacteria, and pseudopodia can also serve the function of locomotion. Likewise, there is an infinite number of ways that a wing could be structured in animals. Vertebrates have come up with 3 completely different types of wings fashioned from forelimbs, by pterosaurs, birds & bats; How many other possibilities could have evolved? It's as if you were looking at that one target on the wall and assuming it was the only one that could have been drawn and the only one that an archer would aim at, just like the specific structures found in nature are assumed to be there by design only because they are irreducibly complex and already specified by their very existence. This seems like a very subtle and sophisticated form of circular reasoning to me.\n \n Another thing that bothers me is the way random mutations (M) are always uncoupled from natural selection (NS) when arguments are made in favor of intelligent design. In Dembski's explanatory filter, this uncoupling occurs when he presents regularity ( natural laws) separately from random chance. The regularity would correspond to NS while randomness would correspond to M. But when you take the randomness associated with M in isolation, uncoupled from the direction imparted by NS, you miss the point of how M & NS always work together.",

Any legal authority will tell you that this is the case. The Disco Institute and the TMLC are such pathetically sore losers that they've crafted this accusation of impropriety and spread the word. Such is their standard practice: popularize bullsh** and let the uneducated public eat it up.\n If the ID whiners want to complain that over 90% of the ruling was straight out of the plaintiffs' proposed findings of fact, then they should have been correct on more than under 10% of the subject matter, or on at least any substantial point.

   "Sinjin, while the debate you link to makes an interesting read, the side of Intelligent Design was inadequately represented. Many of the arguments brought up in the opening post were entirely missed by Clive14's opponent.\n \n \n \n This objection, if it is an objection, is a form of the logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem. The issue of irreducible complexity would still be an issue if I were public schooled, private schooled, or unschooled. Evidence is evidence, regardless of who brings it up.\n \n \n \n As I mentioned in the opening post in the section dedicated to common objections, I am aware that some believe that random mutation and natural selection have been demonstrated to provide adequate explanation for IC systems. However, as I also mentioned in the opening post, all of the attempts (or, at least, all that I am aware of) have thus far proven inadequate.\n \n \n \n This has the makings of a fascinating discussion. Although I can't address specific objections (or \"misstatements\") until you bring them up, the Dover trial is an exceptional example of evolutionary misunderstandings of irreducible complexity. The ACLU's misrepresentations of Behe were subsequently copied by the judge. Subsequent comparisons, such as the Discovery Institutes \"A Comparison of Judge Jones' Opinion in Kitzmiller v.

If Behe was misrepresented, he had the perfect opportunity to point that out, in the court of law. He was unable to.

   "That's a big assumption which I bet you can't back up. How can you determine that all these biologists have a naturalistic bias?\n\n \n The argument is naturalistic bias. Saying \"science will someday find a natural answer\" is simply pretending that all answers must inherently be natural, which is the very definition of naturalistic bias.\n \n \nWhy do you assume that, when we honestly don't have all the data, the best assumption is that of design? Maybe the fact that we don't know something means just that and no more. Maybe some irreducibly complex or specified systems are unresolved so that it is best to say we can't conclude anything at all yet regarding M + NS or ID.\n\n \n The evidence we do have points to intelligent design, as outlined in the opening post. The objection we are discussing deals with the possibility of future evidence pointing towards evolution.\n \n \nSince when is there an a priori assumption in science that natural causes will be found for everything? I don't make that assumption. Theistic evolutionists who oppose ID don't make that assumption. Science does NOT make any such assumption; it just limits itself to naturalistic explanations because it can't test for anything else.\n\n \n Then we agree. IC and CSI are about testing for intelligence, which is merely a trait - it has nothing to do with the natural or supernatural. As a result, the possibility of supernatural intelligence exists within ID. The a priori assumption comes in when scientists assume that ID will be proven false by a naturalistic theory and assume that their conjecture is an argument.\n \n \nWhy is that distinction so hard for ID advocates to understand? I have no objection to putting ID on the table as an hypothesis. I just want to see real evidence and I want to know how you can test for intelligent design without asserting that \"natural, unintelligent causes can not account for IC or CSI\" while you sneak ID into the discussion by default.\n\n \n You're missing an important link in the argument. Yes, evolution cannot account for irreducible complexity and specified complexity. However, we also know that even casual intelligence does account for specified and irreducible complexity (ie, many human designs exhibit CSI). Thus, it is likely that intelligence was involved in the origin of these systems.\n \n \nSo, everyone has a personal opinion about what we may discover. You have your opinion as much as everyone else. But we all know that such opinions are just that and no more. Are you trying to insinuate that such opinions among evolutionists are being deliberately passed off as evidence for evolution? I'm somewhat puzzled as to why you make an issue of scientists, especially evolutionary biologists, having personal opinions about the progress being made in research.\n\n \n I entirely agree that there is nothing wrong with personal opinions. I begin to disagree when people miss the point and think their opinions are an anything more than an informed guess. I included that paragraph because certain users had been using that argument.\n \n \nNow excuse me, but aren't you completely contradicting yourself here? You're leaving the term \"irreducible complexity\" completely devoid of meaning, as a layperson I have no idea what you could possibly mean by it now.\n\n \n Your right. Sorry if the terms are confusing. Basically, the irreducible core is the real IC system - it was a blunder on my part to define a system containing irreducible complexity (but not necessarily irreducible) as an irreducibly complex system. Obviously, it's only an irreducibly complex if it's irreducible - otherwise, it's a reducibly complex system.\n \n \nSomething has always bothered me about how the term, \"specified information\", is tossed about by ID advocates. The examples used to illustrate their point always involve obvious artifacts which everyone recognizes. There is a subtle begging of the question here where the biological system in question is already assumed to be designed because it has a function and is organized like the artifacts (the statue in this case) being used in the analogy. To me, what counts as specified information is very subjective and is based on what is meaningful to the observer.\n\n \n I apologize if my writing has led you to that belief, because nothing could be further from the truth. Informed advocates of Intelligent Design haven't used arguments from false analogy since the days of William Paley's watchmaker. Rather, the analogies used by Intelligent Design advocates aren't arguments in and of themselves - they are merely illustrations used to help people understand the real argument. Namely, that certain organisms contain a trait that only intelligence can produce. Perhaps a better illustration of this side of the argument would be the SETI program or random number generation - both of which are scientific projects dedicated finding previously unidentified intelligence.\n \n \nThe one who shoots the arrow has already recognized a specific target. What if there were an infinite number of possible targets that could have been painted on that wall?\n\n \n Or, rather, if we had painted the target around the arrow after it hit the wall. \n \n \nThe reason I bring this up is that there are an uncountable number of ways proteins could have come together to form a locomotor organelle. In fact, the flagellum of eukaryotes is completely different than that of bacteria, and pseudopodia can also serve the function of locomotion\n\n \n Yet there is also a much, much larger number of ways that it could be dysfunctionally assembled. It didn't have to come together in a functional way - yet it did. Thus, it is specified.\n \n \nAnother thing that bothers me is the way random mutations (M) are always uncoupled from natural selection (NS) when arguments are made in favor of intelligent design. In Dembski's explanatory filter, this uncoupling occurs when he presents regularity ( natural laws) separately from random chance. The regularity would correspond to NS while randomness would correspond to M. But when you take the randomness associated with M in isolation, uncoupled from the direction imparted by NS, you miss the point of how M & NS always work together.\n\n \n Natural selection cannot account for irreducible complexity. Thus, if a system is both irreducibly complex and contains specified complexity, natural selection is not considered when using specified complexity to test for design.\n \n \nBoth sides submit a \"Proposed Finding of Fact.\" It is standard practice to use even verbatim excerpts from said documents when writing a legal opinion. Any legal authority will tell you that this is the case.\n\n \n Common practice is irrelevant - the judge literally copied the misrepresentations and errors made by the ACLU in his ruling. If he had carefully considered his ruling, I doubt that he would have made these kinds of simple mistakes. Table C in the article I referenced documented a few of the more manifest misrepresentations. For example:\n \n Judge Jones said: \"He [Behe] was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not \"good enough.\"\n \n The ACLU said: \"He [Behe] was confronted with the fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books and several immunology text-book chapters about the evolution of the immune system, P256, 280, 281, 283, 747, 748, 755 and 743, and he insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution - it was 'not good enough.'\"\n \n Here is the line (in context) that both Jones and the ACLU quote: \"These articles are excellent articles I assume. However, they do not address the question that I am posing. So it's not that they aren't good enough. It's simply that they are addressed to a different subject.\"\n \n \nOh, the discovery institute might wiggle, squirm and complain, but Behe could not counter the objections in court, and he was there. If Behe was misrepresented, he had the perfect opportunity to point that out, in the court of law. He was unable to. He was ripped to tiny shreds when it was shown that he was the one doing the misreprentation. Read the transscripts. it's all there.\n\n \n I have read most of the relevant transcripts, and I disagree. Most of the arguments brought up by the ACLU differ little from those addressed in the opening post. If you have a particular argument in mind, I would be happy to discuss it with you.\n \n \nYou do realize, do you not, that there is no \"the\" bacterial flagellum.\n \n So why, I have to wonder, why the Cre-, I mean, Designer would design several different flagella....\n\n \n Why not? After all, if you are designing more than one airplane, isn't it more efficient to consider different sorts of engines?\n \n \nFortunate for me, considering that I haven't even had the chance to sit down and hammer out a good, lengthy discussion. I will try to put something together this weekend, even if I'm not completely caught up elsewhere.\n\n \n Thanks! I'm looking forward to reading your response.",

That's rather academic since I as I stated first, I see no reason to think that any part of the cell is irreducible...\n\n \n If I could re-write the opening post (I wrote that section more than a year ago), I almost certainly wouldn't bring up the issue of probability - I can see now that it could easily lead to a long, needless discussion without any real conclusion. Since it's not particularly important to my argument, I'll drop it for now. More importantly, there are several other points that I should bring up, since I neglected to talk about them in that section of the OP. \n \n First, your version of the IR hypothesis cannot account for the protein bonding that occurs in systems like the bacterial flagellum. As mentioned in the OP, proteins in systems like the flagellum bond more closely than a hand in a glove. If your idea actually occurred, more than one mutation would be required to add a new protein to the pre-flagellum system. At minimum, you would need a mutation to create/move/modify the first protein so that it would fit into the pre-flagellum, and you would need a second mutation to modify the proteins of the pre-flagellum so that they could bond with the new protein.\n \n Second, complex systems like the bacterial flagellum have control mechanisms. Biochemists observe that bacteria move their flagellums in response to their environment - the movement of the flagellums is not random, because something is controlling the movement of the flagellum. Likewise, any pre-flagellum system also would not act randomly, since any complex system is pointless (or even harmful) if uncontrolled. Both would have a control system of some kind. Therefore, since at some point the pre-flagellum system must become a flagellum, more than one mutation must be required to make the new system work. Even if all of the parts of the pre-flagellum system were lined up in such a way to work as a flagellum, the bacteria would still try to use the new \"flagellum\" as a pre-flagellum system, because the control mechanism would not have been changed.\n \n Third, your objection ignores the exceedingly intricate construction process of irreducibly complex machines, particularly the bacterial flagellum. The informational \"construction manual\" used to build the flagellum lies within the way the proteins fit. If a new protein is added, a flagellum will not be produced, simply because that protein would not fit into the construction process.\n \n All three of the above apply even before, in your theory, the system becomes irreducibly complex.",
