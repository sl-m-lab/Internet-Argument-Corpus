   "Hi Everyone, \n \n I was here before about a year ago and thought I would return for a bit to see what others have to say about the teaching I am giving you here about unalienable rights. I would love to hear what you have to say, but please be respectful.\n \n \n A statement within one of the most important documents ever written for this country, has been one of the reasons that I stand so strongly with the gay rights people. I would like to give my understanding of one of the wisest statements within the Declaration of Independence. \n \n This statement...\n \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and Happiness...\"\n \n For many years of my youth, I did not have the understanding of this wisdom, so I began seeking out the true meaning. It is clear that anti-gay rights people do not have this understanding yet, so I thought I would share it for those that have hearing ears that hear.\n \n The first two things that I needed to understand was the meaning of ...unalienable rights and self evident truth. So, as all good seekers do, I looked in the dictionary for the meaning of...\n \n Self evident...Evident by itself; needing no proof. Example: It is self evident that physical growth is the result of food and water.\n \n Unalienable...that which cannot be given away or taken away. Example: birth rights that our Creator gave us.\n \n Beings the Declaration of Independence used the phrase, \"Among these rights\", this told me there were more rights that were not stated along with life, liberty and happiness. So I had to seek until I found out what all the rights were and then get an understanding of each. I found 7 rights.\n \n 1. THE RIGHT TO BE HERE...that is our right to exist. This right is the foundation of our survival and security.\n \n 2.THE RIGHT TO FEEL...Feeling is the way we obtain important info about our well-being. When this right is infringed on, we become out of touch with ourselves. We become numb and disconnected from our souls. When people state to us that we have no right to be angry; that we should be ashamed of ourselves; that boys don't cry, they are infringing on our right to feel. Our right to enjoy healthy sexuality is intimately connected with our right to feel.\n \n 3.THE RIGHT TO ACT...Societies with narrowly defined behavior patterns impair our right to act by giving us fear of punishment. For instance, many gay men fear acting on their feelings of love for another man in public (i.e. expressing affectionate touching, etc.) because he fears the retaliation of the general public. This is our right to be FREE.\n \n 4. THE RIGHT TO LOVE AND BE LOVED...This right can be damaged by any dysfunction in a parents ability to love and care for their child. Many cultures infringe on this right of the gay person with their judgmental attitudes towards gays. This can create a poor self-esteem, broken will and inability to feel or communicate. The right to love is also damaged by racial differences, war, or anything that forces separation between groups.\n \n 5. THE RIGHT TO SPEAK AND HEAR TRUTH...This right is damage when we are not allowed to speak truthfully for fear of retaliation. A young gay person fears speaking out about his orientation because of the religious judgements against him. When our parents, societies, religious leaders or governments lie to us, they are also abusing this right.\n \n \n 6. THE RIGHT TO SEE... This right is damaged when we are told that what we perceive is not real; Example, when a gay man is told that what he feels for another man is not love, but only lust. When things are deliberately hidden or denied, such as when a drunk parent lies to their child about being drunk. This damages the child's ability to see things as they really are. \n \n 7. THE RIGHT TO KNOW...This consist of the right to accurate information, the right to truth, the right to knowledge and the right to simply know what is going on. Proper education is an important part to this. When one doesn't educate their self about the gay man, they damage their own right to gain knowledge. A close minded person has damaged their own ability to gain knowledge.\n \n I believe this world would begin to turn around if these teachings were put out for the people to gain this knowledge. To not understand this is to remain ignorant to our inalienable rights that our Creator gave us, that our founding fathers understood. This lack of knowledge and understanding (ignorance) among the people of the earth is the true evil going on in this world.\n \n We must strive to gain knowledge and understanding. We must seek to find this knowledge. When we seek, we find. That is the only way to pull ourselves out of this hell we now have on this earth.\n \n Aka Sage, Pat Henry and Lilac Angel",

   "2.THE RIGHT TO FEEL... ...When people state to us ... that we should be ashamed of ourselves ... they are infringing on our right to feel.\n\n \n Don't pretend you love the freedom our forefathers wanted us to have. The Declaration of Independence is not against speech that makes catamites ashamed of themselves. The Bill of Rights does, however, give me the right to make such speech if I care to. A good thing, too. People evolved to feel shame because shame can rescue people from depravity.

You are clueless or deceitful as to what anti-sodomy types are about. Those addicted to being sodomized need to be angry--that will encourage them to leave their abusers.

   "Thanks, Angel, for the new thread, I think that it has a lot of potential...\n \n ..I am just wondering where you got the 7 rights...thanks.\n\n \n I found the seven rights in a book called \"Eastern Body Western Mind\" by Anodea Judith. She has a Master's degree in clinical psychology and training in bioenergetics, trauma recovery, yoga therapy and other somatic disiplines. She is a leading authority on the 7 power points of the human body, also called the chakras. \n \n Thank you for inquiring. Now I need to respond to the latest post, if my time will allow.

   "I really have this dislike of responding to people that disrespect the person they are responding to. People teach others how to treat them. By giving out disrespect, you are teaching me that you want disrespect back. And I am really good at giving disrespect back, so you may not want to push me into it any further.\n \n \n You said....\"Don't pretend you love the freedom our forefathers wanted us to have.\" \n \n That is an inaccurate statement of assumption. You are infringing on my right to feel. You are disrespecting me by thinking you can tell me HOW I FEEL! I am the ONLY one here that can express my feelings, just as you are the only one here that can express yours. You give me that and I will give it back to you in return.\n \n You stated...\"The Declaration of Independence is not against speech that makes catamites ashamed of themselves.\"\n \n No where did I state that the D of I is against freedom of speech? So why do you go off on this tangent? And as far as labeling others as a catamite, that is beneath me. That is for people that feel they have a right to condemn others. And about the label, catamite...where in HELL did you get the idea that I was talking about that or anything related to a boy that is kept for unnatural purposes? Are you seeing things that are not really there to see?\n \n You stated...\"The Bill of Rights does, however, give me the right to make such speech if I care to.\"\n \n Yes, I agree here. Freedom of speech does not limit what people say, even if what they say is based on ignorance, judgements and fears, such as your whole post. But I will defend your right to speak it, just as my right to remind you how ignorant your speech is.\n \n You stated...\"A good thing, too. People evolved to feel shame because shame can rescue people from depravity. There is a time for every emotion under the sun, and you would have shame banned precisely at its most proper time.\"\n \n I agree with you about a time for every emotion under the sun. God gave us emotions. We are suppose to feel them. But it is up to us to listen to our own conscience, understand our own feelings and learn from them. Others do not have the right to tell us that we should feel shame. For instance, you cannot in any way make me feel shameful for loving my gay brothers and sisters as I do myself. That teaching came from a much higher Being than you can ever be. \n \n \n You stated...\"It's peculiar the way your statement about shame is surrounded (thereby making quotation difficult)\" \n \n I had no difficulty what-so-ever- in using your quotations surrounded by others.\n \n You stated...\"by the totally contrary assertions that anti-sodomy types would mind your being angry or your crying. You are clueless or deceitful as to what anti-sodomy types are about.\"\n \n I don't believe I am clueless. Anti-sodomy types believe they have a right to tell others what to do with their own bodies. Anti-sodomy types believe they have the right to jump into their neighbors bedrooms. Anti-sodomy types believe they have the right to govern another man without their concent. How am I doing so far?\n \n You stated...\"Those addicted to being sodomized need to be angry--that will encourage them to leave their abusers. Then they should cry for those they have wronged.\"\n \n Do you understand... concent? If two adults give their concent to each other, there is no abuse. Now if someone tries to sodomize you without your concent, then you can consider it abuser and abusee.\n \n \n You asked...\"You addicted to being sodomized?\"\n \n My sex life is not yours or anyones elses business what so ever!!! \n \n \n You so ignorantly stated...\"Cry for the pain you have caused your parents and for the decent females you might have loved instead. They deserve it.\"\n \n Here is a perfect example of how ignorantly assuming you know something about me or anyone else at all, really speaks loudly of how ignorant (lacking knowledge) you are. You fly off on a tangent that is no where near reality. \n \n For your information...I am a 50 year old married grandmother. Now do you feel shame for your words? If you don't, maybe you should practice what you preach!\n \n Lilac Angel",

   "Others do not have the right to tell us that we should feel shame.\n \n \n I have the right to say whatever I want as long is it not slanderous and does not threaten harm. That is what freedom of speech is about. You don't have to listen to me, but that is not the right you claimed to want. Shame necessarily implies the disapproval of others. If others don't have the right to disapprove, by definition shame is impossible. You would have merely guilt.\n \n \nAnd as far as labeling others as a catamite\n \n \n I never labeled anyone a catamite. I said that I should have the right to say that a catamite should be ashamed of himself. You never said what \"we\" stood for. I made the natural assumption that, as in the Declaration of Independence, it stood for all Americans, catamite Americans included. Or do you think just a certain type of American should have the extraordinary inalienable rights you suggest?\n \n \n \n \nIf two adults give their concent to each other, there is no abuse.\n \n \n This is not my opinion. I believe that sodomy is a nefarious addiction (see my earlier thread, Sodomy a vile addiction). So just as a drug dealer abuses a junkee by catering to his addiction, a sodomizer abuses his victim. Only sodomy is worse because it is more insidious and more likely to unnaturally warp sex defenses and desires\n \n \n \nYou asked...\"You addicted to being sodomized?\"\n \n My sex life is not yours or anyones elses business what so ever!!! \n\n \n This is called a rhetorical question. Then: \n \n \nYou so ignorantly stated...\"Cry for the pain you have caused your parents and for the decent females you might have loved instead. They deserve it.\"\n \n Here is a perfect example of how ignorantly assuming you know something about me or anyone else at all, really speaks loudly of how ignorant (lacking knowledge) you are. You fly off on a tangent that is no where near reality.\n\n \n This is not a \"perfect example\", because in your hypercritical state you don't get that my first question was a rhetorical one. All you prove is that you like to cunningly deceive by unnaturally splitting my statements just as you like to deceive by making your own statements unnaturally difficult to split when to be answered correctly such splitting is necessary. \n \n In a way, I did and still do sort of make the assumption that your original harangue has something to do with pederasty (which kind of makes me wonder about your being a 50 year old grandmother). You said \"When people state to us ...that boys don't cry, they are infringing on our right to feel. Our right to enjoy healthy sexuality is intimately connected with our right to feel.\" Here in the \"Gay Rights\" folder that sort of statement sounds awful NAMBLAish to me. Why did you say that? Does society look down of boys' crying more than mens' crying? I have not noticed this. Do men not also deserve to have the right to cry? Why'd you single out \"boys\" in a discussion of the rights of gays to enjoy healthy sexuality? What would \"boys\" have to do with this? It's almost as though you are trying to tell some boy, \"Mr. Meigs [that would be me] wouldn't actually have hurt your feelings by telling you that you shouldn't let yourself be sodomized if he knew you cried so easily, but since he doesn't really realize how sensitive you are and how easily your feelings are hurt, he so callously told you 'danger, danger, you are about to wreck your life and hurt those you love--RUN.'\"\n \n Haaah!",

Just as Jesus said in his last dying breath...\"forgive them Father, for they know not what they do\"...but they will when they \"change forms\". (energy never dies, it just changes form.)\n \n Lilac Angel",

   "Man do i hate it when people wave the bible around and try to outlaw something they don't like. Because that is what this really is, if you look at. Homosexuality is new, different, weird, and distasteful to straight people. That does not mean that it is in any way shape or form wrong. The bible also forbids lieing stealing etc, but we aren't out with massive demonstrations about truth or against crime. Why? Because it is more socially acceptable. And now these frightened conservatives want to tarnish the highest order of our country by introducing the first addition to our constitution that actually takes rights away from people. I look around myself everyday and feel like my country, the greatest example of freedom and liberty in this world, and I feel depressed. We are on the brink of betraying the ideals we were founded on, and if we fall, who knows whether we will be able to get back up.",

   "Homosexuality is new\n \n \n Homosexuality has been around as long as any man or woman has.\n \n I agree with the rest of your post, though. \n Yes, it is alarming that the nation contradicts itself blatantly and continually in the name of patriotism and religion.\n \n I think it was Plato that surmised that all democracy will eventually implode into a socialist state. All we can do is love each other and in this, we will be strong.\n \n America is very weak.",
