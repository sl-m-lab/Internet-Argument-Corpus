Hint: It's Not Japan or China\n \n Well! Well! Well! And who is it exactly who started this snakey business?\n \n Why, bless my soul! It appears to have been Ronald Wilson Reagan!\n \n\n \n You're deluded, as usual. And totally lost on who had the purse strings. President Reagan couldn't have spent a penney unless the DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES approved the spending bill first.\n \n So already you're busted.\n \n Revisiting Liberal Myths &#8211; Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending. He wanted more defense spending, lower entitlement spending, lower tax rates which would boost the economy (and thus revenues) and seemed to achieve that agreement with Congress in both 1981 and 1982. However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years. This attitude of \"cut spending later\" helped continue the debt trends that began under Ford and Carter. By the end of Reagans terms, debt had increased by $2 trillion.\n \n Actual budget figures in the link below:\n \n The President Reagan Information Page:Budget Myths\n \n President Reagan was able to sign into law the tax cuts in late 1981 after an attempt by congressional Democrats to block the cuts (i.e. \"gridlock\") failed...but at the reduced rate of 25%, and an effective rate of 23% since the cuts would be over three years (5% in 1981, retroactive; 10% for 1982; 10% for 1983). \n \n All taxpayers received these cuts, not just the rich as anti-Reagan revisionists would have you believe, as shown in the table of effective tax rates. And, also contrary to liberal recounting, the tax cuts helped spur the economy (see the expansion). In addition, income tax revenues increased during this period and the share of taxes paid by the rich increased also! In other words, the liberals have been lying to you. \n \n The Reagan Information Page:The Tax Cuts\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan&#8217;s tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80. Rather than cut spending, they let the government shut down and blamed Reagan. \n \n House Atreides - The Truth About Tax Cuts\n \n You must really get tired of being embarrassed with your revisionist liberal claptrap. But we'll be around to keep you honest, because you won't hear about all these things on MSNBC or CNN.",

He came up with the plan to take SS off the budget, which allowed the government to basically spend all the money in the trust fund without ever having to really count it as deficit spending.\n \n At the end of the day, though, it goes a lot deeper than SS and medicare and other government programs.
