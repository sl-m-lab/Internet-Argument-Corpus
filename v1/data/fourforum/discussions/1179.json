   "The new PM has said that militant groups now want a cease fire and \"want to reach a common denominator\". Who now is stupid  enough to fall for this?\n \n What are your thoughts?\n \n Previous Cease Fire:\n \"A previous cease-fire -- declared unilaterally by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades -- the militant offshoot of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement -- ended August 21. The groups, all three of which have been declared terrorist groups by the U.S. State Department, declared the seven-week-old cease-fire over after a senior Hamas leader was killed in an Israeli missile attack. The Israeli attack followed a terrorist bus bombing in Jerusalem that killed 20 people. Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bus bombing.\"\n \n \n Source:\n \n http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/10/29/mideast/index.html",

   "I say no. Read this link to understand why: http://www.debka.com/article.php?aid=651 (Assad, Nasrallah and Abu Ala Scale up Threat Levels)\n \n Exerpt from the artical:\n \n 1. The Palestinians will refuse to join Israel in peace negotiations as long as construction of Israel's separation fence continues. \"Its continuation makes any talk of a Palestinian state farcical,\" our sources quote Abu Ala as saying. \n \n 2. Any Palestinian-Israeli ceasefire agreement must be based on terms quite different from the conditions of what Abu Ala calls \"Abu Mazen's failed hudna\". \n \n 3. The Palestinians will demand the evacuation of settlements as condition number one for a ceasefire. \n \n 4. The Palestinians will insist on advance notice of all of the Sharon government's actions in relation to the Palestinians. \n \n 5. A ceasefire will be phased, taking effect in one zone after another. \n \n 6. No Palestinian administration will accept the demand to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. \n \n 7. Palestinian security forces will go into action only against ceasefire violators. \n \n Arafat made the important concession of allowing Qureia to appoint a security affairs minister with real authority.\n \n \n Over all, I am willing to give Palestinians a chance. BUT, not with Arafat around the corner.",
