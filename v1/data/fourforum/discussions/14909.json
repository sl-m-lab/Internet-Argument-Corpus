   "If the way to prevent such bloodshed during mass shootings is to require the shooter to perform a .34 second reload after every tenth shot in order to add and additional .68 seconds to the time required to shoot 30 rounds, wouldn't it also make sense to ban knife sharpeners?\n \n After all, it would decrease the severity of lacerations caused during stabbings due to dull knives instead of sharp ones.\n \n Similar to the fact that shooters would take .34 seconds longer to kill people due to the neccessity of reloading, stabbers would also take longer killing people due to the neccessity of a few more jabs.\n \n Hey, it's all in the name of safety, right?",
