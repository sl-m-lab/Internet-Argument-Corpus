   "As in being of human origin.\n\n Right. We're agreed upon this point, then.\n \n \nAnd as such, the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin.\n\n And we agree that it is a physical entity... the same as any cell of human origin... in fact, the same as anything else that exists in the physical world. We're two-for-two.\n \n \nActually, it can. The zygote doesn't always develop into an adult human being. In fact, about 60-70% of all zygotes never implants or gets rejected and end up being flushed down the toilet. And of those who do implant, some turn into blighted ovums or hydatidiform moles. So no, your claim is not as all-encompassing as you want to present it.\n\n Yes, it is. Read it again. \n \n I make no claim that the zygote ALWAYS develops into an adult human being. I am making a factual statement that a zygote contains everything that it needs to be able to develop into an adult human being provided that it is given nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment in which to survive. Many zygotes do not survive to attach in the safe environment of the uterine wall, or eventually to be born into the outside world. Even of those that ARE provided with a safe environment, not all of them will survive. However, they do have everything they need to be able to grow into an adult human being. Not all of them make it. Neither do all born human entities make it to adulthood.\n \n \nWhich is also true after ANY cell division of any kind, and as such again is a rather meaningless point.\n\n So, we agree again. This is the second time you have labeled one of my points meaningless. I do not disagree. In and of themselves, they are meaningless. Any meaning is assigned to them by whoever wishes to interpret them. \n \n \nWell, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which \"God\" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the \"entity\" at all.\n\n I'm having a little trouble distinguishing what you mean to say here. But I think you are saying this: \n 1) God allows many post-conception human entities to be destroyed naturally.\n 2) The morning after pill doesn't have anything to do with the destruction of the entity.\n \n First of all, these two statements are in no way correlated. The first statement, assuming a 'God' exists, is true. Or perhaps a better way to state it is as an absolute truth: Some portion of post-conception entities do not implant in the uterine wall and are flushed out of the body. This could be observed.\n \n The second statement (assuming my understanding of your point is accurate) is not true. At least one purpose of the morning-after-pill is to not allow the post-conception entity to implant in the uterine wall. It operates specifically to create this result. To suggest otherwise is absurd. If it is not designed to do so, then why would anyone take it?\n \n \n \nOr that they are not true. Until there is actual proof for your claims, it IS an opinion, or in scientific terms, it is a hypothesis. \n\n Ahh, but there is proof. Nothing that I am suggesting is opinion. If evidence can be used to verify a statement as true or false, then it is not an opinion. It is a fact. It may be a fact without supporting evidence, but it is a fact never-the-less. All of the facts that I presented could be proven false with evidence that contradicts them. But no such evidence exists in the physical realm.\n 1) It is certainly well documented that a zygote in the female human being was created from the sperm of a human male and the ovum of a human female. It is of human origin, as you stated above.\n 2) Visit any in-vitro fertilization lab, and you could see many of these physical entities.\n 3) Six billion humans are alive today that began their physical, biological development as a zygote, and to which nothing has been added except nourishment and oxygen. The fact that they are alive is proof that whatever environment they live in is safe enough to survive.\n 4) Feel free to contact the scientists who developed the morning-after-pill. They will tell you specifically how it functions. There is certainly proof that it operates specifically to 'prevent a pregnancy from developing,' or in other words, to terminate the development of a post-conception entity.\n \n Seriously, Carla... There is nothing to dispute. You cannot reasonably suggest that a human zygote is not of human origins. You cannot reasonably suggest that a human zygote does not exist in the physical reality. You cannot reasonably suggest that something other than oxygen, nourishment and a safe environment MUST be present in order for a zygote to develop into a fully grown adult human. You cannot reasonably suggest that the morning-after-pill NEVER functions to prevent the development of a post-conception entity. In order to prove my factual statements are false, you must be able to do at least one of the above. Good luck! ;-)",

   "Carla -- First, let's make the distinction clear between fact and opinion. A fact can never be an opinion. And an opinion can never be a fact. They are mutually exclusive. One never 'turns into' the other.\n \n FACT: Statement of actuality or occurrence. A fact is based on direct evidence, actual experience, or observation. \n \n OPINION: Statement of belief or feeling. It shows one's feelings about a subject. Solid opinions, while based on facts, are someone's views on a subject and not facts themselves. \n \n Also see: http://oii.org/cyberu/html/fact.htm\n \n \n \nAgain, that claim is not factual. Unless the genetic makeup of that zygote is just right, that will not happen. A woman can grow a 10# hydatidiform mole without any problems.\n\n Yes, the claim is factual, as it has been observed time and time again. It wouldn't matter if a woman can grow a 1000# hydatidiform mole without any problems... that has nothing to do with the observed fact that a zygote needs nothing to be added to it except nourishment and oxygen, and allowed a safe environment in which to develop. Many problems can potentially develop along the way, both intentional and unintentional -- natural or unnatural, but nothing needs to be added except what is mentioned above. Fact. Observed. Many times.\n \n \n \nEssentially, yes. Lots of zygotes are destroyed \"naturally.\" And EC does not directly destroy the zygote anymore than non-implantation for other reasons does.\n\n You are correct. EC does not directly destroy the zygote. I never said it does. Look at my original statement: \"...the morning after pill has the potential to destroy a post-conception human entity.\" Perhaps a more precise wording of this would have been \"...has the potential to cause the destruction...\" but I felt it would be understood by most reasonable people as it was stated.\n \n EC causes thinning in the lining of the uterus, which makes it more difficult for the zygote to implant itself, which in turn causes the zygote to stop developing. This has been observed. Many times. It is a fact. In order to contradict the fact that EC has the potential to destroy a zygote [by thinning the uterine lining], you would have to prove that EC never functions this way.\n \n If EC can never cause the destruction of the zygote, then why would a woman take it? It would be pointless, as that is the goal of any woman taking EC.\n \n \nYes, they are. Without implantation, all zygotes end up the same way.\n\n Your statement is ultimately true. That still doesn't mean that natural termination and intentional termination are correlated. It is possible to never intentionally terminate the development of a post-conception entity. Natural terminations will still occur. The only impact EC has on natural terminations is that potentially some pregnancies that would have terminated naturally will no longer terminate naturally because they are being terminated intentionally.\n \n \nBut the non-implantation is not what destroys the zygote.\n\n Not directly, no. But the effect of non-implantion regardless of the cause is that many zygotes terminate their development. One of the primary functions of EC is to reduce the likelihood of implantation, thereby causing the destruction of the zygote.\n \n \nNope. Until you actually prove something, it remains an opinion.\n\n Re-read the distinction between facts and opinions.\n \n \nAnd as such, they are opinions, not facts. And this also contradicts your claim above of how those facts extsts.\n\n Re-read the distinction between facts and opinions. Opinions do not become facts. Facts are facts. They may be true facts or they may be false facts. But facts are facts are facts.\n \n \nBut not proof that every zygote has the physical capacity to reach that point, and in fact that the zygote needs the right genetic makeup as well to not end up as a hydatidiform mole instead.\n\n Where, oh where, did I claim that every zygote has the physical capacity to reach that point?

You have also provided evidence that you like semantics games: \"The pill... does not terminate the development, but merely stops the implantation.\" \n \n \nIrrelevant.\n\n Relevant, because it was a part of my initial statement that you disputed.\n \n \nI never claimed this, so your inclusion of that point here is dishonest.\n\n Again, it was a part of my original statement that you disputed.\n \n \nI proved that yes you do need much more.

You are not contradicting any of my facts, Carla. You are not providing evidence that something other than oxygen, nourishment, and a safe environment MUST be provided to the zygote in order for it to survive.\nIt needs a successful genetic makeup (It also needs a bunch of hormones and other chemical interventions along the way, but lets just put those under \"nourishment\" for now).\n \n \nBut, to deny that the pill is a potential cause of the non-implantation, which leads to the termination of development, is absurd.\nBut then, I certainly have not denied that this is what the EC does, as that is its mechanism of action.\n \n \nYou have provided evidence that you do not know the difference between a fact and an opinion.\nWell, given that you claim such a thing as a \"false fact,\" I have the sense that you are a bit off on your claim.\n \n \nYou have also provided evidence that you like semantics games:\nRather, I like factual, accurate information as the foundation for debate.\n \n \n\"The pill... does not terminate the development, but merely stops the implantation.\" \nAh, but don't forget that your original claim was not that the EC terminates development, but rather (Post #5): \"The morning after pill has the potential to destroy that unique post-conception human entity.\" 'potential to destroy' is rather different than \"terminate development\"\n \n \nRelevant, because it was a part of my initial statement that you disputed.\nNope.

Of course, I am not actually doing the physical destruction of the photograph, but I am certainly causing the destruction by lighting the match and holding it underneath the photo.\nExcept that the EC doesn't provide any force onto the zygote. Your example would only be true if the picture would bun if it hit the floor, just like pictures would normally burn if they fell to the floor, and your action merely prevented the picture from not falling. The claim of proactive intervention directly against the zygote/picture is not analogous to the actions that the EC impose on the zygote itself (which is none).\n \n \nAgain, you have offered no evidence to contradict any fact that I have stated.\nSure I have, as can be seen above, including that some of what you call facts really aren't facts (But then, we seem to have a different idea of what a fact is, so perhaps we can't really do much other than agree to disagree on that one).",
