Specifically, committing our country to a long expensive war/occupation with very little global support and mixed domestic support. Secondarily, he was/is criticized for uncontrolled spending. He was praised for a tax cut at the Federal level. The rest of our taxes, however, seem to be increasing due to a lack of revenues collected, and decreased funding at the Federal level, as well as uncontrollable spending at all levels of government. I'll be interested to see how he reduces the deficit before he leaves office.",

   "On the flip side, Scottish is percieved as the by far most sexy accent by foreigners. I can`t think of a single female friend that doesn`t get all glossy eyed when hearing scottish...

I dunno.\n \n Saying the scottish accent is sexy because of Sean Connery is like saying the English accent is sexy because of Pierce Brosnan. But I have known many many VERY unsexy (VERY) english people who do not help the cause at all. People are sexy and if they have a foreign accent then that makes them more sexy.

   "I asserted no such thing: I asked a question about the \"hierarchy\" of accents in America - if there is such a phenomenon.\n\n I think there is.\n I think at the bottom of the ladder is the southern drawl.\n There are many many variations on this, but they are all put in this category.\n No matter what kind of genius you are, if you speak with this accent you sound just above retarded. :)\n Example: \"Ahm fiddin-ta feeyul up mah far-whiller wit fahwer gallons.\"\n That **** burns my ears. Anyone who can squeeze two syllables out of a one syllable word, BAH I say!\n \n Then comes the cajun accent, maybe.\n \n Then probably some of that Brooklyn-Bronx-Queens Archie Bunker thing.\n \n Then I guess it's the surfer dude california accent.\n \n Then comes that Minnesota, Wisconsin, Dakota thing. \"Aw, jeez! Dontcha know.\"\n \n Then your everyday american accent that you can't place where the possessor came from.\n \n Then it's probably that neutral News Anchor sounding accent at the top.\n \n I'd say that's pretty close to the accent heirarchy here.",
