   "Ugh, I just rented \"Infection\" and it sucked!\n It was low budget and the acting was WAY over the top.\n I dunno, maybe it's good in a campy sort of way.\n \n It reminded me of \"Tomei\" and it's many progressively crappier sequels.\n \n I can't find \"Hypnosis\" for now, but I rented \"The Eye\". ooooo creepy.....",

   "Some of them give me that impression too.\n I think it's the Japanese style of filming.\n It goes very quickly.\n \n Also, when I watch some movies with subtitles that are very literal, I sometimes can't make out what's going on. If I watch it again with dubbing, it detracts from the action (to me), but sometimes they help the story make more sense.\n \n And, these movies are made for Asian audiences and the cultural differences sometimes make the story, or a scene here or there, a little confusing. \n \n I think the way death and spirits are dealt with in asian cultures can sometimes make a scene or a plot point confusing to a Western audience.\n \n The Eye is from Hong Kong I think, so it may be more palatable for most westerners. Even some of the words they use are english, mixed in with the cantonese.",
