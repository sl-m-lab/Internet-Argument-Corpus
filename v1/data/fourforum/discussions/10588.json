   "\"The goal of life is living in agreement with nature.\"\n \n Zeno, Greek philosopher\n \n \n \n \"All speech is vain and empty unless it be accompanied by\n action.\" \n \n \"Small opportunities are often the beginning of great\n enterprises.\" \n \n \"You cannot have a proud and chivalrous spirit if your conduct\n is mean and paltry; for whatever a man's actions are, such\n must be his spirit.\" \n \n Demosthenes \n \n \n \"I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters\n of their thoughts.\" \n \n John Locke \n \n \n \"Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must.\" \n \n \"How can you come to know yourself? Never by thinking, always by doing. Try to do your duty, and you'll know right away what\n you amount to.\" \n \n \"Nothing is worth more than this day.\" \n \n \"There is nothing worse than aggressive stupidity.\" \n \n \"Treat a man as he appears to be, and you make him worse. But treat a man as if he were what he potentially could be, and you make him what he should be.\" \n \n \"Whatever you can do or dream, begin it.\" \n \n \"Whenever I hear people talking about 'liberal ideas,' I am\n always astounded that men should love to fool themselves\n with empty sounds. An idea should never be liberal; it must be vigorous, positive, and without loose ends so that it may fulfill\n its divine mission and be productive.\" \n \n Goethe \n \n \n \"Better fare hard with good men than feast it with bad.\"\n \n \"Such is the irresistible nature of truth that all it asks, and all\n it wants, is the liberty of appearing.\"\n \n \"What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.\"\n \n Thomas Paine",
