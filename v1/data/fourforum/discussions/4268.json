If you have equal amounts of Male and Female of the same species of Animal, not one of them will attempt to engage in sexual activity with another of the same sex.\n \"Homosexuality\" cannot, and does not occur in nature.\n\n \n This post is not quite accurate. First, the reason animals engage in homosexual sex is current under debate; claiming that they do not prefer sex with members of the same-sex is merely an as-of-yet unfounded opinion just as claiming that they do prefer it is. Further, if you have equal amounts of males and females in a society, some males will still engage in same-sex behaviors for many animals. This does not necessarily imply that it is their preferred form of sex.\n \n The idea that homosexuality cannot and does not occur in nature is certainly untrue. As the link to the article, and even Jaaaman's post suggest, in times when not many females are present we have absolutely seen long-term same-sex relationships occur in nature. Jaaaman might have made a claim which has not yet been proven false by claiming that homosexuality is not possible in nature when there are equal numbers of males and females. However even then it seems unlikely that the statement \"cannot occur\" is true, for a single mutation in the fruit fly drosophila can cause those flies to engage in sexual intercourse with males in preference to females. Whether such behavior \"does\" occur currently for the reason of mutation or otherwise is under debate.",

I'm certainly not an artificial organism, I was born, like the rest of us, from a mother and a father and yet I am gay. There are PLENTY of male humans on the planet, yet I am oriented towards relationships sexually and emotionally with other women. Granted those women are also of like mind/body/emotional well being/spirit. I do not, have not and would not be attracted to women who are not also lesbians/bi-sexuals. Although I have a PREFERANCE for lesbians only, I do realize that there are bi-sexual women who meet my orientational needs. \n \n I do not hate men, I do not dislike men, I do not shun men from my life, I simply am NOT SEXUALLY attracted to men. \n \n Come on Jaaaman, you and I have spoken on several occassions outside of this forum and we seem to get along fine. I might even go as far as to say we are \"friendly.\" \n But it does not change the fact that I am still a lesbian. It in no way implies that I have any kind of sexual attraction to you or any other male. \n I'm sure the other men in this forum are perfectly secure enough in their sexuality to not be offended by my simply not being attracted to them. But your comments almost seem jealous. \n I say almost because I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt here. I know you are a married man and love your wife. But you cannot deny the basic human need to feel wanted by whichever gender you yourself are attacted to. I feeds our human egos. It's normal.\n The same holds true for other animals as well. \n Just remember, we are all animals.",

So do tell me how homosexuality is unnatural? If humans are mammals or so I learned in biology 101, would we not fit into the same catagory as other animals? Here are some links to view to prove the point.\n \n \n http://www.rnw.nl/lifestyle/html/gayanimals000808.html\n \n my personal favorite....\n \n http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.c...MNG3N4RAV41.DTL \n \n\n \n Also JakeCJB has posted other links as well:\n \n \nThe \"deprived of heterosexuality\" argument. A variation on the pseudo-heterosexuality argument, this argument postulates that lower ranked males are deprived of the opportunity to mate and therefore turn to other males for sexual satisfaction. \n \n The problem with this argument is that in many species in which harem-guarding occurs, there is no difference between higher ranking males and lower ranking ones as to the frequency of their homosexual mountings. This has been demonstrated in musk oxen, American bison, and New Zealand sea lions among others. \n \n Among female homosexual pairs of Japanese macaques and Hanuman langurs engaging in homosexual behaviors, males approaching the pair may be threatened or even attacked. \n \n When homosexual bonding does occur in the absence of opposite sex pairs, members of such a pair often resist attempts to 'convert' them back into heterosexual relationships. Even when deprived of their bonded partner, white-fronted Amazon parrots will not revert, and long-eared hedgehogs have refused heterosexual partners for as long as two and a half years, much of their natural lifetime. In the case of Stellar's sea eagles and female barn owls, both housed without opposite sexed members of their species, homosexual pair bonds among females were strong enough that when inseminated, they coparented the chicks that resulted. \n \n Homosexual bonds can be tight. Among male rhesus macaques, crab-eating macaques, bottlenosed dolphins, cheetahs and black-headed gulls with homosexual bonded partners, the members of the pair exhibited considerable distress at being separated from their partners. In all cases, the individuals ignored opposite sex partners offered them, and showed considerable joy and exhuberance at the reintroduction of their partners.\n \n http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm\n \n http://www.salon.com/it/feature/199...15featurea.html\n \n\n \n And another by JakeCJB: \n \n \nIt appears most animal same-sex activity occurs with mounting...\n \n Affectionate activity often leads to, or is inseparable from, overtly sexual behavior--defined here as any contact between two or more animals involving genital stimulation. Stumptail and Crab-eating Macaques, for example, kiss their same-sex partners during sexual mounting. In fact, mounting is the most common type of sexual behavior found in homosexual contexts: one animal climbs on top of the other in a position similar to heterosexual intercourse, usually from behind in a front-to-back position (that is, one animal mounted on the back of the other). More than 95 percent of mammal and bird species use this position, for both male and female homosexual interactions.\n http://print.google.com/print/doc?isbn=0312192398\n \n Even if it is for power with some, it is still natural. \n \n If animals are monolithic, I suppose we have a disorder for our monogamous pairings which we strayed into. Bi-sexuality is the norm in bonobos, which are closely related to us. We are also the only species which adapts to the environment by using tools we fashion with our own hands. How unnatural of us.\n \n\n \n Just a few that I found. \n \n But, I would tend to agree with Joe in that it's highly doubtful that Jaaaman would ever give into the facts placed in front of him.\n It's Jaaaman's perogative to ignore these facts, but he doesn't have the right to insist our laws reflect his ignorance.",

It may be genetic, but there's no good reason for homosexuality from a evolutionary standpoint. If it follows the trend of other characteristics in the human race (or animals in general), it will eventually disappear from the species as it doesn't do anything to protect or propogate the species.\n\n \n That is a possibility, but it does not necessarily follow. Allow me to explain. First, in evolution, not all traits which are harmful are selected away. For example, let us look at sickle-cell anemia. This disease is very common in Africans but not in Americans. The reason for this is evolution! Hopefully you all remember your Mendelian genetics and Punnett Squares.\n \n Sicke-cell anemia is recessive, not dominant. So let's represent the trait using the letters S and s. This means that anyone with the genes SS or Ss doesn't have sickle-cell anemia, but anyone with the genes ss does. In America, natural selection has weeded out pretty much all of the s genes, the ones that cause sickle-cell anemia. This means that most people here are SS reproducing with SS resulting in only offspring of SS. In Africa, however, most people are Ss; two Ss people reproducing would have children that are 25% likely to be SS, 50% likely to be Ss, and 25% likely to be ss. \n \n So why would natural selection not have weeded out that s gene in Africa as it did in America? Well it is because the gene is tied to something else; as it happens anyone who is heterozygous with the sickle-cell gene (anyone who has Ss) is immune to malaria. Malaria has been a much greater problem in Africa than in America, and because of this, people with the genes Ss have been more able to reproduce than people with the SS genes (people with the SS genes would never have children who are immune to malaria). \n \n That is a very simple case; if sexual orientation is genetic, it is likely caused by a variety of genes, not just one. But should sexual orientation be at least partially genetic, homosexuality may have been maintained through evolution because because some heterozygous condition of it is beneficial to survival.\n \n It seems less likely, that homosexuality has survived because it is evolutionarily beneficial to the survival of the human species. It certainly may be the case that having a small subset of a human population which is attracted to members of the same sex is beneficial to the survival of that population. This group could perhaps exist to balance out families in subsocieties and subcultures where the number of males is greater or less than the number of females by a significant amount. These additional same-sex families could therefore have served to take in children who found themselves parentless, for whatever reason. It may further have been that in human societies, it was beneficial to have some members who did not need to care for children so that they might advance society in some other fashion.\n \n What the future holds for homosexuality is anyone's guess, but it does not indicate the most morally correct method of handling gay rights today.",
