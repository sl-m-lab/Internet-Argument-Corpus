   "Lone senator blocks unemployment benefit extensions - CNN.com\n \n \nWashington (CNN) -- The Senate adjourned Friday without approving extensions of cash and health insurance benefits for the unemployed, as well as a handful of other federal programs that run out Sunday, after a lone senator insisted that Congress pay for the $10 billion package.\n\n \n WOW. So there IS somebody in the senate who understands that you have to actually PAY for stuff. Amazing.\n \n \nDemocrats argued that the safety net funds are classified as \"emergency\" and therefore don't need to be paid for by cutting spending elsewhere or raising taxes.\n\n \n This is one of the biggest loads of monkey feces that the folks in washington have ever thrown at us. They wait until a couple of days before the thing expires to vote for it so they can classify it as an \"emergency\" and bypass annoying things like the CBO assessments.\n \n \nIn addition to funding unemployment insurance and the COBRA health insurance program for people who have lost their jobs, the bill would prevent a scheduled 21 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. \n \n Those cuts will technically go into place when doctors' offices open Monday morning. But because there is a two-week delay processing Medicare payments, a short-term lapse of the program is unlikely to affect payments, according to experts in the medical community and a Senate Finance Committee aide.\n \n Likewise, unemployment benefits could be delayed, but if Congress acts next week, as expected, the impact is likely to be minor, according to a Labor Department analyst. That's because Congress will likely approve the funds retroactively to make up for the missing days.\n \n An aide to Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus confirmed that the Senate will try to pass the funds retroactively.\n\n \n Hopefully this will not happen and the bill will end up dead.\n \n I do not necessarily oppose unemployment insurance programs. For the most part I think that they are a relatively good idea. Unemployment should not be necessary, but since most americans apparently do not have the sense that god gave to a little green apple, they do not save any money since apparently it does not occur to them that their job may not be entirely permanent. Like most social welfare programs, I am willing to grudgingly go along with it because it keeps sheeple at home watching television instead of robbing those of us who are productive as we try to go about our daily lives at gunpoint. \n \n BUT COME ON. Unemployment benefits were never meant to last for years on end and they SHOULDNT. If you give people unemployment insurance for months and months and months, it prevents labor market corrections that NEED to occur. Those labor market corrections that NEED to occur but do not will keep other corrections that NEED to occur from happening. Otherwise you are essentially building a bigger bubble on top of the little one.",
