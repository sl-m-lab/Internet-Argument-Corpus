   "Current US policy is moving towards a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese products. With the exception of a few, inefficient but politically protected industries, the US produces few of the consumer goods we now import from China. What we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the Chinese doubled their prices.\n \n Does anyone think the US public, with stagnated wages, understands that move will be a substantial direct increase in their cost of living? Is the administration counting on blind patriotism for public approval of again having their wallets lifted?\n \n Or, does anyone else see this as a move to increase consumer spending in an effort to keep expanding the internal transaction driven GDP? As in the net difference from wholesale to retail price, our usual crisis management style in lieu of long-range planning. \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050526/ap_on_bi_ge/us_china_trade",

What in the hell is \"national capital investment for infrastructure\" have to do with this debate? Absolutely nothing. I spent enough time in the business world to know **** from shinola. \n\n \n \n national capital investment for infrastructure= simple concept. It is essentially making capitol investments in your infrastructure, i.e makign sure there is plenty of power to go around (for factories, etc...), investing in the creation of shipping facilites (land and sea based), commerical hubs, since commercial areas have MUCH greater utility requirements from electricity to sewage to garbage disposal than other areas. Without this public level investment, there is no such thing as industrial expansion. Building a factory in an area where you cannot get suitable electircity to run it is an exercise in futility, or an area where there is no means to ship your finished goods.\n \n For example, Gujarat is indias largest port. It has the capacity to handle 39 MMTPA. It also has no deep draft berths, which means that it can not take any really BIG ships. \n \n Shanghai Harbor on the other hand has the capacity to handle 340 MMTPA and EVERY large berth is deep draft capable. China has 4 other ports capable of handling over 300 MMTPA. \n \n Look at electrical infrastructure. India has a 1.5 MW cap on electrical services, and you can only get that in 2% of the country. China will drop you a 10 MW service anywhere in the country, and can do a 500 MW service in over 30% of the country. \n \n It would take 30 years for india to be able to produce even 1/10 of what the chinese do. The chinese produce more goods for export yearly than india, pakistan, turkey, mexico, syria, iran, israel, korea (N and S), taiwan and singapore COMBINED. Even if those nations listed above started RIGHT NOW with a series of rapid industrial upgrades, it would take them 15 years to be able to equal china in production. \n \n \nDaewoo already shot down his own argument and I highlighted that in a previous post.\n\n \n How so? Becuase I fail to see a 27.5% tariff on goods that they are making an average of 200% on to be significant? Face it, MM, 27.5% out of a 200% average profit is NOTHING. You are talking about a mosquito biting an elephant here. \n \n We are still waiting to be dazzled with your business pedigree.

Positive GDP growth numbers are the finger in the endangered dike of consumer confidence. \n \n I haven't read the bills, they're still in committee, but doubt trade name components from Japan, etc. would be included. And let's not forget many Ford, GM and Chrysler new vehicle assembly parts are from China. Right now the issue is centered on textiles and furniture. If the US and EU did force the issue, and be in violation of WTO agreements, a trade war could quickly spread throughout the world. The first big loser in such a conflict would be the US as other nations would quickly dry up treasury purchases while they watched the USD evaporate to offset tariffs until interest rates were increased to a point of, well, we really don't want to go there.\n \n The danger is not the Yuan.

Pretty simple, engage brain and expound on details. Forget the **** like blanket statements of China's accounting system being out of whack when it's obvious you don't have a clue about a subject, just mouthing something you've read or heard from a public media source. Most people involved in economics, finance and investing rely on paid, private subscriptions or current education from objective, non-political sources for their news. And it isn't cheap. If you wish to continue sounding like a buffoon with your media-inspired sales propaganda, that is your privilege, but knock off the personal slurs. You're becoming a troll. Genuine \"devil's advocates\" generally identify themselves as such out of respect for etiquette and courtesy, while trolls dismiss etiquette and courtesy altogether.\n\n \n That's an oxymoron to claim that \"paid, private subscriptions\" are objective. They are anything but. I've lost more money listening to experts than I could count. The WORST mistake I ever made was listening to paid experts and one was my next door neighborhood. He also talked up China well over a decade ago and my money went into a rathole. I've had paid subscriptions to economic newsletters and they are almost always wrong. If you want to learn about the stock market or other economic matters, put your own money on the line. You'll learn soon enough. \n \n You're claiming that I've been mean to you. You should read some of your own posts to me. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\n \n No one here should be deceived that anyone posting here (including me) has all the answers or some special insight into the future. We don't. Not one of us. Even the \"great\" Warren Buffett has recently gotten burned by investing in the Euro and against the dollar. So much for his crystal ball. \n \n Warren Buffett loses $310m by betting against the greenback\n \n The Times\n May 2, 2005\n By Patrick Hosking and Gabriel Rozenberg\n WARREN BUFFETT has lost $310 million (\u00a3162 million) betting against the US dollar. But the world's second-richest man and best-known investment guru is undeterred and continues to position Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, for dollar weakness...\n \n \n http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/14457\n ---------------------------------------------------\n And if you actually think that China's banking system is sound, you are the one who is smoking something. Check this out (there are many more saying the same thing.)\n \n May 2, 2004\n OP-ED COLUMNIST\n Let Us Pray\n By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN\n \n TOKYO\n \n Here's what I learned in Tokyo: If you're the leader of Japan, America, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines or the European Union and you're not going to bed each night saying the following prayer for China, then you're not paying attention:\n \n \"Dear Heavenly Father, please keep the leader of China, President Hu Jintao, healthy and on an even keel. Please see to it that he moves steadily and carefully toward restructuring the Chinese banking system and ridding it of its huge overhang of bad loans and corruption, before there is a real meltdown that would be felt around the world. Give him the wisdom to cool the overheated Chinese economy without creating a recession that would prompt China to stop importing like crazy and start just exporting like crazy. And Father, forgive us for all the bad words we used in recent years to describe China's leaders - terms like `Butchers of Beijing.' We did not mean it. We meant to say `Bankers of Beijing,' because their economy is now fueling growth all over Asia, bolstering Japan and sucking up imports from everywhere. May China's leaders live to 120, and may they enjoy 9 percent G.D.P. growth every year of their lives. Thank you, Father. Amen.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n and this little snippet:\n \n The most striking thing about being in Asia today is hearing how much more important China's growth engine has become for companies all across the region - and well beyond it. When Chinese authorities told banks last week to cut back their wild lending, commodity prices and stock markets tumbled all over the world. News that China is having regular blackouts because it can't buy enough crude oil is helping push up gasoline prices the world over.\n \n (I posted this over a year ago in another forum and this is the complete article. The original link is no longer active. So I am hardly a newcomer to this subject.)\n \n http://www.whistlestopper.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-10390.html",

You seem to have a thing about \"cutting and pasting\" as though it diminishes the argument. I cut and paste because I wanted to show what others who have studied these issues have had to say. I won't cut and paste this, but this problem is not something that I concocted out of thin air. It has been written about extensively. This is a good summary. While I won't cut and paste it I will post the link. You can debate it if you will. I'm not going to try to outreason someone like this true expert who actually knows what he is talking about.

I can't see how Europe with all of its problems, an anemic economy and political problems coming out of their ears is going to have a strong currency if there is no growth.

As I said, I'm not impressed. You may have made a pile of money in your life but you haven't learned much in the way of economics. I just posted two links to two excellent articles in Business Week in my post above that explained in exquisite detail why China is on such shaky ground. (I didn't post the articles themselves because your buddy complained about my \"cutting and pasting.\") I went on to say that I was not going to regurgitate what someone else has already said; someone who is truly expert, and someone who is better able to articulate the facts than I could. I take it that you didn't bother to read those before you replied. I would have been most interested in your take and rebuttal. Having seen none, I take it that you have none. \n \n I once made a comment here about transporting vehicles at a local Ford dealer. Suffice it to say that I did not make my living transporting vehicles in my former life. I've done this exactly twice. It is not my living. It is irrelevant.\n \n Let me give you some timeless advice. Don't get too big for your britches and try getting off your high horse and mingle with the common man without all of the technical mumbo-jumbo. Even Alan Greenspan doesn't do that. (You may have heard of him.) Your so-called pedigree or business acumen doesn't give you a license to dispense nonsense.\n ------------------------------\n I am going to make one exception as to your request about my background. I will tell you something about my investing history.\n \n And if you want to comment about these companies I will discuss with you and possibly even appreciate your insight. I purchase these stocks through Scott Trade. I'll use the stock symbols.\n \n ADP, C, CSCO, DELL, EMC, F, HDI, INTC, MSFT, PFE, SPY, WMT. These are all large cap companies. If I had it to do over, I would have never invested in Pfizer or EMC, or most of the tech stocks. I listened to the advice of others when I should have been doing my homework. And I regard the advice of financial \"experts\" as worthless or even downright dangerous to one's net worth. And \"Pompous\" Bob Brinker gives me a pain in the butt. If I had anything to do over in my life I would have gotten stock investing down pat. On that basis I have done poorly. For the average layman it is probably best to just invest in a good mutual fund like Vanguard's S&P index fund.",

   "You are really kind of losing me here. In 1994 I paid $999 for a 22 cubic foot refrigerator by Amana. This year I bought a new Amana 26.5 cubic foot refrigerator by Amana. I paid $989 for it.

They didn't even bother trying to sell them in Canada. Dealers could get Canadian retail price for one and two year old trucks just by changing the dash to imperial and sending them to auction across the border. It was a full fledged cottage industry until the Loonie started shooting up and taking the wind out of their sales. The used market for trucks has dried up considerably as a result. \n \n I was actually offered a \"free truck\" when I was buying by one of the auto brokers here in town. I buy the truck, as he spec'd it out, and in one year (Ford requires that all trucks be registered in Canada for one year before they can be exported), I give it back to him with under 40,000 kms and he gives me another new one. I just continually make the payments. It was a sweetheart deal actually, but I had to make payments on a loaded diesel, and it was more than I wanted to spend, on top of that, I was concerned about exactly what happened, and being stuck with a truck I didn't really want.\n \n As for prices, I order what I want, and pay cash at fleet rate through the my company, so I'm quite certain that I won't get a better deal anywhere.

We have more millionaires per capita than we have ever had in our history. We have the highest home ownership than we have ever had. If not for Iraq we might actually be able to balance the budget (we should regardless). Your implied argument seems to be that this standard of living cannot be sustained and we will inevitably have a lower standard of living because we are no longer producing most of our manufactured goods. In view of the fact that we have a low unemployment rate (and likely to go still lower), what are all of these people doing for a living? How is it that they are able to sustain their high standards of living? Is that all going to be swept away one way by a catastrophic financial collapse? We've been hearing for years that we are one or two years away from financial ruin and the next great depression will be on us. Somehow it never seems to happen. \n \n What am I missing here? What do you think is going to happen to our economy and if you ran things, what policies would you put into place to correct these deficiencies?\n\n \n \n \n Your naiton is either making money or loosing it. We are loosing it. there is no question of that. Even just looking at official trade numbers (which discount several important expenditures) shows this clearly.\n \n What you are seeing when it coes to new millionares, etc.. is the inevitable move to a two tiered system that comes with a service based economy. It is essnetially economically neutral for the nation. It is simply a matter of shiffiling money around internally.",

Even just looking at official trade numbers (which discount several important expenditures) shows this clearly.\n \n\n \n For me a look at GDP components from 2000 on for both the US and China (or anyone else) is a pretty simple example of national fiscal direction. 2000 was our last year of gradual decline as an industrial nation, which began in the 1980s. From 2001 on, the shift from domestic manufacturing expansion gross dollars to consumer and government consumption has been dramatic with a corresponding increase in imports. Government expenditures facilitated by debt have tripled in that period, capital formation is unchanged and our tax base is in process of deterioration. We're dissipating our national wealth at an alarming rate with no foreseeable change. We're shoveling it out the door, replacing it with internal transactions and that means expanding the money supply with no new wealth entering the system.",

What policies do you implement?\n \n I.E. Would you slap on big tariffs as per Pat Buchannan? Would you simply mandate that our trade be equalizied and no more trade deficits? Do you immediately balance the budget and no more deficits. Do you prohibite mortgages that have low down payments? Do you mandate domestic content in all manufactured goods in the U.S. such as the Amana refrigerator that you cited? Do we refuse to accept Chinese goods? Stop doing business with them?

   "\n \n Again, what would you do if you have the power to wave your magic wand and change things for the better as you see it?\n\n \n I'd throw us into a deep economic recession, depression if necessary, to get the standard of living in line with our internal transaction based economy without further endangering our future. That would include requiring all union, civil service, SS, military retirement and social service COLAs to swing both ways, reduce the military to a defense posture and return the national guard to deal with inevitable civil violence. No need to send jobs off-shore, we have an adequate labor force here, they just haven't realized their true worth in a global economy. No different than any other remedy; repair the pain and move on without it. Very simple to achieve, I'd just publish real, unpolished numbers and let consumer confidence take its course. Basically a corporate turn-around, conserve as much cash as possible, use debt in a judicial manner, get rid of the deadwood and contingent liabilities while shaping market direction and goals. As a true fiscal conservative and Republican, I'm not afraid to admit I don't care about the little people nor do I have aspirations to make the history books.

   "No doubt China is a major player, and will continue to become stronger on the global stage. As has been mentioned earlier in this thread, Chinese demand for products such as steel, iron ore, and coal has sky rocketed in the recent past, and Australia has capitalized on this increased demand. Contracts for supplying China with natural gas valued at $30Bn+ have also been sealed. The Chinese have indeed been pumping resources into infrastructure, and it is starting to pay off. \n \n I am not a fan of tariffs. Most of the time they are used to protect inefficient sectors of the economy, industries which really represent a misallocation of resources. But what has been said is true, that the US don't have large industries in the same areas of goods and services that the Chinese are importing, it does make this look like a money grabbing exercise because their is no domestic industry to protect. \n \n The Australian Government, in conjunction with the Chinese, have set up joint committies to discuss a Free Trade Agreement between the two countries. It's exciting that some foreign economies are starting to perk up a little because we were getting kind of lonely. ;)",
