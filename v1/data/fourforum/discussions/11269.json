   "While our troops relinquish their positions in Iraq, our politicians work out a new \"victorious plan\" of Iran's seizure!\n To tell the truth recent desertion of 1,300 soldiers during military operation in Basra shows that our Iraqi military contingent is demoralized and atrophied to the last degree. But we have never heard about it. It looks like our officials are passing over it in silence, because they are fast in preparing military operations in Iran. As I know Pentagon is going to invest over $900 billion for developing new weapons and equipment now! It is whispered that our military plan to spend over $335 billions for Iran campaign. I can't understand it! \n How long will we be tolerant to such dangerous line of our present leaders' policy when ones line their pockets while the others have to suffer?",

Now only half the path (to its destruction) remains,\" an editorial in the conservative Keyhan newspaper declared. \n \n \"It was proven that, by means of an offensive operation that need not be equal to Israel's moves, it is possible to neutralize the Zionist navy,\" the article said triumphantly. \n \n 'Great war not far off' \n \n It continued: \"Just as in one 33-day war more than 50 percent of Israel was destroyed, and the hope of its supporters for the continued life of this regime was broken, it is likely that in the next battle, the second half will also collapse.\" \n \n \"On that day... Jordan will not be able to prevent the Jordanian Islamists from operating through the long Jordan-Palestine border, and the millions of Egyptian Islamists... will not let the Sinai-Israel border remain quiet, and the Syrian Golan Heights will not remain as a (mere) observer of the battle. That day is not so far off.\"\n \n The Resalat newspaper struck a similarly bellicose tone with an editorial entitled \"Preparations for the Great War.\" \n This is the reality of the threat that Iran poses to Israel and the USA. So tell me, what kind of American Patriot would defend such a Country that would seek to deny Israel their right to exist?",
