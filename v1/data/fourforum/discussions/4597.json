White men don't get it because we have been at the top for so long that we can't imagine another way of doing things. We live our white caucasion lives. Some blacks turn out very successful, and we accept them for it because they adherred to our policies and succeeded, but everyone's culture in this country is different. Our policies shouldn't be the only policies. Our way of living shouldn't be the only way to live well.\n \n You cannot expect minorities to want to fit into the white dominated world and so we either overlook them, or they choose not to accept us.

This is not about racism, but about the sad state of affairs within the Black community. It is no more or no less than what Bill Cosby has stated.\n Blacks comprise only app. 13% of America's population yet:\n 1. That 13% accounts for 80% of all violent crime.\n 2. The number one cause of death in Black males between the ages of 17 and 40 is gun-shot wounds.\n 3. That same 13% of the population comprises 50% of all new aids cases in America.\n 4. One half of that 13% (Black males) make up over 40% of America's prison population.\n I could go on and on, but to what end? The truth is that there is a huge problem in the Black community with drugs and crime. I personally do not believe that poverty is the root cause of crime. There may be many excuses for these problems, but very few real reasons. Some people just don't give a damn about themselves or other people and intend to prove it. I believe that a lack of decent morals and rampant drug abuse in the Black community is at the root of most of their problems. The fact that 70% of the children born in the Black community are illegitimate bolsters my theory that a lack of decent morals is prevalent in that community.\n I believe that liberals are largely the cause of these problems. President Johnson's Great Society comes to mind as one of the greatest failures in American history. Affirmative action and welfare does not liberate, it enslaves people. That failed social exercise made a whole race of Americans quit caring about themselves and their families.\n The solution to the problem is within the heart of every individual regardless of their skin color.

   "The issue hunter avoids is that a lot of those statistics can be exacerbated by racist policing. I would be interested to see statistics weighted by socio-economic group, then the pciture might be clearer.\n\n \n No, it can't. You could possibly explain away a few percentage points based on claims of racist policing, but nowhere NEAR enough to explain a difference on the scale hunter is pointing out. The policies of every polivce department in the coutry are available to the public. Any policy even approaching racist is bound to bring quick and severe reprocussions from the public. Additionally, almost all states attorney generals office have auditing and compliance sections for law enforcement agencies that respond to charges of racism in any LE agency. Besides, if it was just a question of raqcist policing, you would see a disporportianal number of unjustified arrests of blacks, which does not seem to be the case.\n \n In order for the problem to be explained away as racist poilicing, you would essentially need a massive conspiracy. Police departments, from the chief down to the guy who mops the floor would all have to be involved and would all have to be willing to keep their mouths shut about the unwritten racist policies. The attorney generaly office would have to be in on it, as would the local prosecutors and judges, as well as anybody who sits a jury. They would all have to understand that black defendants MUST be convicted in order for it to not appear that racist policing is going on.\n \n If you break crime down by socio-economic group, you will find that poor people commit more crimes that middle class or upper class. You will also find that there are a LOT mroe poor whites than poor blacks, but that poor blacks still commit FAR more crimes.\n \n Personally, I am a white guy who lives in a small town in the middle of kansas. There are maybe 10 black families in town. 3 of them are here becuase I hired them and they moved here to work. My knowledge fo the black community is not especially extensive and is limited soley to middle class and upper middle class blacks. They are where I get my informaiton regarding the black community and problems int he black community. \n \n 2 of the 3 black guys that work for me started out int he ghetto. They both take a Bill Cosby type view as far as blacks and crime. The blachk community ios self destructing, and there is nobody to blame for it but the individual and the poor choices they make. They have the educational opportunities, they just fail to take them. Oddly enough, I have heard at least on of my black friends blame part of the problem on rap music (scary, since huinter seems to have drawn the same conclusion). His outlook is basically that black kids listen to rap, and idolize the rappers, many of whome are criminals or write songs glorifying violence and crime. I know he personally does not allow his kids to listen to rap music. \n \n Accoridng to nearly every black person I have spoken on the subject to seems to blame these problems not on any form of racism, but instead on the fact that the black community has largely failed to integrate itself into american society. Other minority groups do not seem to have this problem. Now, the question is, do we change american culture as a whole to better fit the black community into it, or do we help the black community change to better fit in. Since a large protion of the black community is poor, and they seem to spend an awful lot of time shooting at each other, stealing, and smoking crack, I would suggest that our efforts be aimed at helping to integrate the balck community into american culture, not twisting american culture to fit the black community. The black guys that I know who started out in the ghetto seem to agree that bringing people out of the ghetto is much preferable to turning the entire country into one big ghetto so the poor blacks feel at home wherever they are.",

Are more poor whites in rural settings vs urban? \n \n There is so much that impacts crime - poverty, upbringing, effective law enforcement, education, opportunities, self-esteem, a willingness to work, positive role models, moaking sure there is stuff for kids to do and places for them to go. It's a complex issue (which is why I respond to the statement below).\n \n \nOddly enough, I have heard at least on of my black friends blame part of the problem on rap music (scary, since huinter seems to have drawn the same conclusion).

There are rappers with a positive message, even Christian rappers. \n \n I listen to rap. I don't committ crime. My kid listens to rap - he doesn't either. \n \n Know what you are listening to, have a reason for listening to it, and dialogue with your kids. That will do more than censoring.

Do you have any solid figures or is this speculation? (asking because I`m curious)\n\n \n Admittedly the numbers I have on this are nearly 5 years old. They were given as part of a handout by some federal schmuck trying to sell after school programs in order to help curb youth crime rates. Youth crime rates oin our community are virtually non existant. This is an agricultural based community. Kids are out plowing fields after school. They do not need an intramural basketball league.\n \n the question of socioeconomic statu seems to be a vlaid one, though according to the figures I have (which, as I said before, are old), poor whites outnumber poor blacks by nearly 5 to 1, and poor blacks STILL commit more crimes overall than pooor whites. For violent crimes, they commit almost 5x as many. Oddly enough, when it comes to youth crimes, most youth crimes comitte by whites are comitted by middle class kids. \n \n As far as physical segregation, I have never seen any figures on that. I think that it would be very difficult to prove causality in any event.",
