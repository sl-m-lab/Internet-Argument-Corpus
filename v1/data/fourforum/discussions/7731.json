If directly attacked, the revenue lost due to decreased oil transport capacity becomes a moot point, leaving them with no reason NOT to shut down the gulf. \n \n There is simply no military solution regarding Iran. We have 130,000 troops well within range of their missiles, only a small percentage of which would actually have to reach their target to wipe out US presence in the ME. 2 strategically sunk tankers, well within Irans capability, would close down the persian gulf completely.
