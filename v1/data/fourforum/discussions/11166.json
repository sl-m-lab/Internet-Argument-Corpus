If you study the agreement between the US and NK, it's essentially we don't do anything until you finish your end of the bargain.

Hamas acts as a relief agency, medical provider, education provider and has a military arm. Most Americans see Hamas as only the military arm. Hence why views are generally screwed up. They only have one part of the puzzle. Hamas has to know it can never win a conventional war against Israel and any NCBR weapon would bring the end to Hamas. By offering them legitimacy for giving up their military wing, there is potential for peace. Heck, some established parties in Malaysia have roots in terrorism.",

He does not need permission from our XXXXX in chief.\n \n\n Had he played the cards in the proper order, he could have been sent by GWB to talk to Hamas.\n\n \n Frankly, your argument here is so mind numbingly stupid and unamerican that I am out of responses. \n \n \nHe came back all proud of his news of a possible 10 year truce (contingent upon Israel's giving back land).\n\n \n So, in other words he managed to accomplish more in an afternoon, acting as a private citizen, than the president has in the last 8 years. \n \n \n\n Why 10 years?

He wants it so bad, he is willing to interfere with the official policies of a sitting administration rather than elect a new one to do his bidding.\n\n \n I think that we should talk to hamas as well, and frankly do not see the need to negotiate. We need to just tell them \"Israel is an illegally occupying force, is guilty of numerous, documented war crimes. Even THEIR OWN COURTS have found the Israeli government in violation of multiple binding treaties. \n \n Then we give Israel 30 days to withdraw and come into compliance with UNSC resolutions. Then we introduce a NEW resolution that requires that they disarm since they have proven time and again that they are more than willing to carry out illegal military strikes against other nations in the region.\n \n THEN, we start talking reparations. \n \n \nOh I see. We as Americans have a right to act in the face of what we see as unjust situations? That is a prize winner. Anarchy would prevail were we all given that right.\n\n \n I would argue that we have the RESPONSIBILITY to act in the case of an unjust situation. Silence is the enemy of democracy and the greatest ally that any tyrant ever had.

He does not represent our government. He does not claim that he represents our government. He is a private citizen, which means that he can pretty much talk to whoever the hell he wants. He does not need permission from our XXXXX in chief.\nWe don't have a XXXXX in chief, daewoo. Your attempted humor is unnecessary.\n \n \n\n Frankly, your argument here is so mind numbingly stupid and unamerican that I am out of responses. \nYour argument is self-righteously judgemental and only barely humorous. \n \n \n \n\n So, in other words he managed to accomplish more in an afternoon, acting as a private citizen, than the president has in the last 8 years.\nI don't agree that he has accomplished anything positive. Getting a verbal commitment from a known liar is not really improving things...just getting favorable press for Jimmy Carter...the worst U.S. President of this century. \n \n \n \n\n Because there are issues on the table other than the land. The 10 years gives them an opportunity to work out the rest of the details. \nYou must be in the know. What are the other details? Please tell us what Carter has told you since he returned. \n \n \n \n \n\n I think that we should talk to hamas as well, and frankly do not see the need to negotiate. \nI agree. We should talk with words like...\"We do not negotiate with terrorists.\"\n \n If you see no need to negotiate, why do you praise Carter for doing so?\n \n \nWe need to just tell them \"Israel is an illegally occupying force, is guilty of numerous, documented war crimes. \nI'm not up on who's got the longest list of war crimes. I do not doubt that there have been none on either side.\n \n I do not agree that Israel is an illegally occupying force. They occupy land that they claimed after wars they did not initiate. They gave back Gaza once and were rocketed the next week. I concur with Israel's distrust of the surrounding neighbors and Hamas...that gentle group that has vowed to exterminate those in the legal State of Israel.\n \n \nEven THEIR OWN COURTS have found the Israeli government in violation of multiple binding treaties. \nI said already that there have been war crimes by both sides. Hamas and the other gutless bastard terrorists that strap on bombs and kill innocent children commit war crimes every day. I doubt you'll find any Jews doing that.\n \n \n\n Then we give Israel 30 days to withdraw and come into compliance with UNSC resolutions. Then we introduce a NEW resolution that requires that they disarm since they have proven time and again that they are more than willing to carry out illegal military strikes against other nations in the region.\nDisarming Israel equates to genicide. They would be slaughtered.\n \n \n \n\n THEN, we start talking reparations. \n...to Israel? Yes, I agree. \n \n \n \n\n I would argue that we have the RESPONSIBILITY to act in the case of an unjust situation. Silence is the enemy of democracy and the greatest ally that any tyrant ever had. \n Who are you quoting? That sounds much like \"For evil to prevail, all that is required is for good men to do nothing.\"\n \n \n \n\n Obviously the act needs to be proportional to the perceived injustice, and all available options need to be examined prior to resorting to violence, but at the end of the day, the second amendment is there for when the system has failed. \nWanting to disarm Israel and speaking positively of the Second Amendment in the same breath...\n \n \n \n \n \n\n He is. It is you, and the Bush administration, that is not in this case.\nNo. He is bucking the system. When a sitting President requests a former President to stand down, that former President should do so. Carter is a stage master, just looking out for his own image.",

In the invasion and occupation, israel was 100% the belligerent operating illegally. They owe hundreds of billions in reparations. \n \n \nI agree. We should talk with words like...\"We do not negotiate with terrorists.\"\n\n \n Then we will LOSE and the terrorists will destroy us. It is that simple. The war we are fighting is impossible to win. No nation has EVER won a 4th gen war. It simply cannot be done. It is impossible. The only way anybody \"wins\" is to sit down at the negotiating table. This is what the British had to do with the IRA despite the fact that the British had full possession, occupation, and a large military presence in the conflict region. \n \n \n I'm not up on who's got the longest list of war crimes. I do not doubt that there have been none on either side.\n\n \n Palestinians are incapable of committing war crimes. Legally, war crimes cannot be committed by civilians, unless they are either in command of or responsible for the actions of military units. It is also questionable whether the belligerent in a conflict even has standing to bring war crimes charges against their victim. In the past there has been kind of a \"you attack illegally, you get what you get\" attitude...especially where civilian militias or resistance fighters are concerned. \n \n \nI do not agree that Israel is an illegally occupying force. They occupy land that they claimed after wars they did not initiate. They gave back Gaza once and were rocketed the next week. I concur with Israel's distrust of the surrounding neighbors and Hamas...that gentle group that has vowed to exterminate those in the legal State of Israel.\n\n \n Then your knowledge of Israels history re: military conflicts is just as lacking as your knowledge of the soviet invasion of afghanistan was. They DID initiate those wars, Jim. That is what you seem to be missing. \n \n Ironically enough, part of the problem here is the result of our conflict with the soviets. Prior to the 6 day war, Egypt shut down their border with Israel and deployed troops to keep israeli terrorists from continued attacks against Egypt. They told israel that if they did not stop supporting the terrorists that there would be military repercussions. Johnson stepped in and negotiated a settlement that essentially amounted to a \"cooling off\" period. As part of this, the egyptians were required to shut down their early warning systems and all military radar units operating in the border region. This is what allowed israel to carry off the massive sneak attack that began the 6 days war (it is funny how many XXXXXX out there try to claim that israel was dragged into these conflicts, or that they did not initiate them, when so many of them started with sneak attacks by israel....in this case a massive attack less that 36 hours after signing a US brokered agreement that there would be no hostilities). \n \n WE now know...years later...that Johnson was enraged about this and when he originally ordered the US military to start moving in that direction it was NOT to support israel, but to force them back into their box so we could decide how terrible their punishment was going to be (Johnson did not like the idea that the US had been used as a pawn and that israel had signed a peace agreement with the intent of breaking it less than a week later). Contrary to the nonspiracy theories out there, THAT is why the liberty was sunk. Israle knew they were in big trouble and they were taking out the primary US intel platform in teh region.\n \n Then the Soviets, who for whatever reason thought we would be supporting israel in the conflict moved in and started to aid the Arab states and the Egyptians, so we switched our gameplan rather than end up on the same side as the soviets. \n \n No matter how you slice it, there is absolutly NO QUESTION that israel DID initiate those wars. None at ALL. \n \n \nI said already that there have been war crimes by both sides. Hamas and the other gutless bastard terrorists that strap on bombs and kill innocent children commit war crimes every day. I doubt you'll find any Jews doing that.\n\n \n Not today. Israel was founded on terror and jewish terrorists were the big problem for the first part of its history. Today israel has modern weapons which makes it a LOT easier to slaughter civilians. In some cases they can do it by remote control. \n \n So the palestenians, who are fighting a superior force using insurgent tactics are gutless bastards but the israelis who drop bombs on civilians from 20,000 ft and shell refugee camps from miles away are not??\n \n \n\n Who are you quoting? That sounds much like \"For evil to prevail, all that is required is for good men to do nothing.\"\n\n \n I am quoting me. \n \n \nWanting to disarm Israel and speaking positively of the Second Amendment in the same breath...\n\n \n Nice try, Jim.

It seems one way to make a splash and get famous these days is to publicly speculate a really high death toll number in Iraq because, let's face it, it's what some in the anti-war movement WANT to be able to use as ammunition in the court of public opinion. You know, I'm against the war too, but I wish people wouldn't use exaggerated stats. We don't need to do that. It's bad enough without even exaggerating. Even the most \"high-end\" reports by organizations unfriendly to the Bush administration typically put the numbers at around 90,000. (http://www.iraqbodycount.org/) Heck, the whole population of Iraq is only around 27 million. It's funny how the really high-end guestimates stats tend to to vary wildly from opinion to opinion, as in, discrepancies sometimes of a quarter to half-a-million! Honestly, I suspect if I started a blog and claimed the count was up to a billion deaths, a good number of anti-war people would believe it.
