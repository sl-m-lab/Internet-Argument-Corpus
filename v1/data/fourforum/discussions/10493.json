Still, Savage DOES make some good points here and there but for the most part he's just a talking head.\n \n However, you have to keep in mind that these people are controversial because it pays the bills. Ann Coulter is a excellent example, even though she's a author.\n The more insane her comments the more money. Same goes for talk show hosts, Imus was a good example. I doubt they actually mean what they say, but they say it because it makes them rich. And that is a travesty to the actual ideology of Conservatism. \n \n IMO, Neoconservatism takes the worst from liberalism and the worst from Conservatism and puts them together where libertarianism takes the best and merges them.",
