   "http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/30/ukcrime1\n \n The gun shown here, a Webley, is up for sale in London for \u00a3150, one of hundreds of such weapons that are easily and cheaply available on the streets of the UK's big cities, a Guardian investigation can reveal.\n \n The variety of weapons on offer in Britain is extensive and includes machine guns and shotguns, as well as pistols and converted replicas. A source close to the trade in illegal weapons contacted by the Guardian listed a menu of firearms that are available on the streets of the capital.\n \n \"You can get a clean [unused] 9mm automatic for \u00a31,500, a Glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of MAC-10s,\" he said. \"Or you can get a little sawn-off for \u00a3150. They're easy enough to get hold of. You'll find one in any poverty area, every estate in London, and it's even easier in Manchester, where there are areas where the police don't go.\n \n \"People who use shotguns tend to be lower down the pecking order. There is less use of sawn-off or full length shotguns, and if a criminal wants street cred, he wants a self-loading pistol, a MAC-10 or an Uzi submachine gun.\"\n \n This week a man who ran a \"factory\" for converting replica weapons into working guns was jailed for life. Police believe the products of Grant Wilkinson's workshops were used in more than 50 shootings, including eight murders. His speciality was turning legally purchased MAC-10s into weapons that could fire live rounds, an increasingly common practice.\n \n According to David Dyson, a leading firearms consultant, it is possible to learn through the internet how to make a firearm, given a degree of skill, and converted deactivated weapons also feature in shootings.\n \n But it is the arrival of eastern European weapons that, alongside a homegrown industry in converting them, has contributed to the firearms glut. \"There has been an influx from eastern Europe and particularly from Poland, and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" said the source. \"In Liverpool docks, you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and they'll say OK and two weeks later, they will be there - and they are straight goers.\"\n \n According to Dyson, the latest \"weapon of choice\" is a Russian 8mm Baikal self-defence pistol, originally used for firing CS gas. \"They are legally sold in Germany and won't fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel, and replacing it with a rifled barrel,\" he said. \"After other small alterations, it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition. The replacement barrel is longer than the original, and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer, which is commonly sold as part of the package.\n \n \"There are hundreds of these floating around and hundreds have been seized,\" he said. \"They look the part as they are based on the Russian military Makarov pistol. If you are a 20-year-old drug dealer and you want a gun, that is what you will get and it will cost about \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500.\"\n \n \"The trends in firearms are driven by the suppliers,\" said Dyson. \"About two years ago, a supplier brought back hundreds of German-made revolvers, blank-firing pistols which can be bought legally in Germany. They were then converted and new cylinders made. They could then be sold for \u00a3700 to \u00a3800 when the supplier would have bought them for \u008060 and spent about \u00a330 on converting them.\"\n \n Home Office data shows that gun crime is up since last year, despite the recent doubling of sentences for possessing or supplying firearms. There were 9,803 firearms offences in England and Wales in the year to March 2008 with most in London, Manchester and the West Midlands.\n \n Most buyers are involved with drug dealing, the source said. Some are used to rob other dealers in crimes that go unreported, others are used as protection while a deal is under way. \"Someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it. They will have one guy who doesn't give a ####.\n \n \"Everyone wants to be a gangster now, mainly the kids. You have five or six in a little crew and one of them will be carrying. They want handguns - shotguns are too big and bulky. The sawn-off doesn't look so good but use a machine gun and you get known as a heavy guy. They have them just to be a chap on the street, to pose. Some of them walk around all day with a .38. It's 16-year-olds at it and it's getting like America, silly as it sounds.\"\n \n In terms of nationalities, the influx of eastern European criminals has changed the balance of power. \"Who's using the guns? The [Jamaican] Yardies' value for life was so minimal that they thought nothing of killing people,\" said the source. \"We don't like them, they have no moral code. But it's the Russians and the Polish and Albanians around now. They are bullies. They want to take over the flesh business. The Russians are cold-hearted ####ers. What they have been doing is following the card boys [who put cards advertising prostitutes in phone booths in central London] and then taking the girls hostage, armed if need be.\"\n \n Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, who has investigated some of London's most high profile shooting murders, said he believed the age of offenders was getting younger, and sometimes guns seemed to be used for the slightest reason.\n \n \"Playground squabbles are now being settled with guns,\" he said. \"And drug dealers are taking a policy decision to get youngsters to carry guns.\"\n \n He said guns could be purchased for a few hundred pounds in many parts of London. \"You can hire a gun for a period and, if the gun has already been used for a murder, the going rate comes down.\"\n \n While the conviction of Wilkinson was seen as a breakthrough, it is accepted that with the increased traffic between Britain and eastern Europe, stemming the flow of weapons remains an almost impossible task.\n \n \"Guns are always available,\" said Dyson. \"You can go to the former Soviet Union, or countries with less stringent regulations than ours, and although British Customs have their successes, many guns appear to be smuggled into the UK.\"\n \n Amnesties for people to hand over weapons are greeted with scepticism by criminals. \"The gun amnesties are meaningless,\" the source said. \"All you get handed in are guns from boys who wanted to be gangsters and then got a job or someone whose mother found it in their bedroom. If I had a gun, I wouldn't take part because, if I got pulled, what would I say - 'Oh, I'm just on my way to the amnesty.' Also if it gets out that you've given in your tool, people will think you're a wrong 'un.\"\n \n Few professional criminals would keep guns on their premises. \"Only silly people keep it in their homes. Normally, you have a 'keeper' a couple of miles away and some of them have been at it for 20 years. It's best to have an old fellow with no previous or a woman. You keep the ammunition separate because you'll get a much heavier sentence if you have them together.\"\n \n When guns are moved from place to place, a young woman is often used as the courier because there is less risk of her being stopped and searched.\n \n What is not in dispute is the devastating effect that the casual use of a gun over a minor argument can have on dozens of people. In December 2006, Sean \"Stretch\" Jenkins, 36, an amiable, 6ft 8in window-cleaner from south London, was shot dead at a party in Carshalton. His killer was a cocaine dealer called Joseph Greenland, a volatile man with a quick temper, who had apparently taken offence at something Jenkins said. The men had earlier been at a boxing night at Caesar's in Streatham, where there had been some fighting outside the ring. Greenland had left the party, driven home in his Range Rover, picked up a gun and returned to kill Jenkins in front of at least five witnesses, who were warned not to talk.\n \n None of the immediate witnesses gave evidence against Greenland, who had a reputation for threatening to \"annihilate\" anyone who crossed him, but there were traces of his DNA on a cigarette end and a wine glass at the party and his bragging about the shooting was to be his downfall. His recourse to a gun, for no other reason than some perceived slight, left Jenkins's six-year-old son without a father and saddened a wide network of friends and family. Greenland was jailed for life last week and will have to serve 30 years before he can be considered for parole.\n \n \"We got what we wanted,\" said the victim's mother, Maureen Jenkins, of the verdict and sentence last month. \"I went to the cemetery and said, 'Well, boy, I can put you to rest'.\"\n \n The detectives investigating the killing and the prosecution team that secured Greenland's conviction were \"marvellous\", she said. \"I shed tears every day and I probably will till the day I die. Why do these people have to kill for nothing? If they want to kill people, why don't they join the army? You don't ever think a shooting will happen in your life. It's all down to guns, just guns.\"\n \n The Guardian's source said that guns were becoming a first rather than a last recourse. \"A gun used to be used as a mediator; now everything is revolved with a gun. It's brought the heat on everyone. Before you would get a two [years jail sentence], now it's a five. It's getting like the US now, like The Wire. It's like a prediction of what will happen here. I think they all think they're playing Grand Theft Auto. It's madness out there.\"\n \n Well I guess that nationwide handgun ban is doing the trick then.",

It doesn't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept.\n \n \nGazza stated that guns are expensive.\n \n \n Not expensive enough, but enough to put them out of the range of small time punks.

I could make one if I wanted.... It wouldn't be very good, but it still means there's a supply. The point is that banning guns pushes the price up and reduces the avaliability of guns to the criminal classes, thus only the criminals with a lot of money will own them. Given that these criminals are more interested in the top levels of the drug trade and are more worried about each other, rather than knocking off a few ordinary people for thier wallets, society is safer as a whole.",

Just because some criminals have the ability to get hold of guns doesn't mean that you're going to be murdered. You seem very scared of being attacked. The point is that the practical effect of a ban is that it keeps the guns out of the hands of low level thugs, and thus makes it much less likely for you to be attacked and murdered with a gun.\n \n \nCall me strange if you want, but I thought the entire point of banning something was to make it completely inaccessible. We banned new machineguns from civilian ownership in 1986, nobody can get a new P90 through legal channels even if they're willing to pay $10,000 for it.\n\n \n The emphasis is the word legally. In this country you can't get handguns legally, even if you're willing to pay \u00a35,000. You have to obtain it illegally. I don't know what the going prices are for illegal arms in the US.\n \n \nIn the 1920s we banned alcoholic beverages, the idea was that the ban would end alcoholic consumption, not establish a caste system where only the rich could be drunk.\n\n \n What was the effect? Alcohol became confined to the top of the tree where the money was (ignoring basement stills for the moment). In crime terms, this is the same with a ban on guns. The guns become confined to the drug running gangs, and they don't go round shooting people for no reason. Not to mention that the gangs are easier to keep an eye on, than having to observe everyone.\n \n \nSo lemme see if I can get this straight.

What I said is that people are safer because you are unlikely to be attacked by someone with a gun, thus you not having one becomes irrelevant.

Thus only criminals will have access to guns, and thus your statement is flawed by default.\n\n \n Petty criminals, drug lords, it really makes no difference because it all boils down to one thing: the criminals are still armed, the innocent people aren't, and your claim is that society is safer with this method of doing things.\n \n I don't care what rank a criminal individual has, they're all the same to me; people who knowingly and willingly break the laws to get ahead through illegal channels. Trying to explain away the differences doesn't fly with me, they're all members of the same society class; criminals. And your statement still amounts to \"Criminals have guns, regular people don't, and society is safer this way\".",

   "Maybe you could supply stats that show the crime rates from 1987-1997 are considerably higher than crime rates for 1998-2008.\n\n \n The stats were provided on that other thread. I don't think they've changed in a few months...\n \n \nWhat was it, only one single case of a school shooting, which served as the basis for banning all handgun ownership over there?\n\n \n As I recall, the Dunblaine Massacre lead to the banning of all handguns.\n \n \nYou guys across the pond fully embraced the \"once is more than enough\" mindset when it came to banning guns to stop school shootings, but the same mindset doesn't work with assaults because they're a rare occurrence and not worth the trouble? You're holding two entirely contradictory beliefs at the same time.\n\n \n No, I'm saying that assaults should be dealt with, but that I shouldn't be scared of someone attacking me with a gun. The number of assaults using guns is very low. Why do we need guns to defend ourselves from something that is highly unlikely to happen?\n \n \nSo you're really no better off than we are. It seems the only real difference is that over here a criminal has a much better chance of dying at the hands of an intended victim.\n\n \n Apart from the fact that your crime rates are very much higher than ours. It seems that you have a higher chance of being killed...\n \n \nThey have gun ownership rates comparable with America, a more firearms-friendly culture than Britain, every adult of a certain age is issued genuine military firearms, and they still have lower crime rates than Britain. How do you explain that away? The only thing I can think of as a possible excuse is that the British are too sloppy to do it right.\n\n \n I don't see that it's something for me to explain. You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts. Too sloppy to do what right? You're not very good at explaining yourself.\n \n \nAnd in many instances you've proven that the obvious escapes you.\n\n \n Such as?\n \n \nNo I'm simply stating that making something illegal will only benefit criminals, not anyone else.\n\n \n Which implies that you support legalization of everything. I'm not sure why you carry on down this line. You can't follow the line that laws do no good, and then support the creation of laws to support that what you want. You either want to remove all laws, or you believe that laws perform a purpose. Either is fine, but you can't argue both.\n \n \nPetty criminals, drug lords, it really makes no difference because it all boils down to one thing: the criminals are still armed, the innocent people aren't, and your claim is that society is safer with this method of doing things.\n\n \n I'm saying that British society is safer as it is at the moment. If this inaccuracy is how you understand it, then I can't help. The point is that society is safer when there isn't a large quantity of guns in circulation. \n \n But think about what you said! Guns are ILLEGAL, thus anyone who obtains one is a CRIMINAL. This means that CRIMINALS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HAVE GUNS. Your statement implodes in a circle of fatuous logic.\n \n \nI don't care what rank a criminal individual has, they're all the same to me; people who knowingly and willingly break the laws to get ahead through illegal channels. Trying to explain away the differences doesn't fly with me, they're all members of the same society class; criminals. And your statement still amounts to \"Criminals have guns, regular people don't, and society is safer this way\". \n\n \n Ah, you're one of those people! You don't actually bother getting into the guts of a problem, you're just happy to class a group as homogenous even when they aren't. I'll go through this for you....\n \n If you restrict the number of guns, then guns become limited to those who have the money and the power to obtain them. As a rule these people are involved in drugs, or other illegal trades, and as such won't shoot ordinary people wantonly. Hopefully in time guns can be removed from thier hands as well, but to begin with this isn't possible. It also means that this leads to a reduction in guns in the lower eschelons of crime, making people safer.",

To put your logic six feet under, there's only one person you have to keep in mind: Al Capone. His illegal alcohol business thrived during the prohibition era.",
