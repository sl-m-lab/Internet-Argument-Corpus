   "I think the Americans do not deserve Obama, IMHO what they really deserve is a politician who is the spitting image of the average American: a bigot, an ignorant and a Bible thumper. Wouldn't it would be nice that the first black , sorry! African-American (father African, mother American) President was followed by a woman, what about this one : \n \n \nRight-wing radicals are already pinning presidential ambitions on a mother-of-five from Minnesota who calls herself a 'fool for Christ' and condemns Obama as a socialist at the head of a gangster regime\n \n She is a striking brunette with a decidedly outspoken attitude. She lambasts President Barack Obama as a socialist and has become the darling of America's right-wing activists who flock to her appearances. She is hated by liberals and loved by conservatives.\n Sarah Palin? Not quite. Meet Michele Bachmann, a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota who is being hailed as a new and increasingly powerful voice in American politics.\n Bachmann, at 53, is a darling of the so-called Tea Party movement, which has campaigned vociferously against healthcare reform, the economic stimulus package and legislation to combat climate change. Her followers have been behind mass rallies in Washington and smaller ones all over the country. She has emerged as one of the most visible politicians in America, frequently appearing on the conservative Fox News channel, whose hosts often champion her causes.\n She is part of an increasingly visible \"female brand\" of conservatism that is rising in America in the wake of the election of Obama. They include notable syndicated commentators such as Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter, whose dislike for liberals has grown ever more shrill in recent months. And, of course, Palin herself. She is still a giant of the political and media landscape and next week embarks on a book tour to sell her autobiography. It has already sparked a media frenzy, with a heavily hyped appearance on Oprah Winfrey's show, and become a huge bestseller on pre-orders alone.\n All these women express a mood of conservative discontent that is becoming increasingly vocal and, some experts warn, extreme. The Republicans have been kicked out of power in the White House and Congress. The party is becoming more white and southern at the same time as national demographic changes give power to other regions and minorities. Many Americans are also suffering in the recession. That is a grim picture but one that also makes many voters vulnerable to a talented rabble-rouser. \"They are tapping into grassroots frustration... they are charging up an already highly charged group of people,\" said Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. \n The politics espoused by Bachmann, Palin and others on the far right of the conservative movement warn darkly of Obama's intentions. They paint a picture of an America that is under threat from its own president. Bachmann has spoken of the possibility of the White House setting up \"re-education camps\" for America's youth. Palin once accused Obama of \"palling around\" with terrorists. To the many critics of this new breed of conservatism, people such as Bachmann and Palin are putting an attractive female face to a very ugly brand of politics.\n Even a cursory glance at her career reveals that this rising star has long trafficked in some extreme positions. In October last year Bachmann called some of her fellow congressmen anti-American. She has said Obama holds socialist views. She has attacked global warming by saying that carbon dioxide emissions are a natural part of the atmosphere. \"Carbon dioxide is not a harmful gas, it is a harmless gas,\" she said. She has fed into fears of a violent backlash against Obama by saying that \"having a revolution every now and then is a good thing\". She has spoken of \"gangster government\" in a speech viewed more than two million times on the internet. She has dubbed Obama's plans to increase AmeriCorps - a government volunteer service group - as a plan to forcibly indoctrinate young people. \"I believe there is a very strong chance that we will see young people put into mandatory service... there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people,\" she told an interviewer. Her language in opposing healthcare reform has been bloodcurdling. At a recent event in Colorado she told her audience: \"What we have to do today is make a covenant, to slit our wrists, be blood brothers on this thing. This will not pass. We will do whatever it takes to make sure this doesn't pass.\" She is also extremely socially conservative, strongly opposing abortion and gay marriage, and deeply religious. She has described herself as a \"fool for Christ\".\n\n \n The new wave of female firebrands striking fear into liberal America | World news | The Observer",

   "I am afraid, after reading the article below, that a gun crazy of the right, may one day attempt to assassinate President Obama. So many politicians have been gunned down in the land of the gun that is possible this may happen. \n \n ________________________________________________________________\n \n \"The loud, occasionally violent protests at public meetings held by US lawmakers to discuss health care reform highlight a deep, powerful and rather ugly current of angry, paranoid populism in American politics,\n \n The angry scenes - by now familiar to anyone who watches TV news - of lawmakers being heckled or shouted down by chanting protestors in their own districts, have spilled over into violence at only a handful of events, but passions are running high enough that some observers are dubbing the congressional recess 'The Summer of Hate.' \n \n But as political historian Rick Perlstein points out, the health care protesters and &#8216;birthers&#8217; are just the latest in a long line of angry right-wing conspiracy theorist movements with a powerful narrative of victimization. \n To ask whether the protests are spontaneous and genuine, or manipulated 'Astroturf' - a fake grassroots plan supported up by front organizations determined to kill the president&#8217;s plan for reform - is a false dichotomy, he argues.\n &#8220;If you don't understand that any moment of genuine political change always produces both, you can't understand America, where the crazy tree blooms in every moment of liberal ascendancy, and where elites exploit the crazy for their own narrow interests.&#8221;\n But the crazy tree is also blooming with another dangerous fruit - the resurgence of the American militia movement with its racial underdog ideology and strategy of leaderless terrorism.\n The last time the militia movement was in its ascendant was during the 1990s - and it ended with the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people.\n The most important difference today, the report notes, is that \"the federal government - the entity that almost the entire radical right views as its primary enemy - is headed by a black man,\" adding racist rage of white supremacists to the heady mix of militia ideology.\n .\n \n Protesters who turned out to greet President Obama in Arizona on Monday openly carried firearms, including one semi-automatic rifle. \n Prior to the president&#8217;s visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to attend a health care town hall meeting, a man arrested for &#8220;sneaking past security officials&#8221; turned out to have a loaded, unlicensed handgun in his car, according to the local paper. During the visit, as MSNBC recorded, one of the protestors, carrying a placard referring to Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s admonition to water the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants, also displayed a holstered sidearm.\n This is legal in New Hampshire apparently - the gun was registered and not concealed, and the man was on private property - and as the New York Times has noted, the two incidents in Portsmouth are not the only ones where firearms have turned up, legally or otherwise, in the hands of anti-health care reform protesters. All of which underscores a fact about the American right which bears repeating for a foreign observer: These people are armed. Let&#8217;s be clear: No one is predicting the assassination of President Obama, or anyone else. \n In the much-maligned and now withdrawn DHS intelligence assessment that warned earlier this year of the potential threat posed by resurgent right-wing extremists, there was no mention of assassination, and indeed the authors state that though &#8220;Rightwing extremists have capitalized on the election of the first African American president [...] they have not yet turned to attack planning&#8221; of any kind.\n And yet, when one considers the availability of firearms to protesters with an angry narrative of victimization, and the growing influence of a movement which glorifies violence against African-Americans, one can hardly avoid a sense of foreboding. \"\n \n Costs of War: Paranoid Populism / ISN",
