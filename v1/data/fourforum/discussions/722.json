Iran is repressive, but I don't think that they are actively at this time killing people based solely on race/religion/ethnicity. If they are, I stand corrected. Remember Vietnam? We were saving the people from the \"evil communist regime.\" I am neither a communist, nor a conciencious objector, but I saw no point in wasting lives in another person's fight.
