   "The road to hell is made with good intentions... or lies. It's the case with European mass-media barons who let this 'caricature genie' out of the bottle. Some of them say now this was meant as kind of contribution into the America led crusade on Muslim terrorists. I don't believe into their good intensions. They can't be so na&#1087;ve. In what I believe is that their lie. If they really meant to uproot terrorism they would have demonized several \"Islamic leaders\" provoking terrorism under the guise of \"pure faith\". They didn't do it. Instead they insulted all Muslims! And they continue with it presently. The latest example is when \"Radio Liberty\" made it possible for Movladi Udugov (they call him \"Goebels of Chechen terrorists\") to propagate radical ideas. It makes sense in one case only. Europe keeps feeding back Muslim terrorism! And she is going the road farther and farther ... Hell is within the reach already.",
