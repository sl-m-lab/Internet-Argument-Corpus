Kansas city-area abortion provider robert crist performed williams' abortion.

According to medical reports, harris bled to death from a perforation of her uterus caused by the abortion. Harris' family filed a civil lawsuit against the abortion clinic and mohammad imran, the doctor who performed the abortion. In january 2002, a jury found both the clinic and imran responsible and awarded $2 million to harris' 5-year-old son. \n \n (\"trial under way in lawsuit filed over abortion death,\" associated press, january 8, 2002; \"jury awards more than $2 million in lawsuit over abortion death,\" associated press, january 16, 2002.) \n \n sharon hamptlon, 27, died december 13, 1996, in moreno valley, ca. \n \n Abortion provider bruce steir pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in hamptlon's death.

A jury found that the doctor's negligence caused her death. \n \n (\"malpractice caused woman's death, lawyer says,\" milwaukee journal sentinel, april 24, 2001; \"negligence finding won't benefit family,\" milwaukee journal sentinel, may 5, 2001.) \n \n lisa bardsley, 25, died in 1995 in phoenix, az. \n \n Bardsley was discharged about an hour after her abortion, but as she and her boyfriend were driving back to flagstaff, she became ill and later died of massive hemorrhaging. John biskind, who was later convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison in the abortion death of lou anne herron, performed bardsley's abortion. \n \n (\"bomex faces suit, family of woman in botched abortion cites doctor's record,\" arizona republic, march 12, 1999; \"abortion doctor sentenced to five years,\" associated press, may 5, 2001.) \n \n pamela colson, 30, died june 26, 1994 in panama city, fl. \n Colson was about 12 weeks pregnant when she went to the women's medical services in pensacola, fl. After an abortion, colson and a friend were driving home to port joe, fl when colson experienced difficulty breathing. Shortly thereafter, colson went into full cardiac arrest. She was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where she died. A medical examination attributed her death to a torn uterine artery, which caused heavy and uncontrolled bleeding.

Her uterus was reportedly cut during the abortion, causing her to bleed to death. Clinic staff called emergency personnel when ortega-rodriquez went into cardiac arrest. \n \n (\"o.C. Doctor investigated in abortion death,\" los angeles times, december 15, 1994.) \n \n jammie garcia yanez-villegas, 15, died in 1994 in houston, tx. \n \n According to press reports, yanez-villegas died from an infection after an abortion by abortion provider john coleman at the a to z clinic in houston. Coleman, who suffered from emphysema, died three days after yanez-villegas. Clinic employees reported being concerned about coleman's ability to operate given his health problems. \n \n A subsequent health department inspection revealed dirty and unsafe surgical instruments, inadequately trained personnel and incomplete patient records. The state went to court to shut down the clinic; in response, owner moche hachamovitch voluntarily closed it. Yanez-villegas' family later named hachamovitch in a wrongful death suit. \n \n (\"abortion centers accumulate record of 6 deaths, 28 suits,\" arizona republic, january 17, 1999.) \n \n guadalupe negron, 33, died july 9, 1993, in new york, ny. \n \n Abortion provider david benjamin is currently serving a 25-year-to-life sentence in connection with negron's death.

Abortion clinic owner alicia ruiz hanna said she tried to save sanchez after the patient went into convulsions. A jury, however, found hanna guilty of second-degree not a nice act in sanchez' death and sentenced hanna to 16 years to life in prison.

Three months after veal's death, officials at ben taub hospital treated a 17-year old girl who was hemorrhaging and in critical condition after an abortion at the same abortion clinic. \n \n (\"death of teen after abortion leads to probe of care at medical clinic,\" houston chronicle, november 6, 1991; \"secrecy veils state probes of abortion clinics,\" houston chronicle, february 9, 1992.) \n \n angelica duarte, 21, died october 30, 1991, in las vegas, nv. \n \n Within hours of having an abortion at the woman's place abortion clinic in north las vegas, duarte was taken to the emergency room at lake mead hospital medical center where physicians said she had lost all but one-tenth of her blood supply. \n \n A hospital official said they were told she had been bleeding for four hours before coming to the hospital. A hospital spokesman said duarte was comatose and bleeding from her uterus when she arrived at the hospital. She died shortly thereafter. \n \n (\"bleeding may have killed victim of abortion,\" las vegas sun, november 2, 1991.) \n \n angela hall, died in 1991 in birmingham, al. \n After an abortion, hall experienced a drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and excessive bleeding. Abortion clinic staff called an ambulance to take hall to the hospital, but abortion provider thomas tucker cancelled the call. Hall was eventually taken to the hospital, where she died three days later. In december 1996, an alabama judge ordered tucker to pay $10 million to hall's five children. The state of alabama stripped tucker's medical license in 1994 and mississippi followed suit the next year after a series of incidents involving tucker. (\"alabama: abortion doc ordered to pay $10 million for wrongful death,\" abortion report, december 6, 1996; \"abortion doctor loses his license,\" the times-picayune, march 18, 1995) \n \n sandra milton, 28, died april 27, 1990, in toledo, oh. \n \n Milton died of internal hemorrhaging from a laceration of the uterus during an abortion. \n \n (\"demonstrators arrested at toledo abortion protest,\" united press international, may 22, 1990.) \n \n christina goesswein, 19, died in 1990 in new york, ny. \n \n According to press reports, goesswein had sponges inserted a day prior to her abortion to dilate her cervix, but was vomiting and experiencing severe pain. The abortion provider, moshe hachamovitch, opened the clinic in the middle of the night and proceeded with the abortion; goesswein died hours later. \n \n A medical examiner ruled that goesswein died from an embolism of amniotic fluid. A lawsuit is still pending against hachamovitch in the case, alleging he should have recognized her symptoms and should not have performed the abortion. \n \n (\"abortion centers accumulate record of 6 deaths, 28 suits,\" arizona republic, january 17, 1999.) \n \n marla cardamore, 18, died in august 1989 in pittsburgh, pa. \n \n Cardamore reportedly died from infection after an abortion at the magee women's hospital. A lawsuit filed by cardamore's parents against the hospital was settled in 1997. \n \n (\"lawsuit over fatal abortion is settled,\" pittsburgh post-gazette, january 14, 1997.) \n \n debra gray, 34, died in july 1989 in suitland, md. \n \n During her abortion at the hillview women's medical surgical center, gray was given the anesthetic brevital. Gray reportedly began having problems breathing minutes into the procedure, but abortion provider gideon m. Kioko continued the abortion. Gray went into full cardiac arrest and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She was taken to a hospital where she was declared brain dead and removed from life support three days later. \n \n In september of the same year, suzanne r. Logan, 26, was also given brevital during an abortion at the same clinic and had a reaction similar to gray's. Published accounts reported that no trained anesthesiologist was available when logan stopped breathing, went into cardiac arrest and, as a result, was left completely paralyzed and unable to speak. \n \n Logan eventually won a multimillion-dollar settlement in her case against the abortion clinic but died of complications from pneumonia three weeks later. She remained paralyzed from the abortion complications at the time of her death. \n \n (\"suitland clinic's ex-chief turns in md.

(\"a tale of two abortions,\" the louisville (ky) courier-journal, february 24, 1991) \n \n stacy ruckman, died 1988 in springfield, mo. \n \n A jury found that ruckman received an overdose of the local anesthetic lidocaine during an abortion and therefore awarded her family $25 million in damages. The abortion provider, scott r. Barrett jr., did not carry liability insurance, so it's unknown if the family collected any of the award. The state of missouri revoked barrett's license after ruckman's death. (\"drug was fatal in '88 abortion: anesthetic also used in death last week,\" st. Louis post-dispatch, april 30, 1997) \n \n luz maria rodriguez died in 1986 in new york, ny. \n \n Right before she was discharged from a bronx clinic, rodriguez reportedly turned blue from lack of oxygen. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and paramedics were called. Rodriguez was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where she remained in a coma for four days until her death. \n \n A medical-malpractice review found that the abortion provider had not removed all the contents from rodriguez's womb, which led to hemorrhaging. A $1.5 million dollar malpractice settlement was paid to rodriguez's daughter. \n \n (\"abortion centers accumulate record of 6 deaths, 28 suits,\" arizona republic, january 17, 1999.) \n \n sylvia moore, 18, died december 31, 1986 in chicago, il. \n According to press reports, moore bled to death at a chicago-area hospital after abortion provider arnold bickham called her \"lazy\" and pushed her out of the abortion clinic in a wheelchair when she was unable to walk on her own. Less than two years later, officials with the illinois department of professional regulation revoked bickham's license after finding him guilty of \"gross malpractice\" in moore's death. Bickham's license was previously suspended for performing abortions on women who were not pregnant and sometimes not fully under anesthesia.

Would not the (potential) child receive very little, if zero, quality prenatal care?\n Why would anyone want to punish  a women for getting pregnant? \n \n Also, I think that if a little more research went into it, the women who died in relation to having an abortion may have had an adverse reaction to the anesthesia. Thus, if they got their tonsils out and went under anesthesia, perhaps the same adverse reaction would have happened. However, since people who have tonsils removed and/or other major surgeries and go under anesthesia are in hospitals equipped to handle such emergencies, perhaps the prevalence rates of death goes down.

In the United States, execution of cirminals is allowed under the 14th Amendment's \"Due Process\" clause. The death row candadite is tried before 12 of his peers, and if the evidence betrays them, is found guilty of their crime. They are then sentenced by his peers to death. They may appeal, sometime even to the Supreme Court, but if they do not win those appeals, they then executed. They are not executed because it is convenient to execute them, they are executed because they committed a crime deserving of death.\n \n Abortion, on the other hand, is inconsistent with the rule of law.

Our orignal poster is pretending to be concerned about woman and the potential dangers they may face in the choice to end their pregnancy, when in fact it is more dangerous to bring a fetus to term than to terminate.\n \n Continuation of pregnancy or the termination of pregnancy both cary risks, in the case of elective abortion, any type of elective surgery can be potentially fatal or dangerous. As for abortion, it depends on whether you are getting a surgical or non-surgical procedure. I would tend to think a non-surgical form of abortion is many times less dangerous than giving birth.\n \n Of course this ignores a dangerous and disturbing fact, Abortion complications are responsible for approximately 13 percent of the 600,000 maternal deaths that occur globally each year.\n \n The World Health Organization estimates that unsafe abortions kill about 70,000 women annually. Each hour, eight women die from unsafe abortions. For every woman who dies from an unsafe abortion, many more suffer serious injuries and permanent disabilities. In some countries, as many as 50 percent of the pregnancy-related deaths are caused by unsafe abortion.\n \n Anti-choice persons should think about this.",

   "Lack of agreement about the start of \"personhood\" in U.S. law:\n In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its (in)famous Roe v. Wade decision. This was the ruling that gave women the right to choose to have a legalized abortion, early in gestation, for any reason. 2 Justice Blackmun noted that there was no consensus in law when life (i.e. human personhood) begins. \n \n He cited a number of references to \"person\" in the U.S. Constitution. But he found that: \"...in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application.\" \n He later wrote that the State of: \"Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate.\" 2 \n He concluded: \"In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\"   Editor Joel Feinberg commented on Roe v. Wade, writing: \"Hence, the state should not take one theory of life and force those who do not agree with that theory to subscribe to it, which is the reason why Blackmun writes in Roe, 'In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake'.\" 3 \n \n The abortion debate has heated up since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. However, few if any new scientific or medical findings have surfaced that might define when personhood starts.  ",

Defining words through dictionaries, as I have demonstrated, is a form of word game and a poor one at that due to inevitable circularity of definition.

There is no doubt that a corporation may not be deprived of its property without due process of law, 58 and although prior decisions had held that the ''liberty'' guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is the liberty of natural, not artificial, persons, 59 nevertheless a newspaper corporation was sustained, in 1936, in its objection that a state law deprived it of liberty of press. 60 As to the natural persons protected by the due process clause, these include all human beings regardless of race, color, or citizenship. 61 \n \n As you can see from the above a 'corporation' is for all legal reasons a 'person'.

   "Steve: It's hardly complicated; just basic propositional logic and conceptual analysis. Terms are propositional and the syntax of sets of propositions are defined by their formal relations to each other. Where one term is a subset of another term, they must refer to different things rather than similar or same things. In order to have the same or similar meaning, identity conditions must be established such that:\n \n Formally such an identity can be represented as such:\n \n (Aa) (Ab) (a = b) | f(a) <-< f(b) \n \n \"Where any constant a that is synonymous with any constant b such that there is the function of a if and only if there is the function of b\" \n \n The terms 'human' and 'person' are not synonymous because synonymy is about being equivalent (same or similar) in meaning. 'Human' and 'person' cannot be the same because they refer to different sets of things, as I demonstrated in a previous post, and they cannot even refer to similar things because one term, 'human', is a sub-set of the other term 'person'. \n \n Formally this membership can be represented as such: \n \n (Aa) (Ab) (Ac) (a = b & c) | (f(a) -< f(b) & f(c)) & (f(b) v (f(c) -< ~f(a)) \n \n \"Where any constant a that is synonymous with any constants b and c such that if there is the function of a then there is the function of b & c, and if there is either the function b or the function c then there is no function a.\" \n \n To reiterate:\n \n If we have a human , then we have a person, but if we have a person we do not necessarily have a human because we might have a corporation because the term ('constant') 'person' is equivalent to the compound term 'human or corporation' rather than the term 'human'. \n \n Because the term 'human' does not function biconditionally in relation to the term 'person', and because that biconditional relation is a formal condition necessary for a term to have the same or similar meaning such that meaning is preserved through substitution, the terms 'person' and 'human' cannot be substitued for each other in a 'truth-preserving' or 'valid' way.\n \n Here's an arithmetic example: \n \n The set of 3 contains [0, 1, 2] such that if you have that set, you have the sets 0, 1, and 2, containing [ ], [0], [0, 1], respectively. \n \n The identity is as follows: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. \n \n Trying to say that the terms 'human' and 'person' are synonymous is like saying that the terms '1' and '3' are synonymous.",

   "All your arguing about a 'person' has been because you are trying to equate 'person' with 'human' only and then equate foetus with human being , and so make the foetus a person, and not only a foetus but a fertilized egg, hence making abortion legally impossible.\n\n My argument against abortion is moral, not legal; it is not from personhood. You are the one who separates personhood from humanhood, not me. I am simply pointing out that 1) The Supreme Court has established that if the fetus is a person, it's Constitutional right to life guaranteed by the Constitution would have to be protected  ROE v. WADE, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). 2) The 14th Amendment does not say that one must be born to be a person. This is easily seen in the fact that Roe v. Wade decided abortion was legal because of a mysterious, never-before-seen Constitutional right to privacy. Roe v. Wade did not explicitly establish that the fetus was not a person under the 14th Amendment. 3) It is clear that until 1937, the word \"person\" in the 14th Amendment was interpreted to mean \"person.\" It wasn't until 1937 that, without a ratification by the people, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the 14th Amendment changed the word \"person\" to also mean \"corporation.\"\n \n And I'll add this somewhat related comment. Even if I supported a right to abortion, and wanted to make it law, I wouldn't try to get a few justices on the Supreme Court to just change the meaning of the Constitution. I would seek to change the Constitution by the Constitutional provision of the Amendment process, seeking that 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the states would agree with my position and make it law. To do the former is to support and endorse tyranny. To do the latter is to support and endorse Democracy, and the sound pricniples of government laid out in the Constitution.\n \n \nI think you would even prohibit 'the day after pill' right?\n\n Because the day after pill not only prevents conception, but also, in the event conception has occurred, could prevent implantation, effectively killing a human being, I do not support the morning after pill.\n \n \nBecause since life is a continuous even to kill a sperm is murder, since we can not draw the line anywhere, anything we kill constitutes murder according to you.\n\n Do you really expect people to take you seriously when you make comments like this? Please, spare us the dramatic and fallacious hasty generalizations.\n \n \nNot because a corporation has the legal protection and property rights accorded to a human being and hence called a 'person' it means that a corporation is a human being. In your example 'person' is a human being. You are clutching at straws here.\n\n So in the 14th Amendment the word \"person\" means \"person\" or \"corporation,\" but in the 22nd Amendment, the word \"person\" only means \"person?\" My point is that from 1868 to 1937, the word \"person\" in the 14th Amendment meant the same as the word \"person\" in the 22nd Amendment. You think it absurd that the word \"person\" in the 22nd Amendment could also mean \"corporation,\" and the Supreme Court from the years 1868-1937 thought it absurd that the word \"person\" in the 14th Amendment could also mean \"corporation.\"",

And surely you wouldn't tell lawmakers to refrain from using the power of the law to impose their moral belief that murder is wrong onto the rest of society. And most importantly of all, surely you wouldn't seek to impose your moral belief - that one should not impose their moral beliefs on others - onto me!\n \n This won't matter to you, but it is a fact that the US Constitution provides that I can indeed impose my moral beliefs onto others if I can convince enough people to agree with me. The pro-choicers adopt this same philosophy, only they seek the Unconstitutional method of convincing a mere 5 out of 9 people on the Supreme Court of their moral beliefs, while I prefer the Constitutional method of convincing 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of the states that abortions should be regulated. You see, the real moral dictatorship - the rule by the holier than thou moral elite of the elite - is where a mere 5 people (7 in the case of Roe v.

Likewise I am not suggesting that the meanings of these two terms - such as the usage described by english dictionaries - do not overlap somewhat in casual conversation. \n \n What I am saying is that casual use of these terms in any technical argument on the subjects of ethics and law dooms those arguments to failure, just as sloppy coding will plague whatever program you attempt to write with bugs. \n \n Now, will you address the substance of my post, and reason with me?",

You said z=[x.y] I believe, and thus x doesnt have to equal y. Well, that depends on what Z is. What if Z=1? x and y both have to = 1.

Nonetheless, as Symbiote points out (and as I noted previously), while in some senses the terms 'human' and 'person' can be substituted for each other, they cannot be in moral or legal senses. No thesaurus will tell you what senses synonyms preserve meaning in, and are equally useless for rigourous argument - though quite handy for poetry and rhetoric where ambiguity is prized. \n \n But going back to why that is, note that where term a = [b, c] this means that whatever a is, it is the sum of the terms b and c, and therefore cannot be either b or c.\n \n As I demonstrated using arithmetic, if a is \"1\" then of the subvening sets neither b nor c may be \"1\", so when you suggest that where a is \"1\", b and c must be \"1\", you are unfortunately wrong.\n \n The 'functions' that we are discussing are obviously propositional functions, to use the conventional term. In contrast to propositions, propositional functions have no truth-value until bound by a quantifier or replaced by a constant. \n \n Note well that I have used 'constants' (a, b, c) rather than 'variables' (x, y, z), and declared a function of those constants, which would presumably be genuine propositions instead of functions following the conventional use. \n \n However we're discussing synonymy and the semantics thereof.
