   "Bush is not in the position actually to make it out with Iraq. US military lobbyists are pressing him to stay. For them Iraq is milking cow. Clearly, this is the huge market for war equipment profitable trade. Then Iraq is testing ground, which is of utmost importance for the companies producing weapons. Some people I know who are working with those companies say, 'Markets are good, but testing in real war is unique chance'. For getting this chance they are competing in earnest. They ain't so much choosy about the means I should say. I know of some big fish in the congress on some interested companies' payroll. That's disturbing. Leaders in the race are such majors as Kellog, Brown & Root, the Hulliburton offspring KBR. \n Well there are big plans to test so called e-bombs (electromagnetic bombs) in Iraq. After 'Desert Storm' operation every 5th GI came back home with severe physical injuries due to similar tests. Since then during the last 10 years weapons have become more sophisticated with upgraded destructive power. I hate to think more American guys are going to end up as cripples!",
