   "http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/atlanta/0305/11courthouse.html\n \n A Fulton County judge, deputy and a court reporter were killed and another deputy was wounded Friday morning at the county courthouse in downtown Atlanta.\n \n ...and the shooter got away.\n \n Police were hunting the gunman this afternoon. Many metro schools were closed or locked down during the manhunt.\n \n If you read the whole article you may wonder, as I do, why the man was allowed in the courtroom without being shackled. He should have had the ankle chains and the waist chain with his hands tied to his waist.\n \n \"Oh, but Jim\", you say, \"that's not fair!\" Give me a frickin' break!\n \n When this man is caught, he should be killed. No trial, no appeal, no last meal. After all, there should be no need to prove that he did it. The survivors in the court room saw him do it.\n \n But the bleeding heart liberals and the ACLU will rant and rave that the man was not being treated fairly, that's why he shot AND KILLED three innocent and valuable people.",

I understand that in Georgia they do not want the jury to see a defendant in shackles because of a possible perceived image of guilt. Why not belt on a stun module hidden from view with an officer's finger on the button?\n Dono\n\n \n As usual, Dono, you show a rational thinking pattern here that we seem to have lost in theis country. It will be a shame when your generation is gone.\n \n The \"single female officer\" part is the problem. This guy was 6'1\" and weighed 200+ lbs. I saw a picture of the officer on tv, and she looks like a little kid in comparison. I am all for equality in the workplace, but there has to be some point where common sense tqkes over and we do not send a single female officer to transport a large violent offender. If he was being escorted by a 6' tall 200 lb man, I doubt he would have even tried it, since the odds of him being able to completely overpower the guy without danger to himself would have been pretty slim. With a small woman transporting him, reality tells us all he needed was one good punch and she was out of the game. \n \n I personally don't think that people shoud be required to appear in court wearing shackles, or even jail clothes. It does present a percieved image of guilt. The one place that all people should be able to stand with dignity is a courtroom. \n \n Personally, I would prefer to see 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man wrongly imprisoned, and I truly believe that men should be given every benifit of the law.\n \n Jim, you need to keep in mind that at the rate that the US prison population is growing, in 30 years, the MAJORITY of US citizens will have spent some time in jail, even if it is just a weekend in the county lockup. Do you really want to advocate a lock em up and throw away the key mentality, keeping in mind that half your grandkids are going to be the recipients of that mentality?\n \n These two go together:\n \n \nPure and simple, we live in a violent society. Respect for civil authority has diminished on a basis comparable to the lack of respect our professional system of government provides to the public. \n \n \n \n \nWhat is ridiculous to me is to allow even the officers to carry exposed weapons in a court house. It is also ridiculous to transfer accused criminals between the jail and the court room with only one custodian. A person in custody should expect to at least be handcuffed. But again, the ACLU doesn't agree, saying that it might unfairly influence the jurors.\n\n \n For years this was not much of an issue, and it still really isnt in some parts of the country. Not long ago, one of my machinists got arrested for writing a bad check. No big deal, trip to the local sheriffs department, post a $200 bond, then back to work. The deputy let the guy drive his own car and followed him so he could get back to work as soon as possible and not get somebody to follow him to give him a ride.\n \n Around here, that is kind of par for the course for most of the population. We have respect for our law enforcement officers, but that respect comes from the fact that they have respect for the public. They understand that there is a line they walk, and if they cross it, they will end up laying face down in a pool of their own blood on a back road somewhaere and their shooter will never be found, though there is a good chance that most of us locals will know exactly who it was. At the same time, we all know thatt ehre is a line we don't cross, or someboyd from the sheriffs department will be around to see us and we will end up a gues of the county.\n \n Many places, law enforcement has no real respect for the public, and hte public is rapidly loosing theri respect for law enforcement. It seems that part of this has to do witht he fact that law enforcement in many areas is a revenue generating function. Police writing a ticket, or arresting minor offenders who can be charged massive fines is a moneymaker. Mo0st police departmnets turn a profit by focusing on traffic violaters and minor offeders, but let the really bad guys go, since for all the talk that cops like to do about it being a dnagerous job, it is currently more dangerousn int he US to be a housewife than a cop, and fraonkly cops like it that way. They get their gun and their badge and they get to swagger around playin ghte big swinging dick.\n \n The public seems to be becoming disillusioned with the whole legal system we have in the Us currently. This is the second judge that has been hit in the last 2 weeks. Is it the start of a trend? I don't know. I do know that cops are finding it more difficult to keep order (or their version of it) and more people are willing to resist.\n \n Personally, I think this is a good thing. I would rather run with a wolf pack than graze with a flock of sheep any day. Yes, some people ar going to be hurt, but that is the true price of freedom. You cannot be a free society but still expect everybody to be strictly subserviant to the civil authority at all times. That is the exact opposite of freedom.",
