I've already quoted from the Old Testament where God (Jesus to EasyRider) says that gay men MUST be put to death, and elswhere, I showed that in the New Testament Jesus Himself says that not even a little change will be made to the Law and Prophets until heaven and earth pass away. Thus, the Laws of the Old Testament still stand.\n \n Here are the two passages back to back.\n \n \n\n \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n (Leviticus 20:13)\n \n\n \n \n\n \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.\"\n (Matthew 5:17-18)\n \n\n \n Since EasyRider is not out killing gays, despite his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ's command for him to do so, then he isn't a true Christian.\n \n At the very least, EasyRider is using MODERN ETHICAL NORMS to OVERRIDE what the Bible/God/Jesus demands he do.",

The fact you would change to a gay-pride-friendly church instantly like that makes it obvious. There's so much more to religion than a given stance on homosexuality. What about the church's views about CHRIST??? Does that not even factor in for you? I just get the impression that politics is defining your religious choices, rather than your religion defining your political choices. That's fine if you want it to be that way--but why bother going to church at all if gay pride is going to be the defining factor of your religion? Doesn't it, at that point, cease to be Christianity and become a religion of gay pride? Why bother going to a Christian church at all if Christ isn't going to be the main thing for you? Why not instead start up a Church of Gay Pride or something like that? Seriously?\n \n It's interesting to me that a lot of people in the gay pride movement let that one issue determine so much in life for them, because in my experience even many fundie churches really don't talk about it that much. I was raised in a fundie church (I'm an ex-fundie) and I don't remember ever, even once, hearing a sermon about homosexuality or God's view of it. I think sometimes part of the reason the fundie religious view gets out there so much is that your own movement constantly brings it up and opposes religious people.
