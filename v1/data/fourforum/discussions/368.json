   "David Duke is the ex-grandwizard of the Ku Klux Klan, a state representative for Lousianna, and an very outspoken member of the white-supremacist community operating in the United States.\n \n Recently David Duke travelled to Qutar and appeared on the Al Jazeera Network. In his radio address, Duke claimed that the war in Iraq was nothing more than a \"war for Israel\". Furthermore, he stated that this was only a further manifestation of the Jewish conspiracy. His views are ridiculous, yet there are many people who subscribe to his brand of thinking. From the Nazi groups in Europe and America to the majority of Muslims in the Middle East, Jew-hating is again on the rise throughout the world. This demented thought process is deeply ingrained in many of the world's cultures, and remains just as dangerous today as it was in the 1930's.\n \n The following is my assessment of Duke's visit to the propagandists of the enemies T.V. and radio network. I believe there is a common thread that exists between Islamic Fundamentalists and various white-supremacist groups throughout the world, and I believe both groups deserve a similar level of scrutiny, because this common thread could manifest itself as another extension of the Al Qaeda network. Al Qaeda exists as a conglomeration of various other terrorist organizations united together to achieve similar goals. The question is raised about the utility that such Nazi organizations could have for a terror network whose ethnic composition can be combated through the use of profiling. Would these different groups be able to set religious differences aside in order to undermine the force that keeps them from gaining substantial ground, America? These are questions that may become increasingly important in our fight against global terrorism. The following is my assessment of the common threat both groups pose, and the hypothetical case where they find themselves in an alliance against my country.\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n David Duke is just as guilty of sedition as the human shields that ventured over to Iraq in hopes of undermining the war effort. By appearing on the major propaganda outlet for the enemy, and espousing the kind of views he holds he is emboldening the enemy. \n \n He has much in common with Al Qaeda, as anti-semitism is the basis for both of their worldviews. The type of propaganda used by Duke is similar to the type used to brainwash the minds of children in the madrassas. \n \n Certainly, Al Qaeda is looking to recruit some of our more right-wing radical white supremacists within this country to compromise some of the security measures we have taken. The advantage of using white-supremacist organizations lies in the fact that they don't necessarily match the expected profile. They are more likely to blend into this environment and might be able to operate under the radar screen. \n \n If the FBI and the CIA were wise, they would view this anti-government, anti-Jewish mentality with the same mistrust being applied to many of the immigrants coming from states where the Islamic view aligns so perfectly with the Nazis. If current revelations regarding the Oklahoma City bombing are true, then we have already seen the devastation that cooperation between the two groups can cause. \n \n The danger of having Nazis operating within our own borders most definitely falls under the terrorist classification. It has been shown that Nazis are willing to resort to terrorism to fulfill their agenda. It is just as plausible to assume that a link exists between Nazi organizations and Al Qaeda, for the purpose of arming and funding terrorism in the U.S., as it is to assume that Al Qaeda is collaborating with Saddam Hussein, for the purpose of acquiring WMD. All have very much the same goal, and probably would be willing to set their differences aside in order to combat a shared enemy. They most likely assume that they can turn on each other at a later date, for now they may agree to milk each other for everything they are worth. \n \n This is how I would view the terrorist threat at his point in time. Our most likely source of terrorism comes from groups that are able to feign the role of the good American, somebody whose ethnicity does not initiate bells and whistles, somebody who shares Al Qaeda's hatred of America. I suspect white-supremacist groups as much as I suspect the communists. It would not be too difficult for Al Qaeda to find groups matching this description that they could approach; nor would it be too difficult for those groups to capitalize on the chaos of our social structure, in order to bask in virtual anonymity, while they plan the next a major event. It is not unlikely that such a group would take funding and resources from foreign terrorists, or the states that sponsor them. \n \n In short, I think profiling is good, as it allows law enforcement to limit the scope of the search, and allocate resources efficiently. However, we must be very careful about how narrow our vision becomes, because it is extremely possible that such scrutiny will drive Muslim extremists to look to exploit other potential threats that previously existed within our borders. In the mean time, we are busy misdirecting ourselves, while those groups we have since forgotten about become the next likely agents for Al Qaeda.",
