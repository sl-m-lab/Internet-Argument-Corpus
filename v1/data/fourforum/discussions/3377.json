In order to understand God (if such is possible), we must first have some sort of definition of God to understand. If God is limitless (as is often asserted), then there is no definition using words that can fully encompass God.\n \n I'll throw this out there... some individuals have a personal concept of God, and working from this concept that they hold, they may perceive that they understand some part of God. Through experience or revelation, their perception of God's totality may change throughout their life. However, this type of understanding of a concept is completely subjective (as evidenced by the millions or billions of views of God or gods that exist in the minds of individuals).\n \n Without having the means to communicate objectively about God, my mind cannot comprehend how there can be an objective knowledge of God in this physical realm. However, that will not prevent individuals from attempting to attain their own subjective knowledge of God through experience and revelation.\n \n \ntopic: If God is beyond logic and rational, why do we pursue knowledge of him?\n\n It can be known objectively, through logical and rational means, that there is life experience that is beyond logic and reason.

   "I think before we can fully understand God we must comprehend eternal infiniteness &#8211; from everlasting to everlasting. I can&#8217;t grasp it. Maybe because I can&#8217;t pull myself from this cradle-to-grave mentality long enough, or because the human mind is just not created in a fashion to do so.\n \n What I can say is that the closer I get to God the more I understand Him. I&#8217;ve wondered about my faith, my belief, and how it could be weak at times, but never just sat down and worried about it. If the apostle Paul said, &#8220;I just want to know Him&#8230;&#8221; and he being such a dedicated man of God, can&#8217;t fully know God, then I&#8217;m not in trouble. But, just because Paul stopped (or realized he could not understand God fully) doesn&#8217;t mean that I can just quit learning or give up trying to understand Him.\n \n I think that there&#8217;s much more to learn about our fellowman, the way God wants us to learn, that it would take a lifetime just to do that. God has inserted, if you will, things into my life because I wanted Him to help me understand people and their ways. These inserts have changed my way of looking at others, at situations, and at myself.\n \n So, yes, I believe that God is past all understanding. But, that doesn&#8217;t mean we are not to strive to do so.",

   "God exists, for sure. Man will never totally understand God, for sure. I believe it is impossible for such a limited creature as man to understand issues such as all-powerful, all-knowing and eternity, or that God is everywhere at all times.\n \n If we were to understand God, we would be equal to God. Then there would be many gods and not God. Some things that I don't understand, I accept on faith. Other things that I don't understand, don't bother me. Not understanding God is not a problem. I accept God on faith. I don't need man's logical proof that God exists...and no man can offer acceptable proof that God does not exist.\n \n I have enough to occupy my limited memory capacity without searching for an answer to every question that comes to mind. I don't bother with finding proof that gravity is what holds everything in order because such proof is evident in daily observations on the earth and is evident from the motions of the other objects in space. There's no need for me to know how gravity works. I just know it does.\n \n The same holds true for proof of God's existence. There's no need for it. I see it on a daily basis. An atheist may say that all this happened by accident. I say it's God's work.\n \n It's hard enough to attempt understanding other humans and why some people are mentally deranged.\n \n Man is not so different from any other species of animal. One thing that all animals (that I know of) have in common is the requirement for food. We all consume food, be it animal, vegetable or mineral. \n \n That brings the question; Why are we here? Is to eat other animals? It appears that some animals are here only for that reason. After all, that's all they do...eat, sleep and eat some more.\n \n God likely does not need to eat.

Maybe not. Since encountering God must be a subjective experience through the individual mind of a person, what one person 'gets' from following the same steps may not be what another person 'gets.'\n\n if you take the exact same steps, you will get the exact same results\n \n \nWho would have to seriously question the religious methods? Many people already do seriously question the religious methods.\n\n what i'm saying is, if we could find God outside of the realm of faith, then everything that religion is based on goes down the drain.... this is deserves a thread of its own!\n \n \nInteresting. There are certainly other opinions as to the motivation for believing in God.\n\n like i said, respect, reverence, admiration and love usually become the offspring reasons, but i think it always starts with fear. i can certainly say thats how it started with me\n \n \nOffer one example. (I'm not saying there aren't examples. I just cannot think of any.)\n\n easy. fear of dying promotes health consciousness. fear of imprisonment curbs potential criminals. fear of terror causes more gullibility of what the media says\n \n \nWho is we? You say this as if these things are universal. I can tell you that it is genuinely possible to live without fear of anything.\n\n it certainly is. and without fear man could live completely free of boundaries. but the would be no way to rely on discretion, and recklessness would very likely be the norm. humanity would probably not last too long\n \n \nNo. Fear is not powerful. Fear has no true power. Fear motivates through force... not power. Read the book \"Power versus Force\" for a clear distinction between Power and Force.\n\n power and force are directly related, even mathematically (P= F/t, t is time). the more force employed, the more power is resulted. but yes, i agree there is a difference, say, between a tyranical dictator and an authoritative influencial leader. yet the proportional relationship remains",

There is no finite action that is punishable by infinite consequences that can be considered a just punishment by a loving God.\n\n well, God is infinite, and from his perspective your reward as well as your punishment is infinite. focusing on the effect of the bad choice and not on the reward of the good choice kinda throws everything off balance. is God any less loving for being the same God that grants infinite joy to those that made the right choice? it is the same God, after all. if God is capable of granting an infinite reward, why is it beyond him to also serve an inifinite punishment. see the balance?\n \n \nWe could experience that exact same event and have two completely different perceptions of that event.
