   "We constantly hear certain people (you know who you are, hell, everybody who you are) criticizing the legal concealed carry of firearms by regular citizens, making wild accusations about how the people who go through the process are more likely to shoot and kill others, how there's gonna be blood in the streets, people are going to commit murder over parking spaces, it increases workplace violence, etc.\n \n Baseless fears aside, concealed carry has been around for well over 20 years, and it exists in some form or another in 48 of the 50 states. And I'm not familiar with even a single case of any state trying to repeal concealed carry and outlaw it.\n \n So anti-gunners, if concealed carry is such a bad thing, how come no state has ever moved to try and do away with it?",

Those that infringed on the right to KBA are numerous and many. Morton Grove is a good example of the withdrawal of a State gun law being trashed by Heller. Kennesaw Georgia law has been strenghtened :) emoticon_xgood emoticon_xhoho",
