I guess you really don&#8217;t realize how silly you sound. We aren&#8217;t exploring Mars ONLY to find out if there has ever been life there or not. But we know there is such a thing as life. We know that life as we know it needs water. We know there is water on mars. And it does have huge biological and theological implications so naturally we would check it out since we&#8217;re there anyway. You apparently have an amazing lack of curiosity. :)\n \n Maybe there is no evidence of life in Australia, but there is in other parts of the world.
