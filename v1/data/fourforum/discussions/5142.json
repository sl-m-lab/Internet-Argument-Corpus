   "Hello -\n I would just like to make a point here. In my state, one with Draconian gun laws in the northeast, the NRA (as wonderful as it is as an organization), knows they can preach to the choir: (us) - but probably not get many converts. We do, however, have 2 state organizations which are on top of legislation in the state capitol is all the time. Sadly, most people don't join - seeing the NRA as all that is needed. Our gun club runs NRA matches, but we also run state matches. To do so, the Club must belong and we must belong & we do.... the information is outstanding and you know what the laws coming up are, etc.\n \n Please support your stae organizations. They may one day be more helpful to you than NRA ( which we also belong to).",

   "\"I don't like the NRA that much. I think they have made too many compromises.\"\n \n Although I agree they do make some compromises, the NRA is one of the most powerful grassroots lobbying organizations there is in this country, they are for gun rights, and I will continue to support them. \n \n This does not mean I don't support other organizations that accept less compromise like GOA. I am a life member of both organizations.\n \n I would advise people like pickleweaseler to join the NRA, then make your voice heard within the organization. Of course, continue to make your voice heard by your congressmen, local and state governments, etc. You have been doing this, I hope.\n \n State organizations? I'm not sure there is a need for them in my state, as there would be in CA, IL or NY, but now that I see it mentioned I will find out what organizations there are.",
