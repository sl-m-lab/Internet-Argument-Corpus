   "Georgian president Saakashvili is aiming at NATO membership. What Georgia can offer in exchange? It is poor state with rather weak economics and defence. All it has is its territory. It's not far from Iran and from China. And USA has its own designs on it.\n First of all Georgian NATO membership will be good cause for placing American (under guise of NATO ones) military bases on its territory. That would minimize chance of improvement of Chinese and European relations and destroy hope for renascence of Great silk-way which connected Europe with China long ago.\n Moreover it may cause tension of relations between Georgia and China for USA has made its mind to deploy its National ballistic missile defense which would threat to Chinese security.\n So aiming at NATO Saakashvili takes pains for involving country into new conflict (as if coming war against autonomies isn't enough for him) and at the same time causes great harm to EU (mind you that Georgia wants to become EU member either).",
