   "Not only missile interceptors but nukes as well are to be deployed in countries of Eastern Europe (Poland and Czechia are the first to 'be honored'). What are their true targets? \n Western European states and Turkey shouldn't be deluded. Their escaping from having those interceptors and nukes in is no guarantee of their safety. So that's victory is partial if it's victory at all. \n Deports to store weapons especially nuclear ones is a brilliant target for Islamic radicals! With the Europe presently flooded by Muslims and very militant Muslims e.g. Chechen ones dramatic string of events is quite a probability. \n The threat of terror attacks on such sensitive deports is good enough tool for America to keep Berlin and Brussels and Rome on the hook. Blackmailing along with force is American most favored means of pursuing their 'vital political goals'. Add here some reports portraying Al Qaida as owing its birth to America. It's scary indeed for Europeans!",
