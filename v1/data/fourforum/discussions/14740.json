   "i had a lecture in chemistry today, and something occurred to me about this forum - why dont ID supporters ever complain about chemistry? you know the argument, 'evolution is bad science because we cant actually see it happening, and science is all about observable evidence...' well, almost everything in chemistry relies on atomic theory which has never been observed. research and testing, logical reasoning developed the atomic theory, and its a pretty good one at that. evolution is the same deal, but maybe even more convincing, since it has been observed.\n \n i always thought i knew the answer to \"why do creationists pick on biology and not the other sciences?\" i thought its because it deals with the touchy subject of life and how we came to be, which seems to contradict the biblical story of creation. but after thinking it through, im not so sure anymore. atomic theory is an even weaker theory (still strong, but slightly weaker in comparison to evolution, imo) that explains so much, yet it remains untouched. if ID proponents have a problem with evolution due to a lack of observable evidence, they must have loads to say about atomic theory. but they dont, and that leaves me with the original question, why do creationists pick on biology? chemistry sucks. i wish the creationists would attack that area of science so i wouldnt have to take a million chemistry classes.\n \n thinking about it now, physics and especially astronomy are very much contradictions of the biblical creation story. we have learned that the earth is not special other than its ability to support life, there are planets like it that can support life, even our closest neighbor planet is thought to have once supported life. this again is unobserved evidence and like everything in science, always questionable. however, it isnt astrophysics or atomic theory the creationists are after, its EVOLUTION... but why? pick on Gilbert Lewis or beat up Stephen Hawking.",

Here we go:\n \n The Hebrew Bible nowhere states that the earth, plants and daytime were created before the sun. A careful reading of the primary Hebrew text (as opposed to our English translations which often reflect certain sectarian biases) reveals that the sun, moon and stars were all present in Genesis 1:1-3: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was deserted and empty and darkness was on the surface of the ocean, And the Spirit of God was brooding over the waters. Then God said, Let there be light ... There was evening and there was morning - day one\" (literal translation of the Masoretic text). \n \n It must always be remembered that the description of creation is from a geocentric point-of-view, i.e. an observer on the earth. The writer of Genesis is not standing in space looking down on earth. That juxtaposition is critical. \n \n We continue: \n \n \"And God said, Let luminaries in the expanse of the air be for separating the day from the night. And let them serve as signals to mark seasons and days and years. And let them be luminaries in the expanse of the air to give light upon the earth. And it was so. God brought forth (not 'created' or 'made') two great luminaries - the greater luminary to dominate the day and the lesser luminary to dominate the night - the stars also. God gave them forth in the expanse of the air ... \" (Gen.1:14-16, literal translation). \n \n The point will become clear as we examine the literal words of two other passages: \n \n \"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? ... Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness a diaper for it ... ?\" (Job 38:4,8-9). \"For six days Yahweh worked on the air and the land, the sea and all that is in them ...\" (Ex.20:11) \n \n In other words, the sun and moon and stars were all present from the beginning but were not initially visible from the earth's surface until the third day when the thick layer of water-saturated cloud was dispersed. \n \n NCCG.ORG New Covenant Church of God - B'rit Chadashah Assembly of Yahweh, FAQ 325: When was the Sun Created?\n \n Also, have you ever read Revelation 21:23? \n \n \"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.\" So, the initial \"light\" can arguably be the light of God. Or it can simply be light appearing somewhere in the universe.\n \n Your objection fails, or at best is inconclusive.\n \n \n\n why dont you complain about atomic theory, EZ? chemical scientists rely soooo heavily on the atomic theory, which has never been observed. if you really want to bring down science and corrupt the US into a mass christian indoctrination, take down the weak pillar that is atomic theory. chemistry will collapse and... job done. man, i should be a creationist.\n\n \n I don't have a problem with science.

ID advocates claim they are entirely science based, with no affiliation to religion, no? we all know this is a lie, but they are still making the claim. then they go and attack evolution because of a so called lack of evidence. if they are honestly science based with no affiliation to religion, they MUST have a problem with atomic theory.\n \n not doing so is a return to biological creationism pre-ID.",
