   "I was discussing this with some guys today and thought I would post it here and see what you all thought.\n \n During the Vietnam war and in some analysis aterwards, there was some speculation that we lost in vietnam because America had grown too big for it's britches. We did not believe that we could be defeated, and we planned our strategy accordingly. Even later in the war when we were getting our butts handed to us pretty well, we simply could not accept the fact that we were unable to take a little, undeveloped nation. Richard Nixon stood ont he whitehouse steps and said \"Victory in southeast asia is assured\" while their flag was flying over our embassy in Saigon. \n \n After the breakup of the Soviet Union, there were rumors that several other nations (that we considered friendly) were assisting the VC by funneling funds through the Soviet Union because, although they did not support communism, they did want to see a loss by America to get us back in line. No country feels comfortable if they see another, especially one with the kind of military power that the US has, running roughshod over the entire planet.\n \n I saw an international poll at people-press a while back that showed that over 70% of those polled considered themselves to be \"strongly anti-american\". According to the poll, even the Dutch were strongly anti American. Majorities in 7 of 8 predominatly mulim countries believe the US will someday pose a threat to theri country, and internationally the US was #4 on the list of \"who is the greatest threat to world peace\" as rated by citizens of the european union.\n \n There is a new poll out now, but I haven't had time to review it.\n \n Anyway, the question is, do you think America is getting too big for its britches, and do you think this will lead to more complications on the international front? The response to this question when asked earlier was pretty evenly divided between \"screw the rest of the world, there is no country int he world that can take us\", and \"maybe we need to practice a little more restraint in our foreign policy\".\n \n While I would certainly agree that there is probably no country in the world that can match us militarily, how about any 2 countries, or 5, or 10? What about after they cut off our middle eastern oil supply?\n \n Your thoughts?",

To the question of will we have more complications on the international front? I thihk that without a doubt, yes. America feels, and has for a long time, that everything that happens in the world effects us. I don't believe that there is any doubt that conflicts are bound to arise. Of course, that shouldn't always mean having to use our military.\n \n Can our military deafeat 2 or 3 or 4 countries at the same time? Yes. In fact it has been said that the docterine for the american military is to have a force as strong as, I believe, the next most 10 powerful nations. And military spending essentially reflects this. However, can we occupy 4 countries at the same time without support from our allies or having a draft? Probably not. We are having a whole lot of trouble with one.\n \n As to the anti-americanism, I have not read any polls lately, but I believe that it is very high even among our allies. And whether you like Bush or not, I think that you have to agree that he has hurt America's image around the world. If you have a link to that new poll, please post, Daewoo, I would be interested in looking at it.\n \n I know I left out a few part of your statement, but I didn't want this to get to long.\n Again, thanks for the thread.",

   "Yes I think the US is doing more in the world than we should be doing. We would have probably been better off today if we had never attacked Iraq. Still I think we have to be sure to keep an eye on the international community and not be afraid to make decisions that may lead to war if the long term result of that decision is better for us and the rest of the world. I do think that the final result of the second Iraqi war will be beneficial to us and the rest of the world although it has hurt the US's image.",

Having a strong democracy in the middle east that is friendly to us has potentially huges benefits. It also has potential to be devestating to the region and to the US, if our nation building doens't work. And even if it does work, it will be (most likey) at a huge cost to the US for a long time. Not to turn this into an Iraq debate, but I think that was (is) a lot of the objection. Many feel that both sides of the argumet (costs/benefits) were not laid out fairly.\n This is revelent to this discussion, though, I feel, because sometimes things are put too simplicticly. The question with Iraq was too much \"will we be able to/how easily will be defeat Iraq?\" Instead of \"how long, and what what cost will our occupation be?\" and \"what are the potectial risks versus the potential gains be.\" I feel that it was an insult to Americans to not have a serious debate about these questions.",

Also interesting, I think is that the report is about 8 months old, so I wonder how opinions have changed since then. (with the continuing insurgency, not finding WMD, ect.)\n \n Thanks again for the link.",

   "I'm sure they will have another one before long. Usually, I catch those as they first come out. For some reason I missed that l;ast one. I think it is becasue the title is more or less the same as the old one, which I had already seen.\n \n The part that is (or should be, I think) is the opinion noted in western europe that they (western european nations) should operate w/ more autonomy. It leads to an interesting question, in my mind, of whether or not he US could win a war with western europe as a united entity, especially if they enlisted the aid of russia and china (neither of whom are really THAT friendly to the us). What if we added in a Middle east oil embargo against the US??",

Europe+Russia+China+Middle East would probably defeat over a long period of time but not before the nukes were sent off. Everyone involved would have to know that it would be inevitable that it would come to that and in the end there would be no winner.",

Luckilly I think its only a hypothetical question (at least unless something truly dramatic happens). Rest assure that the \"anti-american\" sentiments in europe are confined to the present american foreign polycies. Only fringe groups actually base any anti-american sentiments on actual hatred of the (succes of?) \"american ideology\", and next to none is based on actual dislike for the american public. \n \n Even assuming that the animosity between the US and Europe would reach such heights that we started to contemplate violence as a settling of difference, a war would be most unlikely. And mutal assured destruction by nuclear weapons is only one reason. We are so intertwined, culturally, politicly, socially, economicly and millitary (NATO) that our societies as we know them would go under. I don`t think any of us are prepared to do this, no matter the situation.",
