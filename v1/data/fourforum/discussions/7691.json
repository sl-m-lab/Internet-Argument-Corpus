   "SAN DIEGO - Former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham, who collected $2.4 million in homes, yachts, antique furnishings and other bribes on a scale unparalleled in the history of Congress, was sentenced Friday to eight years and four months in prison, the longest term meted out to a congressman in decades.\n \n Cunningham, who resigned from Congress in disgrace last year, was spared the 10-year maximum by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns. He also was ordered to pay $1.8 million in restitution for back taxes.\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11655893/\n \n IMO, any politician that takes such bribes as Cunningham did should spend at least 20 years in a Federal Pen. emoticon_mad",

   "The man is a thief, nothing more. There is nothing lower in my book than a thief. I think given the magnitude of his crimes, he is getting off very easy. \n \n Not to mention the fact that he will still be collecting his government pension to the tune of $40,000 a year, all while sitting in prison. But hey, what is the real difference? Most of our tax dollars already go to criminals.....ahem....I mean politicians.",
