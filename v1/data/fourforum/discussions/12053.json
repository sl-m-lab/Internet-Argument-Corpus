   "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Gay rights groups and newspaper editorials on Tuesday condemned the Vatican for its decision to oppose a proposed U.N. resolution calling on governments worldwide to de-criminalize homosexuality.\n \n The row erupted after the Vatican's permanent observer to the United Nations told a French Catholic news agency the Holy See would oppose the resolution, which France is due to propose later this month on behalf of the 27-member European Union.\n \n Archbishop Celestino Migliore said the Vatican opposed the resolution because it would \"add new categories of those protected from discrimination\" and could lead to reverse discrimination against traditional heterosexual marriage.\n \n \"If adopted, they would create new and implacable discriminations,\" Migliore said. \"For example, states which do not recognize same-sex unions as 'matrimony' will be pilloried and made an object of pressure,\" Migliore said.\n \n A strongly worded editorial in Italy's mainstream La Stampa newspaper said the Vatican's reasoning was \"grotesque.\"\n \n Pointing out that homosexuality was still punishable by death in some Islamic countries, the editorial said what the Vatican really feared was a \"chain reaction in favor of legally recognized homosexual unions in countries, like Italy, where there is currently no legislation.\"\n \n Franco Grillini, founder and honorary president of Arcigay, Italy's leading gay rights group, said the Vatican's reasoning smacked of \"total idiocy and madness.\"\n \n \"The French resolution, which is supported by all 27 members of the European Union, has nothing to do with gay marriage. It is about stopping jail and the death penalty for homosexuals,\" Grillini told Reuters.Vatican attacked for opposing gay decriminalization | International | Reuters\n \n But of course, gays are DISCRIMINATING against the Vatican because we are opposing them in their attempts to keep homosexuality illegal.\n \n THIS is the type of mentality gays are against.\n When we want to end gay employment discrimination, people show up with signs that say \"Save the Children\".\n When we want to continue gay marriage in California, churches LIE and proclaim that it will make churches perform gay weddings and school children taught gay marriage.\n When we want gay equality, Christians proclaim THEY are the ones religiously discriminated against cause they can't get the government to enact their religious persecution.\n \n And this \"but they believe it\" junk?\n Quite frankly, if a Christian were to believe \"the earth is flat\" or \"the sun revolves around the earth\" in this day and age, that should be EMBARRASSING. To believe some of these things that are obviously false, and to try to further them as true???\n It's part of the reason some people think there is something wrong with religion's effects on REASON.\n \n Furthermore, this article demonstrates something I have mentioned elsewhere. Some people have pretended \"Christians are just concerned with just gay marriage\".\n That is false. There is a MAJOR push from powerful Christian organizations (including those multi-million dollar anti-gay organizations) to oppose ANY gay equality advancement.\n If that \"concerned with just gay marriage\" claim were the truth, then it would be a no-brainer to SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION.\n \n Mormons are being similarly tested with legislation in Utah for supporting gay equality under a name that is not \"marriage\". Like the Catholics, I believe they will provide some measure of opposition.\n \n \n Human rights groups say homosexuality is still punishable by law in more than 85 countries and by death in a number of them, including Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen.\n \n Vatican spokesman Rev Federico Lombardi said \"no one wants the death penalty or jail or fines for homosexuals\" but defended Migliore's comments, adding that the Vatican was in the majority on the issue.\n \n \"It's not for nothing that fewer than 50 member states of the United Nations have adhered to the proposal in question while more than 150 have not adhered. The Holy See is not alone,\" Lombardi said.\n ....\n Grillini, the gay rights activist, said he feared what he called another \"Holy Alliance\" between the Vatican and Islamic states at the United Nations to oppose the proposed resolution.THIS is the mentality of many with the anti-gay approach.\n To proclaim agreement, BUT THEN FIGHT AGAINST EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE that \"agreement\".\n \n Does the Vatican have any resolution on how to STOP gays from being put to death?\n No. Of course not.\n They just FIGHT AGAINST the resolution that is on the table to accomplish that!\n \n And as for the \"50 member states of the U.N.\", I would LOVE to get the actual names of who falls where.\n On one side, you would have civil rights power-houses. The people RESPECTED for civil rights.\n On the other side, that 150 is made up of 85 countries that STILL HAVE IT ILLEGAL, so OF COURSE they are on the Vatican's side.\n And having homosexuality illegal IS NOT THE ONLY means of actively and extremely discriminating against gays.\n \n And look at that. Catholic and Islamic collusion.\n But some would try to lead us to believe that it's not a \"religious\" thing with regards to opposition to gay rights... emoticon_frazzled\n \n As long as religion provides a powerful mouth-piece for opposing gay equality, and as long as too many religious members are complacent in this approach, some will continue to see religion as the problem for gay equality.",

Very quick and explicit condemnation.\n A \"resolution\" on Catholic priests who molest children, and other Catholic priests who use Catholic money to bribe the victims to stay quiet?\n That took a WHILE to come out with. Needed more thought.\n \n Another example of how skewed religion is when it comes to gays.\n \n I wouldn't be surprised if the condemnation of the resolution against imprisoning and/or executing gays was \"quick\" as well.\n Perhaps the excuse to give the public to explain why took a little longer...",

   "What this proves is that the Vatican is NOT representative of the scriptural christian ethic at all. That was also proven in foundits other thread where he applauded them for accepting evolution as a valid science.\n\n I suspect that is more because they UNDERSTAND what evolution DOES and does NOT say.\n Archie? Why do you think evolution contradicts creation?\n \n And on what grounds to declare it not a \"valid science\"?\n Is \"creation science\" a legitimate science to you?\n \n \n \nThat was just fine with foundit, and only a couple of days ago, yet today they are evil for holding to an equally unscriptural principle.\n\n Wow!\n If you actually took a minute to STOP AND THINK, you would realize why I praise one and condemn the other.\n \"unscriptural principle\" is YOUR complaint. Not mine.\n I think the \"evolution\" thing is great cause it shows the church's capability to evolve in thinking. If this were a few centuries earlier, you would be railing against the idea of \"earth rotates around the sun\".\n \n And as for the current issue (gay criminalization / execution), we agree that is wrong, so why you would have any pretense of surprise or conflict is beyond me...\n \n \n \nI may stand against redefining marriage on moral grounds, but only I have raised the issue of how homosexuality is wrongly criminalized in so many countries around the world in other debates.\n\n I'm sorry, but WHAAAA?\n You claim \"only you have raised\" that issue, yet here I am raising it. Obviously proving your claim wrong.\n Furthermore, WHERE have you raised that as an issue???\n \n \n \nLet this story be a reminder of how good the gay community has it in the USA as you attempt to force your lifestyle into every aspect of society as a right and normal sexual outlet.\n\n And by the same token, Christians should stop your belly-aching cause if you lived in a Muslim country, you wouldn't have half the religious freedom you have here...\n (Yeah. I don't think even NOW he can see the flaw in his absurd admonishment...)",
