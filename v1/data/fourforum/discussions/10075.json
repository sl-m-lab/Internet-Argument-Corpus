   "I was surprised that this wasn't being talked about, so I thought I'd bring it to everyone's attention.\n \n I also thought this fit in well with the other currently active health related threads in this forum.\n \n Sicko, Michael Moore's new film, was released this week. I saw it on Saturday and loved it, and wanted to see what other people thought.\n \n I agree with the following reviewer that this is Michael Moore's best film. The information contained in it is vital for every American to know about, it is entertaining, and it is edited astoundingly well. What is also notable is that Michael Moore doesn't even appear in the first half of the film. I thought this was a smart move as the people whose stories are being told more than speak for themselves.\n \n Here's the review. What do yall think of the film?\n \n http://www.idahostatesman.com/entertainment/story/93771.html\n \nMovie Review: Sicko\n Moore takes shot at health system\n By Colin Covert - Minneapolis Star-Tribune\n Edition Date: 06/29/07\n \n \n Rick, an uninsured woodworker, lost two fingers in an accident. When the hospital laid out the costs of reattaching them, he could afford to save only one. A true romantic, he chose to keep his ring finger. But he was better off than the indigent patients several Los Angeles hospitals dump on the sidewalk beside the city's Skid Row free clinic.\n Maybe things are better for the majority who have health insurance? Not always. Dr. Linda Peeno, a former medical reviewer for the health insurer Humana, told Congress how she furthered her career by protecting the firm's profits, knowingly denying a customer a life-saving operation. In effect, she helped Humana kill him - legally, mind you - for half a million dollars.\n \n Welcome to health care in the richest nation on earth, where stepping on a rusty nail could be a catastrophe that plunges you thousands of dollars into debt. It's the subject of Michael Moore's most accomplished film yet.\n \n \"Sicko\" is a compelling, funny, highly persuasive and ultimately hopeful report on the ills plaguing America's private, for-profit health care system. The film skillfully blends moving individual stories, humor, political analysis and ethical passion. It doesn't simply make the problems visible. It shows that solutions are possible.\n \n As the film notes, doctors who discourage treatment are rewarded, customers who seek care face burdensome approval procedures and legislators who advance the insurers' agenda are rewarded with lavish campaign contributions. \n \n The result is a system ranked 37th in health care around the world, just slightly ahead of Slovenia's.\n \n Moore traces the current state of affairs to the passage of the HMO Act in 1973, which ushered in the era of managed care. He effectively illustrates his history lesson with 1971 Oval Office audiotapes of Richard Nixon and presidential aide John Ehrlichman. The adviser was briefing the president on a visit by the head of Kaiser Permanente, one of the first big HMOs, lobbying for legal changes that would help such firms expand.\n \n Ehrlichman: \"All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make.\"\n \n Nixon: \"Fine.\"\n \n Moore follows the audio exchange with video of a TV address the following day in which Nixon promised legislative initiatives to give Americans \"the finest health care in the world.\"\n \n But Moore isn't merely engaged in partisan finger-pointing. He lambastes Hillary Clinton, once a champion of health care reform, for becoming the second-highest recipient of donations from the health care lobby. The cries of divisive demagoguery that have accompanied Moore's earlier films are unlikely to be raised against this one.\n \n \"Moore is right that the U.S. health care sector is bloated and inefficient, and that insurers and providers routinely rip off consumers,\" says conservative scholar Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute and former health policy analyst for the U.S. Senate's Republican Policy Committee.\n \n \"Michael Moore's style aside, it's hard to argue the facts,\" commented the American Society of Registered Nurses, which independently verified \"Sicko's\" charge that America spends far more per capita on health care than any other nation, but ranks low on life expectancy, infant mortality and access to physicians.\n \n It doesn't have to be this way, Moore argues. In visits to Canada, England and France, he finds well-functioning health care systems operating without the fabled waiting lines, ruinous taxes or oppressive regulation we're cautioned about. We meet a French doctor who makes house calls and new parents in London who laugh at the idea that Americans are charged to have babies.\n \n Moore doesn't make overreaching claims for other countries' systems, merely suggesting that we take the best ideas they have developed and add good ones of our own. \n \n \"Sicko\" is Moore's most satisfying and mature film, with few cheap shots.\n",

   "This may or may not be directly relevant to Michael Moore's movie Sicko (which I haven't seen yet), but I did find an interesting web page about the pharmaceutical industry, which is useful to share here: \"The Truth About the Drug Companies\", by Marcia Angell, July 15, 2004\n \n http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17244\n \n This part was most of interest to me:\n \nIn the past two years, we have started to see, for the first time, the beginnings of public resistance to rapacious pricing and other dubious practices of the pharmaceutical industry. It is mainly because of this resistance that drug companies are now blanketing us with public relations messages. And the magic words, repeated over and over like an incantation, are research, innovation, and American. Research. Innovation. American. It makes a great story.\n \n But while the rhetoric is stirring, it has very little to do with reality. First, research and development (R&D) is a relatively small part of the budgets of the big drug companies-dwarfed by their vast expenditures on marketing and administration, and smaller even than profits. In fact, year after year, for over two decades, this industry has been far and away the most profitable in the United States. (In 2003, for the first time, the industry lost its first-place position, coming in third, behind \"mining, crude oil production,\" and \"commercial banks.\") The prices drug companies charge have little relationship to the costs of making the drugs and could be cut dramatically without coming anywhere close to threatening R&D.\n \n Second, the pharmaceutical industry is not especially innovative. As hard as it is to believe, only a handful of truly important drugs have been brought to market in recent years, and they were mostly based on taxpayer-funded research at academic institutions, small biotechnology companies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The great majority of \"new\" drugs are not new at all but merely variations of older drugs already on the market. These are called \"me-too\" drugs. The idea is to grab a share of an established, lucrative market by producing something very similar to a top-selling drug. For instance, we now have six statins (Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol, and the newest, Crestor) on the market to lower cholesterol, all variants of the first. As Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, put it, \n If I'm a manufacturer and I can change one molecule and get another twenty years of patent rights, and convince physicians to prescribe and consumers to demand the next form of Prilosec, or weekly Prozac instead of daily Prozac, just as my patent expires, then why would I be spending money on a lot less certain endeavor, which is looking for brand-new drugs?[4] Third, the industry is hardly a model of American free enterprise. To be sure, it is free to decide which drugs to develop (me-too drugs instead of innovative ones, for instance), and it is free to price them as high as the traffic will bear, but it is utterly dependent on government-granted monopolies-in the form of patents and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved exclusive marketing rights. If it is not particularly innovative in discovering new drugs, it is highly innovative- and aggressive-in dreaming up ways to extend its monopoly rights.\n\n \n Also,\n \nRecently the public has shown signs of being fed up. The fact that Americans pay much more for prescription drugs than Europeans and Canadians is now widely known. An estimated one to two million Americans buy their medicines from Canadian drugstores over the Internet, despite the fact that in 1987, in response to heavy industry lobbying, a compliant Congress had made it illegal for anyone other than manufacturers to import prescription drugs from other countries.[15] In addition, there is a brisk traffic in bus trips for people in border states, particularly the elderly, to travel to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription drugs. Their resentment is palpable, and they constitute a powerful voter block-a fact not lost on Congress or state legislatures.\n \n The industry faces other, less familiar problems. It happens that, by chance, some of the top-selling drugs -with combined sales of around $35 billion a year-are scheduled to go off patent within a few years of one another.[16] This drop over the cliff began in 2001, with the expiration of Eli Lilly's patent on its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac. In the same year, AstraZeneca lost its patent on Prilosec, the original \"purple pill\" for heartburn, which at its peak brought in a stunning $6 billion a year. Bristol-Myers Squibb lost its best-selling diabetes drug, Glucophage. The unusual cluster of expirations will continue for another couple of years. While it represents a huge loss to the industry as a whole, for some companies it's a disaster. Schering-Plough's blockbuster allergy drug, Claritin, brought in fully a third of that company's revenues before its patent expired in 2002.[17] Claritin is now sold over the counter for much less than its prescription price. So far, the company has been unable to make up for the loss by trying to switch Claritin users to Clarinex-a drug that is virtually identical but has the advantage of still being on patent.\n \n Even worse is the fact that there are very few drugs in the pipeline ready to take the place of blockbusters going off patent. In fact, that is the biggest problem facing the industry today, and its darkest secret. All the public relations about innovation is meant to obscure precisely this fact. The stream of new drugs has slowed to a trickle, and few of them are innovative in any sense of that word. Instead, the great majority are variations of oldies but goodies-\"me-too\" drugs. \n\n \n Anyway, these are just a few interesting points about the pharmaceutical industry.",

However, the public has been sold a bill of goods that the reason our US-made prescription drugs are so much more expensive than those from, say, Canada is because of innovation. If the innovation is not real (to any significant degree), then why in the world should we pay those high prices? I think that we should let the market decide and grant patents only for those drugs that are truly innovative. \n \nYes, companies do what I'd consider shady things to prolong a patent and waste a lot of money on advertisement I am curious on the level of R&D and innovation into new surgeries other nations have compared to the US?\n\n Our government does put a lot of money into medical research at universities and at the NIH. Apparently, various European drug companies have at least part of their R&D centers here in order to benefit from that research (at least according to that link). I would presume that we put a lot of money into other areas of medicine as well - including new surgeries. I would guess that our federal budget for funding medical research is higher than most other countries, but that most other countries also have medical research budgets. I am just tired of being sold the line that it is our private sector which comes up with these innovations and, thus, deserves their profits. It seems to be mainly our tax dollars that pay for the innovations through university and NIH research. \n \n As for medical insurance, several years ago, I worked in Switzerland for a few years, where one is not supplied medical insurance through work. My private health insurance cost under $2000 per year where, in the US, it cost over $3000 for the same type of coverage. Really - where is that extra money going to? My guess is profit and the costs of keeping the sub-par insurance system that we have (lobbying costs, etc.).",

I'm an Expat (from US) living in Germany. I'm in the health care system here. It's 1,000,000% better than the US. I had a heart attack (at the tender age of 41) two years ago, and, on top of my $550 per month payment to the insurance, I had to fork over another $7000K. And I was unemployed at the time. And they were NASTY!!!!!!! I remember when i was in the emergency room, the receptionist came in with her oh so nasal voice requesting the $100 co-pay. lol I was drugged up on morphine. I remember the doc, to his credit, saying get the \"F\" out of here. It's not the docs... it's the pharmaceuticals and the insurance racket.\n \n Here in Germany, I'm on my partners plan. 10 Euro co-pay ever quarter. I pay 15 euro per quarter for my medication. In the states, it would come to about $180 per quarter.... just for medication. IF I see a doc, it would be another $25 per visit.\n \n I can see the doc anytime here for free.. Just walk in whenever I had a question. They actually did research as to why I had a heart attack and determined it was from sleep apnea. (I'm actually an athlete, black belt in martials arts). And, voila... I was in a sleep clinic for four nights. Hooked me up with a machine. I had to pay 10 euro a night for the hospital stay. everything else was covered.\n \n The US systems svcks. My partner pays about 200 euro a month into the system. The employer pays the other half. The goverment picks up the overhead costs.\n \n So, I paid, in the US in one year, over 15,000 dollars for my health care. I was not a \"high-risk\" patient. I was unemployed. In Germany, when you're unemployed, you're covered. period. If I had the heart attack here. I would have only paid 100 euro for my hospital stay. And 15 euro for my meds per quarter. And 10 euro per quarter for ALL the doctors.\n \n So, how does how does 200 Euro per year compare with shelling out 15,000 dollars in the US? Oh, the taxes are about 2% more than the US here. The numbers don't lie.",

   "It's nice to see replies from different countries. Here in the US it's an atrocity that people must pay through the nose for out-of-pocket expenses even when they have health insurance. I was working one job where I had to pay $200 per month for insurance. When I lost my job, it went up to $400 in order to stay on the \"Cobra Plan\" between jobs with no income coming in. I opted to take my chances. It's a tough choice to make. Where I work now, there is a 74 year old woman who works 4 days a week so she can be on the company's plan. Medicare is too sketchy in its coverage for many seniors who get sick more often, need more medications and who are more likely to be hospitalized. \n \n What ###### me off even more is the way some nay sayers will pick at fine points when they criticize the film, \"Sicko\". I have no patience for those who pan the film just because there may have been some oversights in Moore's assessments of other systems, like the shortages in medicine & equipment found in third world countries like Cuba. I shouldn't have to live with the fear of being tens of thousands of dollars in debt if I were to ever have a major mishap when I'm between jobs. Some services should never be managed for profit.",

   "I just watched the film this evening, and aside from the discussions about whether healthcare is or is not misrepresented (I was kind of bemused by the fact that Moore seemed to celebrate our ludicrously overpaid doctors) I was intrigued by the idea of fear of government. Could it be that because the US lacks the good things that government can provide, like decent healthcare, government in the US is more distant and like anything you don't have a lot of contact with, it becomes the big scary menace. In Britain and most of Europe, while we might complain about the standards of public services, nobody particularly complains about the existence of, say, the health visitor who visits every week when you've had a baby to check that they're healthy and growing properly. My suspicion is that the existence of such a government service in the US would be considered an imposition rather than a help.",

   "Lets not forget that we don't have a fully privatized health system. The government already plays a huge role in health care to make more of a hybrid system more than anything....perhaps private-lite is a better term..i dunno.\n \n In any event, did the movie discuss what happened in Tennessee when they did a \"universal health plan\" there?",

   "I watched the movie and even though MM is not on my \"most beloved\" list, the movie was very good. Sure there were bias things, but that doesn't make the entire movie not credible. The US health care system isn't the best out there. It is a Business, Health Insurance is purely a business. Can anyone seriously think that these corporation care about \"John and Jane Smith\"? If these guys actually were in it for the people the companies would be in debt. I know that when I go and open up my first business, if the net profits are negative... I wouldn't stay in it for too long. \n \n The US may have the best doctors and treatment... but you are risking it when you pay insurance companies for their plans. Not only that but it will cost you an arm and a leg. But if you have the money, you're in luck here.\n \n Quality Healthcare really depends on so many damn factors: from everything about your health to where you live (meaning the part of the state you reside in, state, and or country).",
