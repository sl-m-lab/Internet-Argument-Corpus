   "This makes certain assumptions about the historical Jesus, but also makes very good points. I think that for understanding God it might be best to be within some framework and be prepared to break it than stand outside of one altogether or remain totally constrained. The rawest and most powerful challenges to God I have ever heard come from the priest-poet R S Thomas. Leaving the church altogether is a cop-out, as is ignoring the problems and falls from faith.",

   "Someone here mentioned Joseph Campbell, which prompted me to pull out my old copy of The Power Of Myth, where Campbell is interviewed by Bill Moyers. I had read it about twelve years ago and decided to re-visit it. Herewith, then, some (what I consider to be) interesting quotes...\n\n \n I'm sure there's similarities in myth and religion, would bet my life on it, Orion - but what Campbell did was to attempt to hinge both off the same doorway. It works in the physical world, but does not include the spiritual, which I expect he had some belief in or he would not have explored it to the extent that he did. Either that or through the \"unconscious psychic life of mankind\", to which Jung endorsed. At any rate, to him, there was another \"world\", so to speak, that existed besides this that we perceive...just had Jung had believed.\n \n But - still the following quote you gave makes sense:\n \nYou have to break past your image of God to get through to the connoted illumination. The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: \"Religion is a defense against the experience of God\".\n\n It hints at to what I've been saying all along - that religion is a binding of mankind to earthly things. I'm not saying to forsake the church nor the teachings of Christ, but to break away from the teachings that have become corrupted by the methodology of religion.\n \nThe mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas that can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience.\n\n I don't personally believe that an \"experience of mystery\" is what it takes, unless he was referring to acquiring the knowledge of a perceived experience first, then dealing with it. I have not read Campbell enough to know his teachings fully, but I think he missed the mark here on that one subject. However, as far as mankind reducing God to something more on the grounds of them (our) selves, I do think he has a very valid point. We want what we want and, without giving thought of the things God, we rebel when we don't get it like we want it, etc., etc., etc. Mankind is a very self-serving creation.\n \nThere is a form of meditation you are taught in Roman Catholicism where you recite the rosary, the same prayer, over and over again. That pulls the mind in. In Sanskrit, this practice is called japa, \"repetition of the holy name\". It blocks out other interests and allows you to concentrate on one thing, and then, depending on your own powers of imagination, to experience the profundity of the mystery.\n\n Or, in other words, hogwash...\n \n You have to go past the imagined image of Jesus. Such an image of one's God becomes a final obstruction, one's ultimate barrier. You hold on to your own ideology, your own little manner of thinking, and when a larger experience of God approaches, an experience greater than you are prepared to receive, you take flight from it by clinging to the image in your mind. This is known as preserving your faith.\n\n Again, anyone that has been trained to believe that the image of Christ is anything other than the Gospel should be subjected to a spiritual awakening. Whether they see it for what it is or not, is entirely dependent on how deep theirs scars of religion go.\n \nJesus was a historical person who realized in himself that he and what he called the Father were one, and he lived out of that knowledge of the Christhood of his nature. \n\n I don't think it was the nature of Christ (or Christhood) that Jesus based his life on - He was the image of God and based His life accordingly. There is no \"nature\" of Christ, literally, in other words. That's what makes up the many religions - thinking that Christ was something altogether different than God.\n If Campbell meant (and it could be so) that God lived out His character through Christ, then I'll buy that. \n \nMoyers: What did you mean by Christ in you?\n \n That you must live not in terms of your own ego system, your own desires, but in terms of what you might call the sense of mankind - the Christ - in you.\n\n I can't agree with this either, for had mankind been able to live outside themselves with what we were born with we would have no need for Christ. What God tells us is that we have to be able to do away with the \"sense of mankind\" and have the mind of Christ. \n \nMoyers: Do you think Jesus today would be a Christian?\n \n Not the kind of Christian we know. Perhaps some of the monks and nuns who are really in touch with spiritual mysteries would be of the sort that Jesus was.\n\n What do we really classify as Christians these days? Good question. On this board for instance, most hated are the extremists - who I would not classify as Christians. JMHO, though.",

   "I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s similarities in myth and religion, would bet my life on it, Orion &#8211; but what Campbell did was to attempt to hinge both off the same doorway.

Either that or through the &#8220;unconscious psychic life of mankind\", to which Jung endorsed. At any rate, to him, there was another &#8220;world&#8221;, so to speak, that existed besides this that we perceive&#8230;just had Jung had believed.\n\n \n I've not read Jung, so I can't comment. Yes, Campbell sees close ties between myth and spirituality. Unfortunately, many people consider the word 'myth' to be somewhat derogatory, not unlike the way many creationists view the word 'theory', as in \"Well, evolution is only a theory\". Quoting Campbell: \"Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life\". What he's saying (I think) is that myths give us a window to the spiritual, moral, ethical, and philospohical lessons which come to us from antiquity, and if we ignore them, we perhaps do so at our own peril, or at the very least, we're forced to rediscover what the ancients already knew. Often, children are given a story to read, after which they are asked \"What is the moral of the story?\". \n \n Campbell: There is a form of meditation you are taught in Roman Catholicism where you recite the rosary, the same prayer, over and over again. That pulls the mind in. In Sanskrit, this practice is called japa, \"repetition of the holy name\". It blocks out other interests and allows you to concentrate on one thing, and then, depending on your own powers of imagination, to experience the profundity of the mystery.\n \n \nOr, in other words, hogwash...\n\n \n Whatever. I'm not an expert on Catholicism, but I'm aware that mantra, the repetition of a word or phrase, is an important part of Eastern religion, and it serves the purpose which Campbell describes for the rosary in Catholicism: to free the mind of distraction and to allow it to concentrate on the divine. You know how your own mind works; you're attempting to concentrate on something, and suddenly you think to yourself, \"What shall I have for dinner tonight\", or \"The car needs an oil change\". An example of mantra from Tibetan Buddhism would be Om Mani Padme Hum, translated literally as \"Hail the jewel in the lotus\", which may mean nothing to you or I, but it has great significance to Buddhism. Here's one interpretation: I invoke the transformation and purification of the six negative emotions of pride, jealousy, desire, ignorance, greed and anger into their true nature, enlightened mind.. Why Lotus? The Lotus is a beautiful flower which emerges from dirty, often filthy, water. \n \n \nAgain, anyone that has been trained to believe that the image of Christ is anything other than the Gospel should be subjected to a spiritual awakening.\n\n \n I consider the gospels to be a window to Jesus. In fact, it's the only window we have. However, I wouldn't take all the gospel accounts as to what Jesus said or did at face value. Again, we come back to myth. Nothing wrong with myth, so long as you recognize it. Ditto the first few chapters of Genesis.",
