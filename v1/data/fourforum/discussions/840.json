   "prove it.\n\n \n this came off of the FCC website. i provided a link below:\n \n Q: How have obscenity and indecency been defined? \n \n \n A: In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court established the following criteria to determine whether speech is obscene: (1) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest; (2) whether the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law; and (3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. In 1978, the Court stated that whether the work could be deemed \"patently offensive\" would depend on context, degree and time of broadcast. \n \n \n The Commission's generic definition of \"indecency\" is one that applies to language that describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and organs. \n \n \n Q: Are there provisions in federal law which penalize the showing of obscene material on cable channels? \n \n \n A: Yes. Both 47 U.S.C. \u00a7559 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a71468(a) respectively bar the transmission of obscene material over a cable system and the knowing utterance or distribution of obscene matter by means of a cable television system or subscription service. \n \n \n Q: What rules, if any, apply to sexually explicit programming?\n \n \n A: Section 505 of the 1996 Act states that cable operators, or other multichannel video programming distributors who offer sexually explicit adult video programming or other programming that is indecent on any channel(s) primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming, must fully scramble or block both the audio and video portions of the channels so that someone who does not subscribe to the channel does not receive it. Until a multichannel video programming distributor complies with this provision, the distributor cannot provide the programming during hours of the day when a significant number of children are likely to view it. \n \n \n here is the link: http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/program.html",

I like thinking.\n \n They don't mean the same thing. Technically poop and **** refer to the same thing, but in practice they don't. People say **** when they're angry, or when they are using it as a derogatory term. When used as a derogatory term, it means dirty, stupid, pathetic, ugly, and so on. Maybe it puts a mark on your soul to call someone that. A passage in the Bible says \"think about good and noble things\" (paraphrase) Using a swear as a derogatory word can lead a person to focus on the bad things about someone else, and I don't think that's a pleasant thing - and it can lead you to think that you are better than someone else. (I don't know if you think that kind of pride is bad) \n \n Some people swear to express anger. Now, expression of anger is a good, even a necessary thing. So what's wrong with swearing to express anger? ... People swear when they are especially angry - often when they feel like they have no control over what's going on, or are having trouble dealing with something. Its not a constructive way to express anger, because it's like saying you give up, or lack control. If a person swears, they aren't looking for a way to solve a problem, they're just saying 'this sucks'. In this way, its a negative thing to do, and can lead to a person becoming more easily angered and taking less control. I know that when I swear I'm irrationally angry over some small thing. It may let some steam off, but I feel bad for getting so foolishly angry, and for swearing when I think it's wrong. The fact that I've sworn stops me from being strongly angry by kind of shocking me, but it's replaced by a sort of bitter anger which is basically my pride being embarrased, and I want to justify my anger and what I've done. Now, I realize that I'm speaking from a viewpoint that swearing is wrong, so maybe personal experience is different for others. One very good piece of advice about anger is to count to 10 and breath deeply before speaking. I think a good question to ask yourself is would you swear after counting to 10 or would you talk it out?\n \n But what about people who swear by habit, or maybe to express suprise. It doesn't look like the meaning is bad. I've never really been there, so I don't know what to think. One thing that I could say is swearing by habit may make it easier to swear in anger or to swear as a derogatory term.\n \n Finally, to Christians I want to say something. Paul said \"don't cause your brother to fall\".(paraphrased) I think he was speaking about meat offered to idols... some of the Christians knew that the idols were nothing more than blocks of wood or stone, and it was fine to eat the meat. However, some didn't know that and thought it was very wrong. Paul said that the Christians who didn't think it was wrong shouldn't eat the meat in front of the other Christians. Now, it sounds like he's saying that morals are relative, but that's not necessarily what it means. If one of the Christians who thought it was wrong saw another Christian doing it, they would think that person was not a sincere Christian and their faith would be weakened. Or, they might go along with it, while still believing it was wrong.\n \n I do think that some morals are relative. If you think something is wrong, then it's probably wrong for you to do. The Bible says God 'wrote on our hearts' the basic rules of morality, so you should trust yourself to a point. But...\n \n I think the best way to think about it is \n - \"is that word said in anger or as a derogatory remark?\"\n - \"what do I think?\"\n - \"what do other Christians think?\"\n - \"what does God think?\" (most important!)\n Remember, don't cause your brother to fall!",

   "Robbie,\n \n Like I said, I think it depends on the context. What is the meaning behind the words. You made the argument that \"sh!t\" is derogatory, but poop is not. Well, lets look at that. If I say \"hey you sh!thead, stop doing that\", am I being derogatory...yes I am. If I say \"hey you poophead, stop doing that\", am I still being derogatory...yes. It has to do with context. I am using language to belittle or degrade another, and that is wrong, but it is not the words that are wrong, it is the meaning behind them. You elude to this fact throughout your post, but always seem to fall back over the fence a sentence or 2 later. Again, words are just tools made by man to communicate and express desires, feelings, and commands. It is the meaning behind the words that you should be concerned with. \n \n \n \n Disclaimer...The use of the non-word \"sh!t\" is purely as example. Any resemblance to any other words, actual of insinuated, is purely coincidental. ",

I think I agree all the way, especially in that the meaning is what's important, except in one small thing - While ****head and poophead may both be used as derogatory, I don't think I've ever heard someone use poop seriously.\n \n ps. I don't think I was eluding that its the meaning that's important, I was trying to show how the meaning was bad.",
