   "When starting military operation in Lebanon Israel officials didn't think about own people who suffered badly from this conflict.\n Israel's home front wasn't ready to permanent and massed bombing on Hezbollah side. Most part of bombproof shelters didn't work, the evacuation of simple citizens from attacked territorieas was never realized. Well, state care about people was limited by sound signaling about possible bombardment. At the same time 50% of Israel population thinks that any political problems Israel can be and must be solved by power method. I can't get!\n Israel military men say that the reason of collapse with home security is cutting down of military expenditures. But they keep silent about corruption which prevails in military department. They don't want to say about the fact that money for reconstruction and maintenance of military infrastructure (including bombproof shelters) was plundered or distributed among close people and organizations. And now, as a result of war against Lebanon (Hezbollah) military men got reason for pressure at officials for accounts for military needs extension. In spite of it the home front is supporting its army unconditionally but what will happen in future when people will know about their army inefficiency?\n I hope that Israel will reconsider its position as a result of this conflict and the peace will come to this district. But it's too far a way to reach this.",

   "Relatively speaking the Israeli's didn't suffer badly.\n \n They were better prepared and their shelters did mostly work. On the whole unless you go down deeply, bomb shelters don't work on a direct hit (see WWII - London); what they do is protect the inhabitants from shrapnel. You can rebuild houses.",
