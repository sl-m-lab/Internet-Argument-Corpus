   "I thought this was an interesting article, in that it shows protests are not always good just for protests' sake. People get angry about things, but if they don't really think about what they are doing, they can cause more harm than good.\n \"\"I don't ever intend to use BP again,\" said Atlanta resident Monica Manuel who held up a cardboard sign \"Boycott big polluters.\"\n Another protestor, Ruth Resnicow, said it was devastating to see the wildlife on the Gulf Coast being affected by the worst oil disaster in U.S. history. \"The oiled pelican has been a logo of the disaster. People need to see change.\"\n Gas station and convenience store owners say protestors are targeting the wrong people. In 2008, the London, England--based oil giant announced it was exiting the retail gasoline business because margins were lousy. Today, the 11,500 gas stations that carry its logo in the United States are owned by independent franchisees such as Russell Scaramella of Georgia Oil Holdings. He owns 22 BP stations in the Atlanta area which he acquired from the UK firm in March 2009, and he is worried that the bad publicity will eventually hurt his bottom line.\n \"The hardest part is on the employees because they are seeing the protests... they are concerned about their jobs and families,\" Scaramella said.\n Protests such as these are likely to be counterproductive, said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. They can hurt the bottom line of locally owned gas stations instead.\n \n \"So whether you are protesting by marching, or by not buying gas, you are hurting the small business, but you are really not hurting BP,\" he said.\" More at BP boycotts hurt local stations; gas giant offers help - CNN.com",

Well...sorta.\n \n The problem is, there is no \"clean\" company in the oil industry. BP, Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Mobile, Amoco, etc etc... have all spilled oil, and are all at risk of having future accidents. Sure, BP is at the heart of the current disaster, and it's convenient to level anger against them, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Boycotting BP and going elsewhere for gas is like boycotting Marlboro and only smoking Camels because you found out Marlboros cause cancer. \n \n What people need to direct there energy and focus on is how we can mitigate the possibility of future oil spills of this magnitude. I would say developing alternative fuels and working towards cleaner and renewable energy might be a great start.",
