Of course, everybody seems to prefer jumping to conclusions rather then thinking about that. \n \n As for having a bodyguard, its an unfortunate fact that major political figures need protection (hypocrisy or not).\n\n \n I'd think that would be Moore's manager's responsibility. I'd seriously doubt that Moore, or anyone else with his professional schedule, handles such mundane logistical details. This isn't a pro or con opinion of Moore's handgun statement, simply facts that exist regarding most busy people at that level. In Moore's position, I'd immediately be certain the responsible person understood that he/she doesn't hire cheap security. The good ones normally employ former law enforcement types who are allowed to carry concealed weapons in most states as part of that good old boy club. If it's serious security, as with many of the very valuable media artists, most good high level personal security agencies have offices and/or affiliates in most cities that furnish a local, top professional warrior type with an IQ above 140 or so and staff that can guarantee safety from any threat other than a sniper or nuke. They meet the client(s) plane at general aviation, the regular cops know who they are and they know the cops. Moore has that kind of money, somebody suffered the effect of feeling cheap or stupid. Or both. \n \n Upper tier politicians have the very best personal and general security money can buy, including our military and secret service, both in expansion modes. While some folks disagree with Moore's philosophy, there are those out there who consider killing real politicians the cure for despair in a mentally deranged mind generally prompted by voices.",
