   "Does the information that Colin Powell presented to the UN convince you that it's time to go to war with Iraq? Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, said that the US has discovered that Iraq has links with terrorist organizations such as Al Qaida. He also said that satellite photos and Iraqi telephone conversations that the US has intercepted show that Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction. That's not hard to believe. The UN weapons inspectors said that the Iraqis weren't very cooperative- which kind of leads me to believe that they must have something to hide. \n \n What's scary is that Iraq may have links with terrorist organizations. Terrorists and weapons of mass destruction should not mix. What if Iraq gives or sells nuclear weapons to a terrorist organization? About 3,000 people died on 9/11. If 9/11 happens again and terrorists have nuclear weapons this time then millions of innocent Americans could lose their life. Bush is continually moving more troops into the middle east region. If Iraq doesn't cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors then I think there's going to be a war.",

   "Does the information that Colin Powell presented to the UN convince you that it's time to go to war with Iraq?\n\n \n No, much of the information Colin Powell presented to the UN was shown to be utterly bogus today. Iraq invited numerous foreign journalists to tour a lot of the sites that Colin Powell highlighted in his report and his rhetoric was utterly unjustified.\n \n \nColin Powell, US Secretary of State, said that the US has discovered that Iraq has links with terrorist organizations such as Al Qaida. \n\n \n It is true that Iraq has contacts with al-Queda, principally the Kurds in Northern Iraq protected by the No Fly Zone. \n \n \nHe also said that satellite photos and Iraqi telephone conversations that the US has intercepted show that Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction.\n\n \n Where are these \"Weapons of Mass Destruction.\" If he knows where they are at, why not point them out to the UN inspectors and have them destroy them? Oh yes, now we know!\n \n \n That's not hard to believe. \n\n \n Its hard to believe that the U.S. came out today and said there was a high probability of a massive imminent al-Queda attack on the American East Coast given that for roughly a year now they have done nothing but rant about Iraq, in the meantime while al-Queda has been camping out in Yemen and Pakistan laughing their f****** asses off! Nothing better than that shows the utterly irresponsibiltiy of the the U.S. government. If it is al-Queda that is about to imminently attack the United States, should they not be going after the people trying to kill us!\n \n \nThe UN weapons inspectors said that the Iraqis weren't very cooperative- which kind of leads me to believe that they must have something to hide. \n\n \n That is not true at all. Iraq got basically a \"B\" on cooperation. Basically what the Bush Administration wants is another Gulf of Tonkin.\n \n \nWhat's scary is that Iraq may have links with terrorist organizations. \n\n \n That does not scare me in the least. There are dozens of other nations throughout the world with much stronger contacts with the al-Queda organization, such as the Islamicists in Pakistan, a country with nuclear weapons. It is also very scary to me at least how America is totally ignoring the fact that Communism is sweeping across Latin America, in our own backyard. It is scary to me that Brazil, now under the leadership of a fanatical leftist, is about to default on its billions of dollars of loans and develop nuclear weapons.\n \n \nTerrorists and weapons of mass destruction should not mix. \n\n \n I cannot think of another country more likely to sell such weapons to terrorists than North Korea. North Korea just the other days was caught shipping missles to Yemen. North Korea is firing up its OPERATIONAL nuclear reactor and is about to start producing such weapons. By all means though, bomb Iraq!\n \n \nWhat if Iraq gives or sells nuclear weapons to a terrorist organization?\n\n \n Iraq has no nuclear capability whatsoever. North Korea does however and North Korea has been making tons of audacious threats lately, such as \"reducing the land of the imperialists to a sea of fire\" and \"there is no such thing as a world without North Korea.\" North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and it totally kicked the UN inspectors out of North Korea. The situation in East Asia is VERY SERIOUS at is being utterly ignored by the Bush Administration, just like the situation in Latin America.\n \n \nAbout 3,000 people died on 9/11. \n\n \n America has already killed about that many civilians in Afghanistan.\n \n \nIf 9/11 happens again and terrorists have nuclear weapons this time then millions of innocent Americans could lose their life.\n\n \n Obviously the easiest way for 9/11 to happen again is for the Bush Administration to let more terrorists into the United States by utterly failing to control our own borders. Bombing foreign nations incites terrorism and so does supporting the corrupt regimes in the area. The U.S. Government itself is by far the biggest threat to the security of American citizens.\n \n \nBush is continually moving more troops into the middle east region. \n\n \n Iraq is going to double in size within 25 years and Iran is going to add 30 million people. In 25 years the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza will outnumber the Jews 2 to 1 and by 2050 4 to 1. Attempting to conquer and rule over the Middle East at this point in time is an utter mistake of catastrophic proporations. Such an operation will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to maintain and will most likely incite more and more and more terrorism. The situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating as it is. We do not need several more Afghanistans at all, that is of course unless America wants to be the Soviet Union 2.\n \n \nIf Iraq doesn't cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors then I think there's going to be a war.\n\n \n Do you think we should go to war with North Korea? North Korea kicked the UN inspectors out. Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel belligerently attacks its neighbors. Israel kills its own people. Israel threatens its neighbors with Weapons of Mass Destruction. The main source of instability in the area is Israel and its desire to eliminate the Palestinian population.",

   "The Bush administration says that the reason that they are treating North Korea differently is because North Korea has not invaded anyone since the Korean War. Of course I don't want a war, but if it's truly necessary to prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons of mass destruction and another 9/11 then we should go to war. War should be a last resort. If they could find a way to remove Sadam Hussein from power without hurting the Iraqi people that would be much better. What would you do if you were in President Bush's position? What would you do to prevent another 9/11 and prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons of mass destruction?",

Iraq invited numerous foreign journalists to tour a lot of the sites that Colin Powell highlighted in his report and his rhetoric was utterly unjustified.\"\n \n If you were paying attention you would have noticed that buildings were moved around from the photos shown and what the reporters sent back.\n \n \n \"It is true that Iraq has contacts with al-Queda, principally the Kurds in Northern Iraq protected by the No Fly Zone. \"\n \n Then we should take them out as well.\n \n \"Where are these \"Weapons of Mass Destruction.\" If he knows where they are at, why not point them out to the UN inspectors and have them destroy them? Oh yes, now we know!\"\n \n Iraq has had 12 years to learn how to hide things. And everytime we find anything it isnt good enough. We could find a 100 megaton nuke and still people would be saying that it is not good enough for war. According the the cease fire agreement that was signed by Iraq we already have reason enough for war.\n \n \"Its hard to believe that the U.S. came out today and said there was a high probability of a massive imminent al-Queda attack on the American East Coast given that for roughly a year now they have done nothing but rant about Iraq, in the meantime while al-Queda has been camping out in Yemen and Pakistan laughing their f****** asses off! Nothing better than that shows the utterly irresponsibiltiy of the the U.S. government. If it is al-Queda that is about to imminently attack the United States, should they not be going after the people trying to kill us!\"\n \n Remember when Isreal raided Arafat's Compound and found all of those documents that pointed to Iraq as the primary source for funding, training and equipment for the terrorist in the Mid East. Why should we not believe that he will not try to do the same here.\n \n \"That is not true at all. Iraq got basically a \"B\" on cooperation. Basically what the Bush Administration wants is another Gulf of Tonkin.\"\n \n So you are saying that Iraq has been fully cooperative as it said it would in the cease fire agreement?\n \n \"That does not scare me in the least. There are dozens of other nations throughout the world with much stronger contacts with the al-Queda organization, such as the Islamicists in Pakistan, a country with nuclear weapons. It is also very scary to me at least how America is totally ignoring the fact that Communism is sweeping across Latin America, in our own backyard. It is scary to me that Brazil, now under the leadership of a fanatical leftist, is about to default on its billions of dollars of loans and develop nuclear weapons.\"\n \n I agree, lets remove them everywhere but we have to start somewhere.\n \n \"I cannot think of another country more likely to sell such weapons to terrorists than North Korea. North Korea just the other days was caught shipping missles to Yemen. North Korea is firing up its OPERATIONAL nuclear reactor and is about to start producing such weapons. By all means though, bomb Iraq!\"\n \n From the people I have talked to just returning from duty on the 38th they say that South Korea could take the North in under 4 weeks. This would be an acceptable option in my opinion. \n \n \"Iraq has no nuclear capability whatsoever. North Korea does however and North Korea has been making tons of audacious threats lately, such as \"reducing the land of the imperialists to a sea of fire\" and \"there is no such thing as a world without North Korea.\" North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and it totally kicked the UN inspectors out of North Korea. The situation in East Asia is VERY SERIOUS at is being utterly ignored by the Bush Administration, just like the situation in Latin America.\"\n \n I have a feeling that if we were to take a strong stance on N. Korea that the anti war movement would say we are trying to conquer the world and people like you would be saying Bush is trying to get us nuked ect. \n \n \"America has already killed about that many civilians in Afghanistan.\"\n \n And your point is? The way I see it, if we have to sacrifice all of Iraq to make sure that one innocent American life is not lost then we have done a good job. I know this is gonna get me a tounge lashing but I have to say it is how I feel. \n \n \"Obviously the easiest way for 9/11 to happen again is for the Bush Administration to let more terrorists into the United States by utterly failing to control our own borders. Bombing foreign nations incites terrorism and so does supporting the corrupt regimes in the area. The U.S. Government itself is by far the biggest threat to the security of American citizens.\"\n \n I agree with the securing of our borders but every attempt to even discuss a feasable way to do so (mine fields) gets hammered in congress, so call your congress men and your senators, let them know how you fee. \n Who were we bombing when the WTC was hit?\n \n \"Iraq is going to double in size within 25 years and Iran is going to add 30 million people.

North Korea kicked the UN inspectors out. Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel belligerently attacks its neighbors. Israel kills its own people. Israel threatens its neighbors with Weapons of Mass Destruction. The main source of instability in the area is Israel and its desire to eliminate the Palestinian population\". \n \n \n I have already answered the N. Korea question.\n Isreal attacks its neighbors when they attack her. Isreal kills its own people while it is fighting its war on terrorism. Isreal has told its neighbors (Iraq) that if they use chemical weapons on her that they will get blistered. Isreal has not taken any steps to eliminate the Palestinian pop. please back this up with proof.\n Even if Isreal is the main source of instability and our support of Isreal is what brings attacks, I do not think we should budge an inch under a threat. If we were to do so that would just be telling everyone that if you want America to do something or to not do something then all you go to do is blow up a building. What if they blow up buildings and say that they wont stop until we make our women cover from head to toe and our men wear beards? I have said this before and I will say it again.\n THIS IS NOT FRANCE! WE DO NOT GIVE INTO TERRORIST OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER THAT WOULD THREATEN US WITH FORCE!\n GOD BLESS AMERICA",
