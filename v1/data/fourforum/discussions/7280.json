   "Does Bush have a piece of paper somewhere, probably kept in the pentagon, labeled something like \"Plan to bomb Iran\"? Almost certainly. A big part of the pentagon's job is to figure out scenarios just in case they need them. Bombing Iran is an obvious idea, so I'm sure they have a bunch of scenanarios all laid out. Does Bush intend to use any of these plans? It would be incredibly stupid thing to do at this point. So, yeah, he may well be considering it. If Iran got nukes it would be a very bad thing. Given Bush's record he may well not be able to come up with any way of preventing them from developing nukes that doesn't involve bombing them. So, in the name of \"world safety\", he may well drag us into another war.",

   "We will not bomb Iran unless they lash at us, refuse to halt nuclear weapons production, or they \"wipe Israel off the map\".\n Iran more than likely will be the next war because you got a thug in there running the government, and a bunch of Ayatolla followers, and chaos. You also got a nuclear weapons production that has been proved to be happening, and a bunch of threats towards Israel and the latest, \"i hope sharon dies\".\n What is America doing? We not only need reform in that country, but a demolishment of their arms race. This is like the cold war between America and Russia. I don't like the fact that Iran has nuclear capabilities and weapons that are coming to be built.\n I am afraid Iran could \"wipe Israel off the map\" cause they would possibly do it. Reason I say is cause I know they would. Some say, oh, they would not do that cause America would lash back at them. Well, Al Qaeda killed 3,000 people on September 11. Guess what, they risked their government, their country, and their way of life just to attack the only remaining superpower in the world. Nuking another country is so easy. I am sure Iran is just like Al Qaeda and will be willing to risk their country for the anailation of the jews. Hell, Adolf Hitler risked his country exterminating jews, poles, Russians, and others. He risked his country when he attacked the USSR, and he risked his country attacking Britain. Even though they fall out of power and themselves are eventually killed, these thugs are more willing than you people think. \n I can see the Iranian president risking his country, government, and so on, by attacking the jews. I am ashamed that my government is supporting this ####. They are offering to enrich their uranium, and so on. I am ashamed. But, only time will tell.\n -John",

   "This is a tough question. For one, attacking Iran is not like attacking Iraq. Iran has teeth. On the other hand, if we fail to attack Iran after they spit in our face, we essentially have lost any and all control in the ME. \n \n Additionally, there is a financial aspect to consider. We attack Iran, and $100per barrel oil is not likely to be far behind as Iran is OPECs 2nd biggest exporter.\n \n With the addiiotn fo the Russian TOR M-1 air defense system, Iran has a powerful defense against air attack. The Tor M-1 is the most adavanced air defense system in the world. It is even better than anythign the US has. It is capable of targeting planes, cruise missiles, or even bombs in mid air. With the remote radar station, not only is it capable of seeing and engaging our stealth bombers, it is incredibly difficult to kill becuase the remote rader stations can be located up to 150 miles from the actual launcher, makign any attempt to engage the launcher a XXXX shoot. \n \n Additionally, retaliation is likely to be swift and severe. The Iranians also bought a number of cruise missiles in the Ukraine several years ago. The missiles in questiona re designed to carry a nuclear payload. While there is no confirmation that the Iranians have any nukes, the nuclear weapons that were on those missiles have never been accounted for. They are on the list of over 100 Ukrainian nukes that were lost due to a \"clerical error\". Even without the nuclear warheads, the missiles are a serious threat. We do nto have ANYTHING that will take them down in flight. Our SOP is to try to use an AWACS to vector fighters to the missile and shoot it down manually. Our kill rate on them in simulation is only about 5%. We have trouble getting any kind of lock on them and they fly damn fast. It is like trying to thread a needle at 700 miles per hour.\n \n They can do all the neat tricks that US missiles can do, like fly down HVAC ducts or hit a specific window in a building. Assuming that they don't have the nukes that go with the missiles, it still seems highly likely that they have copied the missiles, which gives them some serious strategic teeth.\n \n I have seen a lot of people argue that IRan does not have the skill to reverse engineer those missiles. I agree. They do not. They don't need to reverse engineer them, they just need to copy them. There is a world of difference. When you reverse engineer something, you have to understand exactly how it works. Copying it is much simpler.\n \n Currently, I would say that it is too close to call. From a practical standpoint, we would be absolute fools to attack Iran. BUT, we have shown lately that if nothing else, the AMerican public is a bunch of absolute fools, and the president and his little band of merry men are as well.",

   "http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/010906I.shtml\n \n By William Rivers Pitt\n t r u t h o u t | Perspective\n Monday 09 January 2006\n The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran. \"The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year, according to German media reports, reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media,\" reported UPI on December 30th.\n \n \"The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week,\" continued UPI, \"quoted 'NATO intelligence sources' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah-led regime into line, including military options. This 'all options are open' line has been President George W Bush's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months.\"\n \n An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order.\n \n 1. Blowback in Iraq\n The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations, principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decades. In essence, Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government.\n \n Should the United States undertake military action against Iran, the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme.\n \n In the first eight days of January, eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday. Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little political power in the government. \n \n If the US attacks Iran, it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran. The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties, US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power. Iraq, already a seething cauldron, will sink further into chaos.\n \n 2. Iran's Armaments\n Unlike Iraq, Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions, repeated attacks, and two American-led wars. While Iran's conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran-Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.\n \n According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004, Iran \"has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves. They include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare. Iran's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks, 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 artillery weapons, 306 combat aircraft, 60 attack helicopters, 3 submarines, 59 surface combatants, and 10 amphibious ships.\"\n \n \"Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability,\" continued the CSIS report. \"Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare, and poses the additional threat of proliferation. There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long-range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction. It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown.\"\n \n A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports, \"Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf, Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf. The so called 'Tanker' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region. Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective.\"\n \n \"More concerning,\" continued the MILNET brief, \"is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy. The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect, anti-shipping cruise missiles: 'Iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China, midget submarines from North Korea, submarines from Russia, and modern mines.'\"\n \n It is Iran's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf, especially for the US Navy. Iran's coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters. The Gulf itself only has one exit, the Strait of Hormuz, which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline. In essence, Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf. Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below.\n \n Of all the missiles in Iran's armament, the most dangerous is the Russian-made SS-N-22 Sunburn. These missiles are, simply, the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet. The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude. Its maximum low-altitude speed is Mach 2.2, some three times faster than the American-made Harpoon. The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range. The missile's manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer, and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship. The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile. Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors. The Stark could not see them to stop them.\n \n The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, with some 7,000 souls aboard. Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force, which includes the USS Tarawa, the USS Austin, and the USS Pearl Harbor. The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf. The Sunburn missile, with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection, would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders.\n \n Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq. Currently, the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms, shoulder-fired grenades and roadside bombs. The vaunted American military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare. The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war, a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days. If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles, along with any or all of its nearly million-strong army, into the Iraq fray, the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire.\n \n (More)",

   "3. The Syrian Connection\n In February of 2005, Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat \"challenges and threats\" in the region. This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq, and a reaction to America's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus. An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces.\n \n Like Iran, Syria's military is nothing to scoff at. Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel. Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel's overwhelming capabilities. As of 2002, Syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability. The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.\n \n Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of SCUD-derived systems. Iran, North Korea and China have been willing providers of state-of-the-art technologies. Compounding this is the well-based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf.\n \n 4. China and the US Economy\n While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos, missiles in the Gulf, and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran, all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US/Iran engagement.\n \n China's economy is exploding, hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry. In the last several months, China has inked deals with Iran for $70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas. China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years, will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran, and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field. China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea, where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China.\n \n Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health. Further, any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China's liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz. Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran, the US would be faced with a significant threat. This threat exists not merely on a military level, though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan. More significantly, China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand.\n \n Paul Craig Roberts, writing for The American Conservative, said in July of 2005 that \"As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States, the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $1 trillion. China's accumulation of dollars is approximately $600 billion. South Korea holds about $200 billion. These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States. By dumping some portion of their reserves, these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rates skyrocketing. Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action, but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan, for example - China holds the cards. China and Japan, and the world at large, have more dollar reserves than they require. They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose.\"\n \n \"The hardest blow on Americans,\" concluded Roberts, \"will fall when China does revalue its currency. When China's currency ceases to be undervalued, American shoppers in Wal-Mart, where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China, will think they are in Neiman Marcus. Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes. If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market, American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression.\"\n \n In short, China has the American economy by the throat. Should they decide to squeeze, we will all feel it. China's strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States.\n \n 5. American Preparedness\n American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield. The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception. The last three years of the Iraq occupation, however, have sapped this confidence. Worse, the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military, justifying the decrease in confidence. Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, recruiting is at an all-time low. Soldiers with vital training and know-how are refusing to re-enlist. Across the board, the American military is stretched to the breaking point.\n \n Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation. According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University, the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration. If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq, and comes to involve Syria, our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously. Add to this the economic threat posed by China, and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe.\n \n If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments, missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq, our troops there will be fish in a barrel. Iran's position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair. In the worst-case scenario, the newly-minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play, hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam.\n \n (More)",

   "Conclusion: Is Any of This Possible?\n The question must be put as directly as possible: what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe? It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq, Iran, Syria and China simultaneously.\n \n Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons, but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat. Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation, and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor. Therefore, any attack upon Iran's nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess. Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe. The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation, however, seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so-called \"War on Terror.\"\n \n Unfortunately, all the dangers in the world are no match for the self-assurance of a bubble-encased zealot. What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course? Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n \n George W. Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front. Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media. More significantly, recall Iraq. Karl Rove, Bush's most senior advisor, notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to \"run on the war.\" The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms, but during the 2004 Presidential election.\n \n What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran, and from the diversion of attention to that attack? The answer lies in one now-familiar name: Jack Abramoff. The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard-fought GOP gains in Congress, and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away.\n \n Is any of this a probability? Logic says no, but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics. All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth.\n \n They did it once already in Iraq.",

   "Excellent post, though I think the author could have (and should have) delved a little deeper into Iran's shoulder fired and man portable weapons systems. Iran's production of Konkurs anti tank missiles, and their possession of tens of thousands of Kornet anti tank missiles essentially negating our primary ground combat advantage...our armor.\n \n The Iraqis did not ever have any kind of single shot solution for our tanks and APCs and certainly did not have any after years of embargo. Their only option was to try to double or triple tap them with RPGs. Don't get me wrong, a guy with an RPG is more than capable of taking out an Abrams tank, but he must fire a first shot to pierce the outer armor, a second, and often a third to pierce the inner armor. Additionally, the effective range of the RPG is fairly limited (700 meters is the maximum practical engagement range, and they are not real accurate past 200 meters).\n \n The Iranian Konkurs and the Kornet are both single shot solutions for the Abrams tank or any APC we have in our arsenal. With ranges of 4 and 5 KM respectively, both missiles are designed for long range engagement (though they can be used at less then 10 meters effectively) and the Iranian have enough of them to put them all over the country.",

   "Here's a good fictional story about what would happen on the first day of the war against Iran :\n \n \n Day One - The War With Iran\n \n By Douglas Herman, USAF veteran\n \n The war began as planned. The Israeli pilots took off well before dawn and streaked across Lebanon and northern Iraq, high above Kirkuk. Flying US-made F-15 and F-16s, the Israelis separated over the mountains of western Iran, the pilots gesturing a last minute show of confidence in their mission, maintaining radio silence.\n \n Just before the sun rose over Tehran, moments before the Muslim call to prayer, the missiles struck their targets. While US Air Force AWACS planes circled overhead--listening, watching, recording--heavy US bombers followed minutes later. Bunker-busters and mini-nukes fell on dozens of targets while Iranian anti-aircraft missiles sped skyward.\n \n The ironically named Bushehr nuclear power plant crumbled to dust. Russian technicians and foreign nationals scurried for safety. Most did not make it.\n \n Targets in Saghand and Yazd, all of them carefully chosen many months before by Pentagon planners, were destroyed. The uranium enrichment facility in Natanz; a heavy water plant and radioisotope facility in Arak; the Ardekan Nuclear Fuel Unit; the Uranium Conversion Facility and Nuclear Technology Center in Isfahan; were struck simultaneously by USAF and Israeli bomber groups.\n \n The Tehran Nuclear Research Center, the Tehran Molybdenum, Iodine and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility, the Tehran Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories, the Kalaye Electric Company in the Tehran suburbs were destroyed.\n \n Iranian fighter jets rose in scattered groups. At least those Iranian fighter planes that had not been destroyed on the ground by swift and systematic air strikes from US and Israeli missiles. A few Iranian fighters even launched missiles, downing the occasional attacker, but American top guns quickly prevailed in the ensuing dogfights.\n \n The Iranian air force, like the Iranian navy, never really knew what hit them. Like the slumbering US sailors at Pearl Harbor, the pre-dawn, pre-emptive attack wiped out fully half the Iranian defense forces in a matter of hours.\n \n By mid-morning, the second and third wave of US/Israeli raiders screamed over the secondary targets. The only problem now, the surprising effectiveness of the Iranian missile defenses. The element of surprise lost, US and Israeli warplanes began to fall from the skies in considerable numbers to anti-aircraft fire.\n \n At 7:35 AM, Tehran time, the first Iranian anti-ship missile destroyed a Panamanian oil tanker, departing from Kuwait and bound for Houston. Launched from an Iranian fighter plane, the Exocet split the ship in half and set the ship ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz. A second and third tanker followed, black smoke billowing from the broken ships before they blew up and sank. By 8:15 AM, all ship traffic on the Persian Gulf had ceased.\n \n US Navy ships, ordered earlier into the relative safety of the Indian Ocean, south of their base in Bahrain, launched counter strikes. Waves of US fighter planes circled the burning wrecks in the bottleneck of Hormuz but the Iranian fighters had fled.\n \n At 9 AM, Eastern Standard Time, many hours into the war, CNN reported a squadron of suicide Iranian fighter jets attacking the US Navy fleet south of Bahrain. Embedded reporters aboard the ships--sending live feeds directly to a rapt audience of Americans just awakening--reported all of the Iranian jets destroyed, but not before the enemy planes launched dozens of Exocet and Sunburn anti-ship missiles. A US aircraft carrier, cruiser and two destroyers suffered direct hits. The cruiser blew up and sank, killing 600 men. The aircraft carrier sank an hour later.\n \n By mid-morning, every military base in Iran was partially or wholly destroyed. Sirens blared and fires blazed from hundreds of fires. Explosions rocked Tehran and the electrical power failed. The Al Jazeerah news station in Tehran took a direct hit from a satellite bomb, leveling the entire block.\n \n At 9:15 AM, Baghdad time, the first Iranian missile struck the Green Zone. For the next thirty minutes a torrent of missiles landed on GPS coordinates carefully selected by Shiite militiamen with cell phones positioned outside the Green Zone and other permanent US bases. Although US and Israeli bomber pilots had destroyed 90% of the Iranian missiles, enough Shahabs remained to fully destroy the Green Zone, the Baghdad airport, and a US Marine base. Thousands of unsuspecting US soldiers died in the early morning barrage. Not surprisingly, CNN and Fox withheld the great number of casualties from American viewers.\n \n By 9:30 AM, gas stations on the US east coast began to raise their prices. Slowly at first and then altogether in a panic, the prices rose. $4 a gallon, and then $5 and then $6, the prices skyrocketed. Worried motorists, rushing from work, roared into the nearest gas station, radios blaring the latest reports of the pre-emptive attack on Iran. While fistfights broke out in gas stations everywhere, the third Middle Eastern war had begun.\n \n In Washington DC, the spin began minutes after the first missile struck its intended target. The punitive strike--not really a war said the harried White House spokesman--would further democracy and peace in the Middle East. Media pundits mostly followed the party line. By ridding Iran of weapons of mass destruction, Donald Rumsfeld declared confidently on CNN, Iran might follow in the footsteps of Iraq, and enjoy the hard won fruits of freedom.\n \n The president scheduled a speech at 2 PM. Gas prices rose another two dollars before then. China and Japan threatened to dump US dollars. Gold rose $120 an ounce. The dollar plummeted against the Euro.\n \n CNN reported violent, anti-American protests in Paris, London, Rome, Berlin and Dublin. Fast food franchises throughout Europe, carrying American corporate logos, were firebombed.\n \n A violent coup toppled the pro-American Pakistan president. On the New York Stock Exchange, prices fell in a frenzy of trading--except for the major petroleum producers. A single, Iranian Shahab missile struck Tel Aviv, destroying an entire city block. Israel vowed revenge, and threatened a nuclear strike on Tehran, before a hastily called UN General Assembly in New York City eased tensions.\n \n An orange alert in New York City suddenly reddened to a full-scale terror alarm when a package detonated on a Manhattan subway. Mayor Bloomberg declared martial law. Governor Pataki ordered the New York National Guard fully mobilized, mobilizing what few national guardsmen remained in the state.\n \n President Bush looked shaken at 2 PM. The scroll below the TV screen reported Persian Gulf nations halting production of oil until the conflict could be resolved peacefully. Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, announced a freeze in oil deliveries to the US would begin immediately. Tony Blair offered to mediate peace negotiations, between the US and Israel and Iran, but was resoundingly rejected.\n \n By 6 PM, Eastern Standard Time, gas prices had stabilized at just below $10 a gallon. A Citgo station in Texas, near Fort Sam Houston Army base, was firebombed. No one claimed responsibility. Terrorism was not ruled out.\n \n At sunset, the call to prayer--in Tehran, Baghdad, Islamabad, Ankara, Jerusalem, Jakarta, Riyadh--sounded uncannily like the buzzing of enraged bees.",

Hit by hit could perhaps chip through the multiple layers of the composite armour?\n \n As for the main topic, I think we have found out that while the US can defeat any single world military in a straight on confrontation, it cannot fight on too many fronts simultaneously, so while it could take onAfghanistan and Iraq, and possibly Iran, we'd get a very very relieved North Korea and god knows who else stirring up trouble.\n \n As for the effects, I think Gamehuis is closest to a real scenario.

   "The advantage of the anti tank missile systems is that they are man portable and require very little by way of support. An autocannon requires a large amount of heavy ammo, and they are not man portable or especially concealable. Against an enemy running older equipment and without air superiority, the autocannon is a viable anti tank weapon. Against an enemy using newer equipment, and with the ability to vector air support quickly, the missiles are a better option.\n \n The US pulling a large first strike is certainly viable. A limited assault is, IMO, more difficult to call. Most of the Iranian targets that we might wish to hit in a limited strike are hardened. Most are heavily protected by automated air defense systems. While I certainly believe that we could pull it off, it would require significant resources and there is a possibility of failure. \n \n Additionally, a limited strike scenario would be a non repeatable event. Once the Iranians recognize our intent to engage in immediate military action they can bring more air defense systems on line, keep air intercept squadrons on rotating patrols, and launch their missiles at our bases in the Middle East (in Iraq and Kuwait).\n \n I am afraid that our politicians will attempt to initiate a limited first strike in order to avoid full warfare with Iran. I would imagine their military planners are already telling them that this is not an option. In order to have any hope of victory without taking significant US casualties, we have to decimate Iran's military during the course of our primary engagement. Failure to do so would likely result in the destruction of all of our fixed bases in Iraq and Kuwait. Iranian ballistic missiles are MUCH more effective and more reliable than the Scuds utilized by Iraq, and they have a LOT more of them. It is estimated that the Iranians can put 200 missiles in the air in the first 20 minutes of any engagement. Even if 50% of those were destroyed or failed in flight, that is still enough to take out ALL of our military facilities in Iraq and Kuwait, and wipe out every major Israeli military base. \n \n \n That said, I think that whether or not we have the ability to pull a successful first strike depends largely on your definition of the word \"successful\". If \"Successful\" is limited solely to engaging and destroying our designated target, then yes, we can absolutely do it. If, on the other hand, successful includes not getting 80-90% of the soldiers we have in the ME killed in the process, then our odds of success drop significantly.",

   "Here's a good fictional story about what would happen on the first day of the war against Iran :\n \n \n Day One - The War With Iran\n \n By Douglas Herman, USAF veteran\n \n The war began as planned. The Israeli pilots took off well before dawn and streaked across Lebanon and northern Iraq, high above Kirkuk. Flying US-made F-15 and F-16s, the Israelis separated over the mountains of western Iran, the pilots gesturing a last minute show of confidence in their mission, maintaining radio silence.\n \n Just before the sun rose over Tehran, moments before the Muslim call to prayer, the missiles struck their targets. While US Air Force AWACS planes circled overhead--listening, watching, recording--heavy US bombers followed minutes later. Bunker-busters and mini-nukes fell on dozens of targets while Iranian anti-aircraft missiles sped skyward.\n \n The ironically named Bushehr nuclear power plant crumbled to dust. Russian technicians and foreign nationals scurried for safety. Most did not make it.\n \n Targets in Saghand and Yazd, all of them carefully chosen many months before by Pentagon planners, were destroyed. The uranium enrichment facility in Natanz; a heavy water plant and radioisotope facility in Arak; the Ardekan Nuclear Fuel Unit; the Uranium Conversion Facility and Nuclear Technology Center in Isfahan; were struck simultaneously by USAF and Israeli bomber groups.\n \n The Tehran Nuclear Research Center, the Tehran Molybdenum, Iodine and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility, the Tehran Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories, the Kalaye Electric Company in the Tehran suburbs were destroyed.\n \n Iranian fighter jets rose in scattered groups. At least those Iranian fighter planes that had not been destroyed on the ground by swift and systematic air strikes from US and Israeli missiles. A few Iranian fighters even launched missiles, downing the occasional attacker, but American top guns quickly prevailed in the ensuing dogfights.\n \n The Iranian air force, like the Iranian navy, never really knew what hit them. Like the slumbering US sailors at Pearl Harbor, the pre-dawn, pre-emptive attack wiped out fully half the Iranian defense forces in a matter of hours.\n \n By mid-morning, the second and third wave of US/Israeli raiders screamed over the secondary targets. The only problem now, the surprising effectiveness of the Iranian missile defenses. The element of surprise lost, US and Israeli warplanes began to fall from the skies in considerable numbers to anti-aircraft fire.\n \n At 7:35 AM, Tehran time, the first Iranian anti-ship missile destroyed a Panamanian oil tanker, departing from Kuwait and bound for Houston. Launched from an Iranian fighter plane, the Exocet split the ship in half and set the ship ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz. A second and third tanker followed, black smoke billowing from the broken ships before they blew up and sank. By 8:15 AM, all ship traffic on the Persian Gulf had ceased.\n \n US Navy ships, ordered earlier into the relative safety of the Indian Ocean, south of their base in Bahrain, launched counter strikes. Waves of US fighter planes circled the burning wrecks in the bottleneck of Hormuz but the Iranian fighters had fled.\n \n At 9 AM, Eastern Standard Time, many hours into the war, CNN reported a squadron of suicide Iranian fighter jets attacking the US Navy fleet south of Bahrain. Embedded reporters aboard the ships--sending live feeds directly to a rapt audience of Americans just awakening--reported all of the Iranian jets destroyed, but not before the enemy planes launched dozens of Exocet and Sunburn anti-ship missiles. A US aircraft carrier, cruiser and two destroyers suffered direct hits. The cruiser blew up and sank, killing 600 men. The aircraft carrier sank an hour later.\n \n By mid-morning, every military base in Iran was partially or wholly destroyed. Sirens blared and fires blazed from hundreds of fires. Explosions rocked Tehran and the electrical power failed. The Al Jazeerah news station in Tehran took a direct hit from a satellite bomb, leveling the entire block.\n \n At 9:15 AM, Baghdad time, the first Iranian missile struck the Green Zone. For the next thirty minutes a torrent of missiles landed on GPS coordinates carefully selected by Shiite militiamen with cell phones positioned outside the Green Zone and other permanent US bases. Although US and Israeli bomber pilots had destroyed 90% of the Iranian missiles, enough Shahabs remained to fully destroy the Green Zone, the Baghdad airport, and a US Marine base. Thousands of unsuspecting US soldiers died in the early morning barrage. Not surprisingly, CNN and Fox withheld the great number of casualties from American viewers.\n \n By 9:30 AM, gas stations on the US east coast began to raise their prices. Slowly at first and then altogether in a panic, the prices rose. $4 a gallon, and then $5 and then $6, the prices skyrocketed. Worried motorists, rushing from work, roared into the nearest gas station, radios blaring the latest reports of the pre-emptive attack on Iran. While fistfights broke out in gas stations everywhere, the third Middle Eastern war had begun.\n \n In Washington DC, the spin began minutes after the first missile struck its intended target. The punitive strike--not really a war said the harried White House spokesman--would further democracy and peace in the Middle East. Media pundits mostly followed the party line. By ridding Iran of weapons of mass destruction, Donald Rumsfeld declared confidently on CNN, Iran might follow in the footsteps of Iraq, and enjoy the hard won fruits of freedom.\n \n The president scheduled a speech at 2 PM. Gas prices rose another two dollars before then. China and Japan threatened to dump US dollars. Gold rose $120 an ounce. The dollar plummeted against the Euro.\n \n CNN reported violent, anti-American protests in Paris, London, Rome, Berlin and Dublin. Fast food franchises throughout Europe, carrying American corporate logos, were firebombed.\n \n A violent coup toppled the pro-American Pakistan president. On the New York Stock Exchange, prices fell in a frenzy of trading--except for the major petroleum producers. A single, Iranian Shahab missile struck Tel Aviv, destroying an entire city block. Israel vowed revenge, and threatened a nuclear strike on Tehran, before a hastily called UN General Assembly in New York City eased tensions.\n \n An orange alert in New York City suddenly reddened to a full-scale terror alarm when a package detonated on a Manhattan subway. Mayor Bloomberg declared martial law. Governor Pataki ordered the New York National Guard fully mobilized, mobilizing what few national guardsmen remained in the state.\n \n President Bush looked shaken at 2 PM. The scroll below the TV screen reported Persian Gulf nations halting production of oil until the conflict could be resolved peacefully. Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, announced a freeze in oil deliveries to the US would begin immediately. Tony Blair offered to mediate peace negotiations, between the US and Israel and Iran, but was resoundingly rejected.\n \n By 6 PM, Eastern Standard Time, gas prices had stabilized at just below $10 a gallon.

The Shrub needs to go.",

So, without worrying about what the right thinks, do you think Iran is trying to get nukes or not?\n\n \n I think they already have them. Over 100 nukes just kin dof disapeared from the Ukrain following the breakup of the soviet union, including the nukes that were supposed to be attached to the cruise missiels that we KNOW the Iranians bought. If you are smuggling the cruise missiles anyway, you may as well buy the nukes for them, too.\n \n Additionaly, their heavy water reactor will have produced more than ehough plutonium by now to build at least one, and likely 2 weapons. They have the technology, and have for several years, to harvest this plutonium from the spent fuel.\n \n I think this is part of the reason they have such a cocky attitude on this. Israelbombs Iran, they wipe israel off the map. The US bombs IRan, they take out 2 of our carrier groups. The world will, IMO accept either of these actions by Iran as defensive. They are not likely to accept nuclear counterstrikes by the US or Israel either one. \n \n I think this is all a moot point, though. It seems that the last few days the rhetoric against Iran has backed off a bit as it has become obvious that their posession of 10% of the worlds oil supply is a much better weapon than any nuke. The chinese have already announced that they will not honor an oil embargo, the Russians have said they will not honor a weapons embargo, and noth have refused to even consider any kind of technology embargo. Russia has even gone so far as to say that regardless of what happens in the Security council, they will be forging ahead with Irans reactor program.\n \n If it came to military action, it would be unilateral action, and would essentially be the US and israel vs. Iran, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. Simply put, we would loose. We don't have the manpower, equipment, or money to fight such a war. China and Russia would likely both support Iran with materials and weapons, and the US economy, based primarily on cheap energy, would crumble to dust under the weight of $100+ oil.",
