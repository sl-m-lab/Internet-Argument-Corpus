I feel like we need to be protected from religion.\n\n \n Actually, some Christian denominations do celebrate gay marriage already. Some (not all) of the Unitarian Universalists and Congregationalists do, and so does the predominantly gay Metropolitan Community Church. Still, they are very small churches, and I'd be surprised if there were a first amendment attempt to get gay marriage past the courts based on the separation of church and state. If lawyers thought it feasible, it might have been tried, already.\n \n You and I might think the logic impeccable on the surface, but it depends on what a judge thinks. Here's how I think the argument would go down. It is not the case that the state is recognising the religious marriages of some denominations but not others. It has its own, purely secular standards for legal civil marriage which have nothing to do with anyone's religion. \n \n I seriously think it would be extraordinarily difficult to make a persuasive case that the state is discriminating against a religion by not recognising a religious gay marriage. The law does not make them illegal, after all. It's civil gay marriage that is illegal, and that simply isn't a church-state matter. Churches are free to marry whomever they please, but the state is not obliged to amend its own institutional definitions to reflect the definitions of any church. To argue that it must would be to hold the state hostage to any cockamamie screwball cult that came along. I don't think you'd get a judge in the land to go along with that.\n \n [Added in edit] In fact, I think you could argue that the Constitution prohibits the state from recognising any church marriage on the sole grounds that the church demands it. The first amendment prohibits meddling by the government in religion, but also the reverse. Government cannot tell churches whom they can or can't join in holy wedlock, but by the same token, a church can't force its form of holy wedlock on the state, as the Mormons in Utah found out. The institutions have to be separate.",
