   "Yes, the Israeli are escalating the cycle of violence once again. The Israeli Offensive Forces took military control of a Palestine prison in Jericho destroying much of the prison and killing two Palestinian prison security guards and wounding 26 Palestinian people. This happen ten minutes after the British government removed their observers form the Palestinian prison. The Israeli arrested a Palestinian prisoner who was the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) Ahmad Saadat for the assassination of the Israeli Minister of tourism, in 2001. There were five other Palestinian prisoners who were wanted by the Israeli government. \n \n The Israeli government is on the public record saying they will take any military actions needed for the security of the State of Israel. These are the types of Israeli military actions that renew the cycle of violence in this life long conflict. Since the Israeli have turn Gaza over to Palestinian internal control the boarder crossing going in and out of Gaza have been closed most of the time. Special Envoy James Wolfensohn help to pay (out of his own pocket) the Israeli settlers for some of the greenhouses they left standing in Gaza. Otherwise, the greenhouses would have been destroyed by the Israeli Offensive Forces like everything else the Jewish settlers left standing.\n \n The Israeli government has done almost everything it could do to escalate the violence and tensions between the people in the Holy Land. While the Israelis are giving with one hand, they are pulling the carpet from underneath the feet of the Palestinian society with the other hand. Then they wonder why there is so much hate and animosity toward them as a nation and people. The targeted assassination of Palestinian leaders by the Israeli Offence Forces must stop before the cycle of violence resumes. Any act of restraint by the Palestinian society. The Israeli try to take the credit as their policies are working. \n \n http://peacereform.blogspot.com/",

   "This is the same thing that was taking place under Sharon. theya re just being less subtle abotu it. They give pennies while taking hundred dollar bills and then point ot the pennies they gave and say \"LOOK HOW GREAT WE ARE\". And idiot Americans with no idea of what is going on cheer for the bloodthirsty, genocidal maniacs.\n \n Hopefully israel will do somethign foolish like attack Iran, which will net the palestenians all the aid they need to attack israel, which will already be much weakend by 200 Iranian cruise missles and ballistic missiles screaming into Israel as a couter attack.\n \n The Israelis have been selling the myth of the great Israeli military for so long that the fact that EVERY projection I ever saw in my military career regarding an Israel/Arab war shows Israel being turned into a smoking crater is irrelevant to them. Even if ISrael were to use nukes, their arogance and real estate poicies have neted them too many well armed neiborghs in the region for them to have any hope of survival.",

Even if ISrael were to use nukes, their arogance and real estate poicies have neted them too many well armed neiborghs in the region for them to have any hope of survival.\n\n \n You've got to remember the religious factor as well. The Orthodox faction has a great deal of power within Israel, and these people genuinely believe that the end of the world is coming and that they are the ones who stand to gain from it when it does.\n \n The Jews returning to Israel is one of the major signs of the coming apocalypse, and any Hasidim worth his salt is going to have 100% faith in the power of the Lord to protect Israel against its enemies.\n \n I was in Israel in 2001 (on 9/11 no less!) and the one event that sticks in my mind is talking to an Ortho (as we called them) at the Western Wall. We were talking to him, as with so many other conversations with Israelis, about the 'situation', as it is referred to in almost reverential terms over there. He laughed, pointed up to the Haram-esh-Sharif, to the Dome of the Rock, and said \"Soon will come the time when our Temple will stand there.\"\n \n I cannot over-emphasize the utter seriousness and excitement displayed on his face as he said these words. No cares about the potential socio-political fallout from a future demolition of a very holy Muslim site to make way for a Jewish one, no sense of what I would call 'reality' at all, just pure, unambiguous zealotry. \n \n This is off topic, but for me this moment was the tipping point that put me firmly, once and for all, in the \"religion is a mental illness\" corner. This guy was possibly the most fervently religious human being I will ever come into contact with, and his one sentence changed my views on religion, on human nature, on Israel, on global politics, forever. \n \n This is the same mindset that fuels terrorism; these people genuinely do not care what happens in this world because they are utterly certain that it is the 'next' life that matters, and they 'know' they have a winning ticket.\n \n I do not expect many people to appreciate this post, but I would urge you to go and talk to the Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem about world politics. You will find their views are not dissimilar to someoen like Bin Laden. I do not say this lightly, and I do not like it. But I spent 4 months in Israel and this was only the most extreme, and refined, version of the same argument that I heard over and over again. Much of Israeli domestic policy is self-justifying; they have returned to the Holy Land which demonstrates that they truly are God's Chosen People, therefore they can do no wrong and the violence we see now is just the precursor to the final battle, in which the Israeli Jews will come out on top, and for all time.\n \n Of course they don't all believe this, but enough do that it made an impression on me after 4 months, and due to the (understandably) obsessive Israeli emphasis on reviving and re-living ancient Jewish culture, the more fundamentalist you are the more funding you get, the more political prominence you get, the more media space you get. I genuinely feel sorry for the Israelis; they are caught between religion and reality, between history and their own potential, they cannot help but dig themselves into the biggest hole in the world, and the sides are starting to collapse.",

They also share it with many American christians. It was not long ago that Bassman on this very page stated \"THERE IS A MANSION WAITING FOR ME IN HEAVEN\". Great. Kill youself and get to moving into it. \n \n I occasionally wander through some of the evangelical web pages. You would be absolutly SHOCKED at the number of ignorant christian zealots out there who just CANT WAIT for the end of the world so jesus will snatch them away. They are just foaming at the mouth waiting for it. \n \n Wander through the religous forums here and there are plenty of delusional XXXXXX who are absolutly certain that when they die, jesus is coming for them. They don't fear death for themselves or anybody else. \n \n \nOf course they don't all believe this, but enough do that it made an impression on me after 4 months, and due to the (understandably) obsessive Israeli emphasis on reviving and re-living ancient Jewish culture, the more fundamentalist you are the more funding you get, the more political prominence you get, the more media space you get. I genuinely feel sorry for the Israelis; they are caught between religion and reality, between history and their own potential, they cannot help but dig themselves into the biggest hole in the world, and the sides are starting to collapse.\n\n \n What potential? They are a nation lacking in natural resources, without a highly skilled manufacturing labor pool, and with polices so horrendous that no busines person in their right mind would be willing to deal with them for 50 years even if they renounced those policies tomorrow. \n \n Israel is a welfare state in the truest sense fo the word. They are entirely dependant on foreign contributions for survival. WIthout the billions that the US provides, they cannot afford to feed their people, nor is it likely that they will ever be able to. They picked quite possibly the worst place on the plant to try to build an independant jewish homeland. Guided by their mythical belief system, and the belief (without any evidence to supprot it at all) that there MUST be oil in israel, they created a nation that cannot possibly survive without trillions in handouts.",
