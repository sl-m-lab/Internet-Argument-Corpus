OR WILL YOU ALWAYS SET YOURSELF UP FOR HUMILIATION AS YOU BLATANTLY DISTORT THE FACTS. Read this LINK for the backstory regarding Chris Dodds and Barack Obama profiteering from Fannie Mae and the Democrats part is aiding and abetting this scandal all along. Here's an excerpt for you from the link.\n  ALERT: Explosive CEO calling Obama, Dems \"Family\" of Fannie Mae\n September 17, 2008 7:45 PM\n \n John McCain. 25 May 2005, speaking to the Senate:\n \n Mr. President, this week Fannie Mae's regulator reported that the company's quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were \"illusions deliberately and systematically created\" by the company's senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion accounting scandal.\n \n The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's report goes on to say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally manipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to trigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's former chief executive officer, OFHEO's report shows that over half of Mr. Raines' compensation for the 6 years through 2003 was directly tied to meeting earnings targets. The report of financial misconduct at Fannie Mae echoes the deeply troubling $5 billion profit restatement at Freddie Mac.\n \n The OFHEO report also states that Fannie Mae used its political power to lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulator's examination of the company's accounting problems. This report comes some weeks after Freddie Mac paid a record $3.8 million fine in a settlement with the Federal Election Commission and restated lobbying disclosure reports from 2004 to 2005. These are entities that have demonstrated over and over again that they are deeply in need of reform.\n \n For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-known as Government-sponsored entities or GSEs-and the sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in the housing market. OFHEO's report this week does nothing to ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the contrary. OFHEO's report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay.\n \n I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.\n \n I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation.\n \n So John McCain saw this coming back in 2005, and warned Congress about the financial inequities that were taking place. But as it say's below, the legislation was blocked by democrats. Need I say more as Obama mocked McCain yesterday for wanting to have an investigation? Obama knows that an investigation would lead directly to him so he scoffs and mocks the idea of one.\n \n The legislation was blocked by Democrats, with the assistance of a few Republicans.\n \n James Johnson, former CEO of Fannie Mae and current Obama advisor, has cost us many tens of billions of dollars we can't afford.\n \n Franklin Raines, former CEO of Fannie Mae and current Obama advisor, has cost us many tens of billions of dollars we can't afford.\n \n Barack Obama: if we can't afford his advisors, we certainly can't afford him.\n \n As Obama attempts to blame the Bush administration for this Real Estate debacle, it is his top advisors and himself who has profited the most from it. And don't forget that Bill Clinton put Johnson and Raines in their positions to profit as they did through narly and questionable mortgage practices that directly led to these problems. And all so they could meet lending goals which their PERSONAL BONUSES WERE BASED UPON. Raines alone, walked away with around 50 million dollars in salary and bonuses after just 5 or 6 years as head of Fannie Mae. \n ==============================================================================================\n \n HEATHER NAUERT: Barack Obama attacking John McCain once again on the economy and the market turmoil today. Our John Gibson has new information on the Democratic presidential nominee and the mortgage mess for us now. What have you got John?\n \n JOHN GIBSON: Alright Heather. Lehman Brothers' collapse is traced back to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big mortgage banks that got a federal bailout a few weeks ago. Freddie and Fannie used huge lobbying budgets and political contributions to keep regulators off their backs. A group called the center for responsive politics keeps track of which politicians get Fannie and Freddie political contributions. The top three U.S. Senators getting big Fannie and Freddie political bucks were democrats and number two is Senator Barack Obama.\n \n Now, remember, he has only been in the Senate four years but still managed to grab the number two spot ahead of John Kerry, decades in the senate, and Chris Dodd who is chairman of the senate banking committee. Fannie and Freddie have been creations of the congressional democrats and the Clinton white house, designed to make mortgages available to more people, and as it turned out, some people who couldn't afford them. Fannie and Freddie have also been places for big Washington democrats to go to work in the semi-private sector and pocket millions. The Clinton administration's white house budget director Franklin Raines ran Fannie and collected 50 million dollars. Jamie Gurillick, Clinton Justice Apartment Official, worked for Fannie and took home 26 million dollars. Big Democrat Jim Johnson, recently on Obama's VP search committee has hauled in millions from his Fannie Mae C.E.O. job.\n \n Now remember, Obama's ads and stump speeches attack McCain and republican policies for the current financial turmoil. It is demonstrably not Republican policy and worse, it appears the man attacking McCain, Senator Obama, was at the head of the line when the piggy's lined up at the Fannie and Freddie trough for campaign bucks. Senator Barack Obama, number two on the Fannie/Freddie list of favored politicians after just four short years in the senate. Next time you see that ad, you might notice he fails to mention that part of the Fannie and Freddie problem. Heather.\n \n NAUERT: Wow, that's quite a report, begs the question - where is John McCain on this?\n \n GIBSON: John McCain is a measly $20,000 after over 20 years so he really doesn't even come close in the political contribution department.\n \n If you want specific numbers regarding the payouts your idols received, HERE YOU GO!",

Someone such as myself and others like me would say she has more executive experience that all the other candidates combined. She hasn't been corrupted by the Washington beltway like Biden or Obama.

They're all equally \"fair and balanced\".\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAnd the kindergarten \"sex-ed\" was age appropriate. Congrats, you've bought a lie. \n\n \n Actually I did read the bill and everything linked to it, It does abdicate sex ed to be taught in grade school and the last time I checked kindergarten is in grade school. I also saw nothing about teaching about abuse until grades 6-12 and was not about pedophiles and was limited to only girls as if they were the only ones who could be abused. I also saw that the material wouldn&#8217;t be taught if the &#8220;parent or guardian submits written objection thereto, and refusal to take or participate in such course or program shall not be reason for suspension or expulsion of such pupil.&#8221; This kind of sounds like the legislature takes a dim view of anyone who refuses to let their child participate. That they have to even mention &#8220;suspension or expulsion of such pupil&#8221; doesn&#8217;t give me the warm fuzzes. If it had said that retribution of and kind would not be tolerated I would have felt a lot better about it. I would think that the school should be required to secure the parent or guardians permission prior to enrolment of the child in such a class in K-5. And nowhere does it make mention that the parent of guardian be notified of the course. Of what I read in this it seams to me that the parental or guardians rights aren&#8217;t even taken in to consideration here. That is fine that it is to be age appropriate but I would be concerned as to who is to make that determination? If this bill took the parents or guardians rights in to consideration they would be provided with a detailed course plan to look over and then make the course elective in K-5. Of what I saw of the rest of the bill I saw nothing that would be appropriate in K-5. Just to give a couple of examples CPR or first aid.\n \n I also tried to get info on the curriculum that would be used, which I was unable to do. I would have liked to have read that also so I could have had the larger picture. Though the add is some what misleading but is accurate. In my opinion there is more truth to the add than not. The only thing that wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the add was the age appropriate but in k-5 what would be? A source if it is true it doesn&#8217;t matter where it comes from.\n \n \n \nSo again, no source. And once again, Hannity and Colmes is not a source, it's an opinion\n\n \n You were kind of right. I didn&#8217;t see the show but as I said before it doesn&#8217;t matter were it comes from if it&#8217;s right.\n \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/17/lynn-forester-de-rothschi_n_127047.html \n \n [QUOTE]Which they didn't\n \n As long as McCain and his people are satisfied with their pick and the republican party is also satisfied it doesn&#8217;t matter what you, the liberals or anyone else thinks. They were satisfied with their process.\n \n \n \nTo-may-to, To-mah-to. If you want to call it a \"hit squad\", go right ahead. McCain has done the same thing with Obama and Biden-it's to be expected.\n\n \n It was nothing compared to Obama.\n \n \nWhich has nothing to do with what I said.\n\n \n Yes it does it is and alternate view of it. Since she didn&#8217;t try to get evolution out of the curriculum just wanted creationism also taught as well so the students could make up their own minds whether its one or the other or a combination of both.\n \n \n \nWhen someone is an \"end of days\" sort, you'll excuse me if I don't want them within 1000 yards of the big red button.\n\n \n Oh please now your just being irrational.\n \n \n \nActually, it's the opinion of people who know her.\n\n \n Actually it is the opinion of two liberal leftists activists who are at odds with the public who have every right to pursue what they believe, just as your activists do. I guess that what you want is a double standard. It&#8217;s ok for liberal activists and not for conservative ones right. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYet here you are, spouting the Republican talking points, holding snippets heard on Hannity and Colmes as valid sources. This is the same Hannity who last week started insulting an economist who stated the economy was in trouble and accused him of quoting Democrat talking points. Guess this week proved him right, didn't it? \n\n \n Yep just like McCain reminded the senate back in 2005 that they needed to address these very issues. Ones that were created by the government of Bill Clinton lowering the standards for being able to get a loan. And the government regulators asleep at the switch. Though I never said that the economy wasn't it trouble I beleave it is and partialy due to the price of oil and the inflation it is causing not to mention the failure of the banking regulations. These two things combined along with our government spending like drunken sailors both parties and both candidates proposing a 3 to 4 trillion dollar in crease in spending is like throwing gas on a fire. If we make it through the next 4 years with out destroying our economy we will be lucky. And our trouble is being caused by both parties and they have been doing this dammage for 30 years.",

And you're also right that the Roman and Jewish leaders of the day had an elitist opinion of who was worthy of Gods grace, but why would you let the spiritual blindness of men determine your response to the living God who is the same yesterday, today and forever? \n \n And don't forget that I teach not submission to any religion, but I promote a personal relationship with God through Jesus, by way of the indwelling of His Holy Spirit which He promised He would send after His ascension. That same Spirit guides believers today just as He did the first century Apostles.\n \n Jesus said:\n Jhn 16:7 \n \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.\n Jhn 16:8 \n \"And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:\n Jhn 16:9 \n \"of sin, because they do not believe in Me;\n Jhn 16:10 \n \"of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;\n Jhn 16:11 \n \"of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.\n The helper is Gods Holy Spirit which indwells all believers in Christ which is why we become new creatures in Christ once we are born again.\n 1Pe 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.\n 1Pe 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,\n 1Pe 1:4 to {obtain} an inheritance {which is} imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,\n In the bolded verse we see that the triune God is active in our salvation as the Father who's foreknowledge designed our redemption, the sanctifying work of His Holy Spirit which convicts and guides us to salvation, and the shed blood of the unblemished lamb of God which was shed as propitiation for our sins.\n \n So just remember that according to the true gospel of salvation, there is nothing we can do to either earn or merit salvation. It is a free gift which is based on a personal relationship with the God of love who originally created us in His image for fellowship. \n \n Also consider that our God represents the only true freedom that exists in this world, not bondage as the deceivers would have you believe. emoticon_xangel Now you can tell your friends you went to church today. emoticon_smile",

Khomeni=Robertson=the Wahhabists=the Christian Dominionists=the ultra-Orthodox in Israel=the Hindu who murdered Gandhi= the African Anglicans.\n\n \n Wait you for got a few in your list atheists, liberals, activists, feminists, black separatists, white supremacists, gay activists, ACCORN, environmentalists, KKK, Communists, Fascists, PETA and many more. You can find them everywhere you look if you look long enough. The thing is every persons opinion as to what a fanatical ideology is different so what is it that makes your interpretation/ definition the correct one? It all comes down to each individuals interpretation.",
