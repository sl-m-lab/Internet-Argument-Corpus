   "Former senior Sinn Fein member Denis Donaldson has been found shot dead in the Irish Republic\n \n Mr Donaldson was expelled from the party last December after admitting he was a paid British spy for 20 years.\n \n The IRA issued a statement saying it had \"no involvement whatsoever\" in Mr Donaldson's death in County Donegal.\n \n Link for full story\n \n What do you guys think? Considering his past, my first thoughts are that the IRA, or at least a branch/brakeaway faction that hasn't laid down it's arms, is repaying \"old debts\".",
