The \"Fair tax\" grants tax consideration for lower income earners outside of the sales tax itself. \n \n I'm a proponent (to the greatest extent feasible) we transfer our federal revenue sources from income taxes to a general sales tax.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn\n\n Since such a tax would gut the income of the US government to a miniscule portion of its current tax revenue, what would you cut from the budget? Would you significantly reduce military spending? Would you eliminate or severely cut Medicare or Social Security? You would have to make very significant cuts in all of these programs if this tax plan would become a reality since these programs make up the majority of government spending.\n \n Alternatively, if you want to limit how much you cut government spending (which is mainly composed of military spending, Social Security and Medicare), you could make the sales tax very high and would have to also implement it on high value items such as houses and cars. This would mean that the great majority of tax burden would shift from the rich to the Middle class and that the Middle Class would be effectively much poorer than it is now. This would also mean that it would purchase much less. Since the main drive of the US economy is the purchasing power of the Middle Class, this would mean that the whole US economy would decrease significantly. \n \n I would be quite interested to see if you have any specific answers to these concerns - mainly answers that address the numbers. In other words, I wonder whether you have thought through the consequences of such a tax in detail or whether this is a philosophical issue involving your opinion that such a tax would be more fair.",

   "Another Opinion, I've posted a discussion thread entitled \"FICA's the most regressive federal tax\".\n \n This discusses transferring a portion of our tax revenue from our FICA payroll tax to a federal sales tax. We are aware of the revenue we derive from our current 15.3% FICA tax upon our (statistically effectively) entire USA payrolls. We are not absolutely certain as to the relative proportion of USA's payrolls and our total gross sales. We don't know what exceptions and/or loop holes the U.S. Congress may choose to incorporate if and when we enact a federal sales tax.\n \n Discussing transference of the revenue sources (from FICA to a sales tax) are incomplete and/or unconfirmed information and determinations requires us to employ suppositions, approximations and guesstimates. I regret that the discussion is not as explicit as we would wish it to be. If you find a superior discussion of the topic with more quantitative and accurate data, please forward the address link to me.\n \n \n We know a great deal less about our income tax base rather than our payroll tax base. The U.S. Congress and all the rest of us are much more in disagreement as to what is and what should be considered as net income. Discussing transference of income taxes to a sales tax revenue source is necessarily less explicit than discussing transference from the FICA payroll tax.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

The fair tax is a simple(ton) solution to a difficult problem. \n \n That said, the solution to our current problem (which is essentially insolvency) is not as complex as many would make out. First, we need to cut spending, especially military spending, by a HUGE margin. Our military is LITERALLY designed and funded to re-fight WWII. The odds of having to fight a major two theater war in the foreseeable future is somewhere between slim and none. \n \n Second, we need to tax. And tax heavily. And we need to tax the rich, because they are the only ones who have enough money to actually make a difference. Trying to spread the tax burden \"evenly\" between the poor, the middle class, and the wealthy is just plain stupid. Then we need to go back and look REAL HARD at our corporate taxes and decide which \"investment\" activities we actually want to encourage with a low tax rate. Purchasing stock in an IPO of a promising young company, of course we should encourage that. That is NOT where most companies wall street investment profits come from, though. The truth is that companies make trillions of dollars a year in what amounts to computerized day trading on the stock market. That is why we can see 60% of individual investors pull OUT of the stock market in the last year, and the market still climbs. Laws of supply and demand tell us that should be impossible. The money left, prices should fall. They are kept artificially high by a never ending stream of computerized trades and commission churning junk trades from the big investment brokerages. And we REWARD this activity with a low tax rate and when you suggest that we should RAISE it you end up with a bunch of know-nothing bafoons arguing that raising capital gains taxes will stifle investment. \n \n The last head of the GAO resigned in disgust because he kept telling congress that if we continues as we have been doing, the US will end up a third world nation. He resigned and it appears he is going to spend the rest of his life on a SELF FUNDED lecture circuit trying to get the american people to listen to what he is saying and do some simple math. \n \n The head of our federal reserve (Bernanke) literally sat in front of congress last year and told them that the first thing he does every morning is check bond rates to see if US treasuries have crashed overnight. \n \n Frankly at this point the \"fair tax\" is little more than a mildly interesting case of mental masturbation at best. At its worse it is a rallying cry for those who are dumb enough to believe in something for nothing.",

One of the prerequisites for a functional stock market is strong government financial regulation.

Where things get tricky is when you are doing taxes from multiple revenue streams while tying to write off a $170,000 RV as a section 179 deduction for a business where your wife is the only employee (for the record, it says \"seat 9 people behind the drivers seat\"...it does not say BUS) or write off 6 trips to the virgin islands as business expenses. \n \n \n To be fair (pun intended), it took me awhile to realize that taxes really aren't and can't be \"fair\". You really just have to get what you can from the people that can pay so that our society can function. It is the responsibility of government to keep those functions limited to what is absolutely necessary though. So much for that. \n\n \n Yes and no. The idea behind a progressive income tax is that it requires that those who benefit the most from the system pay the most to support it. People become wealthy though hard work, intelligence/good decisions, luck, and ENVIRONMENT. I dont care how smart Bill Gates is. If he had been born in some village in Uganda, nobody would have any idea who he was. Without the infrastructure in place and the social system we have in place, he would have been nothing. That system was VITAL to his success. Charging him more to support it than you charge some guy flipping burgers for minimum wage is right.",

   "................ Which, IMO, is why every single one of our founding fathers warned against maintaining a standing military. It is just too tempting a tool for politicians to do stupid things with.\n \n I shudder to do so, but I disagree. \n \n First of all, part of the governments responsibility is to provide for the general welfare of the nation. That includes taking steps to assure the nations growth and development. That means encouraging investment and activities that lead to positive growth and development.\n \n The second reason I disagree is that most of the parasitic moneymaking that goes on only exists because of the government. IF not for the government regulations that provide the illusion of transparency and fair play, our stock market would essentially not exist, which would mean that the computerized day trading parasites would not exist. One of the prerequisites for a functional stock market is strong government financial regulation. They have never managed to get a stock market off the ground in ANY country that did not have strong and comprehensive government regulation because the trust is simply not there. If there is no penalty for falsifying financial records, you would be an XXXXX to not do it, shoot your stock price through the roof, then cash out and walk away. \n \n A complex financial market REQUIRES strong government regulation. That has been proven conclusively in history. It is the complex financial market...the result of government intervention...that allows parasitic profiteering. It is illogical to suggest that the government has no place in policing the result of their creation.\n\n \n Daewoo,\n . . . Unfortunately there has been industrial, corporate, and computer revolutions since 1776. A standing military is a national necessity.\n \n I iterate that I'm not opposed to written laws and regulations but I have a justifiable mistrust for government's discretionary power.\n \n /////////////////////////////////////////////////\n \n Originally Posted by Supposn \n Steeeeve,\n . . . government's function should be to maintain an equitable playing field and keep the game honest. It should not be government's function to assist or penalize the players because (in the government's opinion) they could perform better. \n \n Of course in explicitly specified situations where there are overwhelming and long term benefits to government's mandating or prohibiting specified behavior, the government can and should do so.\n \n I'm not opposed to written laws and regulations but I have a justifiable mistrust for government's discretionary power. We have courts and judges because we have yet to find superior methods.

   "I know this is the argument that people make, but COME ON. For 95% of americans, the tax code is not all that complicated. You take the slips your employer provides your, take the paper your mortgage servicing company gave you so you can deduct the interest on your mortgage, and the slip that your daycare provider gave you so you can deduct the kiddies care, and you input the numbers where told on a 1040. It aint hard.\n \n One thing I really pushed last year and will push again this year is the IRS freefile program. The IRS essentially agreed not to develop their own online tax filing software if all the major vendors would provide FREE online filing to basically most americans. The one I recommended was TurboTax. Simple questions in easy to understand language. Takes less than an hour. Spits out the result. EASY. Any XXXXX can do it.\nyeah this is true for most people most years but than you have the one year you transfer property to your kid and all of a sudden the tax consequences get a little more complex. Try taking the tax part of the CPA exam and see how well you do. \n \n Anyway, my point to this is that the tax code is as complicated as we want to make it. It just stinks for a small to medium size business that they have to pay 2-3 of me so their taxes can get done. It is kind of another great example where the policy doesn't really hurt the wealthy but instead hurts the \"middle\" guys. \n \n \nI am not kidding at all when I say this woman was dumber then a box of rocks.

This was a real student financial aid case I looked at a few years back..the person making $250,000 got a grant while the other didn't (by the way, who has $50,000 in moving expenses every year?).

Income is money that comes in. Simple. Dont care if it is a grant. Then we do deductions on a cash basis. Forget depreciation. If you go out and spend $52,000 on a truck and pay cash, you get to write off $52,000 this year. Thats it. If you finance it and pay XXX per month for 3 years, you get to deduct XXX per month for 3 years. Same with buildings. \n \n This year a company I own bought a van. We pretty much bought it so we could lend/lease it to a charity I support (in reality it is a loan, on paper it is a lease due to liability concerns). We took it as a 179 deduction. Now we will depreciate it. Then we will donate it to the charity and will write off the bluebook value of it (or more....) as a charitable donation.

The tax deductions paid for the cost of purchasing, maintaining (and to some extent the gasoline to operate) our cars.\n \n When you're into creative bookkeeping, your calculations of incomes are deliberately complex. The nature of income is such that it passes beyond arithmetic to the art of deliberate confusion.\n \n When law, circumstances and honesty all support your position, a good lawyer or accountant argues the law in the simplest possible manner on your behalf. Otherwise, you or those you pay to assist you all serve your own interests best by muddying the water, obscuring reality, creating confusion all to your own benefit.\n \n It is the simplicity of taxing sales rather than incomes that recommend sales taxes as a preferable tax basis. Honest simplicity of law would more support respect for our government, its laws and the laws' honest applications. That in itself justifies to whatever extent feasible, we should transfer our tax basis from incomes to a general sales tax.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
