   "Lordy! Lordy! Lordy! I feel a sermon coming on! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord (that isn't!)!\n \n I cannot tell how much I hate it that I, an Atheist, must preach to Christians about the word of Christ. \n \n We have now a crisis of enormous human misery in the City of New Orleans and surrounding regions. Therefore, unwashed and unholy Christian brethren and sistern, I tell you to turn to Chapter 25 of Matthew (hmm, was he the tax collector guy? Anyway, that's beside the point.) \n \n Let us, therefore, begin with Verse 31 of Chapter 25 of the Taxman's (if that's what he was) journal: \n \n When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him (I hasten to say that Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, etc., will NOT be amongst these angels), then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. \n \n And before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from his goats (Dear Sistern and Brethren, where, oh, where will the United States of America be? I ask you, are we sheep or goats?). \n \n And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left (I must remind you, dear brethern and sistern, that in the context of the ancient Middle East, the left hand was the unclean hand owing to the dreadful dearth of adequate sanitary facilities in those days for washing one's hands after one has done certain processes of elimination from one's body, therefore, for reasons of sanitation and health it was necessary for the right hand to be reserved for putting food into one's body and not contaminating it and to reserve the left hand for taking care of business when the food was processed and eliminated, being on the left hand, even the left hand of Christ--hmm, it seems to me that someone ought to write something about the \"Left Hand of Christ.\" Any volunteers?). \n \n Then shall the King (I suppose that at this time, one may presume that the term \"King\" refers to Christ himself--I shall have to ask Sister Altari's advice about this reference.) say to them on his right hand (The Clean and Righteous Hand, remember.), Come, ye blessed of my Father (OK, Altari, that clears up my earlier concern in to the identity of the \"King,\" unless there is a chance that this reference is to the Holy Ghost.), inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. \n \n (Now, dear Sistern and Brethren, this is the crux of the matter, please pay close attention:) \n \n For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: (Dear Brethren and Sistern, give heed to those in New Orleans who have no meat) I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: (Remember also, dear Sistern and Brethren, that those in New Orleans are very thirsty and it is NOT for the word of God that you wish to ram down their throasts--they are thirsty for pure and simple H2O--I hope that is not too much science for you) I was a stranger and you took me in: (Yes, Brethren and Sistern, there are many in the City of New Orleans who are strangers and have no place to go) \n \n Naked, and ye clothed me: (No, dear Sistern and Brethren, these people of New Orleans are not precisely naked but their clothing is fouled with days and days of sweat and excrement and urine from the circumstances of their living conditions--they need badly a bath and a new suit of clothes.) I was sick, and ye visited me: (Dear Brethren and Sistern, we have before us the abandoned sick of a certain Charity Hospital in the City of New Orleans who are there because they did not have insurance and access to regular healthcare--those wealthier souls with health insurance and money have already been taken out to safety--but those souls in Charity Hospital, these people who are, in his own words, Christ himself, have been abandoned.) I was in prison, and ye came unto me (Instead, we see a callous condemnation of those who have transgressed the law by looting for survival and fail to remember, that ugly as they are, they bear the Face of Christ upon their countenance and ye have judged them). \n \n I think, that owing to space limitations, I must continue my sermon in another post.",

But here's a miracle for you, Joe:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE: McDowell, Josh.

   "Miracles are also rejected because they violate known behavior of what we know of the universe in addition to only being hersay.\n\n \n The word 'miracle' (in its literal sense) tends to be used today in three contexts:\n * unexpected recovery from serious illness;\n * survival of a catastrophic event (especially one in which others have died);\n * mysterious apparitions.\n \n All three are testimony to the human brain being ill equipped to deal with contingent events. We are innately cause-seekers, and the notion that something hugely significant to our survival or well-being can happen for no particular reason is one we find very hard to handle. We are also innately pattern-seekers, and find no difficulty in detecting the lineaments of a human face in a purely random assemblage of cracks and stains. (Remember the 'image' of the BVM on a salt-stained wall that drew thousands of pilgrims to an underpass in Chicago last April?)\n \n It's over 100 years since Emile Zola famously asked why the pile of discarded crutches outside the shrine at Lourdes didn't contain any artificial limbs. Believers' responses - the ones I've seen, anyway - tend to resort to ad hominem attacks on Zola, rather than addressing the question of why modern 'miracles' should be restricted to events that can happen naturally (such as paraplegics regaining their mobility) rather than those that cannot (such as amputees re-growing their limbs).\n \n The fact is, miracles in the supernatural sense do not happen and never have.",

   "Concerning Operation Blessing:\n \n http://www.tompaine.com/feature.cfm/ID/6535\n \n Panty Hose, Chocolate And Other Charitable Offerings\n According to its Web site, the mission of Operation Blessing International (OBI) \"is to demonstrate God's love by alleviating human need and suffering in the United States and around the world.\" Founded in 1978 by Pat Robertson, the organization \"was originally set up to help struggling individuals and families by matching their needs for items such as clothing, appliances, vehicles with donated items from viewers of The 700 Club.\" In 1986, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation (OBI) was formed as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to handle international relief projects. In 1993, all Operation Blessing activities were transferred to OBI.\n \n While OBI trumpets its work at home and abroad through its Web site, other sources provide a more nuanced picture. In 1996, the Norfolk, Va.-based Virginia-Pilot newspaper reported that two pilots who were hired by the charity to fly humanitarian aid to Zaire in 1994 were used almost exclusively for Robertson's diamond mining operations. Chief pilot Robert Hinkle, claimed that in the six months he flew for Operation Blessing, only one or two of more than 40 flights were humanitarian -- the rest carried mining equipment. OBI resources were being diverted to support the African Development Co., a private corporation run by Robertson. At the time, Robertson also had a special relationship with Zaire's late dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.\n \n \"My first impression when I took the job was that we'd be called Operation Blessing and we'd be doing humanitarian work,\" Hinkle, a former Peace Corps volunteer, told the Virginia-Pilot. \"We got over there and 'Operation Blessing' was painted on the tails of the airplanes, but we were doing no humanitarian relief at all. We were just supplying the miners and flying the dredges from Kinshasa out to Tshikapa.\"\n \n At first, an OPI spokesperson denied the charges by the Virginia Pilot. Later, however, a written statement from the group admitted Robertson's mining company used Operation Blessing planes \"from time to time,\" but that most air missions in Zaire were for humanitarian or training purposes. \"For example, medicine was transported to some 17 clinics in Zaire,\" the spokesman told the paper. Hinkle called the OPI statement \"a clear-cut lie.\"\n \n In February 1995, Time magazine reported that Robertson's relationship with Sese Seko began after a branch of Operation Blessing \"botched a corn-cultivation project on a 50,000-acre farm outside the capital, Kinshasa.\"\n \n Time also reported that in 1993, during the Rwandan refugee crisis, Operation Blessing \"was criticized for spending too much money on transportation, pulling its workers out too soon and proselytizing. 'They were laying on hands,'\" an American aid worker said. They were \"'speaking in tongues and holding services while people were dying all around,'\" she added. Time points out that although \"many relief agencies are notorious for mismanagement and backbiting?Operation Blessing drew a considerable volume of negative reviews from fellow good Samaritans.\"\n \n Charles Henderson, a Presbyterian minister who heads up Christianity.about.com, recently pointed out that in 2001 Operation Blessing made some awfully strange purchases. The organization that prides itself on helping the poor and hungry in third world countries, spent more than $2.5 million on Ensure, a dietary supplement and Splenda, a no calorie sweetener and more than $10.4 million on candy and panty hose.\n \n Even more disturbing is that Operation Blessing rendered a direct grant of slightly more than $2 million to Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network -- \"more than half,\" Henderson says, \"of the entire OBI budget for direct grants.\" . . .",

   "One condition of 503c qualification is filing annual, public financial statements. OBI has long been known as an extension of Robertson's interests in helping members of his 700 club and other investors who produce or sell goods, a control factor common in US politics and religious charities. As anyone who is familiar with US advertising strategy understands, US media seldom pursues any possible derogatory information regarding a religious charity to avoid offending the large Christian viewing audience. It takes a Swaggert or such with juicy criminal charges to make the network news syndicates.",
