   "Here is a nice website I found that pretty much sums up the basics of modern evolutionary theory. I hope it's accurate. If anyone can find inaccuracies please point them out.(**)\n \n http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEVOLII.html\n \n The links at the bottom are especially useful, like the entire Origin of Species free online.\n \n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/\n \n What the National Academy of Sciences has to say about creationism.\n \n http://books.nap.edu/html/creationism/\n \n And a Berkeley website devoted to helping folks understand evolutionary theory.\n \n http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/evolution.html\n \n I'd like to see what a creationists might find objectionable about any of this.\n \n (**)-I don't like their oversimplified explanation of speciation, which stems from the simplified view of a species, which is a result of the Linnean classification system. It's hard to define a species based on interbreeding because there are so many examples of hybridism it isn't funny. But, their explanation of the overall gist of how it happens is ok.",
