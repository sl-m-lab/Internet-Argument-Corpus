   "I think that they should subdivide the entire Creationists vs Evolutionists debate into OEC and YEC.\n \n Being a sort-of-OEC myself, it is frustrating to watch as the YEC are continually annihilated by the sci crowd (many times without even knowing it). It's like a sport or something.\n \n Personally, I think the chances of either group convincing the other group is slim to none. I guess that is why when most people finally realize the odds, this whole mess turns into a big witch hunt.. on both sides.\n \n I've always viewed both sides (c & e) as one and the same. When I was young, it came as a big suprise to me when I found out that many people couldn't rectify their faith with certain scientific claims. I remember looking at the classic evolutionary latter (ape to man) poster and thinking.. yep, that's how He did it. Makes perfect sense. Dang, He's smart. I think it would be neat to have a poster that showed all the way from dirt to Man. A little piece of Genesis. I think it's beautiful when we understand a little more about the whole creation. It's wonderful to see faith validated scientifically. What I don't understand is why YEC's want to Limit their faith. \n \n I think what hurts me the most, is when I meet scientists that have slowly turned to atheism and agnosticism Because of science. We all doubt. It is in our nature. But, science is just too small. It is impossible for me to live inside of it's box. \"Why?\" is infinate. Our minds have the ability to wonder beyond absolute zero. Faith is as natural as love or expression. Science just doesn't lead me to create art. It only helps me create it. Just like the YEC's who close their minds', some scientists are losing their respect.\n \n Oh well... back to the rock fight.\n \n ------\n \n We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don't.\n Frank A.

   "\n Why not? There's no rules that say faith and science must be separate.\n \n\n \n I'll just address this, if I may.\n \n My working definitions of faith and science are more or less as follows. Science is a belief system based on observation, logic, and reasoning. Faith is belief in the absence of proof.\n \n Now this isn't to say that one must adhere only to faith or only to science. I'm a firm adherent to the scientific method, but I believe many things that can't be proven true. However, in any situation where the truth or falsehood of a statement can be proven, I yield to science. It seems to me that faith can only justifiably be applied to areas that don't yield themselves to scientific analysis. If the truth or falsehood of a statement can be determined, then turning to faith for an answer seems to be to be an act of self deception. So I have to disagree with you. I think that science and faith are very different tools, which can only properly be used in distinct arenas.",

If you couldn't build on the belief that something will happen, we'd be stuck never forming new hypostheses. \n \n You may have it backwards.\n\n You really have a strange definition of faith.\n Scientific laws require reproducible results (patterns).\n That's how they got to be laws.\n I believe that the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth will have the same value tomorrow that it had yesterday because there is no indication that this pattern will change.\n \n It's not because of faith, or at least certainly not due to the kind of faith required to believe in the supernatural. \n \n Your definition of faith sounds like an exercise in solipsim.\n I can't prove you are a human and not a computer so I have to have faith that you really are a human (despite all the patterns I have built up in my brain over time.)\n \n \nIt can go both ways.

I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the \"logical\" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. \n \n But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and \"make sense\" to more than one person, these specific \"explanations\" can be passed down.\n \n So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.",

   "Just a couple of thoughts on the last post:\n 1) Definitely have to agree that God is egotistical. I haven't really heard it asked directly, but I don't suppose anyone who believed any substantial part of the Bible to be true could really argue that God is portrayed as \"humble.\" Alpha/Omega, great I AM, no other gods before me, way/truth/life, only name by which man can be saved--all refer to God, and none appear to be humble.\n \n 2)To say God is evil is a little more tricky. What does evil mean? If defined biblically, then you're drawing from a text that claims everything God does, by definition, is just. The very text having its validity questioned. If you're saying God is evil according to some generally agreed upon societal principles, then it's a different conversation.\n \n Also, if I'm understanding correctly, it seems one conclusion intended to be drawn is that the wickedness/egoism/incapability of God is reason to \"chuck\" the Bible. If I understood incorrectly I apologize, and please disregard the following: I don't see how one can use something learned from the Bible as a means of discrediting the text. If the text is discredited, it seems the rationale for discrediting it is simultaneously undermined (I am not refering to irreconcilable contradictions here; rather, what I mean is this: one reads, discovers God is evil, and then decides that the text cannot be true because of what one read. The text has to be valid for this conclusion to make any sense. I think. So I'm not sure the Bible can be \"chucked\" on this basis).\n \n 3)I would not say God makes \"no sense,\" although much of what we find in scripture indeed appears nonsensical. However, to be fair, in the story referred to, Abraham asked God to spare the city. God agreed, on the condition ten righteous men be found. No such luck for Sodom, and the city was still destroyed. Lot was simply delivered, along with most of his family. Point is, God wasn't talked out of anything, at least that I can tell, in this instance.\n \n 4)More on Lot: \"God was incapable of finding Lot some legitimate women/God approves of rape or incest.\" To continue questioning in this fashion, one would need simply to search the Bible for any detestable acts and claim, since they occurred, that God is in favor of those as well. Of course, if indeed this was a reason for discrediting the Bible, one would have to first assume the document was valid in order to discredit it.\n \n Finally--Indeed, one can avoid all the contradictions and problems by \"chucking the Bible.\"",

   "3)I would not say God makes \"no sense,\" although much of what we find in scripture indeed appears nonsensical. However, to be fair, in the story referred to, Abraham asked God to spare the city. God agreed, on the condition ten righteous men be found. No such luck for Sodom, and the city was still destroyed. Lot was simply delivered, along with most of his family. Point is, God wasn't talked out of anything, at least that I can tell, in this instance.\n\n \n According to the Bible, Abraham did convince God to change His mind. Here's the haggling over lives....\n \n \n'The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. Then Abraham approached him and said, \"Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty rigteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifth righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing - to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"\n \n The LORD said, \"If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\"\n \n Then Abraham spoke up again: \"Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?\"\n \n \"If I find forty-five there,\" he said, \"I will not destroy it\".\n \n Once again he spoke to him, \"What if only forty are found there?\"\n \n He said, \"For the sake of forty, I will not do it\".\n \n Then he said, \"May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thrity can be found there?\"\n \n He answered, \"I will not do it if I find thirty there.\"\n \n Abraham said, \"Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?\"\n \n He said, \"For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.\"\n \n Then he said, \"May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?\"\n \n He answered, \"For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it\".\n \n When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.' (Genesis 18:22-33) \n\n \n The Bible tells us that God intended to destroy the whole city, but Abraham talked Him out of it for the sake of 50 righteous people. Then, after God agreed to abide by Abraham's wish, Abraham convinced God to not destroy the city the 45 people. After God agreed with the new number, Abraham changed it again, down to 40. This continued several more times, until Abraham was able to haggle God all the way down to 10 righteous people. \n \n The Bible shows us a God that haggles with humans. Worse, a God that haggles with humans over people's lives. It also shows us a God that can be manipulated by Satan to give the thumbs up to kill someone's servants and children. The Bible also shows us a God who, knowing the future, saves Lot's daughters, with the next thing we are told in the Bible is the daughters getting their father drunk and raping him: not once, but twice.",

   "So the Bible does indicate that Lot's being saved is the result of Abraham's haggling with God, and not what God had originally intended.\n \n \n This argument obviously can be made, but it requires a leap that assumes when God remembered Abraham, he looked back to how Abraham manipulated him, and he had to honor the manipulation. It is not imperative that \"rememberance\" entails the abandonment of the original intention. Rememberance also means to honor and acknowledge, several other portions of the old testament indicate that this word \"remember\" is not reference to the changing of the initial plan. This must be assumed. \n \n Consider:\n Genesis 8:1-- \"Then God remembered Noah....and the rain from heaven was restrained.\" This reference to the flood does not decribe an alteration of the initial plan. He planned to save Noah from the beginning (why build the ark) yet that same word \"remember\" is used.\n Exodus 2:24--\"So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\" Again, remembrance is used in reference to a covenant that was already in place, decided upon, etc.\n Psalm 105:42--\"For He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant. He brought His people with joy, His chosen ones with gladness.\" Here remembrance is explicitly linked to \"the chosen ones,\" indicating adherance to the initial plan.\n \n I would argue the same in the case of Job. Of course one can assume that God was smooth-talked, the evidence is simply not there. God starts off the conversation with Satan by asking where he has been--a question to which he knows the answer (Scripture teaches God is omniscient). There is more evidence here to support that God is in fact leading Satan. His next question asks if Satan has considered Job. After he tells Satan to go ahead, Satan comes back, and God asks the exact same questions!! No surprise Satan wants to take it a step further.\n \n It is important to note that God is the initiator of this line of discussion!! I can definitely see people becoming furious with God after reading this book, since it is really He who prods Satan into tormenting Job and his family. In the entire book, almost every time Job speaks his sentences start with \"He/He/He,\" trying to explain to his friends how it is God who is doing this to him out of His own good pleasure. The totality of scripture, I believe it can be argued, supports the claim that God controls everything, even the heinous torturing of Job. So I see why people get upset with the God of the Bible. However I don't see how one can be upset with God, and then claim he's simply easily manipulated. In that case, we can't really be mad about how evil he is. Those feelings should be replaced, if we are consistent, with feelings of pathetic disdain at this supposed deity who lacks both backbone and the fortitude to carry out the wishy washy plans he does have. \n \n Fortunately or unfortunately, I think the Bible paints a picture of a God who maintains sovereignty. The tough question for me is not is the God of the Bible a weakling. Contrarily, it revolves around reconciling omnipotence with the apparent atrocities. Job recognized omnipotence, yet he maintained his faith. Sorry for the length.",

That's all that part of my post conveyed, not that remembrance itself means having changed one's intention.\n \n \n \n Rememberance also means to honor and acknowledge, \n\n \n Yeah, I know. So what?\n \n \n ... several other portions of the old testament indicate that this word \"remember\" is not reference to the changing of the initial plan. \n\n \n Which I never claimed.\n \n Are you having fun setting up and knocking down your strawman version of my position?\n \n \n \nGenesis 8:1-- \"Then God remembered Noah....and the rain rom heaven was restrained.\" This reference to the flood does not decribe an alteration of the initial plan.\n\n \n Irrelevant. \n \n Show me where the Bible tells us earlier that Noah haggled God down, convincing Him to change His plans, the way that Abraham did.

Of course one can assume that God was smooth-talked, the evidence is simply not there.\n\n \n Wrong. The Bible clearly tells that at first God forbid Satan from laying a finger on Job. But when the first attempt to satisfy Satan's doubt failed, Satan then talked God into allowing Satan to physically harm Job himself. God changed his plan ... and the change of plan came from by someone else, not God.\n \n Your version is an interpretation ... not what the Bible itself tells us. And your interpretation is based on circular, and invalid, theological 'reasoning' ... see next part.\n \n \nGod starts off the conversation with Satan by asking where he has been--a question to which he knows the answer (Scripture teaches God is omniscient).\n\n \n No, scripture tells that God is omniscient in some places, then contradicts itself in others. \n \n Hell I don't even have to leave the current page of the Bible to show this! Sticking to Sodom and Gomorrah ...\n \n \nThen the LORD said, \"The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know\". \n \n The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. Then Abraham approached him and said: \"Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous in it?\" [and the haggling begins!!!!] (Genesis 18:20) \n\n \n See, God's not all-knowing ... the Bible tells us so.\n \n Again, all problems with trying to reconcile the Bible with itself can be solved simply, by just chucking the damned thing into the trash. :p",

   "Too late...\n\n Too late for what?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, here's a nice NYT article that I thought I'd throw in here.\n \n I think this article does a good job of explaining the debate in a fair and balanced way while still getting across the fact that Intellegent Design is pseudoscience and evolutionary theory still works (well).\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/national/22design.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5094&en=0ca73531c0586b08&hp&ex=1124769600&partner=homepage\n \n\n In Explaining Life's Complexity, Darwinists and Doubters Clash\n \n By KENNETH CHANG\n Published: August 22, 2005\n \n At the heart of the debate over intelligent design is this question: Can a scientific explanation of the history of life include the actions of an unseen higher being?\n \n The proponents of intelligent design, a school of thought that some have argued should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools, say that the complexity and diversity of life go beyond what evolution can explain.\n \n Biological marvels like the optical precision of an eye, the little spinning motors that propel bacteria and the cascade of proteins that cause blood to clot, they say, point to the hand of a higher being at work in the world.\n \n In one often-cited argument, Michael J. Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University and a leading design theorist, compares complex biological phenomena like blood clotting to a mousetrap: Take away any one piece - the spring, the baseboard, the metal piece that snags the mouse - and the mousetrap stops being able to catch mice.\n \n Similarly, Dr. Behe argues, if any one of the more than 20 proteins involved in blood clotting is missing or deficient, as happens in hemophilia, for instance, clots will not form properly.\n \n Such all-or-none systems, Dr. Behe and other design proponents say, could not have arisen through the incremental changes that evolution says allowed life to progress to the big brains and the sophisticated abilities of humans from primitive bacteria.\n \n These complex systems are \"always associated with design,\" Dr. Behe, the author of the 1996 book \"Darwin's Black Box,\" said in an interview. \"We find such systems in biology, and since we know of no other way that these things can be produced, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, then we are rational to conclude they were indeed designed.\"\n \n It is an argument that appeals to many Americans of faith.\n \n But mainstream scientists say that the claims of intelligent design run counter to a century of research supporting the explanatory and predictive power of Darwinian evolution, and that the design approach suffers from fundamental problems that place it outside the realm of science. For one thing, these scientists say, invoking a higher being as an explanation is unscientific.\n \n \"One of the rules of science is, no miracles allowed,\" said Douglas H. Erwin, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian Institution. \"That's a fundamental presumption of what we do.\"\n \n That does not mean that scientists do not believe in God. Many do. But they see science as an effort to find out how the material world works, with nothing to say about why we are here or how we should live.\n \n And in that quest, they say, there is no need to resort to otherworldly explanations. So much evidence has been provided by evolutionary studies that biologists are able to explain even the most complex natural phenomena and to fill in whatever blanks remain with solid theories.\n \n This is possible, in large part, because evolution leaves tracks like the fossil remains of early animals or the chemical footprints in DNA that have been revealed by genetic research.\n \n For example, while Dr. Behe and other leading design proponents see the blood clotting system as a product of design, mainstream scientists see it as a result of a coherent sequence of evolutionary events.\n \n Early vertebrates like jawless fish had a simple clotting system, scientists believe, involving a few proteins that made blood stick together, said Russell F. Doolittle, a professor of molecular biology at the University of California, San Diego.\n \n Scientists hypothesize that at some point, a mistake during the copying of DNA resulted in the duplication of a gene, increasing the amount of protein produced by cells.\n \n Most often, such a change would be useless. But in this case the extra protein helped blood clot, and animals with the extra protein were more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, as higher-order species evolved, other proteins joined the clotting system. For instance, several proteins involved in the clotting of blood appear to have started as digestive enzymes. \n \n By studying the evolutionary tree and the genetics and biochemistry of living organisms, Dr. Doolittle said, scientists have largely been able to determine the order in which different proteins became involved in helping blood clot, eventually producing the sophisticated clotting mechanisms of humans and other higher animals. The sequencing of animal genomes has provided evidence to support this view.\n \n For example, scientists had predicted that more primitive animals such as fish would be missing certain blood-clotting proteins. In fact, the recent sequencing of the fish genome has shown just this.\n \n \"The evidence is rock solid,\" Dr. Doolittle said.\n \n Intelligent design proponents have advanced their views in books for popular audiences and in a few scientific articles. Some have developed mathematical formulas intended to tell whether something was designed or formed by natural processes.\n \n Mainstream scientists say that intelligent design represents a more sophisticated - and thus more seductive - attack on evolution. Unlike creationists, design proponents accept many of the conclusions of modern science. They agree with cosmologists that the age of the universe is 13.6 billion years, not fewer than 10,000 years, as a literal reading of the Bible would suggest. They accept that mutation and natural selection, the central mechanisms of evolution, have acted on the natural world in small ways, for example, leading to the decay of eyes in certain salamanders that live underground.\n \n Some intelligent design advocates even accept common descent, the notion that all species came from a common ancestor, a central tenet of evolution.\n \n Although a vast majority of scientists accept evolution, the Discovery Institute, a research group in Seattle that has emerged as a clearinghouse for the intelligent design movement, says that 404 scientists, including 70 biologists, have signed a petition saying they are skeptical of Darwinism.\n \n Nonetheless, many scientists regard intelligent design as little more than creationism dressed up in pseudoscientific clothing. Despite its use of scientific language and the fact that some design advocates are scientists, they say, the design approach has so far offered only philosophical objections to evolution, not any positive evidence for the intervention of a designer.\n \n 'Truncated View of Reality'\n \n If Dr. Behe's mousetrap is one of the most familiar arguments for design, another is the idea that intelligence is obvious in what it creates. Read a novel by Hemingway, gaze at the pyramids, and a designer's hand is manifest, design proponents say.\n \n But mainstream scientists, design proponents say, are unwilling to look beyond the material world when it comes to explaining things like the construction of an eye or the spinning motors that propel bacteria. What is wrong, they ask, with entertaining the idea that what looks like it was designed was actually designed?\n \n \"If we've defined science such that it cannot get to the true answer, we've got a pretty lame definition of science,\" said Douglas D. Axe, a molecular biologist and the director of research at the Biologic Institute, a new research center in Seattle that looks at the organization of biological systems, including intelligent design issues. Dr. Axe said he had received \"significant\" financing from the Discovery Institute, but he declined to give any other details about the institute or its financing.\n \n Stephen C. Meyer, director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute, compares the design approach to the work of archaeologists investigating an ancient civilization.\n \n \"Imagine you're an archaeologist and you're looking at an inscription, and you say, 'Well, sorry, that looks like it's intelligent but we can't invoke an intelligent cause because, as a matter of method, we have to limit ourselves to materialistic processes,' \" Dr. Meyer said. \"That would be nuts.\"\n \n He added, \"Call it miracle, call it some other pejorative term, but the fact remains that the materialistic view is a truncated view of reality.\"\n \n William Paley, an Anglican priest, made a similar argument in the early 19th century. Someone who finds a rock can easily imagine how wind and rain shaped it, he reasoned. But someone who finds a pocket watch lying on the ground instantly knows that it was not formed by natural processes.\n \n With living organisms so much more complicated than watches, he wrote, \"The marks of design are too strong to be got over.\"\n \n Mainstream scientists say that the scientific method is indeed restricted to the material world, because it is trying to find out how it works. Simply saying, \"it must have been designed,\" they say, is simply a way of not tackling the hardest problems.\n \n They say they have no disagreement with studying phenomena for which there are, as yet, no explanations.\n \n It is the presumption of a designer that mainstream scientists dispute, because there are no artifacts or biological signs - no scientific evidence, in other words - to suggest a designer's presence.\n \n Darwin's theory, in contrast, has over the last century yielded so many solid findings that no mainstream biologist today doubts its basic tenets, though they may argue about particulars.\n \n The theory has unlocked many of the mysteries of the natural world. For example, by studying the skeletons of whales, evolutionary scientists have been able to trace the history of their descent from small-hoofed land mammals. They made predictions about what the earliest water-dwelling whales might look like. And, in 1994, paleontologists reported discovering two such species, with many of the anatomical features that scientists had predicted.\n \n Darwin's Finches\n \n Nowhere has evolution been more powerful than in its prediction that there must be a means to pass on information from one generation to another. Darwin did not know the biological mechanism of inheritance, but the theory of evolution required one.\n \n The discovery of DNA, the sequencing of the human genome, the pinpointing of genetic diseases and the discovery that a continuum of life from a single cell to a human brain can be detected in DNA are all a result of evolutionary theory.\n \n Darwin may have been the classic scientific observer. He observed that individuals in a given species varied considerably, variations now known to be caused by mutations in their genetic code. He also realized that constraints of food and habitat sharply limited population growth; not every individual could survive and reproduce.\n \n This competition, he hypothesized, meant that those individuals with helpful traits multiplied, passing on those traits to their numerous offspring. Negative or useless traits did not help individuals reproduce, and those traits faded away, a process that Darwin called natural selection.\n \n The finches that Darwin observed in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands provide the most famous example of this process. The species of finch that originally found its way to the Gal\u00e1pagos from South America had a beak shaped in a way that was ideal for eating seeds. But once arrived on the islands, that finch eventually diversified into 13 species. The various Gal\u00e1pagos finches have differently shaped beaks, each fine-tuned to take advantage of a particular food, like fruit, grubs, buds or seeds.\n \n Such small adaptations can arise within a few generations. Darwin surmised that over millions of years, these small changes would accumulate, giving rise to the myriad of species seen today.\n \n The number of organisms that, in those long periods, ended up being preserved as fossils is infinitesimal. As a result, the evolutionary record - the fossils of long-extinct organisms found preserved in rock - is necessarily incomplete, and some species appear to burst out of nowhere.\n \n Some supporters of intelligent design have argued that such gaps undermine the evidence for evolution.\n \n For instance, during the Cambrian explosion a half a billion years ago, life diversified to shapes with limbs and shells from jellyfish-like blobs, over a geologically brief span of 30 million years.\n \n Dr. Meyer sees design at work in these large leaps, which signified the appearance of most modern forms of life. He argues that genetic mutations do not have the power to create new shapes of animals.\n \n But molecular biologists have found genes that control the function of other genes, switching them on and off. Small mutations in these controller genes could produce new species. In addition, new fossils are being found and scientists now know that many changes occurred in the era before the Cambrian - a period that may have lasted 100 million years - providing more time for change.\n \n The Cambrian explosion, said David J. Bottjer, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Southern California and president of the Paleontological Society, is \"a wonderful mystery in that we don't know everything yet.\"\n \n \"I think it will be just a matter of time before smart people will be able to figure a lot more of this out,\" Dr. Bottjer said. \"Like any good scientific problem.\"\n \n Purposeful Patterns\n \n Intelligent design proponents have been stung by claims that, in contrast to mainstream scientists, they do not form their own theories or conduct original research. They say they are doing the mathematical work and biological experiments needed to put their ideas on firm scientific ground.\n \n For example, William A. Dembski, a mathematician who drew attention when he headed a short-lived intelligent design institute at Baylor University, has worked on mathematical algorithms that purport to tell the difference between objects that were designed and those that occurred naturally.\n \n Dr. Dembski says designed objects, like Mount Rushmore, show complex, purposeful patterns that evince the existence of intelligence. Mathematical calculations like those he has developed, he argues, could detect those patterns, for example, distinguishing Mount Rushmore from Mount St. Helens.\n \n But other mathematicians have said that Dr. Dembski's calculations do not work and cannot be applied in the real world.\n \n Other studies that intelligent design theorists cite in support of their views have been done by Dr. Axe of the Biologic Institute.\n \n In one such study, Dr. Axe looked at a protein, called penicillinase, that gives bacteria the ability to survive treatment with the antibiotic penicillin. Dr. Meyer, of the Discovery Institute, has referred to Dr. Axe's work in arguing that working proteins are so rare that evolution cannot by chance discover them.\n \n What was the probability, Dr. Axe asked in his study, of a protein with this ability existing in the universe of all possible proteins?\n \n Penicillinase is made up of a strand of chemicals called amino acids folded into a shape that binds to penicillin and thus disables it. Whether the protein folds up in the right way determines whether it works or not.\n \n Dr. Axe calculated that of the plausible amino acid sequences, only one in 100,000 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion - a number written as 1 followed by 77 zeroes - would provide resistance to penicillin.\n \n In other words, the probability was essentially zero.\n \n Dr. Axe's research appeared last year in The Journal of Molecular Biology, a peer-reviewed scientific publication.\n \n Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University and a frequent sparring partner of design proponents, said that in his study, Dr. Axe did not look at penicillinase \"the way evolution looks at the protein.\"\n \n Natural selection, he said, is not random. A small number of mutations, sometimes just one, can change the function of a protein, allowing it to diverge along new evolutionary paths and eventually form a new shape or fold.\n \n One Shot or a Continual Act\n \n Intelligent design proponents are careful to say that they cannot identify the designer at work in the world, although most readily concede that God is the most likely possibility. And they offer varied opinions on when and how often a designer intervened.\n \n Dr. Behe, for example, said he could imagine that, like an elaborate billiards shot, the design was set up when the Big Bang occurred 13.6 billion years ago. \"It could have all been programmed into the universe as far as I'm concerned,\" he said.\n \n But it was also possible, Dr. Behe added, that a designer acted continually throughout the history of life.\n \n Mainstream scientists say this fuzziness about when and how design supposedly occurred makes the claims impossible to disprove. It is unreasonable, they say, for design advocates to demand that every detail of evolution be filled in.\n \n Dr. Behe, however, said he might find it compelling if scientists were to observe evolutionary leaps in the laboratory. He pointed to an experiment by Richard E. Lenski, a professor of microbial ecology at Michigan State University, who has been observing the evolution of E. coli bacteria for more than 15 years. \"If anything cool came out of that,\" Dr. Behe said, \"that would be one way to convince me.\"\n \n Dr. Behe said that if he was correct, then the E. coli in Dr. Lenski's lab would evolve in small ways but never change in such a way that the bacteria would develop entirely new abilities.\n \n In fact, such an ability seems to have developed. Dr. Lenski said his experiment was not intended to explore this aspect of evolution, but nonetheless, \"We have recently discovered a pretty dramatic exception, one where a new and surprising function has evolved,\" he said.\n \n Dr. Lenski declined to give any details until the research is published. But, he said, \"If anyone is resting his or her faith in God on the outcome that our experiment will not produce some major biological innovation, then I humbly suggest they should rethink the distinction between science and religion.\"\n \n Dr. Behe said, \"I'll wait and see.\"\n",
