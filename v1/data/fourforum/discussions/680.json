   "Should the state of South Carolina be allowed to fly the Confederate flag above its state house? There are two reasons why I say the answer is yes.\n \n 1) The Confederate Flag, as it is used today, is not a symbol of slavery, like many people think it does. Flying a flag is a symbol that one has pride in whatever that flag stands for. In the case of the Confederate Flag, the Confederacy doens't exist anymore, so the logical alternative would be that the flag stands for the region that was once the Confederacy: the south. Flying the Confederate flag is only a symbol that the people have pride in southern culture. Why did many Americans fly flags after 9/11? They wanted to show their pride in America. Why do people fly flags of their favorite sports team, NASCAR driver, etc.?

   "Post 1--\n \n \n In response to your previous post...\n \n \n 1) \"The Confederate Flag, as it is used today, is not a symbol of slavery, like many people think it does. Flying a flag is a symbol that one has pride in whatever that flag stands for. In the case of the Confederate Flag, the Confederacy doens't exist anymore, so the logical alternative would be that the flag stands for the region that was once the Confederacy: the south. Flying the Confederate flag is only a symbol that the people have pride in southern culture. Why did many Americans fly flags after 9/11? They wanted to show their pride in America. Why do people fly flags of their favorite sports team, NASCAR driver, etc.? Because they have pride in their team/driver and its/his accomplishments.\"\n \n - The flag is used for a varity of reasons. \"cause its my heritage\" - southener. \n I will first address this point\n First off, to me it doesn't seem like something to be especially proud of. But thats just me. Everyone has a right to be proud of their \"heritage\". As Americans we are proud of our country. Not that we chose our country or birth, but for some strange reason we are very proud of it. \n In WW2 Nazi soldiers fighting for Hitler, killing jews and others. They killed around 10 or 11 million. I think most Germans are ashamed of that time in their history. Because they know what they were fighting for, and what they were doing was so horrible. \n Slavery is not nearly as drasitc as WW2 although I will attempt to use this comparison. \n Should the Nazi flag (swatstika) fly over the capital of Germany in tribute to Nazi soldiers, or because its their \"heritage\". I would hope not. This would offend jews worldwide and imply that the goverment is anti semite. I will elaborate further on why that would be wrong if you disagree, although I think its pretty obvious that it is.. for the following reasons\n 1. They lost the war\n 2. They were fighting for an unjust cause\n 3. It obviously offends alot of people world wide.\n Some people in Germany fly the flag, but these are indivisuals, not the goverment. \n Their is a big diffrence in the goverment flying the flag than a small group of Neo Nazi's flying the flag.\n \n This issue compares to slavery pretty well. \n \n \"Why did many Americans fly flags after 9/11? They wanted to show their pride in America.\"\n \n - This is one country as a whole where the American flag stands solely as a represenation for freedom and liberty. I don't think their is any American that is offended by the flag. They may hate the goverment, but the flag should not offend them.\n One nation is a whole is a diffrent story than 1 state flying a flag that offends alot of people and I don't think should be flown in the first place.\n \n \"Why do people fly flags of their favorite sports team, NASCAR driver, etc.? Because they have pride in their team/driver and its/his accomplishments\"\n \n - This is also is not a similar enough issue to compare. We are not talking about people we are talking about the goverment. (Flag on statehouse) \n \n \"Also, i doubt that there are too many people who would say that slavery was a good, moral thing. Even racist people who I have talked to agree that slavery was a bad time in our history. These people do not want America to go back to a slavery system, but they only feel that people of a different skin color are inferior.\"\n \n - There are alot of people that I have met, that are not ashamed of slavery and even some who think its a shame it has been abolished. Although your right... There are more southeners who think that slavery was bad, than who think it was right. Although another thing the flag is flown for is to symbolize and express their racism. The state goverment should not do this. (Express any racism) I'm not saying that, this is why they have the flag their, I'm just pointing out that once again the people and the goverment are two diffrent issues. \n \n \n 2) \"Banning the use of the Confederate Flag above the South Carolina statehouse would be unconstitutional. Even if the Confederate flag stood for slavery, there is nothing that could be done about it. America guarantees the right of free speech to everyone. If the people of South Carolina want to fly the Confederate flag, then they should have the right to.\"\n \n - I'm not sure of the statistics about how many South Carolinans want the state flag their or not. I have met far more South Carolinians (I live in SC) who want the flag taken off the state grounds, than those who want it to stay. So my point being that the majority of SC's don't want the flag their. The people of SC can wear the flag on their shirts, fly the flag on their property, and solely wave the flag on the state house. Its not \"politically correct\" for the SC GOVERMENT to have it their on the state grounds. To some people this is like saying : The SC goverment supports the confederate flag. \n \n That just about sums up all what I had to say...\n Look forward to your next post\n Sorry about the delay\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

Not that we chose our country or birth, but for some strange reason we are very proud of it. \n\n \n No other country has people clamoring to get into it like America does. We're proud of it because we have what others would like. However, this part of the debate is getting off topic.\n \n \n In WW2 Nazi soldiers fighting for Hitler, killing jews and others. They killed around 10 or 11 million. \n\n \n Actually, the soldiers did not kill. It was Hitler's SS that did the killing of the Jews. Hitler had only one goal in mind: to control the world. He used the Jewish race as a scapegoat for some of Germany's problems, and he set out to exterminate them in order to try to gain more support for himself.\n \n \n I think most Germans are ashamed of that time in their history. Because they know what they were fighting for, and what they were doing was so horrible. \n Slavery is not nearly as drasitc as WW2 although I will attempt to use this comparison. \n Should the Nazi flag (swatstika) fly over the capital of Germany in tribute to Nazi soldiers, or because its their \"heritage\". \n\n \n The \"heritage\" argument is irrelevant here because the Nazi flag was never a symbol for an area. The German flag continued to remain the German flag even while Hitler was in power. The Nazi flag was only a symbol of the Nazi party. By contrast, the Confederate flag was a representation of an area, the southern states who were part of the Confederacy.\n \n \n I would hope not. This would offend jews worldwide and imply that the goverment is anti semite. I will elaborate further on why that would be wrong if you disagree, although I think its pretty obvious that it is.. for the following reasons\n 1. They lost the war\n 2. They were fighting for an unjust cause\n 3. It obviously offends alot of people world wide.\n Some people in Germany fly the flag, but these are indivisuals, not the goverment. \n Their is a big diffrence in the goverment flying the flag than a small group of Neo Nazi's flying the flag.\n \n This issue compares to slavery pretty well. \n\n \n Regarding the three reasons why you stated the Germany should not fly the Nazi flag, and you implied that Confederate states should not be allowed to fly the Confederate flag:\n \n 1) So what? They lost the war. Big deal. This still isn't a reason to keep an area from flying a flag.\n \n 2) I assume the unjust cause you are referring to with the Confederacy is slavery. Slavery wasn't a major issue in the Civil War. Sure, South Carolina attempted to leave the Union because of slavery, but other than that, it was not an issue. As a matter of fact, many southerners who fought in the war were probably against slavery.\n \n One example of a Confederate soldier who fought against slavery would be Robert Lee, the Commander of the Confederate Army. He was actually offered command of both the Union and Confederate armies, despite his rank as a colonel. However, when his state, Virginia, seceded from the Union, Lee searched his soul and found he had a serious problem. He did not believe in slavery.... After pacing his room during a sleepless night, Lee came to a decision. 'I cannot draw my sword against my friends and neighbors,' he decided.\" (Quote from Maj. Gen. [ret.] William A. Cohen's book The Stuff of Heroes)\n \n \n To be able to own slaves you had to have money...lots of money. You had to own or buy land for the slaves to work on. You had to buy equipment for the slaves to use or seeds for the slaves to grow. You had to be able to pay for the slaves' food. And then, you had to buy the slaves themselves. Slavery was not something that anyone could afford.\n \n Many of the soldiers in the Confederate army could not even afford boots to march in during the war. If they couldn't afford boots, they certainly weren't going to be able to have a slave. The slavery system didn't help them, and in fact, it only impoverished them more. Even today, people want to find the cheapest labor for their jobs. In this case, the slave was a worker who would work for zero dollars an hour. For each slave that was brought over from Africa, the value of the work of a white, peasant worker was reduced. \n \n Many people would now ask, \"What were the southerners fighting for?\" In essence, they were fighting for the American dream. Yes, I said in favor of it. South Carolina felt that it was being oppressed by the American government, so they decided that they would leave. Although it was subtly planned so that the Union could say that the Confederacy fired the first shot, Lincoln essentially performed an act of war against South Carolina. South Carolina responded with war. The Confederacy was actually fighting against oppression, in favor of more free choice and liberty.\n \n Some may fly the flag as a reminder of slavery. Some may fly the flag as a racist symbol. Some may fly the flag to show southern pride. However, if for no other reason, South Carolina should fly the flag to show that if America again attempts to come in and force them to do what America wants, the citizens of South Carolina will stand up and defend free choice and liberty.\n \n 3) If the Nazi party actually still existed, they should have the right to fly the Nazi flag. Why? Because it is their symbol. Obviously, if the Nazis still stood for world domination and that the Jews stood in the way of that goal, then it would offend people. However, if they had changed their ideals and broadly published that fact, then the Nazi flag shouldn't offend anyone.\n \n By the same token, the Confederate flag should not offend people unless South Carolina makes it so that it does. If South Carolina states that they do not agree with slavery and that they are not trying to promote racism (which should be irrelevant by the argument above, but it would be a nice thing to do anyway), then there shouldn't be as big a problem with the flag being flown, because people would not be able to interpret the flag as a racist symbol.\n \n Also, the opponents of the Confederate flag are 100% correct when they say that certain racist hate groups use the flag as a symbol of white supremacy and racism. However, they are wrong when they say that the flag should not be used because of that. A burning cross is also used by the same hate groups as a racist symbol. However, no one would argue that churches should not put up a cross because it could be offensive. Also, even a burning cross would not be offensive if the people around it are wearing kilts instead of white hoods. (A Scottish custom is to use a burning cross to rally the clan.)\n \n \n This is one country as a whole where the American flag stands solely as a represenation for freedom and liberty. \n\n \n Actually, the American flag stands only as a symbol of America. America, in turn, stands for freedom and liberty. However, the flag itself does not stand for freedom and liberty.\n \n \nI don't think their is any American that is offended by the flag. They may hate the goverment, but the flag should not offend them. \n\n \n I disagree with you, but I don't think I am able to prove this statement otherwise, so I'll leave it alone.\n \n \n One nation is a whole is a diffrent story than 1 state flying a flag that offends alot of people and I don't think should be flown in the first place. \n\n \n Read my above statements above about why it shouldn't offend people and what South Carolina should do to ensure that it doesn't.\n \n \n This is also is not a similar enough issue to compare. We are not talking about people we are talking about the goverment. (Flag on statehouse) \n\n \n You are correct. However, I was only pointing out that a flag can show that the person who flies it has pride in what the flag stands for. \n \n \n There are a lot of people that I have met, that are not ashamed of slavery and even some who think its a shame it has been abolished. \n\n \n I have never met anyone with those views, but I believe you when you say that. I don't live in the \"deep south\" and actually, I have only lived in the \"northern south\" for about a month. (Those were the terms that someone from Arkansas used to tell me that I'm not becoming a southerner like him just by moving to Kentucky. They don't mean anything other than that!)\n \n \n Although another thing the flag is flown for is to symbolize and express their racism. \n\n \n Once again, I my argument to this is above.\n \n \n The state goverment should not do this. (Express any racism) I'm not saying that, this is why they have the flag their, I'm just pointing out that once again the people and the goverment are two diffrent issues. \n\n \n I agree with you about the state government not expressing any racism, and I have included above a step that I feel South Carolina should take to ensure that they are not perceived as racist or anti-civil rights.\n \n \n I'm not sure of the statistics about how many South Carolinans want the state flag their or not. I have met far more South Carolinians (I live in SC) who want the flag taken off the state grounds, than those who want it to stay. \n\n \n I haven't found any official statistics either. Your poll may or may not be accurate (not that I think you would change results or anything, just that your poll is probably confined to a limited radius around where you live and probably doesn't include many from the remainder of the state.)\n \n \n \n Because of the maximum length of post requirement, I am going to have to continue this on a new post.",

   " So my point being that the majority of SC's don't want the flag their. \n\n \n Well, in that case, then the flag should be removed. However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether or not SC should be ALLOWED to fly the flag. If you debate against that issue, you debate against America. America is a democracy; if the people of South Carolina don't want to fly the flag, then the flag should be taken down. I guess I assumed (and now I realize that I may have assumed incorrectly) that this debate takes place because South Carolina wanted to keep flying the flag and others wanted them to take it down. \n \n \n Its not \"politically correct\" for the SC GOVERMENT to have it their on the state grounds. \n\n \n Why not?\n \n \n To some people this is like saying : The SC goverment supports the confederate flag. \n\n \n And what is the problem with that. Even if the flag was being flown as a racist symbol or a symbol of slavery, slavery was seen by some at that time as a good thing. What is the problem with honoring those who died fighting for what they believed in and what they saw as their country. \n \n However, the flag should not be interpreted as racist or a symbol of slavery. And in this case, it makes it even more reasonable that South Carolina should honor those who were killed during the war.\n \n \n That just about sums up all what I had to say... \n\n \n Normally, I wouldn't quote this, but I'm sure that you're glad that I've finally reached that statement of your post! :) Sorry for the length (It's almost four entire pages at 10 point font in the Word document I typed it in), but I feel that almost all of it was necessary to explain my viewpoints.\n \n Good luck with the remainder of the debate.\n \n I look forward to your reply.",

Once you pay it to the government, it is no longer your money. The government can do with it what it wants to.\n \n Also, as I have stated before, I only support the flag as long as a majority of the people of South Carolina support the flag. If a majority of the people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it, then it should be removed.\n \n Now there is the question of how do we decide whether or not South Carolina wants the flag. Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have representatives. The government of the state of South Carolina should decide the issue. If the people of South Carolina think that the issue is important enough, then they will take that into account when they vote for their representative.\n \n \nAlso if they simply want to honor their \"area\" then they can wear all those shirts themselves.

   "SilentPoet,\n \n Thanks for the excellent debate. Just like the last one, I was constantly on my toes trying to think of new ways to refute your arguments. \n \n I have one major suggestion for you, and that is to look at the topic a little more carefully. From what I've gathered, you were expecting me to debate one or both of the following:\n \n 1. Use of the flag is moral - However, that makes this a topic that is impossible to judge because morality is up to the person. What is moral to one person is not necessarily moral to another. Therefore, who wins would be up to what the judge believes, not necessarily who debated better.\n \n 2. South Carolina should use the flag even if the people don't want it - this is anti-democratic and I wouldn't support this.\n \n \n You really gave me a challenge. If you want to hold another tournament, I would be more than happy to debate you again. Good luck to you if you involve youself in any more tournaments, and I look forward to debating you, either here or elsewhere on the site!",
