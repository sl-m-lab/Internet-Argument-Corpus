A. Hodge <P<\n \n Well! as a matter of fact, there is quite a difference between what Jesus Christ stood for, and what some people actually believe, but my point here is strictly direct people to know his truth, but always follow his steps, rather than follow any man made religion, and of course, for looking at what our Lord have said in Matt. 6:33 reveals that exact meaning of what his kind of religion should be like, thats if a person is to follow his teachings or sayings, but a person must take his yoke upon theirself and follow him, \n \n So then! I must be presuaded by Matt. 6:33 on exactly what and why did he make that statement, of: \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God\", and its righteousness; and all these things shall be added added unto you. \n \n but this method does not eliminate the need for religion, because of it content of this scripture, and because by this method infront of everything else as he has said, means to many people, that our Lord have our full attention for learning as one of his true worshipers as a start, but why not continue?
