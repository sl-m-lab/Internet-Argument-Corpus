   "So it likely didn't have much of an effect on crime overall.\n\n \n Let's be honest for a change. The AWB had no effect on crime at all.\n \n \nHowever, it could have saved a few lives so some people might reasonably claim that it was worth it.\n\n \n No it couldn't, because that's a lie.\n \n \nThink of Poplawski gunning down three police officers with an AK-47. Would you have supported the ban if you had known it could have saved the lives of three police officers?\n\n \n No I wouldn't, because I don't believe saving three lives is worth the infringement of fundamental rights. If I believed that then I'd also have to believe that destroying the internet is the best way to fight child pornography. Or I'd have to believe that suspending a person's right to trial is the best way to get rid of domestic terrorists.\n \n \nOr would you rather have let these officers die?\n\n \n This statement of yours is intellectually dishonest. There's no way you can show that had AK-47s been banned, these police never would have been killed by Poplawski. For all we know he could've easily killed them with a shotgun, or a lever action rifle. Or maybe he might've gotten the AK from the black market and had it anyway!\n \n Your statement is no different than playing the dead children card, claiming that the lives of our nation's children are in jeopardy because we refuse to eliminate an individual right.\n \n \nHow did Poplawski gun down three armed police officers so easily with a weapon that according to the gun lobby only differed from other firearms in its scary looks?\n\n \n Because all guns are lethal in nature, all of them are capable of being used to kill someone if used improperly.\n \n Or are you now claiming that if Poplawski had been limited to bolt-action rifles, those police officers would still be alive because a bolt-action rifle is incapable of killing?\n \n \nCould it be that the gun lobby has been misleading people about the powerfulness of these weapons?\n\n \n I don't see how. Take off the pistol grip, the flash suppressor, the bayonet lug, put in a five round magazine and functionally it's absolutely no different than a semi-automatic hunting rifle.\n \n \nEven a semiautomatic version of an assault rifle can be fired at an amazingly rapid rate.\n\n \n So who cares? Last time I checked there was no law against guns with a high cycling rate.\n \n \nI have seen a few of these semiautomatic weapons being fired in online videos. I saw one video on youtube. The gun in the video was fired so rapidly that I would have mistaken the weapon for a machine gun if I had not been informed before that the weapon was semiautomatic.\n\n \n Now you're delving into the realms of the position of the Violence Policy Center. They advocated the ban on \"assault weapons\" arguing that since so few people could tell a semi-automatic from a true machine gun, their ignorance could only add to the cause and strengthen the public support for the ban.\n \n \n\"Even semiautomatic assault weapons can be fired with extraordinary speed. When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in just five seconds on semiautomatic.\"\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n\n \n So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.\n \n \nCan anyone dispute that?\n\n \n I don't see why we should bother disputing it. But I can point out some evidence that all guns are capable of being fired rapidly no matter what their design is.\n \n YouTube - Shotgun Speed Shooting World Record, Spencer Hoglund aka Lead Dispencer Pump Shotgun\n \n YouTube - CAS shotgun - Grim Reaper\n \n YouTube - Fast Revolver Shooting\n \n YouTube - Fastest gun in the west\n \n I don't care if a semi-automatic firearm can discharge 30 rounds in five seconds. I don't even care if they can discharge a billion rounds in 30 seconds, because it's absolutely irrelevant to the discussion.\n \n Semi-automatic firearms have been around since 1896 at the latest! They're no more dangerous or unusual than any other gun ever made! Your continued attempts at outright intellectual dishonesty is clear evidence that you don't care about facts or reality, all you care about is motivating your agenda!",

   "  21 State Attorney Generals sends letter to U.S. attorney general expressing opposition to reinstatement of assault weapons ban \n Dear Attorney General Holder: \n \n We the undersigned Attorneys General respectfully write to express our opposition to the reinstatement of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994's semiautomatic firearms prohibition, which is commonly referred to as the assault weapons ban.\n \n As the states' top law enforcement officials, we share the Obama Administration's\n commitment to reducing illegal drugs and violent crime within the United States. We also share your deep concern about drug cartel violence in Mexico. However, we do not believe that restricting law-abiding Americans' access to certain semi-automatic firearms will resolve any of these problems. So, we were pleased by the President's recent comments indicating his desire to enforce current laws - rather than reinstate the ban on so-called assault weapons.\n \n As you know, the 1994 ban on so-called 'assault weapons' did not apply to machine guns or other fully automatic firearms. Machine gun ownership was first regulated when the National Firearms Act was passed in 1934. And more than twenty years ago, Congress took additional steps to ban fully automatic weapons. Because fully automatic machine guns have already been banned, we do not believe that further restricting law-abiding Americans' access to certain semi-automatic firearms serves any real law enforcement purpose.\n \n Recent public statements by congressional leaders reflect that same view. On February 26, 2009, The Hill newspaper quoted the Senate Majority Leader's spokesman saying: \"Sen. Reid would oppose an effort [to] reinstate the ban.\" When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was recently asked whether she supports reinstating the 1994 ban, the Speaker reportedly responded \"No...I think we need to enforce the laws we have right now.\" We agree with the Speaker and the Majority Leader.\n \n The same sentiment has also been expressed to you by sixty-five (65) Congressional\n Democrats in a letter dated March 17, 2009. In that letter, they astutely noted, \"It is hard to believe the ban would be...effective in controlling crime by well-funded international drug traffickers, who regularly use grenade launchers, anti-tank rockets, and other weapons that are not available on the civilian market in the United States.\"\n \n Under Title 18, Section 924 of the U.S. Code, knowingly transferring a firearm to an individual who will use that firearm to commit a violent or drug-related crime is already a federal offense. Similarly, it is also a felony to possess a firearm for the purpose of furthering drug trafficking. At a recent Congressional hearing, Kumar Kibble, the Deputy Director of the Immigration and Custom Enforcement's Office of Investigations, testified that the Patriot Act included changes to Title 18, Section 554 of the U.S. Code, which improved federal authorities' ability to investigate and prosecute illegal smuggling.\n \n As Attorneys General, we are committed to defending our constituents' constitutional rights - including their constitutionally-protected right to keep and bear arms. This duty is particularly important in light of the United States Supreme Court's recent Heller decision, which held that the Second Amendment \"elevated above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" The high court's landmark decision affirmed that individual Americans have a constitutionally-protected right to keep and bear arms. We, the undersigned Attorneys General, are staunch defenders of that right and believe that it should not be encroached upon without sound justification - and a clear law enforcement purpose.\n \n We are pleased that the Administration appears to conform with the Congressional\n leadership's position on this very important issue. Importantly, the White House website no longer calls for the reinstatement of the 1994 ban. In fact, it expressly acknowledges \"the great conservation legacy of America's hunters.\" We share that appreciation for hunters and are committed to defending our Second Amendment rights--which is why we believe that additional gun control laws are unnecessary. Instead, authorities need to enforce laws that are already in place.\n \n As Attorneys General, we look forward to working with you and President Obama on common-sense law enforcement solutions to transnational crime. We stand ready to cooperate and collaborate on crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives that will protect our constituents, crack down on transnational crime, and help reduce narcotics consumption in the United States. But, for the reasons explained in this letter, we do not believe that reinstating the 1994 assault weapons ban will solve the problems currently facing the United States or Mexico. \n",
