   "Here is just one example of the press these two allegedly gay birds have gotten since they were held up as examples that homosexual relationships are right and normal in all corners of the natural world, right? Of course all of this drama was created in America's homosexual mecca, San Francisco.\n Love blossoms for zoo male penguin pair\n by Matthew S. Bajko\n m.bajko@ebar.com\n Harry and Pepper could be the poster boys for the phrase \"opposites attract.\" Harry is a social butterfly and loves attention. Pepper, on the other hand, prefers to be left alone.\n \n The two do share a love of swimming and eating fish, mostly herring and capelin. For two years the 5-year-old Magellanic penguins have been lovebirds, attached at the wing, at the San Francisco Zoo.\n \n \"They are a strongly bonded pair of birds,\" said zookeeper Anthony Brown. \"They are monogamous. There hasn't been any exploring.\"\n \n As the zoo and its animals get ready to celebrate Valentine's Day \u00e2\u0080\" for the penguins it is the start of breeding season \u00e2\u0080\" the male penguin pair is the sole same-gender couple struck by Cupid's arrow among the zoo's colony of 53 birds.\n \n \"They've been boyfriends for a long time,\" said their former keeper, Jane Tollini, who left the zoo after 24 years \u00e2\u0080\" 19 with the penguins \u00e2\u0080\" in 2005.\n \n Early on, Tollini said, the two penguins' personalities \u00e2\u0080\" and dislike of their own kind \u00e2\u0080\" were evident. So was the fact they were \"different\" from their penguin peers.\n \n \"Pepper came from a very strange family. He didn't fit in with all the other penguins,\" she said. \"Harry is kind of social. He liked people more than the other penguins.\"\n \n Harry and Pepper both weigh eight and half pounds and stand about a foot and half tall. During feeding times the couple is the first to dine. Pepper has a preference for dining \"al aqua\" so his keepers have affixed a black leather armband to his wing so they can better monitor his feeding habits.\n \n \"He eats in the water so quickly it is hard to read his number,\" said Brown.\n \n Pepper, tagged number 207, also has a \"huge beak compared to his body size,\" said Brown. As for Harry, he prefers to eat on land and is recognizable by the large white spot at the base of his tail.\n \n Harry, tagged number 201, loves to visit with the zoo's human guests. But he had trouble finding a home, or burrow, with the other penguins. He settled on a planter box close to the spot where the keepers feed the birds. His home was away from the colony and a short waddle away from the dinner table.\n \n \"It was the best of both worlds,\" said Tollini.\n \n As for Pepper, he soon took notice of Harry's secluded spot and decided to move in.\n \n \"Pepper said, 'This is great. No one will bother me,'\" she said.\n \n They've been smitten with each other ever since. The pair did move into the row of five burrows on the north side of the Penguin Island exhibit. The row had been fully owned by Fig, the alpha male of the group \u00e2\u0080\" Brown said the females consider him \"a stud muffin\" due to his ivory-yellow colored beak \u00e2\u0080\" but he relented the last one on the right side to the male pair.\n \n In late January the two had already begun to build a nest in expectation of the breeding season that starts next week. Brown, while pointing out their burrow, rated it \"very high\" quality compared to Fig's female partner, who had pulled in plastic to her burrow.\n \n Last year the male couple received a decoy egg to incubate and proved to be good adoptive parents.\n \n \"It was a precautionary measure. Penguins want to lay eggs so bad they will steal another burrow's egg. We were worried they would get hurt trying to steal an egg,\" said Brown. \"They took good care of the egg. They would take turns watching the egg while the other goes out to eat, swim.\"\n \n Harry and Pepper are so strongly bonded that they are being loaned to the Sacramento Zoo for its new penguin exhibit. Along with two other committed pairs, the boy couple will head north to the state's capital at the end of the month and return in mid-2008. When they do, Brown expects they will be ready to incubate a fertile egg and raise their own chick in 2009.\n \n But Tollini isn't pleased with the decision to move the six birds and fears what will happen to them, especially when they return to San Francisco.\n \n \"I don't know what Anthony will do to save their burrow or will they fight like hell to get it back?\" worried Tollini. \"And it is hot in Sacramento. I wouldn't want to go to Sacramento.\"\n \n Harry and Pepper were chosen, said Brown, because they are so close knit. They preen each other and on cold nights snuggle up close to share their body heat. When one is sick, both make the trip to the zoo's hospital. Otherwise, \"they go crazy,\" said Brown.\n \n Like humans, penguins don't like being alone.\n \n \"Penguins don't want to be a single penguin. Everyone wants to be a pair,\" said Brown.\n \n The storybook version of two male penguins raising a chick, titled And Tango Makes Three, has caused a stir when stocked by school districts around the country, most recently in Charlotte, North Carolina. Parents and some school administrators have complained the book promotes homosexuality and want it banned from school libraries.\n \n But zoo professionals voice no such qualms about raising same-sex pairs and allowing them to incubate eggs and raise chicks, said Pam Schaller an aquatic biologist at the California Academy of Science's Steinhart Aquarium. Especially, if the parents of the fertile eggs have genetic make-ups important to the captive breeding stock, she said.\n \n \"It is a benefit to give same-sex pairs an egg to raise. Most young, first-time parents have difficulty in successfully raising a chick or incubating eggs,\" said Schaller. \"If a young couple has two eggs, you can keep them with one of their own and give the surrogate couple the other egg. It allows the first-time couple the opportunity to learn with just the one chick.\"\n \n A same-sex pair with good parenting skills, thus, is not frowned upon.\n \n \"Even though it is a single-sex bonded pair, they could end up being extremely valuable in terms of incubating eggs and rearing other penguin pairs' chicks,\" said Schaller.\n \n The academy has yet to have a same-sex pair within its colony of African penguins. The colony is kept small and equally balanced between male and female birds. When the new academy building opens in Golden Gate Park sometime in 2009 the colony will expand from its current colony of four bonded pairs to 18 birds. But Schaller doesn't expect to see a homosexual pairing because she intends to keep an equal number of male and female penguins.The Bay Area Reporter Online | Love blossoms for zoo male penguin pair\n \n \n And here we see that the wiles of a female named Linda has broken them up in short order, leading to a fight having to be broken up between the two former room mates who have been passed off as gay partners.\n Zoo penguin couple breaks up\n \n By: Katie Worth\n Examiner Staff Writer\n July 10, 2009\n \n \n Move over, Harry: Penguins Harry, left, and Linda, right, are now a couple after Linda lost her mate and courted Harry, who was previously shacking up with Pepper, another male penguin at the San Francisco Zoo. (Cindy Chew/The Examiner)\n SAN FRANCISCO - Someone alert Perez Hilton: Harry and Pepper, the San Francisco Zoo's long-term same-sex penguin couple, have split up. And you\n might say there's a disreputable dame to blame.\n \n The couple's relationship began in 2003 and the breakup came as a shock to the couple's zookeepers because Harry and Pepper, both Magellanic penguins, had long seemed one of the zoo's happiest avian partnerships, according to zookeeper Anthony Brown.\n \n The two black-and-white birds paired off when Harry, whom Brown described as outgoing, befriended Pepper, an introvert who sticks mostly to his burrow. At the time, the two were adolescents and everyone assumed they were just friends.\n \n But soon they were nesting together. Harry would gather grass and bring it home to Pepper, who would arrange it tidily in their burrow, Brown said. Single females would come around, but both birds never seemed interested.\n \n Last year, the pair was allowed to incubate and hatch an egg another penguin had laid.\n \n \"Of all of the parents that year, they were the best,\" Brown said. \"They took very good care of their chick. He ended up being the largest chick on the island.\"\n \n One could say that all seemed to be going swimmingly with Harry and Pepper.\n \n Enter the recently widowed Linda, who has long had a reputation of sorts, according to Brown.\n \n Several years ago, she left her longtime companion and moved in with much older Fig just hours after Fig's partner passed away, Brown said.\n \n \"That was the fastest we'd ever seen penguins move on,\" he said. \"To be completely anthropomorphizing, Linda seems conniving. She's got her plan. I don't think she was wanting to be a single girl for too long.\"\n \n This year, within weeks of Fig passing away in winter, Harry was seen in Fig's old burrow spending time with Linda, Brown said.\n \n Then one day, Harry and Linda approached Pepper's pen and confronted Pepper. Harry began attacking Pepper violently and the three ultimately had to be separated, Brown said.\n \n Harry and Linda successfully nested this year and eventually Pepper was returned to the penguin exhibit from a bachelor pad at the Avian Conservation Center, where he quietly took up his old residence. Zookeepers and fans are waiting with bated breath to see what might happen next.\n \n \"That's the big question,\" Brown said. \"It's molting season in late July and early August, and around that time we see couples getting shaken up. It'll be interesting to see if Harry spends any of that time with Pepper. We'll have to wait and see.\"\n \n kworth@sfexaminer.comZoo penguin couple breaks up | San Francisco Examiner\n \n How tacky, what ever happened to a gracious break up? Must they revert to jealous outburst of physical violence all the time? emoticon_rolleyes",

It's not being outspoken about your Christian beliefs that's the issue. It's you proclaiming how everyone else is inferior to you based on nothing more than your Christian beliefs. You ignore science, you ignore common sense, you ignore other posters' opinions, you deny the debate because you don't hear anything but your own personal beliefs and that is a poor example of going through life, you will never learn, you will certainly never persuade because you won't allow yourself to actually answer an honest question from others. \n \n Christianity is not equivalent to the plague in this \"perverse\" generation. You can't even help but to insult virtually everyone in order to defend your personal faith. It's wilful ignorance that is the plague. You are so ready to demonize homosexuality that you are now taking 2 penguins who do not live anything close to a natural life and simply heaping your own bias onto it. It's two penguins in a zoo, it's not scientific theories we are dealing with here and you are just making outrageous claims based on no real information at all. Do I think you protest just a tad too much? Absolutely. Do I think there is something wrong with you if you are gay? No. Do I know if you are gay? No, but you seem to be throwing everything including the kitchen sink to disprove it's a natural phenomenon and it's rather noticeable. If you are gay, is there anything wrong with it? No, nothing at all so please don't consider this an insult, it's just my observation and it's \"my faith\", only an opinion. I have the same opinion of Larry Craig and other homophobes who live in the closet. \n \n \ndo you really believe that I would deny my homosexuality\n\n \n If you are gay and carry the bible on your sleeve then how else would I expect you to react?\n \n \nif that was my sexual preference?

At least I have the decency to say this is only my opinion and I'm not claiming fact, you on the other hand refuse to do so. You don't deal with the real world you quote bible verses that are irrelevant outside of a religious debate. Unless you are claiming that all aspects of Christianity must be lived by all Americans. If that is the case then there is an entirely other debate we should be having. \n \n You claim others are insulting your religion (me) because I just don't subscribe to the same beliefs as you do. You are completely unable to back any of your claims unless you quote from a book that as far as I'm concerned is not based in anything factual when it comes to homosexuality.

All I do is defend my beliefs but you interpret that as having a sense of superiority. Your ignorance is mind numbing. If you had an inkling of understanding you would realize that we believers submit to out God because we are aware of our sins and sin nature.

But why would I expect you to grasp that simple concept, right? \n \n \n Christianity is not equivalent to the plague in this \"perverse\" generation. \n\n \n Yes it is, from people like you anyway, and you are quickly becoming a majority in this spiritually sick world.

Feel free to post me damning anyone to hell to support your claim mojo/liar. I know you wont so I bolded it so other will see that you will never do it because you can't. You know why? Because I have never done that. I simply point out that the day will come for all of us when the TRUTH from GODS perspective will finally be known. That's a spiritual warning if one doesn't repent, but in no way is it damning anyone to hell. You just sense what awaits you so you lash out at those who convict you of the spiritual dead end you are embracing. But the only person who will determine your eternal condition is you. \n \n \nWell, that's funny. You go through this forum and insult many you debate because they are either not Christian or your type of Christian but if I voice an opinion of my thoughts on your behavior based on others who have denied their own homosexuality then I'm a troll.\n\n \n As I said, you are not only a troll, but an ignorant one. Here's why. Did you happen to read the 3 insulting posts which I responded to? Funny how you saw nothing personal or offensive in them at all. Do you call that objective debating? Yet here you are again attacking me in an extensive response just for giving as good as I get from 3 hate mongers who have attacked me consistently since joining this forum. People like you join this forum just to attack me, do you think you're unique? You're a dime a dozen, historically speaking mojo. \n \n \n You claim others are insulting your religion (me) because I just don't subscribe to the same beliefs as you do. You are completely unable to back any of your claims unless you quote from a book that as far as I'm concerned is not based in anything factual when it comes to homosexuality. Maybe it's not your fault, if you are gay then I'd think you may be the last person to get it.\n\n \n The word of God is self evident in its truth and wisdom mojo. That this FACT is beyond you isn't my problem, nor is it my concern. All that matters is that I pass on Gods truth in my responses to your atheistic and dead end drivel/hate speech. Gods word never comes back void. (See verse below) That means that like a sword it cuts deeply which is why we who share it offend you so deeply, and you take our words as threats rather than the warnings they are. \n Isa 55:11 So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper [in the thing] for which I sent it.\n You may hate what these words express mojo, but they describe your spiritual condition before the Living God perfectly. Posting this passage doesn't reflect condemnation by me but a warning of what awaits those who rebel rather than submit to the God who created them in love. If you had even one ounce of wisdom you would understand that these passages are shared in love since they could lead you to eternal life rather than the eternal separation you are currently running toward with your fingers in your ears. \n Rom 1:17 For in it {the} righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, \"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS {man} SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.\"\n Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,\n Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.\n Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\n Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.\n Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.\n Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\n Furthermore mojo, as an example of the power of Gods word, I am posting this next passage which will surely cut you to the core. You will want to use it as an example of me condemning you to hell, i'm sure. But read it to the end and absorb the promise of eternal hope and salvation which comes with it. But never forget that the first 2 verses are why you are so convicted by the passages we post here. You needn't accept them for their truth in order for their truth to convict you.\n Hbr 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\n Hbr 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\n Hbr 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.\n Hbr 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as {we are, yet} without sin.\n Hbr 4:16 Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\n Having fun now mojo? Or are you finding the truth a bit painful to handle.",

   "Watch out mojo, your guilt and personal conviction from all of the attacks you engage in against the living God and those who believe in Him is showing through. All I do is defend my beliefs but you interpret that as having a sense of superiority. Your ignorance is mind numbing. If you had an inkling of understanding you would realize that we believers submit to out God because we are aware of our sins and sin nature. We humble ourselves before Him and share His love and salvation with people like you out of a sense of love and compassion, not superiority. But why would I expect you to grasp that simple concept, right? \n\n \n Uh, the only things you really share are bible quotes and bigotry. I do not consider them one and the same. For that matter I haven't really attacked god (your god), I've expressed my beliefs that I do not believe in the bible and I really don't care what you believe in, it's the fact that you are completely ill equipped to debate anyone outside of Christianity if all you have is bible quotes. Does that sink in? Not everyone is a Christian and believe it or not everyone who is a Christian really gives a #### about Christianity, to each his/her own. My problems come when others' religion is used to dictate the lives of those who do not follow the same religion. \n \n Save the \"love and compassion\" for somebody else. I have not seen you show either to anyone you disagree with. \n \n \n \nYes it is, from people like you anyway, and you are quickly becoming a majority in this spiritually sick world. You attack me for defending my beliefs but are to thick to appreciate the attacks you yourself participate in against me for having those beliefs. Attacks which do reflect your Truly superior and sanctimonious attitudes as you look down on believers in Christ as ignorant for believing in an invisible God, and just because you haven't experienced what we have. We are night and day, darkness and light. Guess which side you fall on. And that isn't a condemnation of you and your ilk, but a spiritual fact.\n\n \n I'm not attacking your beliefs, I'm attacking you attacking others who don't share your beliefs. You have a real victim complex, don't you? Anyway, I don't look down on Christians, while I don't believe what they do, is that a crime? Yes, I do feel that believing in anything based on faith alone is silly, that's my view, I don't begrudge you for feeling differently, I haven't walked in your shoes. I don't even care how you feel about homosexuality, it's that you want to enforce your beliefs on how others are allowed to live when it doesn't hurt you and there is no evidence that it hurts anyone. \n \n \n \n \nWhen you make stupid statements like this mojo, you're not only a troll, but an ignorant one.\n\n \n I make stupid statements about what? That many bigots are closeted homosexuals? Mark Foley and Larry Craig, both of whom have sponsored anti-gay laws and both of whom are actually gay. Sound familiar? Anyway, it's only a theory and I have no idea what your sexual orientation is but either way honestly wouldn't surprise me. I have an open mind, try it.\n \n \n \nHere's that personal guilt and spiritual conviction getting projected onto me again by someone who can't handle the truth as it's spoken here. Feel free to post me damning anyone to hell to support your claim mojo/liar. I know you wont so I bolded it so other will see that you will never do it because you can't. You know why? Because I have never done that. I simply point out that the day will come for all of us when the TRUTH from GODS perspective will finally be known. That's a spiritual warning if one doesn't repent, but in no way is it damning anyone to hell. You just sense what awaits you so you lash out at those who convict you of the spiritual dead end you are embracing. But the only person who will determine your eternal condition is you. \n\n \n Again with the not being able to handle the truth. Dude, it may be \"true\" in your life, not for me and many others, why not just let it be? You don't really seem to be concerned about saving anyone and have actually told others that they will regret not believing as you do when their day comes. It's like your gloating and it's very, very ghoulish. As far as damning, I didn't mean to say you are personally sending anyone to hell, we both know you can't do that. I'm more or less referring to when you tell people you are the light and they are the darkness and #### like that. Do you realize that sort of talk actually pushes people away from your religion? So, spare me that you're trying to save anyone it's obvious to all that's not what you are here to do. You are sanctimonious, after all you are \"Archangel\", do you like to role-play that way? I think you take yourself a little too seriously.\n \n Anyway, if I believed in the Christian god then I suppose I would repent and you'd have nothing, don't worry I won't take that away from you. And...you're welcome.\n \n \nAs I said, you are not only a troll, but an ignorant one. Here's why. Did you happen to read the 3 insulting posts which I responded to? Funny how you saw nothing personal or offensive in them at all. Do you call that objective debating? Yet here you are again attacking me in an extensive response just for giving as good as I get from 3 hate mongers who have attacked me consistently since joining this forum. People like you join this forum just to attack me, do you think you're unique? You're a dime a dozen, historically speaking mojo. \n\n \n Jeeze, how can one not try to be offensive when it comes to you? I'm amazed if anyone can do it as you are an offense to reason, science and all around common sense. An example? You just can't find it in yourself to believe that pedaphilia is not the same as homosexuality. Ok, that's fine, do you even bother to research it a little? No, of course not because if you did you'd realize you just lost another argument. You rely on your little tiny world view and absolutely refuse to do any research. However, 3 penguins get in a fight and it's a complete refutation of homosexuality in nature. That's just crazy talk.\n \n Anyway, as far as the other 2 (I was the third, remember?) what exactly did they say that equates to \"You can't live your life the way you want to because I read the bible\"? Even though, you are not an authority on sin, that's god's job.\n \n \nThe word of God is self evident in its truth and wisdom mojo. That this FACT is beyond you isn't my problem, nor is it my concern.\n\n \n Now you are contradicting yourself. As above you mention something about all that spiritual warning stuff you were talking about in this post? Now you don't care? I'm sorry but I'm beginning to question your sincerity.\n \n \nAll that matters is that I pass on Gods truth in my responses to your atheistic and dead end drivel/hate speech. Gods word never comes back void. That means that like a sword it cuts deeply which is why we who share it offend you so deeply, and you take our words as threats rather than the warnings they are. \n\n \n Oh, so now we are back to caring? I have to ask, bipolar?\n \n \nYou may hate what these words express mojo, but they describe your spiritual condition before the Living God perfectly. Posting this passage doesn't reflect condemnation by me but a warning of what awaits those who rebel rather than submit to the God who created them in love. If you had even one ounce of wisdom you would understand that these passages are shared in love since they could lead you to eternal life rather than the eternal separation you are currently running toward with your fingers in your ears. \n\n \n Thanks for the love, does this mean that since you were consistent in 2 paragraphs that it should mean something now? Or, are you going to tell me you don't care again?\n \n \n\n Rom 1:17 For in it {the} righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, \"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS {man} SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.\"\n Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,\n Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.\n Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\n Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.\n Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.\n Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\n\n \n That's really sweet. I have to tell you, my skin isn't burning and yet I also don't feel any closer to you. I'm not deleting this from my post because I don't want to be accused of blasphemy.\n \n \nFurthermore mojo, as an example of the power of Gods word, I am posting this next passage which will surely cut you to the core. You will want to use it as an example of me condemning you to hell, i'm sure. But read it to the end and absorb the promise of eternal hope and salvation which comes with it. But never forget that the first 2 verses are why you are so convicted by the passages we post here. You needn't accept them for their truth in order for their truth to convict you.\n Hbr 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\n Hbr 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\n Hbr 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.\n Hbr 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as {we are, yet} without sin.\n Hbr 4:16 Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\n\n \n Yeah, thanks again. I have to say this doesn't really do anything for me one way or another. To be clear, I'm honestly not concerned with Christianity just as I'm not concerned with any religion, to each his own. I have nothing against religion, it's done some bad things and some really good things as well. It's helped people who were in their darkest hour and I would never want that choice, that help taken from anyone. But, you need to remember that religion is a very, very personal choice and not something to be flaunted like a new pair of jeans. I feel like I respect your religion even more than you do, it shouldn't be used to beat people over the head or keep them in line with some arcane dogma. Wouldn't you agree? Take any religion other than Christianity (so you don't feel insulted) and force a people to try and live by it's rules, do you think they will? Religion is voluntary otherwise it's false. \n \n So, I asked you before and I'll ask you again. Do you believe that Americans should be forced to live by Christian laws? I'm referring specifically to homosexuality, free speech, civil rights, etc. Can you answer that?",

On the sexual side of the topic, anal intercourse is a deviant sexual behavior no matter who is involved, hetero or homo. On the social/emotional side, I believe it's a birth defect, wiring gone bad, the manifestation of \"sin\", if you will.\n\n Why would god \"wire\" people to sin? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nNow having said that...,let's see where the line between \"tolerance\" and \"intolerance\" is drawn.\n I don't care if you are gay, straight, or like to swing from rafters naked while your significant other shoots a fire extinguisher at you.., but when the behavior I believe is deviant, and I am aware of it no matter how that knowledge came to me, penetrates my world and the rights of my children, I think its time to quit being so damn tolerant.\n\n I find that fascinating...\n In the interests of finding out how \"tolerant\" you are...\n 1) Do you support gays in the military?\n 2) Do you support gay adoption?\n 3) Do you support sexual orientation employment/housing protection?\n 4) Do you support civil unions?\n \n \n \nMy children, male and female, have the right to go to a school and NOT be in a classroom with a homosexual for 4 to 6 hours a day. \n\n No. They don't.\n Most Americans recognize that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong, and such discrimination should not be tolerated.\n I realize you feel \"icky\" thinking your kid is around a gay person, but your mental issues are not my problem.\n You should seek therapy so that I don't have to limit my life in order for you to feel better...\n \n \n \nAs a Judeo-Christian parent, I have the right to NOT have to discuss gay marriage at my dinner table with my children because it has become a national issue.\n\n Wow. That comes out of left field.\n You have the right to not talk about what you want to.\n I personally believe parents have the right to decide what is suitable dinner conversation.\n \n Can you show me any legislative efforts to make you discuss \"gay marriage at your dinner table\"?\n \n \n \nAnd don't give the one in twenty americans a gay junk.

Why do I know that Ellen Degeneres is lesbian? etc.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I know Barack Obama is a heterosexual.\n I could name a LONG list of heterosexuals.\n Does that mean heterosexuals \"throw sexual behavior in my face\"???\n \n If you object to knowledge, may I suggest you live under a rock?\n Furthermore, please educate yourself that people HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH.\n You not liking to know things about others is downright bizarre.\n \n \n \nI didn't go askin!!!! \n\n You started spouting off your opinions without anybody asking either...\n Should I be offended you \"shoved your opinion in my face\"???\n \n \n \nTake your kids camping some day and in your travels, stop in a rest area some time.

I do not. Why do your rights superceed mine?\n\n There is a phrase.\n Your rights end where mine begin.\n \n YOU think you have the right to tell gays they can't be school-teachers???\n Your rights end where mine begin. You are presuming MORE rights than I have by such an arrogant insistence.\n YOU think you have the right to insist on ignorance about whether or not people are gay?\n Your rights end where mine begin.

All you have done here is attack my character personally which is precisely the point my post is making.

Remember people, Evil can only prevail if good men choose not to confront it.\n\n \n So I was speaking about the chasm between those who promote a moral outlook on life and those who never consider morality at all in determining what is best for our society. That is the evil that will and is prevailing, and which your side doesn't ever want to discuss at all as you insist that homosexuality is natural even though the same percentage of the human community practices it as do those who get cancer. I suppose cancer is a totally natural human condition also, right? If so then why are we attempting to wipe it out? Don't you support cancerphobia?\n \n \nIt is boring how many letters go into you saying so incredibly little.\n YES. We get that you think homosexuality is immoral.\n Your comments just say that over and over and over again, but they don't really say anything else.\n\n \n Really? I believe my statement is incredibly concise in making its point. Here it is again, maybe you should read slower this time. \n \n\n We moral traditionalists are the only thing standing between the reprobate debauchery which those who have no moral center are pushing us toward as a Society. They are totally blind to the moral chaos they represent.\n\n But at least you finally got it right that it is homosexuality which we condemn, and not homosexuals themselves whom Christ also died for. If only you will stop defending your sin and repent of it, much like the straight fornicator does when he receives Gods salvation. Remember that to repent means to turn away from.

It's just that many are intimidated due to your communities very successful tactics of personally attacking a person as you have and constantly do to me for daring to speak my mind regarding the truth of what you and your ilk represents. The great thing about me which you all hate so much is that since I know that I am right before God in speaking the truth, then I don't care and am not intimidated by your personal attacks which attempt to label and marginalize me as some bigoted homophobe for daring to label your chosen lifestyle as the reprobate sexual expression that it is. \n \n The number of hits my personal profile gets is evidence of the following I have from members and guests alike who care about reading my views and opinions exclusively without any interference from the haters which attempt to prevent my message from getting out with all of the off topic attacks which you all contribute, rather than directly responding to what I argue.

So animals were never expected to follow the same moral principles which God established for humanity. \n \n \nNo, no it is not necissarily so.\n \n Cannibalism occurs in nature and is thus natural, but that is not \"right or normal\".\n \n Killing the young of a previous father when you take him out and take his wife occurs all the time in nature, but that does not mean it is \"right and normal\"\n \n Just as something being \"unnatural\" does not mean it is wrong or abnormal: left-handed ness is not the norm - that does not mean it is unnatural or wrong.\n \n Your problem is you are equating words to mean the same thing when the simple fact is they DON'T mean the same thing.\n\n \n As in occurring in nature, you are again referring to the animal kingdom, correct? As in animals eating their young which wont survive, and Lions killing the young in the new pride they take over as the alpha male, so as to bring the females back into the reproducing cycle? My answer above answers this also, but in my opinion these acts are totally natural within the animal kingdom, even though they are very unnatural acts according to human standards. And homosexuality which occurs in the animal kingdom is equally unnatural according to human standards.\n \n I find it so sad that allegedly intelligent and educated human beings have been so dumbed down that they take pride in and feel enlightened for comparing the acts which animals commit, to human beings and feel that because it happens in the animal kingdom then that proves it is right for us also. It just proves that to you secular humanists/atheists, human beings are nothing more than more sophisticated animals. The fact is that God makes very clear in the bible that all life was created to support humanity. This is just one more example of how perverted your world view has become due to the teaching of evolution and your secular philosophies.",

But, just to waste my time, do you see what's happening here? It's not whether homosexuality happens in nature or not it's that this is one of your arguments, the unnaturalness of the act.

   "WOW, foundit contradicts himself in the same statement and nobody else can recognize it. How surprising. You see my intellectually dishonest friend, if something is NATURAL then it is right and normal. So your game of semantics fails miserably if you are held to the actual meaning of the word \"natural\". \n\n \"actual meaning of the word 'natural'\"???\n LOOK at the word.\n \"Natural\".\n Comes from the word NATURE.\n It TALKS about things that are IN NATURE.\n \n And going a step further, suppose we adhere to your definition for a minute.\n If \"natural\" means 'right and normal', then the whole argument is redundant. You are arguing against homosexuality because it isn't \"natural\", when all \"natural\" is is another synonym for expressing your moral indignation to homosexuality.\n \n \n \nI mean, are you now denying that homosexuality is right and normal according to your interpretation of it? Do you admit that it is an unnatural sexual practice? If so then we have nothing more to debate here. So the boring lie is yours once again as you project it onto me as if I am being anything but consistent in my belief system.\n\n No and no.\n I have no idea how you came to that conclusion. Obviously your failed reading comprehension again.\n Bad Mojo has repeated the argument already showing your fallacy that you refuse to recognize.\n \n \n \nJust to be totally clear hear, I stand by that statement as a general statement of fact regarding members of your community.\n\n I know you do.\n You have never apologized for your slurs against homosexuals, and instead try to deny the nature of your actions.\n \n \n \nJust because you find it to be bigoted means that it strikes just a bit to close to home for you, so you must continue to make an issue out of it in order to label me.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n No, Archie, it doesn't.\n Suppose I said Christians were b**chy? Would you find yourself either agreeing with the statement, or unwilling to object cause it would show that you think the statement is true? emoticon_frazzled\n Your limited reasoning faculties are amazing. All roads lead back to whatever assumption you want to believe in.\n You are a fully functional apologetic machine, incapable of looking to the real world for truth.\n \n \n \nBut I have a right to my opinion, and my opinion of the general character within your community is captured in that statement, like it or not. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Archie, my point is that THAT EXAMPLE is one of many which shows you are homophobic. Which you fail to address.\n Suppose I said you were \"b**chy as a Christian\". You would then insist that was an example of my anti-Christian hatred, and bigotry towards Christians.\n \n \n \nSee how dishonest you are as you personalize any criticism of homosexuality as a personal attack against homosexuals? You can't help but play the victim card as you prove the point of my post regarding the tactics your side uses to intimidate, marginalize and by default, silence anyone who dares to speak against what your community represents on moral grounds. All you have done here is attack my character personally which is precisely the point my post is making. Thanks for proving my point regarding your tactics and agenda for silencing honest criticism.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG. That's funny.\n You think saying gays are \"b**chy\" is just \"criticism\".\n But then you think ME POINTING OUT your comment is somehow an attempt to \"intimidate, marginalize and by default silence\" people????\n \n I am simply POINTING OUT what you did, which was worthy of getting the moderators attention to correct you, and you think me pointing out what you did is worse???\n Your thinking is so skewed it is bizarre!\n \n \n \nSo I was speaking about the chasm between those who promote a moral outlook on life and those who never consider morality at all in determining what is best for our society. That is the evil that will and is prevailing, and which your side doesn't ever want to discuss at all as you insist that homosexuality is natural even though the same percentage of the human community practices it as do those who get cancer.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG! You are just plain hilarious.\n You think gays don't want to discuss these issues???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n Look. I realize you think allowing gay homosexuality is \"evil\". It's another example of your extreme homophobia.\n I think you really fail to recognize how your comments are really, really meaningless. You have your opinion that homosexuality equality is evil.\n But the only thing that could be debated is ANY LOGICAL REASON WHY you think that.\n But you don't have a logical reason. You rely on your mythology.\n Suppose somebody were to tell you that spreading Christianity was evil, cause the pigeons told him that was the case. Could you intelligibly discuss the issue with him? \n No.\n \n \n \nI suppose cancer is a totally natural human condition also, right? If so then why are we attempting to wipe it out? Don't you support cancerphobia?\n\n ROFLMAO!\n It's like you're incapable of intelligently understanding what has been repeatedly explained to you.\n To answer your question (and I already know you're going to fail to comprehend it) ...\n 1) Yes. Cancer is natural.\n 2) To say it again, \"natural\" is not an intelligent evaluator of what is right. YOU are the one holding that \"natural\" somehow automatically means good.\n 3) No. Cancer is not good.\n \n See, THIS is one of the reasons discussion with you is just plain impossible. You can't understand even the simplest things.\n \n \n \nReally? I believe my statement is incredibly concise in making its point. Here it is again, maybe you should read slower this time. \n\n You quoting two sentences isn't the issue.\n It's the fact that you repeat what those two sentences say over and over and over again in the same post, saying with twenty sentences what was already said in two.\n \n \n \nBut at least you finally got it right that it is homosexuality which we condemn, and not homosexuals themselves whom Christ also died for. If only you will stop defending your sin and repent of it, much like the straight fornicator does when he receives Gods salvation. Remember that to repent means to turn away from. That's all we're saying.\n\n Yeah Archie.\n And if I said it was CHRISTIANITY I condemned, but not Christians themselves, would you see a difference? emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nOh I'm not alone foundit.\n\n And more of Archie's dishonesty.\n I didn't say you were \"alone\".\n I was pointing out that on this board, EVEN THE ANTI-GAY POSTERS find you vile and your comments repulsive.\n And without surprise, you try to obfuscate my real point.\n \n \n \nIt's just that many are intimidated due to your communities very successful tactics of personally attacking a person as you have and constantly do to me for daring to speak my mind regarding the truth of what you and your ilk represents. The great thing about me which you all hate so much is that since I know that I am right before God in speaking the truth, then I don't care and am not intimidated by your personal attacks which attempt to label and marginalize me as some bigoted homophobe for daring to label your chosen lifestyle as the reprobate sexual expression that it is. \n \n \"the great thing about me\"...\n The arrogance just oozes off you, and you demonstrate once again the REAL point of your posts.\n A mis-guided sense of superiority (or adequacy for that matter) just cause you can be stubborn.\n Cause that's what it really boils down to Archie.\n You refusing to change is just about being stubborn, and you're pride of being stubborn is vastly over-rated.\n \n \n \nThe number of hits my personal profile gets is evidence of the following I have from members and guests alike who care about reading my views and opinions exclusively without any interference from the haters which attempt to prevent my message from getting out with all of the off topic attacks which you all contribute, rather than directly responding to what I argue. And this post is a perfect example of that.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Archie, I suspect a LOT of people look at your profile to figure out what mental institution you are posting from.\n The man on the street corner speaking loudly that the end is near gets attention too.

Archie is just demonstrating (again) his inability to comprehend simple English.\n \n We all know that 'natural' means pertaining to nature, but Archie thinks nature is somehow a moral thing. By his definition flash floods are 'right and normal', trees falling on houses are 'right and normal', as are rabbits eating their own young, volcanos, earthquakes, hurricane Katrina (or any other hurricane), the tsunami, etc etc etc.\n \n These things have nothing to do with being 'right'. Nature cares nothing for rightness or morality. Even the word 'normal' is inaccurate. True, lots of things in nature are normal; a gentle breeze; a moderate wind; light rain; heavy rain; the sun rising in the east. But tsunamis, though natural, are not exactly normal, they are very rare. I haven't seen any volcanic eruptions in my neighbourhood this week.\n \n So, the word 'natural' has no correlation with the word 'right' and is certainly not synonymous with the word 'normal'.

Political Correctness, that's why. You ride your high horse talking about \"tolerance\" but you forget, or are not old enough to remember when beating the snot out of \"dopers\" and \"homos\" was considered \"good sport\".\n \n PC has prevailed and from the pulpits of christian churches it has been taught over the last 30 years to be \"tolerant\" and to \"hate\" the behavior, not the person.\n \n Contray to popular belief, christians opened the closet, gays didn't break out.\n \n \nThat's just about the weakest thing I have ever seen. Plus, didn't you say above \"I love this stuff\". Please, you're not offended and I'm sure if you don't want to talk about gay marriage with your kids then be a parent and set the ground rules.\n \n \n You are obviously NOT a parent.\n \n When I said \"I love this stuff\", I was referring to confronting bigotry on the left.., I don't know how you took it.",

Or do you just see what you want to see.\n \n Militant homosexuality and anti-Prop 8 efforts Northern Thoughts And Reflections\n\n \n Ok, your first links are about Christians going into gay neighborhoods and basically trying to convert gays from their sinning lifestyle.

Moral definitions. Judgment definitions.\n A person could be saying \"gays are not normal, therefore they are wrong\".\n Does that mean \"gays are less than 50% of the population, therefore they are wrong\"???\n Does that mean \"gays are immoral, therefore they are wrong\"???\n The word leads to meaningless arguments. It DOES NOT MATTER whether homosexuality is normal.\n \n Secondly, I have never argued that gay animals make homosexuality \"acceptable\".\n It's the same ol' confusion on the anti-gay side time and time again that it's downright pathetic!\n I said the following in the third post of this thread, and some people STILL CANNOT GET IT...\n Anti-gay poster: Homosexuality is wrong cause it's unnatural.\n Pro-gay poster: One way your claim is flawed is because homosexuality IS natural. Animals do it.\n Anti-gay poster: Wow. You think it's okay to do something just cause animals do it???\n \n Now anybody who can string along a cogent thought should be able to recognize that the pro-gay poster said nothing of the sort.\n If a person argues \"Because of A, then B\", and then A is shown to be false, then the original argument is shown as false.\n Such an observation says NOTHING about the requirements of \"B\" or even \"not B\".\n \n The sad part of this?

And if left-handed people were the norm, then the majority of us would be left-handed.\n It's already been pointed out that this \"interpretation\" of \"normal\" is meaningless as a standard.

It means that they are significantly different from the norm, whatever that norm may be.\n \n\n Considering how over-populated heterosexuals have made this planet in the first place...\n \n\n Darn those heteros! How dare they procreate! emoticon_wow\n [quote]\n I always have to chuckle at the \"if everybody was gay...\" mentality.\n It's an absurd argument based on an even more absurd premise.\n If every organ in our body was a lung, we would all die.\n We need diversity to get the human body functioning properly.\n \n There is no need for homosexuality to exist within a species, but there is a need for heterosexuality.\n \n\n If all gays in the world turned \"straight\" tomorrow, overpopulation would increase.\n MORE people going hungry.\n MORE orphans.\n MORE abortions.\n \n There is an obvious \"better\" situation in a happy medium. Some heterosexuals, and some homosexuals.\n \n\n \n As I stated above, homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, serves no benefit to a species. \n \n \n\n Boring non-sequitur.\n I'm still waiting on any evidence that animals \"couple\" in order to achieve protection from predators.\n \n To put it bluntly, coupling to help against predators IS NOT a \"native instinct\"...\n \n\n Here ya go. Geese Ducks and Swans: Anatidae - Behavior And Reproduction\n \n \n\n Oh wow.\n Ignoring my arguments and without explanation, labeling my argument as \"absurd\".\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n Without explanation? I've explained it to you several times. Maybe words with more than one syllable confuse you. Let's all say it together now an-thro-po-mor-phis-m. \n \n\n And we've already been over this.\n Articles CLEARLY DOCUMENT how this gay couple had females coming by to seek the attention of one of the penguins.\n THEY REJECTED the attention of the female.\n \n \n\n \n Well, maybe if it occurred out in the wild with millions of potential female mates, I might agree. But because a male penguin refuses to order from an extremely limited menu doesn't prove squat.\n Seeking the attention of the same gender while REJECTING the sexual attention of the opposite gender is a clear sign of homosexuality.\n \n\n Quite frankly, your \"anthropomorphic\" argument is meaningless.\n You refuse to look at the EVIDENCE that exists regarding gay animals, and you continue to claim false conclusions on the research. :xbanghead\n \n\n \n So, if you cruise a gay bar and nobody suits your fancy, are we to assume that you are straight? By your logic, that's exactly what we should conclude from your behavior.\n \n\n That's not even a response to what I said.\n You're failing to respond.\n \n Like I said, when people didn't know the gender of these penguins, they ASSUMED they were a male-female couple.\n CAUSE THEY ACTED like a male-female couple.\n Is thinking penguins are \"heterosexual\" an \"anthropomorphic\" response too??? :xbanghead\n\n \n So laymen are now animal behavior experts? When I see a monkey appearing to laugh at another monkey, should I assume that one is a comedian?\n \n\n I have yet to see a gay male do that, so you're making a meaningless comment...\n \n\n Wow! Can't get one by you. \n Here's your gratuitous picture.\n http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/Image/1660/Thumb/1660R-25046.jpg\n \n \n\n And with that, you just lost.\n You admit the two male penguins are not \"normal\".\n You repeatedly argue that homosexuality is not \"normal\".\n Yet you refuse to admit that these two were acting as gay penguins... :xbanghead\n \n\n \n Acting in a \"abnormal\" manner doesn't mean that they are abnormal, only that they are responding in a non-normal manner. \n \n \n Suppose Chris and Pat are acting a certain way.\n If I told you that Chris was a girl and Pat was a guy, you would call them straight.\n If I told you that Chris was a girl, and Pat was a girl, you would refuse to admit they were gay.\n :xbanghead\n \n\n \n I'd say that I couldn't tell by looking at Chris and Pat what their sexuality was. If I saw Chris kiss Pat (and both were girls), there could be a number of explanations other than they were gay. Maybe they were expressing happiness to see each other after one was away. Perhaps they're foreigners. ;)\n \n \n\n Your response is absurd, cause I have made NO SUCH STATEMENT.\n What is it with the anti-gay being incapable of reading and comprehending?\n \n\n \n But you did. You said the penguins were gay, thereby projecting human traits on animals.\n \n \n\n First of all, NORMAL IS IRRELEVANT.\n There are so many different standards and definitions for \"normal\" that it is meaningless to use the word.\n Statistical definitions. Moral definitions. Judgment definitions.\n A person could be saying \"gays are not normal, therefore they are wrong\".\n Does that mean \"gays are less than 50% of the population, therefore they are wrong\"???\n Does that mean \"gays are immoral, therefore they are wrong\"???\n The word leads to meaningless arguments. It DOES NOT MATTER whether homosexuality is normal.\n \n Secondly, I have never argued that gay animals make homosexuality \"acceptable\".\n It's the same ol' confusion on the anti-gay side time and time again that it's downright pathetic!\n I said the following in the third post of this thread, and some people STILL CANNOT GET IT...\n Anti-gay poster: Homosexuality is wrong cause it's unnatural.\n Pro-gay poster: One way your claim is flawed is because homosexuality IS natural. Animals do it.\n Anti-gay poster: Wow. You think it's okay to do something just cause animals do it???\n \n Now anybody who can string along a cogent thought should be able to recognize that the pro-gay poster said nothing of the sort.\n If a person argues \"Because of A, then B\", and then A is shown to be false, then the original argument is shown as false.\n Such an observation says NOTHING about the requirements of \"B\" or even \"not B\".\n \n The sad part of this? I know I've explained this here before.\n And regardless of how many times I explain it, you'll find a variety of people who just can't get it.... \n\n \n The sad part is that you don't recognize that calling an animal \"gay\" is ascribing human characteristics to that animal. There could be a million reasons that the two male penguins hang out together. Maybe one's a great storyteller and the other an excellent listener. Regardless, you don't know why, but insist on calling them gay to reinforce the mistaken concept of gayness in the animal world.\n \n On edit: You never answered MY question.

It's like the old joke: screw women all your life, but suck one c@#$ and you're forever a c@#%sucker.\n\n The possibility of \"bisexual\" is obviously on the table.\n I believe multiple posters have explicitly stated that about the penguin...\n \n \n \nI'm not arrogant enough to believe that I can definitively know the motives of a wild animal.\n\n No. But arrogant enough to deny the obvious categorization...\n So I guess the people who research animals, who have observed these gay animals throughout the animal kingdom, they're all just \"arrogant\" too?\n \n \n \nSo maybe the penguins were far-sighted and thought each other was a member of the opposite sex. Who knows.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n When you reach the \"absurdly lame excuse\" stage, you're showing the weakness of your position.\n You eschew the research of experts, and now toss out wild speculation with no substance...\n \n \n \nI have no problem saying that some animals engage in homosexual acts. I'm not willing to ascribe human labels to their sexual behavior, however.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n What \"human label\" do you think has been applied then?\n Please. Be explicit and quote the offending statement.\n \n \n \nThen all the queens that I used to watch parading into the student union for RU chapter of Homophile League events were my imagination? emoticon_confused\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Let me repeat myself...\n \n Most guys who dress up as women are straight.\n But without surprise, you would assume gay, wouldn't you...\n \n \n Are you going to try to pretend that what you described was \"most men who dress up as women\"?\n Cause if not, you need to review a little something called \"anecdotal evidence\" and recognize what it says about how limited your observations truly are...\n \n \n \nI believe I already said that. Homosexuality is abnormal. Homosexual acts are abnormal in the animal world. Anything else you ned clarified?\n\n After that reversal of yours, I am fine.\n \n \n \nYou said yourself that being gay was more than having homosexual sex. Do you think that most animals are \"evolved\" enough to be as sophisticated as you? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Talk about a pointless reply that completely fails to address my point...\n \n \n \nI've seen lots of so-called experts get their science completely wrong...and I'm a scierntist by profession myself.\n\n And how many of these \"getting it wrong\" consisted of some internet hack (that would be you) refusing to recognize their research, and denying it based on pure prejudice and parroting \"anthropomorphism\" over and over again?\n \n \n \nAnd in a cage with a limited number of opposite sex suitors, behaving instinctive with another male doesn't make it gay. \n\n 1) First of all, regarding these penguins, they HAD AVAILABLE females.\n The article clearly said that a variety of females came by, and were rejected.\n \n 2) Second, it's not just the rejection of the female, but the NESTING with another penguin, AND THEN RAISING a kid together...\n Like I have stated repeatedly, that clearly establishes behavior that would be labeled as \"heterosexual\" with opposite gender birds.\n \n 3) I swear.\n At this stage, it is obvious that the only way you would admit these animals were gay is if they put on a boa, walked around with a purse, and got AIDS together...\n Your denial is evidence of something, but it ain't evidence against the classification of these two penguins.\n \n \n \nLet the ad hominems continue. Nice to see you again, MrWrite.

   "[QUOTE]\nThis perverse comparison alleging homosexuality between humans and animals does nothing to prove that anyone is actually born homosexual. That's why using what animals do to justify human homosexuality is so warped and dishonest. \n\n \n What I'm saying is that there's a contention that homosexuality/bisexuality is found in nature in animals (you'll never convience ME otherwise because my male rats had sex with eachother). If there is a genetic component for homosexuality in animals then there could be one in humans, since we are animals. And in a religious context...animals don't have sin, therefore if animals do it its not sin. Furthermore, if there is a Gay gene, that means that either god put it there or that there is no god...\n \n \nSo assuming that people are in fact, as you say born gay is balderdash and shows precisely why these fallacious articles are so damaging and misleading in their conclusions. \n\n \n Its balderdash because you say so? Dude, come on, even disregarding science, you as well as I have met kids 4, 5, 6 years old that you just KNOW are gonna be homosexual.\n \n \nSo let me tell you how people become gay, it's a result of the sin nature, just like every other predominant sin which afflicts every human being. It just so happens that a small percentage of us are afflicted with this sin in their nature. This doesn't mean they were born with it, but it means they acquired it somehow which I can't determine or explain how or why. \n\n \n Yes, that makes more sense then just admitting that people can be born gay. I guess god DOES work in mysterious ways.\n \n \nBut God knows CxT, but if He created them gay, you can be sure that He wouldn't have condemned homosexuality in the bible. So your claim that blames God doesn't make an ounce of sense. And one more thing. I don't endorse discriminating against homosexuals at all. What I do endorse is equal exercise of the law which means no special rights for people who choose unnatural lifestyles. \n\n \n \n We've been over this....HE DIDN'T. Men wrote the bible. Even if I believed in GOD, its abundantly appearant that the bible wasn't written by a supreme being.\n \n \nEveryone can marry in this country, as long as it's a person of the opposite sex. That is the construction of the historical nuclear family which is the basis upon which humanity has formed civilizations since our inception. Why do you argue for changing that very successful formula now when all you need do is look at the results of gay unions being allowed in other societies to see the negative repercussions that resulted from those social experiments?\n\n \n 2 things... \n 1. If the govt. is going to stick its nose in our private lives and use its power to 'encourage' certain behavior, then the greatest possible number of citizens should have access to those benefits.\n \n 2. If marriage is 'good' for society (and I DO think it is) then the more people who settle down and become happily married, the better the benefit to society. If homosexuals will ONLY marry other homosexuals, then allowing them to marry will increase the number of happily married people.",

   "\n And how many STDs have heterosexuals taken the lead on up until AIDS?\n And why are you fixating on just the \"US\"? Ignoring the fact that WORLD-WIDE, like every STD before it, it is still a DOMINANTLY heterosexually transmitted disease?\n \n And how is this in any way topical?\n Oh wait. It isn't.\n You're just trying to obfuscate and avoid my point with meaningless side-commentary...\n And without surprise, my prediction was 100% correct... \n\n You stated that homosexuality was beneficial to society. I pointed out that I see little benefit derived from AIDS. Very relevant, don't you think?\n \n \n\n So you throw out \"war\" and \"starvation\" as alternatives to population control, as opposed to homosexuality???\n ROFLMAO!\n How about considering whether or not they are DESIRABLE alternatives for population control?\n \n I swear. Anybody who isn't completely shoving their head in the sand on the issue will see your response as further proof of how homosexuality IS A GOOD MEANS to population control...\n \n\n Note to self: Found is sarcasm-challenged.\n \n \n\n Are you honestly trying to contend that AIDS is a viable EVOLUTIONARY response to population control???\n Cause I think it's a crappy idea. Just look at the AIDS babies in the world (brought about by heterosexual parents) and you'll see just how flawed your thinking truly is...\n \n Well. Maybe YOU won't be able to see it.\n Others will though... \n\n See above note to self.\n \n\n Yeah. You are lost.\n My comment had nothing to do with single parents.\n \n Perhaps you should take your self-admission of confusion and take a few more minutes to carefully UNDERSTAND what people are saying first?\n\n \n Here's your statement\" I would love to hear you explain how a single penguin would \"defend\" against a predator to the nest area.\" Now explain just what you did mean by it. You certainly weren't trying to say that two couldn't guard a nest better than one could were you? If that's the case, then you need a reality check.\n \n\n So if a male/female bird were to go through the mating process, build a nest together, and raise a child together, you wouldn't declare that as \"heterosexual\"????\n \n Or was your reply just a weak attempt to imply something contrary to reality, when the truth was that I was dead-on... \n \n\n I would say they are acting as birds and not try to fit them into a human template of behavior in which they don't belong. Animals /= human.\n \n\n Didn't say it was.\n But when two guys refuse female mates, shack up together, and raise a child together...\n Yeah. That clearly points towards \"gay\" (without extenuating circumstances).\n \n If you think otherwise, I would love to see how you would enforce the Florida law against gay adoption.\n Would you look at two guys living together, trying to adopt a kid together, and say \"Well, I don't see any proof that they're gay cause I don't have a video-tape of them having sex\" and let them adopt?\n\n Guys /= animals. I don't believe that I ever said that humans couldn't be homosexuals. It is, as I have contended, a HUMAN ONLY construct. As for the adoption scenario, I'm OK with gays adopting kids. I've seen no evidence that gays, as a group, would be any better or worse than heteros.\n \n \n\n ROFLMAO!\n Way to stick your head in the sand, AGAIN!\n I was referring to YOUR comment of \"Well, maybe if it occurred out in the wild with millions of potential female mates, I might agree.\"\n \n You really seem to be getting yourself confused, as you don't want me to talk about an issue that YOU YOURSELF started...\n \n\n My comment was about the captive penguins. They didn't have millions of female penguins to choose from. Please try to keep up.\n \n\n Would you care to document SINGLE penguins being \"nestmakers\"?\n \n Cause as it is, you keep making up menial excuses for admitting the obvious, asserting incorrect claims right-and-left...\n \n\n Of what relevance is that? We're not talking about SINGLE behaviors.\n \n\n I'm sorry. That was another poster.\n You blindly discounted the research of experts by accusing them of committing an error you obviously over-categorize...\n \n\n Any time I hear a supposed scientist use human behavior to describe animal behavior, my hair stands on end. (or is it that my feathers get ruffled, to use an anti-anthropomorphic expression) ;)\n \n\n The possibility of \"bisexual\" is obviously on the table.\n I believe multiple posters have explicitly stated that about the penguin...\n\n How about \"animal sexuality\" without the humanization? \n \n\n No. But arrogant enough to deny the obvious categorization...\n So I guess the people who research animals, who have observed these gay animals throughout the animal kingdom, they're all just \"arrogant\" too?\n \n\n See feather comment above.\n \n\n When you reach the \"absurdly lame excuse\" stage, you're showing the weakness of your position.\n You eschew the research of experts, and now toss out wild speculation with no substance...\n\n \n Still having trouble with that sarcasm thing, I see. \n \n\n What \"human label\" do you think has been applied then?\n Please. Be explicit and quote the offending statement.\n\n ###!!!?? Are you kidding??!! The term GAY!!!!! Where the F#$% have you been?!!!\n \n \n\n ROFLMAO!\n Let me repeat myself...\n \n Most guys who dress up as women are straight.\n But without surprise, you would assume gay, wouldn't you...\n \n \n Are you going to try to pretend that what you described was \"most men who dress up as women\"?\n Cause if not, you need to review a little something called \"anecdotal evidence\" and recognize what it says about how limited your observations truly are...\n \n\n I apologize for not hanging out in gays bars. I will defer to the EXPERT. \n \n\n After that reversal of yours, I am fine.\n \n\n Reversal? Somebody's been sampling the funny mushrooms again.....\n \n\n Talk about a pointless reply that completely fails to address my point...\n\n At least you're consistent in your lack of ability to comprehend sarcasm.\n \n \n\n And how many of these \"getting it wrong\" consisted of some internet hack (that would be you) refusing to recognize their research, and denying it based on pure prejudice and parroting \"anthropomorphism\" over and over again?\n \n\n \n IMO, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that ascribing human labels to animal behaviors is nothing more than a) an attempt to dummy down findings to layman terms or b) an incredible compunction to be politically correct.\n \n \n\n 1) First of all, regarding these penguins, they HAD AVAILABLE females.\n The article clearly said that a variety of females came by, and were rejected.\n \n 2) Second, it's not just the rejection of the female, but the NESTING with another penguin, AND THEN RAISING a kid together...\n Like I have stated repeatedly, that clearly establishes behavior that would be labeled as \"heterosexual\" with opposite gender birds.\n \n 3) I swear.\n At this stage, it is obvious that the only way you would admit these animals were gay is if they put on a boa, walked around with a purse, and got AIDS together...\n Your denial is evidence of something, but it ain't evidence against the classification of these two penguins.\n \n\n You said yourself that if a gay man rejected a bar full of men, he wouldn't be labeled a hetero, but you insist on using the same logic in applying it to THIS penguin exposed to a very limited number of potential mates.\n As for the obligatory smart-assed comment, you wouldn't know a gay penguin if he shoved his beak up your XXX. ;)\n \n\n Completely bypassing the NUMEROUS examples of research on the issue of \"gay animals\", to complain about being likened to an ostrich???\n \n Your claim of \"scientist\" must involve working for a right-wing think tank, cause you haven't shown any interest in learning the facts of the subject you are attempting to speak on...\n\n I'm sorry, but anyone that starts his list of references with a wiki reference isn't to be taken seriously.",

   "You stated that homosexuality was beneficial to society. I pointed out that I see little benefit derived from AIDS. Very relevant, don't you think?\n\n Why must I point out the obvious to you?\n AIDS sucks resources from our society. A person gets sick with the capability to spread the disease to others. Time, money, and medicine are spent on a sick person.\n \n Homosexuality involves the capability to have that person still be a productive member of society. The person can still provide a contribution to society, while limiting population growth.\n \n The fact that you try to compare the two without recognizing the obvious disadvantages of the fatal disease, as opposed to the benefits of the homosexual couple, is an indicator of how skewed your thinking is on the topic.\n \n \n \nNote to self: Found is sarcasm-challenged.\n\n Honestly, it's hard to recognize \"sarcasm\" when you're dealing with blind extremism such as yours.\n So, instead of a fervent response, you were just failing to give any relevant response to the point I was making?\n Got it.\n \n \n \nHere's your statement\" I would love to hear you explain how a single penguin would \"defend\" against a predator to the nest area.\" Now explain just what you did mean by it.

If two GAY MEN were to defend their home, surely they could defend it better than one gay or straight man, right?\n \n To spell it out for you, your replies are completely meaningless to supporting your pretense that we can't acknowledge these penguins as gay. You keep trying to toss out excuses that HAVE NOTHING TO DO with identifying \"gay\" or \"not gay\" exclusively.\n \n \n \nI would say they are acting as birds and not try to fit them into a human template of behavior in which they don't belong. Animals /= human.\n\n I never said \"animals = humans\".\n :xbanghead\n \n But GAY animals do exist.\n I have outlined clear criteria for recognizing gay animals, which you have consistently avoided.\n \n \n \nGuys /= animals. I don't believe that I ever said that humans couldn't be homosexuals. It is, as I have contended, a HUMAN ONLY construct.\n\n There is no logic in this claim.\n There is nothing exclusive to \"homosexuality\" which makes it a \"human only\" construct.\n You have presented no logic beyond parroting \"anthropomorphism\", \"anthropomorphism\" over and over again.\n \n REAL Scientists who WORK in these areas recognize gay animals.\n You have repeatedly refused to look at their work.\n \n I recognize what you \"contend\", but you do so at the exclusion of the facts.\n \n \n \nAs for the adoption scenario, I'm OK with gays adopting kids. I've seen no evidence that gays, as a group, would be any better or worse than heteros.\n\n And predictably, ducking the question.\n You've been ducking A LOT of my questions.\n \n Let me repeat it for you...\n Regarding Florida Law, if you were to enforce the law...\n Would you look at two guys living together, trying to adopt a kid together, and say \"Well, I don't see any proof that they're gay cause I don't have a video-tape of them having sex\" and let them adopt?\n \n Answer the question.\n \n \n \nMy comment was about the captive penguins. They didn't have millions of female penguins to choose from. Please try to keep up.\n\n You keep coming up with menial and nonsensical excuses to avoid recognizing the obvious.\n ALL those other male penguins have no problems hooking up with a female penguin, but you're quick to dismiss a gay penguin as just \"finicky\" cause it'll help you ignore the fact that he's gay?\n \n \n \nOf what relevance is that? We're not talking about SINGLE behaviors.\n\n Because your responses sound like a mother (of a gay child) in denial.\n You refuse to recognize the behavior as gay, tossing out all sorts of ridiculous assessments and refusing to look at the facts.\n \n The relevance is that YOU CLAIM the species are \"nesters\", so I'm asking you to substantiate your claim.\n You have laid out some absurd excuses which could be applied to HUMAN gays, as long as the information of \"do they have sex\" and \"do they say they are gay\" is withheld.\n \n If the animals only nest with a mate, THAT IS RELEVANT to your excuse.\n \n \n \nAny time I hear a supposed scientist use human behavior to describe animal behavior, my hair stands on end.\n\n Any time I hear somebody who obviously doesn't have a shred of scientific training proclaiming to be a scientist, that bugs me...\n There is nothing about homosexuality that is exclusive to \"human behavior\".\n \n You have stated your opinion that you want homosexuality classified as JUST human, but you have offered no reason beyond your preference.\n \n \n \nHow about \"animal sexuality\" without the humanization? \n\n How about you leave your human prejudices out of this classification, and recognize it for what it is?\n \n \n \nStill having trouble with that sarcasm thing, I see. \n\n Still having trouble addressing REAL SCIENTISTS' research, I see.\n Trying to deflect it with meaningless \"sarcasm\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n###!!!?? Are you kidding??!! The term GAY!!!!! Where the F#$% have you been?!!!\n\n There is nothing about the word \"gay\" that applies exclusively to humans.\n \n Like I pointed out earlier, if this behavior were exhibited between two penguins of opposite gender, you would recognize it as \"heterosexual\".\n The real clincher in these discussions is how a pro-gay poster can easily force the anti-gay poster to an absurd assessment, based on a demand of consistency in logic.\n \n Most people would EASILY be able to assess \"heterosexuality\" in nature.\n You balk at that recognition.\n \n When I ask you here, you insist it's the \"term GAY\", yet you refuse to be honest and also state that it would ALSO HAVE TO BE \"the term straight\" as well.\n But true to your prejudicial inclinations, you have been balking at the recognition of animal homosexuality, while keeping more quiet the classification of \"heterosexual\" animals... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n So, your \"Are you kidding\" line tells me that I have to spell out for you the trap you just fell into...\n Got it yet?\n \n \n \nI apologize for not hanging out in gays bars. I will defer to the EXPERT. \n\n And yet again, you try to obfuscate you being wrong with derision...\n Most REAL scientists would have recognized they couldn't use anecdotal evidence.\n You haven't applied a real science technique to this issue since you started discussing it.\n \n \n \nIMO, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that ascribing human labels to animal behaviors is nothing more than a) an attempt to dummy down findings to layman terms or b) an incredible compunction to be politically correct.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Over and over and over again, all you do is make claims with no substantiation or intelligent explanation.\n You say \"anthropomorphism\" with no validation of your claim.\n Other scientists recognize gay animals, and you refuse to address their research.\n \n You claim \"homosexual\" is a \"human label\", with absolutely no logic to your position.\n EXPLAIN WHY homosexuality is an exclusively \"human label\".\n \n \n \nYou said yourself that if a gay man rejected a bar full of men, he wouldn't be labeled a hetero, but you insist on using the same logic in applying it to THIS penguin exposed to a very limited number of potential mates.\n\n I made no such claim.\n QUOTE ME in what I actually said.\n \n I talked about a PRISON scenario (which you brought up) that involved a COMPLETE ABSENCE of one gender. How choosing a male when ONLY males are available wouldn't make the person gay.\n \n \n \nI'm sorry, but anyone that starts his list of references with a wiki reference isn't to be taken seriously.\n\n You're still looking for any excuse to ignore the work of other scientists, aren't you.\n Take the wiki reference off the list.

We have.\n You misrepresented what I said and attempted to claim a point.\n I called you on it, and you dropped the approach.\n \n But now you claim \"we've been through that\"...\n \n\n There were a limited number of potential partners, Harry didn't like any.....until Linda knocked the gay out of him, that is. ;)\n \n\n And you complain about others \"anthropomorphizing\"????\n Your hypocrisy and contradictory approach is amazing!\n\n Still having a problem with sarcasm, I see. \n \n\n From a stand-point of REAL discussion without you committing problems you accuse others of, what you didn't cover before is WHY WOULD HARRY NEST WITH ANOTHER MALE if he decided that there weren't any females he liked???\n \n If a straight guy goes to a bar and doesn't find any girls he wants to ask out, that doesn't mean he goes out and tries to adopt a kid with another guy...\n \n \n It's the BIG PICTURE here which you fail to recognize!\n\n I did deal with it. I said that Harry was acting instinctual. The male penguin plays a much larger part in the rearing of the young than most other animals. In fact, it's the males in Antarctica that freeze their \"tails\" off hatching the eggs. Ever see \"The March of the Penguins\"? \n \n \n\n I'm sorry. I must have missed where you said that.\n Please. POINT OUT WHERE you originally put this one out there...\n \n Cause if I had seen that, I would have pointed out that YOU ARE ANTHROPOMORPHIZING the situation, when you insist that people shouldn't do that...\n \n You REFUSE to allow people to talk about these animals as \"gay\".\n But when you come across a statement that SUITS YOUR PREJUDICE (which involves anthropomorphizing), you quickly adopt it and throw it out as a possibility...\n \n The only thing consistent in your approach is that you are BIASED AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY, and using any excuse (no matter how inane) to refuse to admit the obvious...\n \n But, above and beyond your hypocrisy, your comment has already been addressed NUMEROUS times...\n BISEXUALITY.\n It exists in a variety of animal species as well...\n\n I'm going to take my ball and jacks and go home unless you develop a sense of humor. \n \n\n You really haven't been paying attention.\n I suspect that on every page of this thread, at least one person has had to repeat BISEXUALITY when somebody else (Archie, etc, etc) has tried to repeat some modification of your supposition...\n \n\n See above.\n \n\n It would be really nice if you would stop repeating and start addressing where you dropped these arguments last in the first place...\n I refer back to the original post where I pointed it out.\n You made a SPECIFIC complaint about supposed \"homosexual\" anthropomorphizing, but not a single mention of heterosexual anthropomorphizing...\n ... until I pointed out your inconsistency...\n \n Looking through your quotes, anybody with a lick of recognition will be able to see you were JUST talking about homosexual anthropomorphism...\n \n I EVEN POINTED IN YOUR LAST POST how you were guilty of the very thing (cause it suited your prejudice) of what you accuse others of doing...\n \n\n Reading challenged as well as humor-impaired......pity.\n \n \n \n\n \n And still NOT ONE IOTA of a comment on these articles...\n I thought scientists were supposed to look at the facts JPSartre12?\n Supposed to look at the research of others?\n \n All you have really done is repeat \"anthropomorphism\" ad nausieum, and refuse to look at the real evidence at hand...\n \n \n\n \n Since you asked. \n Article #1. Funny puff piece. No real science there.\n Article #2 basically supports my position \"Unlike most humans, however, individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight: an animal that engages in a same-sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters. Rather many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society. That is, there are probably no strictly gay critters, just bisexual ones. \"Animals don't do sexual identity. They just do sex,\" says sociologist Eric Anderson of the University of Bath in England.\"\n Article #3 basically states that there are many reasons that animals engage in homosexual ACTS and was written by an evolutionary psychologist. NEXT!\n Article #4 is a rehash of the penguin story done ad nausea.",

   "I think there a few folks in this thread that seriously need to take a chill pill, on both sides. \n For what it's worth, I have never, EVER known a religious person who's morality is not informed by their God-given reason, as most anyone's would be. Not once. This idea that religious people DON'T use reason at all has got to be one of the more insipid insinuations I've heard in a long time. Religion and reason are clearly not incompatible, as the likes of Bishop Tutu, ML King Jr., Ghandi, and Romero have seemed to understand just fine. Of course we never hear about THOSE examples from the anti-theists we have on this forum when it comes to this subject. Reason and religion have done just fine together, thank you, and will continue to do so long after the current anti-theist fad of insinuating that they are incompatible has gone.\n \n On the flip-side, in my experience atheism in its true form as an ideology is not immoral, and in fact really has nothing to do with morality/immorality in the first place. Rather, it's amoral in the sense that it doesn't really address such issues. It doesn't really speak to a moralistic point. I think it's equally wrong for religious people to point fingers at atheists and call them morally wrong or evil. Sorry, but a benevolent atheist helping someone in a time of need is better than a non-benevolent religious person any day. And that really gets the heart of the matter--benevolence isn't about whether one believes God exists or not. There are plenty of downright selfish and evil religious people in the world, and there are plenty of benevolent and kind atheists. The very tactic of trying to associate atheism with immorality is immoral to begin with.\n \n One more thing ... concerning Jefferson, he was not the anti-religious dream figure that some anti-theists seem to assume he is. Anyone that was really a student of his work would be aware that his statements are so diverse and varied that his statements could back a number of positions. I've read plenty of quotes that support religion as well. No one owns Jefferson--neither the anti-theist or the anti-atheist.

You refer to atheists as \"amoral\" rather than being specifically immoral and I agree with that and so much as said it here: You have no moral boundaries at all and wouldn't think of judging anyone if they participated in bestiality for example, even if it isn't your thing. A moral foundation is defined by caring about what is wrong morally, not because of how it affects you directly, but because it is wrong and damages the larger society and the social decency of the whole community.  It would have been more concise to have just said amoral.\n \n I didn't call them immoral in that post but spoke to their perceptions or amoral acceptance of another's immoral actions. I also spoke in general terms regarding how atheists view morality, and I stand by that opinion. But that isn't to say that ALL atheists necessarily practice immoral acts. One of the most personally moral people I have ever known happened to be a devout atheist. So if i sounded like I was making a sweeping generalization I do apologize. \n \n And one more thing which needs to be clarified. The people speaking up in this specific debate whom I was responding to such as write LA and davenport, and now, foundit do unrepentantly practice the abomination of homosexuality and the atheists like Brigid do defend their lifestyle even though she may not be homosexual herself. that is the point I'm making and it stands as it is proven by the very atheists here who have no issue with the sins of the flesh which others practice as right and normal. So as you say, they are amoral at the very least. \n a&#8901;mor&#8901;al[ey-mawr-uhl, a-mawr-, ey-mor-, a-mor-] \n -adjective\n having no moral standards, restraints, or principles; unaware of or indifferent to questions of right or wrong: a completely amoral person.\n \n \nThanks for revealing the moral rationalization which you rely on to make judgments about what is moral and immoral. Christians don't need God in order to know not to murder people, and the evidence of that is that most all believers in Christ never murdered anyone prior to accepting Him. \n \n The standard of holiness we strive for as followers of our Lord is so above what you consider for your lives, it is like night and day, or should I say the difference between the light and the darkness.\n \n For example, we feel convicted about running stop signs, looking at attractive girls with lust in our hearts and thinking about not correcting an error at the checkout counter. You have no compunction what so ever in accepting such things as right and normal as long as you can get away with them here and now.

   "From Atheism is a belief - FreeThoughtPedia (a WORKING website):\nIs Atheism a Belief? \n \n Is \"bald\" a hair color? \n \n Is \"not collecting stamps\" a hobby? \n \n If you no longer believe in Santa Claus, do you call yourself an \"Anti-Santa-Clausian?\" \n \n Is there some doctrine you follow pursuant with your non-belief in the existence of the tooth fairy? \n \n Atheism is a lack of belief in god(s). \n \nTheists often claim that atheism is a belief. They use this characterization to claim among other things, false premises such as: [*]It takes just as much faith to not believe in god as it does to believe in god\n\n Wrong. \n \n It takes no faith to not believe in something. Do you know what the definition of faith is? It is believing in something in the absence of evidence. In other words, it's the opposite of coming to a conclusion based on something real and tangible. The non-existence of something is not a belief. It's merely a base or fallback position one naturally comes to in the absence of contrary evidence. \n \n Is there a large pink elephant sitting on the toilet in the bathroom at your home right now\"? \n \n No? Why not? So you take it on faith that there isn't a large pink elephant sitting on the toilet in your bathroom at home? Do you think your lack of belief in this concept requires faith, or maybe it's the other way around? You only require faith to believe IN something that defies the laws of logic. \n \n[*]Atheists have no morals or world view or any behavioral guidelines, and if they do have any, they must be supernaturally given so they're not really atheists in the first place because morality comes from a higher power\n \n Hogwash. \n \n This claim, which is very often made by theists is insulting to all intelligent people. \n \n First and foremost, as was mentioned earlier, atheism is a lack of belief, which theists often compare in the same terms as they do their beliefs, which do constitute a World view. The problem is, atheism is not a \"world view\". It's not a set of rules, regulations, dogma, scripture, beliefs or any other idea that is universally accepted among people. There is no atheist bible. There are no rules which all atheists are expected to follow. The lack of belief is not indicative of a recommended way of living ones' life. \n \n Atheists do have world views; they do have a sense of morality; they do have ideas on what is and isn't acceptable and moral behavior. However, these \"beliefs\" are not derived from theology, nor are they derived from any atheist manifesto, nor are they consistent among all those who choose not to subscribe to religious mythology. There are many other sources for world views and morality, not the least of which is Humanism which is typically embraced to one extent or another by all people regardless of their faith or lack thereof. \n \n We won't even get into the ludicrous assumption that god has any consistent idea of what is and isn't moral behavior. That's an exercise in hypocrisy best left to its own section, which you can find in the Theological Criticisms area. \n \n The bottom line is that regardless of what magical sky fairy you do or do not believe in, there is ample evidence to indicate there are basic moral guidelines that all humans have an instinctive nature to follow. The most obvious involves avoiding unnecessary harm to other creatures. By doing so, we reduce the likelihood of unnecessary harm being inflicted upon ourselves, and you don't need to believe in god to recognize that pain and discomfort is something worth avoiding wherever possible. \n",

   "By your own words you show you know its wrong. Knowing somethings wrong and doing it anyway doesn't prove you don't understand what is 'right' and 'moral'. It just proves you don't care. We all (except sociopaths perhaps) have the ABILITY to come to the right conclusions and perpetrate the correct actions. Of course, that doesn't mean we will chose to do so.\n\n \n It's not my morality that's in question. My morality happens to be based on my Christian upbringing. \n \n \n \nI'm always tickled when I hear religious folks claim that, without religion, we wouldn't know the difference between right and wrong. In fact, many of them seem act as if it's only their belief in god that keeps them from killing, stealing, or committing any other untold crimes. If that's the case, one wonders, what kind of people are they really?\n \n I guess if I had no faith in my own moral barometer, I might look toward some outward source to tell me not to kill, steal, cheat, etc.\n \n Thankfully, my moral code is based on my respect for myself and my fellow man. Pity that some people are naturally just killers and thieves who require god to prevent them from acting on their own worst instincts.\n\n \n Ever read Lord of the Flies, by chance?\n \n \nNot only that, but the prisons and history books are chock full of True Believers who were not only NOT deterred from killing, torturing, etc. by the Word of their Lord, but took it as a mandate for their heinous crimes.\n \n\n \n And the history books are full of atheist tyrrants like Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler, Chairman Mao, so what's your point? Man has always acted inhumanely towards man. \n \n\n I'll trust the morality of intelligence and reason over that of the \"I-only-do-it-because-my-invisible-friend-in-the-sky-tells-me-what's-right-and-wrong\" Crowd any day.\n\n And how's that working for you so far? ;)",

I suggest that you brush up on your history before spreading such manure.\n \n\n What is this God who takes pleasure only in seeing men grovel before him? Try to picture to yourselves the meaning of the following, quite simple story: God creates the conditions for sin. Later on he succeeds, with the help of the Devil, in causing man to sin. Then he employs a virgin to bring into the world a son who, by his death, will redeem humanity! \n \n I can imagine people being enthusiastic about the paradise of Mohammed, but as for the insipid paradise of the Christians! In your lifetime, you used to hear the music of Richard Wagner. After your death, it will be nothing but hallelujahs, the waving of palms, children of an age for the feeding bottle, and hoary old men. The man of the isles pays homage to the forces of nature. But Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery. A nigger with his taboos is crushingly superior to the human being who seriously believes in transubstantiation. \n \n I begin to lose all respect for humanity when I think that some people on our side, ministers or generals, are capable of believing that we cannot triumph without the blessing of the Church. Such a notion is excusable in little children who have learned nothing else. \n \n For thirty years [i.e. 1618-1648] the Germans tore each other to pieces simply in order to know whether or not they should take communion in both kinds. There's nothing lower than religious notions like that. From that point of view, one can envy the Japanese. They have a religion which is very simple and brings them into contact with nature. They've succeeded even in taking Christianity and turning it into a religion that's less shocking to the intellect. \n \n By what would you have me replace the Christians' picture of the Beyond? What comes naturally to mankind is the sense of eternity, and that sense is at the bottom of every man. The soul and the mind migrate, just as the body returns to nature. Thus life is eternally reborn from life. As for the 'why' of all that, I feel no need to rack my brains on the subject. The soul is unplumbable. \n \n If there is a God, at the same time as he gives man life he gives him intelligence. By regulating my life according to the understanding that is granted me, I may be mistaken, but I act in good faith. \n \n\n \n I've got more in case that doesn't doesn't convince you.emoticon_rolleyes",

In a way you could say the ancient world was based upon religion. Many cultures had different gods or forms of worship. The Romans were no exception except they based most of their gods off of those of the Greeks. Rome, also had many temples and many of their greatest architectural achievements were those buildings built as temples and houses of worship for their citizens.\n\n \n As I stated above, religion was the glue that held society together....as it does today in many places.",
