   "He has scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He has sent away empty. Luke 1:51-53\n \n How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Luke 18:18-21 \n \n Come now, you rich, weep and wail over your impending miseries. Your wealth has rotted away, your clothes have become moth-eaten, your gold and silver have corroded, and that corrosion will be a testimony against you; it will devour your flesh like a fire. You have stored up treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages you withheld from the workers who harvested your fields are crying aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on earth in luxury and pleasure; you have fattened your hearts for the day of laughter. You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one: he offers you no resistance. James 5:1-6 \n \n Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me. . . .Amen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me. And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. Matthes 26:41-43; 45-46",

I've suggested that a cool and dispassionate view points to misgovernance as the key factor that has to be addressed if the poor of this earth are to be given their \"fair\" share of its bounty.\n \n I know this view is unpopular with facile optimists who believe, or affect to believe, that simply providing more aid to developing countries will bounce them out of the poverty cycle. It will not. Surely, it is more humane to seek out the deficiencies in economic infrastructures and try to amend them so that, in the event, poor people will have the foundations on which to build their own prosperity.\n \n The difficulty I have not elaborated is how intervention by the concerned governments of wealthy nations can be effective without assuming at least a temporary neo-colonial role.

   "If the poor of sub-Saharan Africa are getting poorer, then what are the reasons for it? Let's be specific and take a look at one of the poorest of the poor in that region. \n \n Liberia, as most people will know, was founded by freed slaves from America and the Caribbean. Most of the inhabitants are not descendants of those slaves but are indigenous Africans. It's roughly the size of Ohio and has never been ruled by a foreign power. Perhaps the country was never really viable because of its unhealthy location and limited natural resources. \n \n However, it does grow rubber, coffee, and timber, and diamonds are mined there. So why (in 2004) were 80% of the population reported to be living below the poverty line - whatever the criteria for measuring it in that place? \n \n The answer is that the economy has been wrecked by gross misgovernment and civil wars. Rebel groups, war lords, and gangs of incorrigible youths have created a state of anarchy and economic collapse. The feeble UN \"peacekeeping\" force has been unable or unwilling to assert itself and grip the show there.\n \n In 2004 about $114 million of aid was donated to Liberia - most of it by the US. But in such a case where economic development is prevented by internal obstacles, aid \"without strings\" merely reinforces the obstacles it is intended to remove.\n \n So if more aid is not the remedy, what is ? Well, America may be supposed to have a residual interest, so suppose it annexed or was granted a UN mandate to govern the place? After a period of \"mentoring\" during which the rule of law would be established and the economic infrastructure rebuilt, the Americans could depart. This will NOT happen, so perhaps as an alternative, a UN task force of civil engineers, financial experts, teachers, doctors, etc., could be assembled and sent in there (under armed guard) to rescue the country. \n \n These suggestions might be dismissed as just silly - but what's the alternative ? Pouring more aid money into the pockets of hooligan politicians and the \"criminal community\"?",
