I think this would get more press if we weren't involved in that great black hole they call Iraq.

I'll refresh your memory since that isn't possible. I declare myself an independent, I have opposed the Iraq invasion since the beginning, (but probably not for the reasons you think), I'm actually not union, I have a bachelor of science degree in business administration with a concentration in accounting from KU and I have run the construction equipment division of our company for the last 21 years. I oppose big government, higher taxes, and wasteful government spending. I honestly feel I'm much more conservative than liberal. I was being sarcastic when I said it wasn't my job to fight terrorism, I was being critical of the many agencies who actually exist to do that job and didn't. Lastly, I'm not criticizing Republicans or Democrats in general. I didn't say I would never vote for a Republican for president, I just said I wasn't happy with the current one. If you want to know where I stand on any issue, just ask me, but please don't label me a liberal after reading 2 posts! ;)",

   "I too found Clark to be quite credible.I listened to his testimony in front of the commission,and found him to be well versed on the subject matter.He made some very convincing statements to the commission on his ideas of how things were being mishandled.It seemed to me that he had very little access to Bush while he was part of the Bush addmin.I was totally surprised to find that he was constantly dealing with deputies,and not principals.His apology to the American people ,I thought,was a very noble thing to do.He certainally Give me the impression that he was telling the truth. I suppose it would be difficult to address Bush personally,as he was on vacation prior to 9-11 :)",

   "In the beginning of the Iraq war, the \"shock and awe\" phase, the United States illustrated what every other nation already knew, we have the strongest military force in the world. We outspend every other nation by tens of billions of dollars so that's no suprise.\n\n \n Yes, everyone knew we had the strongest military on earth. That wasn't the issue. The issue was that the US has the strongest, best-equipped, and best trained fighting force in the world...and it will use it. Up until Iraq, maybe kinda Afghanistan, nobody thought that the US would realistically enter a large-scale war, because Slick Willy Clinton had given us a reputation of being a paper tiger.",

What other \"large scale wars\" have we missed out on? Who are these \"everyone\" and \"nobody\" people that we should be so worried about impressing? If everyone was \"amazed\" in the early days of the invasion, I'm sure they're all just as \"suprised\" to see such intense fighting still going on one year later.",
