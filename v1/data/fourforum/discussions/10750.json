Remove red and green construction paper chain and pull off candy canes.\n That's all I had...and the tree I bought was beutiful. \n 2 years ago a co-habitant had a Victorian style tree covered with period piece collectable ornaments. Every square inch was covered.\n Not my style really. Took her hours to decorate.\n She managed to smuggle it in behind my back...I wouldn't normally allow such a thing in 'my house'.\n \n And, while grocery shopping tonight with the son, I tried to explain to him why some people have trouble losing weight. Women who've just had kids, people who's metabolism has changed...\n Fortunatly, foods not one of my indulgences. Lack of a sense of smell I think.\n \n Ohhh...but I do love gossip. Don't know why. Probably has to do with it being the only way I can communicate with the wife...I didn't marry her for her intellect :(\n Would probably be lust or something close which I forgot to list.\n \n I think the son's got gluttony down.\n About 3 large candy bars and a 12 pack of Yoohoos in one day.
