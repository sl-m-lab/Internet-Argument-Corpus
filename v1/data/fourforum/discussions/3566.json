   "Tax Hypocrisy: Kerry Makes the Case for Fundamental Tax Reform\n by Richard W. Rahn\n WebMemo #600\n \n October 28, 2004 | printer-friendly format |\n \n Senator John Kerry keeps telling us that \"the rich\" need to pay more in taxes, and he proposes to raise the marginal tax rate that Americans with earnings in the two top tax brackets would pay. But the small amount that Kerry and his wife paid last year in taxes demonstrates the error of this approach. Under Kerry's own plan to \"tax the rich,\" his and his wife's average tax rate would increase to only 15.2 percent, far less than many small-business owners and middle-class earners would pay. This discrepancy is an artifact of today's convoluted tax code. In short, the Kerrys' own tax return makes the case for fundamental tax reform. \n \n The Senator, for Example\n Senator Kerry and his wife are among the 400 richest Americans. Last year, they paid only 13.4 percent of their declared $5.5 million income in federal taxes. \n \n Estimates of the Kerrys' worth range from a low of $700 million to a high of $3.2 billion. How much income would you expect a billion dollars to produce? The Kerrys reported $5 million in income, which is a return of only about one-half of 1 percent, which is far lower than the return on even U.S. government securities. \n \n How could this be? Like many wealthy Americans, the Kerrys have at their disposal a variety of legal means to keep income off of their tax returns and to keep the tax rate on their reported income low. Many of these loopholes are the result of tax policies that aim to reward or punish certain behavior with incentives and sanctions. \n \n These policies make the tax code extremely complex, and their interactions and frequent vagueness benefit those with the means to employ extremely sophisticated tax-planning strategies. Conversely, this complexity disadvantages ordinary taxpayers, few of whom have the time or ability to navigate thousands of pages of tax code regulations, up-to-the-minute legal decisions, and administrative explanations and memoranda. \n \n Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, must have the same tax adviser. Last year, Senator and Mrs. Edwards paid an average tax rate of only 5.1 percent on their reported $434,000 of income, or less than one-third of the rate that the average taxpayer pays. \n \n The Senator's Tax Plan\n For those concerned about tax equity-that is, that all Americans pay their fair share in taxes-working within the confines of the existing tax system is extremely limiting. Raising marginal rates on the rich, for example, will not necessarily result in the super-rich paying markedly higher rates or even as much, as a percentage of actual income, as middle-class taxpayers. \n \n So, in effect, any proposal to raise the top marginal rate is not really a proposal to increase taxes on those who are already rich, whether through inheritance, hard work, luck, or marriage, but a proposal to increase taxes on those who are trying to become rich. Those who have already achieved wealth, by whatever means, can tax shelter much of their income, but those with little in the way of assets find it almost impossible to shelter their earnings from taxes. \n \n Senator Kerry's tax plan exemplifies this difficulty. Kerry proposes to raise the marginal tax rates that apply to income above $200,000. But what effect would this have on the actual taxes paid by the very wealthy? According to an analysis by the Argus Group, a respected tax law and economics firm, the Kerrys' average tax rate would only increase by 1.8 percentage points to 15.2 percent under the senator's plan. At the same time, many small-business owners would see their average rate rise by 4.0 percentage points, resulting in effective rates as high as 35 to 40 percent, including certain deduction phase-outs. \n \n In other words, by proposing to raise the top marginal rates, Senator Kerry implicitly embraces a system of taxation under which he and his wife and other established, wealthy families pay an average tax rate that is less than half of what many young professionals and small-business owners, many of whom may possess few or no assets, have to pay. This fact should give any tax-equity advocate pause. \n \n The Case for Fundamental Reform\n No doubt unintentionally, Senator Kerry makes a strong case for fundamental tax reform, and specifically a flat tax or consumption tax. \n \n Under a flat tax, all Americans, regardless of income level, pay the same percentage of their income in taxes. A flat tax minimizes the complexity of the tax code, eliminating the sort of loopholes that are today so valuable to those who can afford sophisticated tax planning. \n \n Another option for tax reform is the consumption tax, under which savings and investment are excluded from income and only consumption is taxed. Economic efficiency would be enhanced because people would be taxed only on what they take out of the economy rather than on what they put into it. \n \n Municipal bonds, a favorite investment tool of the wealthy, are already treated this way under the tax code, but few other investments are. As a result, most Americans investing their money are doubly taxed: once on their income and again on the investments that they make with that income. Just like the wealthy, all investors should be able to avoid double taxation. \n \n In addition to promoting tax equity, a flat or consumption tax would stimulate an additional supply of labor and capital, which would result in much higher economic growth and lower unemployment to the benefit of all Americans.\n \n As Senator Kerry's own experience so aptly demonstrates, today's tax code advantages the wealthy at the expense of those trying to better their lots. And as his proposal to raise taxes on the rich demonstrates, working within the confines of today's tax code is no way to fix the problem. Only a flat rate, whether under a flat income tax or a consumption tax, would ensure that all taxpayers-even the wealthy and even Senator and Mrs. Kerry-pay their fair share. \n \n Richard W. Rahn is a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation.",

And I just wonder how much they spent for their Tax Preparation? (probably more than you and I make in a year, combined!) We are simply saying that there is a better way to fund the federal govt. that is less intrusive, and simpler, and better for anyone currently paying taxes.\n \n \n \n \nWhat a crock that whole article is.\n \n Waxy\n \n On Edit - 15.2% of 5 million is $760,000. \n \n How much did YOU pay in tax last year. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n P.S. I don't have any delusions of Chugalug actually coming back to defend his post. :p\n\n \n What's to defend? You say the story is \"a crock\"! Well, I imagine his defense could be just about as short. \n \n I paid 28% (the Kerry's paid 15%). Why should I (middle income person) have to pay a higher percentage than the Kerry's? What is FAIR about that?\n \n Under the Fair Tax, Me and the Kerry's BOTH would keep ALL of what we earn, no matter how we earn it. We would then use our \"pretax dollars\" to make our purchases. The more we purchase, the higher the tax we pay, with the max being 23%. If the Kerry's spent $5 million last year, then they would have paid 23% in federal taxes instead of 15%, or $1,015,000 instead of $760,000. My tax burden would decrease from 28% to a maximum of 23%. But then the money I spend is \"pretax money\" (it is my GROSS income) so I have more to spend also.\n \n The less you spend, the less tax you pay (because of the rebates that would be available to all US citizens). Low income people would spend 0% tax (net) up to the poverty level, because the taxes that would be spent on an amount of income up to the poverty level is reimbursed in the form of rebates. Thus, the lower income earners spend little if any tax, and those who spend more, pay more tax. But no one (even the Kerry's) would pay more than 23%. Now, I think most people would think this is FAIR (thus the name \"FairTax\").\n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",

He has even proposed that he is going to raise the taxes on \"the rich\" (which he defines as those who make more than $200,000).\n \n Low income (poor) people do not have discretionary income (for whatever reason). Thus taking 23% of what they NEED to get by, is harmful to those families/people. Most do not want \"hand-outs\" but they do want to keep what they have earned - just like you. Taxing goods and services gives each person the power to choose how much tax they pay, by the way they \"spend\" their money. \n \n The Fair Tax plan encourages saving, which allows low income people a better opportunity to acquire/build \"wealth\".

Total consumption for the same year was $8.54 trillion, or 38% larger. \n \n Thus the basic building block of the FairTax base - total consumption - is 38% larger than the current tax system's starting point - adjusted gross income.\n \n Taxable income under the current system was $4.22 trillion in 2001, only 49% of total consumption.\n \n Or, stated differently, the FairTax base (total consumption) is more than twice the size of the income tax base (taxable income).\n \n (source: IRS Statistics of Income, Table A, Individual Income Tax Returns, Selected Income and Tax Items for Selected Years, 1997-2001, (available at http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=96586,00.html).\n \n This was the testimony of Congressman John Linder (R-GA) at the House Budget Committee Hearing, Wednesday, October 6, 2004 http://budget.house.gov/hearings/linderstmnt100604.htm\n \n \n \n \nIn a service based economy, such as the one we both live in, tieing taxation to spending seems like a death blow to me.\n\n \n Well, it's not a death blow.

If the Kerry's earn $5 million, and spend $50,000 they will pay the exact same tax as the \"ValiantForTruths\" who earn $100,000 but also spend only $50,000. The Kerry's would only pay more taxes if, they spend more.\n \n If the Kerry's earn $5 million, but decide not to spend more than the poverty level ($18,620 for a married coulple), they would pay ZERO taxes. This is because the tax paid on $18,620 would be $4,283. This amount would be \"rebated\" to the Kerry's in the form of 12 equal payments of $357, thus making their effective tax rate paid as 0%, just like the low income earner. I think you might want to know that receiving this rebate IS optional - ie. the Kerry's (or anyone else for that matter) do not have to sign up for it if they do not want to. If they choose to not receive the rebates, then they would pay 23% and no more. However, should the Kerry's decide to spend $1 million dollars, then they will pay more taxes while receiving additional goods and/or services.\n \n Therefore, this is NOT redistribution of wealth. It is not redistribution of wealth because everyone is treated equally, without exception. It is simply collecting revenue from a different source other than Income, and collecting it from everyone equally - nothing more. If everyone is paying equally, then it can be called \"Fair\". \n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",
