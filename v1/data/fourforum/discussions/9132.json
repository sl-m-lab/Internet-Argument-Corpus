My hope is to bring some \"good news\" about the Church, to even things up...The Priesthood and the Church have suffered much not least on this site and on many of the issues... rightly so.\n \n My hope is simply to remind people that the Preisthood is not corrupt in general but only in minority and that the Catholic Church and the priesthood are working in some very important areas.",

On May 15, Pope Innocent IV issued a papal bull entitled Ad exstirpanda, which authorized the use of torture by inquisitors. It was a common part of the medieval judicial system and not particular to the inquisition. The torture methods used by inquisitors were mild compared to secular courts, as they were forbidden to use methods that resulted in bloodshed, mutilation or death. Also, torture could be performed only once. One of the more common forms of medieval inquisition torture was known as strappado. The hands were bound behind the back with a rope, and the accused was suspended this way, dislocating the joints painfully in both arms. Weights could be added to the legs dislocating those joints as well.\n",
