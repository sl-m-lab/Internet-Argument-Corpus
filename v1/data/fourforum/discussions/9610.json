   "The danger I see with the disease model is that it blames one's \n drinking on this imaginary behavioral disorder. It feeds into the AA \n myth that will power is useless against this \"cunning, baffling \n disease\". It is important to remember that 12-step philosophy \n considers alcoholism to be a disorder of thinking - not a weakness \n of will. As such, it deems thinking for oneself to be a \n manifestation of the disease (stinking thinking / your best thinking \n got you here... etc). \n \n Remember the emphasis that is currently given to \"denial\", the \n imaginary thought disorder that tells you that you don't have a \n disease. I am beginning to realize how important this word is to \n painting a picture of addiction as a form of \"insanity\" based \n on \"delusion\". This, of course, allows them to disregard any real \n mental illness, and pretend that the symptoms of depression, anxiety \n etc are caused by the \"disease\" of alcoholism, instead. \n \n This all plays into the belief that addiction is a disorder of \n thought, rather than an issue of free choice. After all, how can one \n have a choice to quit if they are in denial of having the addiction \n in the first place? I am beginning to see how this notion serves to \n undercut a person's confidence in being able to muster up their own \n resolve to quit on their own. One becomes convinced that all the \n will power and volition in the world cannot overcome a disorder \n of \"stinking thinking\", so why even try? \n \n Pardon the long post, but I want to show how many facets of steppism \n actually follow a very well orchestrated plan. I mean, everytime you \n hear a slogan that discourages independent thought and that \n pathologizes \"self will\", you are experiencing an expression of this \n disease theory, telling you that you have a disorder of thought and \n not a weakness of will or resolve. \n \n This approach covers up conditions which can tax our resolve, like \n dpression, or being unemployed, or being stuck in a dead end job. \n Instead of considering these challeges to one's coping mechanisms, \n and instead of seeing how drinking is used as a way of medicating \n pain, drinking is said to be the result of an \"alcoholic mind\". The \n result? ... everytime you try to deal with your true feelings, you \n are said to be on a \"pity pot\", because emoting is a manifestation \n of indulgent \"self will\" - the cause of all \"character defects\", as \n we all know. \n \n So what? Why this long-winded discourse? I am trying to tie together \n a lot of loose ends here and show that the disease model, with it's \n use of the term, \"denial\", is just a refinement of the original AA \n philosophy, and it is perfectly consistent with every slogan you've \n ever heard in the rooms. It is why I don't think you can reform AA \n to be more sensitive to those with \"dual diagnoses\". It is why AA is \n totally incompatable with a non-disease oriented method of recovery. \n And it is why notions of free will are incongruent with steppism. \n Isn't it ironic that psychologists who should be dealing with real \n mental illnesses induldge in this kind of psycho-quackery that is \n designed to cover up real affective conditions with talk of thought \n disorders? Well, that's enough for one post.",

   "WF\n \n Seems to me you are taking a naturalist's approach to alchoholism, something that may be lacking.\n \n I am not versed in what the disease model is, but it never made much sense to me (based on my understanding of what alchoholism is), and I am not surprised to hear that it may be a redone version of AA. I think I once read a poster who alluded to the possibility that this model had more to do with insurance than anything else. (But I can't completely remember.)\n \n I have heard people testify religiously that AA is the only thing that will work.\n \n On the other hand, I have heard similarly religious testimonies about the nature of some drug addictions (e.g. heroin) only to hear the experiences of real (albeit rare) ex-addicts that run (however) counter to prevailing ideology.\n \n I think that ideology can be obstacles to those needing solutions.\n \n That is not to diminish what may in fact work, or speak as an authority on any of this.\n \n Just that I think your points are pertinent.\n \n (BTW thank you for your clarifications on one the more recent evolution threads.)",
