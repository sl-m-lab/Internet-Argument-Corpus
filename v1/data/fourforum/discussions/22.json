I'm glad I'm able to show up to lend a little assistance, albeit delayed.\n \n first of, guys, since you want to only look at the new testament, I'll ask you to turn to Romans 13. Read it. Especially verse 4: \n \n \"For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.\"\n \n Last time I checked, a sword was used primarily to take life. \n \n all the refrences you give from Jesus are his commands for our personal lives... he in no way meant for those to be the rules of government. Here in Romans, we see that the sword is borne by the State to execute God's wrath upon the evil doers.

Take a look at the life, the works, the teachings, and the heart of Jesus Christ. tell me if He would put somebody to death. the only way you can really support capitol punishment is you would be willing to do it yourself. I'm not saying that you have to go do it, would just have to be willing to if you were every asked. that will never happen, but that's not the point. anyway, I know that Christ wouldn't have done that.

Slavery in that time was not equivalent to an indetured servant if thats what you're referring to. Slavery was absolute. It was slavery, what are you trying to pull? And I am sticking to the subject, you interpret that verse as that nothing changed in the transition to the new covenant. Well things did, period. \n \n \"He wasn't \"going against the law of the day\". He was simply telling the pharisees that they were not guiltless, so they shouldn't go around judging people. The adultress did not kill anyone, she committed adultry.\" - Calli\n \n He was going against the law as much as one can. Capitol punishment is not just the execution of murderers, but the execution of anyone by the state. In that time adultery was punishable by death by law, and Jesus said that law was wrong.\n \n \"We never give them a chance? Guess what happens when people are in prison(or on death row)? Pastors and Ministers come and talk to them and ask them if they want God's forgiveness.\" - Calli\n \n The average life of someone on death row is almost 3 years. You're a very short-sighted person Calli. You don't see something wrong in saying \"Ok God you've got 2 years to get something started in this person before we kill him.\" That's just pathetic. You have no idea of what the Gospel is. You keep spouting this XXXX about \"it only applies to personal lives\". Well what is your decision on whether to support the death penalty? It's personal.",

   "To take this out of religion:\n \n 1. Oh and the death penalty does not deter crime. It is a proven fact. People who commit murder do not engage in probability analysis before they kill.\n \n 2. The death penalty is extremely expensive, the average cost including trial, death row imprisonment, state costs, etc. is 3,200,000 dollars, six times the expense of 60 years in prison. By banishing the death penalt alone California could save 90,000,000 dollars per year.\n \n The major cost of capitol punishment trials are the appeals (I know some of you will bring this up). Limit the appeals so we can put them down quicker and minimize costs. To date Stanford Law School through DNA and case review has PROVEN that 3 innocent people have been put to death, 2 in Mississippi and 1 in Florida. They have only reviewed 36 cases, and 3 for 36 is absolutely appalling. We can't take away a person's only hope when life is on the line, or this number will skyrocket even higher than it is. Thusfar, 48 people have been sentenced to death and then found completely innocent.\n \n 3. The death penalty reduces public safety, imagine what California's police system could do with 90,000,000 extra dollars per year. An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again. Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc. Which would save more lives? Imagine how many lives would be saved if California State Police had 90,000,000 dollars extra to buy bullet proof vests, hire extra policemen, prolong investiations,etc.\n \n 4. The death penalty is arbitrary. National averages in 1997: Black kills white - 20.1% are executed\n White kills black: - 5.7% executed\n White kills black - 2.9% executed\n Black kills black - 0.8% executed\n If this doesn't show that our own personal discriminations and prejudices are intertwined with who lives and who dies I don't know what does. \n \n Income discrimination. Do you think if OJ Simpson would have been a middle class teacher he would have avoided the cahir. Of course not. He bought his way out of death. It goes both ways. Innocent men are convicted because they can't afford a decent lawyer.\n \n Governer Ryan of Illinois, a devout believer in capitol punishment, commuted all something like 120 death row cases down to life after he found that the State prosecution had ACTUALLY WITHHELD evidence that would prove the innocence of men about to die. \n \n It is so incredibly obvious that this system is so intrinsically and inheritantly flawed that there is only 1 thing to be done with it. It should be abolished.",

   "Ok, I'm gonna try to parry every point made against the death penalty from my first post to this one:\n Cool Hand Dave was the first to respond to my post. In it he claims that the sword spoken of in Romans 13 is a metaphor... I agree. But I think it means God gives the civil government the power to punish the people it protects up to the use of that sword. Not every crime is punishable by death (except from God himself.) What is the sword a metaphor for, Dave? Jurisdiction maybe? Authority perhaps?\n \n Next up is thistownwilleat. Thistownwilleat attempts to belittle my reference to Paul by saying he is an inferior source! God spoke through Balaam's XXX. Why do you deny that he's speaking through Paul? Is Paul just giving us his opinion? I think not. Next, thistownwilleat says, \"Paul was writing to the people under the law of the Romans. He states that \"these authorities that exist have been instated under God.\" This statement does not span the ages. Surely you don't believe that Cambodian, Nazi Germany, Iraqian, and Somalian Governments were instated by God and his servant in government. He was addressing a particular people in a particular time. He was telling them to keep in line.\" First, I will point out to you that God judged Germany rather harshly... the other governments are either 1) punishment for the people, and 2) awaiting their imminent demise. But we have wandered far from the point. Thistownwilleat's point is that Romans 13 is not applicable! I'm afraid we cannot adopt such a subjective attitude when it comes to the Bible. This is the Word of God, and it is timeless. To finish it off, thistownwilleat says, \"Paul's word is truly great, but he is only Paul.\" Apparantly, thistownwilleat acknowleges that Paul was great but is unable to give any substance to Paul's words, found in Romans 13. \n \n One post down, thistownwilleat says \"Bottom Line: Before the coming of Jesus Christ our sins were not accounted for, the sentence was to die, there was no forgiveness. Upon the death of Jesus this Old Law changed, we could seek atonement without a lamb or a dove. It's called the new law.\" I agree we now can seek atonement without a lamb or dove. That doesn't mean that the rules have changed! 10 commandments are no longer relevant, I suppose! I'm sure that thistownwilleat makes no such claim, but that is what I infer. \n In the same post, thistownwilleat also says \"And here is another thing: you're not God. Neither is the government. Just because God does something doesn't mean that we can. That's just common sense. You are trying to put yourself on the same level as God, \"well he killed people, so I can to\". You and I both know that's wrong. He has his reasons that you and I can't even begin to comprehend, who are we kidding when we think we can say who deserves to live and die.\n \n Sure God has the right to kill people, he is God after all. But Jesus Christ told us point blank that capitol punishment was downright evil. And you can't dispute that.\" Thistownwilleat (this is getting repetitious, any suggestions on how I can cut it down, friend? :D) reminds us that God is supreme. God can do things that no one else is allowed to do. I assume that thistownwilleat agrees that all power comes from God. \"There is no power but of God.\" (Rom. 13) Therefore, God has the ability to delegate that power. Which he did in Genesis 9:6 \"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.\" (as calligirl has previously stated.) I realize that thistownwilleat doesn't acknowledge the legitimacy of the Old Testament, but I was using this as an example of when God delegated his authority to someone else. Thistownwilleat, and others, are correct when they say that we cannot find a place where Jesus says, \"Governments, Kill murderers.\" However, it was unnecessary. Also as calligirl mentioned (she is stealing all my best points :D), Jesus said, \n \"17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" \n Therefore, unless Jesus says something to the contrary, we may assume that the rules of government still apply. In fact, in vs. 19, thistownwilleat, you will notice that Jesus issues a condemnation of anyone who breaks, or teaches others to break, the law shall be called the least in the Kingdom of heaven. Thistownwilleat, my earnest advice to you is that you study this issue out very carefully before you say that one of God's commandments in the Old Testament is void.",

   "In response to American's request to \"please enlighten me,\" thistownwilleat said this: \"\n \n You have heard it said, an eye for an eye, but I tell you RESIST THIS EVIL, and turn then the other cheek.\"\n \n Summary:\n You've always been told an eye for an eye, but I say that it is evil.\n I'll even prove it and save this woman who should be executed under the Old Law, yes she should be executed but since Christianity is about love and forgiveness and seeing as how much I hate the death penalty I'm going to stand up and face an angry mob of men with stones alone. As if this isn't enough my very last words before I died were to forgive the men who killed me. \n \n The story wouldn't have quite been the same if Jesus's last words were, \"Father, make sure they are dealt with accordingly. An eye for an eye.\"\n \n Again, Jesus is talking to us, not the Government! The government has different rules. If the government was run on the basis of \"turning the other cheek\" America would not be America. Such a state of disorder cannot be what God intended. Thistownwilleat forgot to include the citation for the passage he quoted. It is Matthew 5:38-39. Unfortunately, this verse has nothing to do with Jesus' forgiveness of the adulterous woman. That passage is found in John 8. Thistownwilleat, you are becoming an unreliable source, which I'm sure is not your intention. In addition to that error, you have misquoted the verse. The verse in it's unabridged entirety says, \"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:\n 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" Jesus didn't say that the eye for eye deal was evil... he was instructing us personally to not resist evil.\n \n After American's next response, thistownwilleat says this: \n \n Oh I'm not saying that the govenrment should do away with the death penalty on these grounds, I'm saying that Christian people should oppose it, you said it yourself. In the personal life of a Christian, we turn the other cheek. And I think that there is no question that Jesus was against the death penalty. You show me one place where he even hints that he's not. So far all I've heard is Old Testament and Paul.\n \n If anything, this is a case against personal self-defense, not the government's act of justice. I fail to see how this proves that \"there is no question that Jesus was against the death penalty.\" Thistownwilleat, please show me where Christ says that he IS against the death penalty! In black and white, I want it to say, \"oh, btw, no more death penalty.\" You will be unable to come up with such a passage. \n \n Also I wish to add another correction to thistownwilleat's post. He said: \"Roman law said she should be put to death, Jesus said no, that law is wrong.\" It wasn't Roman law that was being questioned, it was the law of the Pharisees. \n \n Now we break into new ground with fallingupward's post. Falling says:\n \n american, would Jesus take anyone's life? no. Jesus was against the death penalty.\n \n why do conservative christians read and follow the words of paul more than the words of Christ?\n \n Perhaps the correct question is, Why do liberal Christians disregard the Old Testament? Is it because they cannot reconcile their positions unless they ignore it? Why don't THEY read and follow God's Word through Paul? Is it because they cannot reconcile their postitions with what is said by Paul?\n \n After my post, we have calligirl's, and then thistownwilleat again. This time, thistownwilleat conceeds that \"Jesus didn't abolish the law of the prophets, he changed them as necessary when one goes from bearing the full weight of one's sins on their shoulders to having a sviour do it for you.\" How is this inconsistant with the death penalty? Thistownwilleat doesn't specify. Later in the post, thistownwilleat answers one of my previous questions: \n \n And Patriot I believe tha Jesus believed in punsihment, but I think he believed in CONSTRUCTIVE punishment, and the death penalty is anything but destrutive.\n \n My friend, when you sin, you may become a Christian afterwards... but that doesn't free you from the consequences of your bad choices before! You still have to pay the price. The government isn't \"playing God...\" God commanded them to do this! Again, I must point you to Romans 13. In that chapter, Paul calls rulers the ministers of God. They are God for us here on earth. \n \n In closing, I would like to quote a portion from Gary DeMar's excellent book, God and Government Vol. 1, a Biblical and Historical Study. This selection is found on page 98 of this book: \n \n \"The Sermon on the Mount is often interpreted as Jesus' reappraisal of the Old Testament system of law rather than as an evaluation of the application of the law as it was interpreted by the Pharisees. This can be demonstrated by a study of a very familiar, and frequently misunderstood, passage of Scripture. 'You have heard that it was said, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\" But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" (Matthew 5:38-39.) Is Jesus abrogating the law as it is found in Exodus 21:24? Not at all! Rather, He is correcting the Pharisaical misuse of the law. This law as it was originally given served as a standard for the civil authorities in administering civil law. It was not meant to apply to individuals wishing to claim private judgement. 'An eye for an eye\" is not to be used as a liscense for revenge. The Old Testament applies the principle of 'an eye for an eye' to the courtroom, 'as the judges decide' (Exodus 21:22; cf. Romans 12:18f.). So then, as we read the gospels, we should expect Jesus to uphold the validity of the law as it pertains to civil government.\" \n \n \n \n I'll try to keep \"religion\" out of this, thistownwilleat, but unfortunately my beliefs permeate every area of my philosophy. But I will try... :D",

   "Back again!\n \n Falling, I never said that I valued Paul's word over that of Jesus. I just fail to see a conflict between the two. We both agree that Jesus changed things when he came... but he didn't change everything. Therefore, I think we may logically infer that if Christ didn't instruct us to change it, it stays the same! Hence my advocacy of the death penalty. \n I think you also misinterpret Paul, falling. However, this is not the place to do that. If you'd like to discuss the merit's of Paul's teaching, start a thread in \"Religion\" and I'll discuss it with you there. \n And hey man, no offense! I get a little hot myself sometimes. \n \n Thistownwilleat, you are correct when you assess what my argument revolves around. I think there is a difference. I'll try to explain: \n When Jesus is telling us to turn the other cheek, he is telling us to not personally seek revenge. This would advocate the view that says Christians shouldn't seek to defend themselves. I think there is a major difference between me shooting someone who attacks me and the government executing someone. I cannot lay a finger on this person myself. But the government is empowered by God to do so. (you already have all the O.T. references, you don't need them again.) \n I also agree with your assessment of the O.T. when you say, \"I don't discredit the Old Testament...but when the laws of the Old Testament come in direct conflict with the direct words of Jesus Christ, I go with the man that God created implicitly as an example, to show us the way when we are confused.\" Let me choose an example we both agree on: animal sacrifice. Christ replaced the need for animal blood to forgive our sins, cause His blood took it's place. I hold that the Old Testament DOESN'T go against the words of Christ here... specifically because they address two different areas of government. One is self-government, and the other is civil government. That is the distinction. \n \n \"How do you know? You accuse me of misinterpretation and then spout off whatever pops into your mind with absolutely NO biblical base. And what state of disorder do you speak of? Do you honestly that America would fall to anarchy and chaos if we did away with the death penalty? Life in prison is not exactly going to bring out a state of disorder.\"\n \n I did not say that if we did away with the death penalty all by itself we'd fall into a state of anarchy... I said if the civil government was run on the basis of \"turning the other cheek,\" we'd fall into a state of anarchy. What I mean is, that NO punishment would be legitimate. Therefore, the laws would be unenforceable. Therefore, there is no external encouragment to obey them. That, I believe, is anarchy. I'm sorry if I inadequately represented my point, and made you believe I was \"spout[ing] off whatever pops into [my] mind.\"\n \n \"Oh, and thank you for pointing out that the adulterous woman and the \"you have heard it said an eye for an eye...\" were seperate...unfortunately I never made any references that they were together, or had anything to do with each other other than the fact that both showed Jesus's feelings toward the death penalty. So check up on things a little more next time before you start throwing around blind accusations.\"\n \n Hmmm unfortunately, I inferred that you thought they were together because you used them together. My mistake. But you're welcome. I was glad to point it out. I'll do my best to not \"throw around blind accusations.\"\n \n \"Why do you pick and choose what you think is applicable from the old testament? The things that you find relevant and useful are legitimate and you ignore the rest. If it works for your argument, fine, if it doesn't forget about it (as you did in my earlier post).\"\n \n What Old Testament part from your last post did I ignore? I really truly detest people who pick and choose things from the Bible, and since I seek to NOT be a hypocrite, I really try to see the whole counsel of God on a matter. I was unaware of any Old Testament passage that remotely infers that the death penalty is illegitimate. \n \n \"My friend, when you sin, you may become a Christian afterwards... but that doesn't free you from the consequences of your bad choices before! You still have to pay the price.\" - Patriot\n \n Whoa, whoa my friend. yes it does. We call it the forgiveness of God.\"\n \n You are saying there is NO consequences? God forgives us of the eternal consequences, but there are still temporal consequences. For instance, if you were a heavy drinker before salvation, you don't automatically get a new liver when you are saved. Or if you did drugs, that doesn't change the fact that there are consequences for doing drugs. \n \n \"And you speak of making a stretch, that guy DeMar quote is borderline delusional. How many assumptions does it require?\"\n \n None? Did you read the citations? Perhaps my selection was wrong. I advise you to read the book, even if you don't agree with it. DeMar says what I want to say, only I don't have to type it. \n \n \"OK, I believe that Paul was inspired by God, but still a human, you believe in a possession of sorts and that God literally spoke through Paul. Does God believe that women are infererior, should stay quite in church services, and should generally not leave the home? I think not. I believe that Paul was human, and being so he poured some of his flaws into his writings.\"\n \n God does NOT believe that women are inferior, and neither did Paul. If you wish to discuss that, however, I'll have to ask that you take it to another thread. \n \n I'll use this opportunity that I believe that the whole Bible is the inspired Word of God. Remember, even the words of Jesus were recorded by men. If we take your logic about \"pouring flaws into writing\" then how do we know that they didn't pour flaws into their writing? I have to either believe the whole Bible, or not believe it at all. \n \n \"Oh and I guess I am getting a little repititous, maybe it's because no one has answered anything. You skirt and evade.\"\n \n Hehe I was going to say the same thing. :D I thought I was answering your points rather well! I'm sorry if I didn't, I am really trying to. \n \n And last of all, I'll defend Calligirl. Why do you think she is \"self-righteous\"? Maybe she was just encouraging me?",

   "The hundred men and women who have been exhonerated from death row were tried \"thoroughly\", whatever that means, the government was granting them no more appeals, their situation was hopeless. Stanford Law Students took on their cases independently without charge and through DNA and other means proved their innocence unequivocally. These men were tried, appealed numerous times, and STILL found guilty, had it not been for Stanford Law these men would be dead. Just as brutally and horribly murdered as the victims of the crimes except that the we the American people killed them in the name of justice.\n \n Even, more disturbing Stanford re-examined a total of 5 cases in which the accused was already put to death that seemed off to them. 3 were proven innocent through DNA. Murdered by their country.\n \n Yes you're right it is impossible to investigate every single death row case to the extent that it needs to be investigated, so therefore innocent men are being put to death and as long as the system stays they will continue to be put to death. So why? Why waste BILLIONS of dollars on a system in which innocent people die? Whose only cause is to fulfill man's born desire for revenge? The same will be accomplished by locking a man up for life, and cheaper too. Think of the lives that the millions and millions dollars that will be saved if the death penalty was abolished could save. California spends an average of 90 million dollars on death penalties per year. Think of the extra policemen, extra funding, etc that it could provide. Now you tell me which will save more lives? Is it worth the death that an extra policeman could prevent so that we can get our revenge?",

   "The death penalty is hypocritical. As a nation that declares itself civilized and not barbaric we sure do have a lot of violent tendencies. How do you go about justifying a murder? Fight fire with fire? I honestly don't see how capital punishment is beneficial, but it does quell overcrowding which seems to be quite a dilemma in the U.S. However, I find it crude to execute a man in the same manner he's condemned for. Killing someone for murder is nothing but murder. It doesn't justify the perpetrator's wrongdoings; it simply brings about gratification and a fulfillment of vengeance for the victimized families. Therefore, I'm not a proponent of state sponsored murder. It's wrong, it's immoral and it's hypocritical. You can't nullify a murder's hurt by executing the (wo)man who committed the crime. I also can't fathom devout christians condoning execution. Afterall, didn't God decree that vengeance was not man's job? Didn't God also include \"Thou shalt not kill\" to the ten commmandments?\n \n I've often made self-inquiries and have thought and pondered vigorously about the point of execution. At first I thought it was to intimidate young people as a scare tactic to marginalize the numbers of homocides committed, but then looking at statistics I realized this was a fallacy. \n When I was more juvenile I believed it was to bring justice to the criminal who partook in the murder, but then I realized this was infantile and utterly inane. There is no justification in killing a convicted killer. It's retribution and it's a rudimentary mean of avenging someone. It doesn't stifle homocide and it doesn't act as a deterrent to aspiring (lol) criminals. The numbers will vouch for that assertion.\n I think it boils down to overcrowding. It's not more expensive to hold an inmate in prison for life as it is to execute a man. The trial alone is a massive government investment and then comes the execution. Many people contend - and prove - that it's more costly to execute a man or to keep a man on deathrow than it would be to keep him in prison for life. However, what I deduced from this is less murder convictions that lead to death sentences would ultimately have prisons busting at the seams with inmates. Therefore, we resort to inhumane acts as means of regulating the numbers in prison. Sure, there are people out there who believe the death penalty is just and does serve a veritable purpose, but I beg to differ. I really think the death penalty is merely means of cutting down the numbers of inmates in prison. Perhaps ultimately this would be more cost-effective, so we trade a life for money compensation.\n \n I implore for the abolishment of capital punishment and minor capital punishment as well. Another thing you must factor in is that many innocent men are sitting on deathrow. I know our investigators and scientific methods are nearly impeccable but things are botched sometimes, which is why these things must be performed with great fastede. Some people opine that bartering a few innocent souls in the system is okay in the long-run, which I find to be a falsity and a wicked and depreciative statement to those innocents sitting on their proverbial deathbed.\n Many of these innocent people fall into the minority category. Statistically, the number of blacks executed outweigh the number of caucasians by over two-thousand deaths. When this revelation was opened to me I was appalled, but racism is rampant and blacks account for a great preponderance of the death penalties exerted.\n If it's possible I'd go for rehabilitation. Surely, serial killers have some sort of psychological ailment, therefore it has to be reparable in some way. I guess it all depends on the severity of the problem.\n In my opinion, the death penalty is barbaric. I don't care if it's done in a \"humane\" manner. This issue is brimming with hypocrisy and deceit. \n If you can't abolish capital punishment all together at least revoke minor capital punishment which allows sixteen and seventeen-year-olds to be convicted and sentenced to death. What are the only nations that employ this method, you ask? Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Congo, Nigeria and the United States. Surely, we're not that barbaric.",
