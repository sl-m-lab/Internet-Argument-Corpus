Good job to everyone else.\n \n \n \n I will give you a more accurate answer.\n \n There are two competing explanations for the existance of life: abiogenesis and religion. One has evidence and the other has faith. (If I ask supersport to say which is which, he will get it wrong.)\n Theism has no evidence outside of its claims (my signature), and abiogenesis is backed up by a combination of evidence, approximate age of life on earth (i.e. more evidence), and Occam's Razor.\n Here's a more detailed explanation:\n \n \n Abiogenesis is a process by which life is thought to have originated from nonliving chemicals. A simplified description (refrencing this page) is:\n Simple chemicals formed polymers, some of which became replicating polymers. These were stable, so once they were formed, they did not break apart like most formations in a randomly moving group of objects.\n These replicating polymers went through other steps and eventually formed a very simple lifeform.\n \n Evidence for abiogenesis includes the successful formation of amino acids under laboratory conditions and the evidence for a common origin of life.\n \n \n \n On the other hand, religion (fundamentalism, in particular) claims that a deity created all life on earth as is. It does not consider the posibility that life might not require a deity. It is assumed that because life exists (and is \"perfect\"), a deity must have created it.\n \n Fundamentalism does not take into account evidence such as the fossil record, the age of stars, or the processes which could easily explain the existance of things without assuming the existance and action of a deity.\n \n Evidence for fundamentalism includes the logical fallacy featured in my signature.",
