   "This is for Voice of Reason and any other anti-gun nut\n \n Why do you feel it is your responsibilty to preach the guns are bad BS? Why do you want to tell other people how to live? Why does me carrying a gun threaten you so much? Why do you want to take away the average Americans right to protect themselves? Have you ever shot a gun? Have you ever been around them before?\n \n If you do not like guns, then dont have one, nobody is forceing you to have a gun, and I am sure that you can find a neighborhood to live in with people that feel the same way you do. \n \n There is no reason for someone to be afraid of honest people having guns, I am not going to rob you, or shoot you. But I garen-damn-ty-it if I am around you and someone else is pulling a gun or a knife on you with the threat of harm, I will be the one saving your XXX, and not 911 and the cops. I think for the average 911 call to go through it takes like 5 minutes minimum. I can pull out my gun, aim and shoot acuratley in less the 10 seconds, what would you rather have? \n \n I would like you to honestly think about these questions, and answer with your mind and heart, not just some lame guns are bad BS.",

Do you just expect me to ignore that? \n \n \n so you are all for ignoring all the people killed by cars, cigarettes, knives, AIDS, heavy objects, falling accidents, construction accidents, pneumonia, fires, and heart diesease. Heart diesease is the number 1 killer in the US, so why arent you pushing for people to eat better, to exercise more, and stop being so fat? so ill ask again why guns? \n \n \nThe statistics that I've seen indicate that society is better off if the average person does not have a gun. I've only shot a gun at a shooting range. Never owned one and don't intend to.\n\n \n Did you know if it werent fro guns you would not have the freedoms you enjoy today? There is a reason the founding fathers of this country made the right to keep and bear arms the second amendment. It was and is the most important right behind freedom of speech. and without the second, you could not enforce any of the others.",
