   "Representative Gerald Allen (R-Cottondale) is so old school. He is now so concerned about the \"homosexual agenda\" that he is pushing a bill that would prohibit the use of public funds for \"the purchase of textbooks or library materials that recognize or promote homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle.\"\n \n \n \n http://www.polstate.com/archives/006291.html\n \n or from the associated press:\n lawmaker seeking to ban gay marriages also wants to prohibit state money from being spent on any materials or programs that \"recognize\" or \"promote\" homosexuality.\n \n Republican Representative Gerald Allen says --quote-- \"We have a culture that's in deep trouble.\" But Representative Alvin Holmes -- a Democrat -- says Allen's measure was an unconstitutional form of censorship aimed at enhancing Allen's standing with the right-wing conservatives. If the bill became law, public school textbooks could not present homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle, college theater groups would not be able to perform plays like the Tennessee Williams classic \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\" where homosexuality is a theme, and public school libraries could not display books that include lesbianism like Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple.\" Allen says the method of weeding out objectionable material and programs was still to be determined. His bill has been prefiled for action in the 2005 session. \n \n Courtesy: Alabama Associated Press\n \n This has no chance of actually passing, but I find it curious anyway. It completely goes against freedom of speech.",
