   "It's a girl! '06 rings in first baby ; Pierce County's first baby of the new year is an early arrival. The honor brings a pile of goodies\n It was 13 minutes after midnight Sunday morning when Pierce County's first new resident of 2006 came into the world at Tacoma General Hospital.\n \n Aniyah Faythe Watkins weighed in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces and measured 19 3/4 inches from head to toe.\n \n The daughter of Stephanie Kitna, 17, and Aiden Watkins, 20, both of Tacoma, snoozed Sunday afternoon while her mother gratefully examined a bag full of gifts from strangers.\n \n \"Who do I thank for this?\" Kitna asked, awestruck by the generosity of the hospital's booster club for mothers and newborns, which annually packs a present for the first baby of the new year.\n \n \"Oh, how cute,\" exclaimed the new mother as she unfolded a blanket sleeper covered with images of Elmo from \"Sesame Street.\" The pink sleeper was one of several donated to Aniyah, who also received a little red-and-white outfit, diapers, blankets, hand- crocheted afghans and two hand-knitted caps.\n \n Kitna, who is the cousin of professional football player Jon Kitna, said she did not expect to be the mother of the first baby born in 2006. She wasn't due to deliver until Tuesday, she said, and she expected the baby to be late.\n \n But Kitna said her obstetrician wanted to induce labor, so she came to the hospital early Saturday morning and began taking pills. \"I was just really impatient all day. When it came down to it, I started getting nervous,\" the mother said.\n \n The baby's father, paternal grandmother and maternal great- grandmother all attended the delivery. \"I almost fainted. I had to sit down for a minute,\" Aiden Watkins said.\n \n Mother and baby plan to make their home with Kitna's grandmother, Mary Kitna, who will help care for Aniyah. Stephanie Kitna, who has not attended school for several months, said she plans to return to classes so that she can pass a high school equivalency test.\n \n Watkins, who works for Labor Ready, said he is looking forward to the day the baby's mother turns 18 so the couple can live together.\n \n Aniyah already looks a little like her dad, the baby's mother said. \"She has his ears. They look exactly like him. I've been showing everybody that,\" she said.\n \n Is it more civilized today to condone illegitimacy? \n VIRGINIA KENEFICK; Gig Harbor\n Published: January 4th, 2006 02:30 AM \n Civilization is proceeding fast. On Jan. 2, The News Tribune announces with fanfare that an illegitimate baby was the first child born around here this year. \n \n That would never have happened 50 years ago, so we must be getting more civilized. Or not. Who knows, perhaps Prince Charming will marry the girl when she's old enough to vote. And the whole entourage is moving into her parents' house.\n \n I think we should be ashamed of ourselves for condoning this behavior. How are young people today supposed to know what is decent and what is not?\n I'm not just being an old fogey. I asked some young women under 20, and they all thought marriage should come before babies. \n \n Wrong to penalize parents because they're unmarried \n LIZ ANDERSEN; Federal Way\n Published: January 5th, 2006 02:30 AM \n Re: \"Is it more civilized today to condone illegitimacy?\" (letter, 1-4). \n The letter was very disturbing to me. I feel that the article about Pierce County's first baby of the new year in no way, shape or form condoned the act of having a child out of wedlock.\n \n Yes, the parents of the first baby were young, but to deny them the privilege of the first baby because they are not married is forcing 50-year-old ideals of what is right and wrong when it comes to child rearing. If I were to become pregnant and did not want to marry the father, I wouldn't marry him because of a child. There are more options than abortion and marriage. \n \n Instead of stigmatizing, do something proactive \n L. LISA LAWRENCE; Tacoma\n Published: January 8th, 2006 02:30 AM \n There are no illegitimate children, just adults who make mistakes. \n \n I do not believe in irresponsible reproduction, but neither do I believe that it is OK to label an innocent child as \"illegitimate\" (letter, 1-4). Stigmatizing a child is certainly not \"decent behavior\" in my book.\n \n Perhaps rather than name calling, those who are concerned about the issue could do something proactive, such as donating to Planned Parenthood or volunteering time to community programs that mentor young people.",

   "I am confused by why people would make this choice: I see having children as a couple as committing you morally to that child's upbringing, which if you're starting as a couple it's best to stay as a couple to avoid the tug-of-love, children being brought into the pain of the break up etc. In this situation I don't see how you can be committed enough to have kids without being committed enough to get married.\n \n But this is about what marriage means to me. Obviously it means different things to other people: people declare their intention to be together for ever but avoid marriage. So as long as the parents aren't having kids carelessly and without considering their welfare, its OK by me.",
