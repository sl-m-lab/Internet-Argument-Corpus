Just thought I'd bring that up.\n\n I agree that women should screen for gross abnormalities in the fetus so that they can decide whether or not to abort, at least in the first and second trimester, based on the very difficult lives that fetus will end up having as a grossly distorted person. Many women would also not be able to handle being a parent of a severely deformed child. It takes an extraordinarily gifted parent and an accepting community to be able to give such people lives that are not miserable. I perfectly understand women not wanting to subject both the potential new person or themselves to that. However, consistent with my stance on abortion, I think they need to decide before the third trimester. Any abortions for such reasons in the third trimester would have to be for abnormalities that are so awful that it would amount to mercy killing.\n \nOne can live off the other...and if so do you kill the non-dominant one. They didn't say anything in this video but one is more dominant than the other normally. Does the dominant one have the right to kill the other for living off of them?

However, if one wanted to die and if there is a way (ex. through surgery) to do that without harming the other twin, then I would support that right to die.\n \n The right to die is a tricky one. I think people should have the right to kill themselves but I think that there has to be intervention if this decision is not made with sound mind. For example, if the person wants to kill themselves because they are deeply depressed, then I think that the state has the right to force them to live while they get anti-depressive treatments.

Now, since that is an ethical principle, I would assume it to apply to other similar situations as well.\n \n Now, we all expect people to be consistent in their positions.

   "This doesn't solve the question...how do you decide which \"third party\" to go to?\n\n Of course, just as I am sure you would, I would want the third party to hold similar moral beliefs to mine. Namely, that the fetus does not gain rights until the third trimester. That means that, in the first two trimesters, it is only the competing equal rights to that body of the conjoined twins and, in the third trimester, one would take the rights of the fetus into consideration. In the third trimester, I would leave the same exceptions as before, adapted to this unusual situation - i.e. risk to either mother's life or severe risk of health to either (self-defense takes precedence), severe abnormality (mercy killing) or possibly rape or incest. That leaves the first two trimesters where the conjoined twins have equal rights over their mutual body. When rights are equal, you look at other aspects. Once again, I cannot make a blanket statement since the other aspects would depend on their specific situation, which I do not know in enough detail. All I can do is state some factors that could be brought into consideration - for example, how much mental suffering would the pro-life twin suffer if the fetus was aborted, how much mental suffering would the pro-choice twin suffer if the pregnancy was forced, how in the world are they going to take care of it if they disagree about being parents, etc. These are not black and white issues. When equal rights exist, one balances other things and that balance is based on specifics of their case which we do not know and cannot comment on - thus it requires a third party objective (pro-choice, of course) judge. \n \n One thing to keep in mind, though, is that pro-choice is NOT pro-abortion. As a pro-choice advocate, I would defend a woman's right to keep her pregnancy if she wishes just as much as I would defend a woman's right to abort - it works both ways. The only reason we never bring up a woman's right to keep her pregnancy is that neither of our sides contests it, so there is nobody to argue against.",

   "I'm going to assume that you mean conjoined twins rather than Siamese twins. Personally, I cannot simply dismiss these ethical questions on the basis that only \"a dozen such cases\" might exist. I do not think it makes much sense to do that when one is discussing rights. For example, suppose that every person except one in the United States was of religion X, and that the other individual was of religion Y. Would we not still think it is important to respect that one individual's religious rights even though only one such case would exist? I think so. Statistical data is wholly unable to dismiss ethical questions.\n\n I am not saying that these ethical questions should be dismissed entirely. However, there are probably thousands if not millions of ethical scenarios one can discuss - each of which affects SOME people. One has to pick and choose where one puts ones mental energies in terms of which scenarios one wants to concentrate on. The number of people affected by those scenarios help determine which ones we concentrate most on. The main difference I see between the conjoined twins (I thought that was the same as Siamese twins - I could be wrong) scenario and the regular abortion scenario is the problem of addressing what one does when the rights are equal. That is a problem that is encountered in a variety of situations in life, but it is not directly relevant to the abortion debate except for this very rare case. Either way, I did already give an answer, since you seemed to think it important.\n \nSpecifically, I do not think that a principle of bodily ownership can even begin to solve the scenario I raised. You, ultimately, do not hold this to be the justification for abortion, but many people do. \"A woman has a right to own her own body.\" I hear that often. But I don't see how that principle can be applied in this case.\n \n I am of the opinion, actually, that only the pro-life position can address this question in a way that is consistent with itself.\n\n Pro-life position is always easy - never abort. Absolutist positions are the easiest to describe. That does not make them right. As for bodily ownership, I do support a woman's right to her body but, in the third trimester, the fetus's rights also come into play so one does a balance of rights. As I mentioned in my earlier posts here, when (in the early trimesters) the rights to body are equal between the two conjoined twins, then other factors are taken into account, for which we would need to know more specifics.\n \nI may be wrong, but it appears that you are substituting a legal answer to a moral question. Let me try to clarify: you have an ethical principle based on empathy. When applied to abortion, that principle allows a woman to abort up to the third trimester of pregnancy. I am asking how people's individual ethical principles would apply in my hypothetical. In other words, how would you answer my hypothetical. To say that someone else should make the decision simply does not answer the question at hand.\n\n See my response to Steeeve's similar question - post #22. Anyway, I am asking again, how is this particular scenario relevant to the general abortion debate?",

With equal rights, other things tip the balance. For example, if it is not too much of a deal for the pro-abortion twin to continue the pregnancy whereas if the pro-continuation twin would suffer mental collapse if forced to abort, then the judge might rule to continue the pregnancy.
