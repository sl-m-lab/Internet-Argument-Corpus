   "Glad to see the federal government doing their job! \n \n \nAt least seven people, including some from Michigan, have been arrested in raids by a FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana as part of an investigation into an Adrian-based Christian militia group, a person familiar with the matter said.\n \n The suspects are expected to make an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Detroit on Monday.\n \n On Sunday, a source close to the investigation in Washington, D.C. confirmed that FBI agents were conducting activities in Washtenaw and Lenawee counties over the weekend in connection to Hutaree, a Christian militia group. Detroit FBI Special Agent Sandra Berchtold told The Detroit News the federal warrants in the case are under court seal and declined further comment.\n \n Sources have said the FBI was in the second day of raids around the southeastern Michigan city of Adrian that are connected to a militia group, known as the Hutaree, an Adrian-based group whose members describe themselves as Christian soldiers preparing for the arrival and battle with the anti-Christ.\n \n WXYZ-TV reports that helicopters were spotted in the sky for much of Saturday night, and agents set up checkpoints throughout the area. Witnesses told the station that it was like a small army had descended on the area. The Department of Homeland Security and the Joint Terrorism Task Force are also involved in the raids.\n \n Mike Lackomar, of Michiganmilitia.com, said both The Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia and the Michiganmilitia.com were not a part of the raid.\n \n Lackomar said he heard from other militia members that the FBI targeted the Hutaree after its members made threats of violence against Islamic organizations.\n \n \"Last night and into today the FBI conducted a raid against homes belonging to the Hutaree. They are a religious cult. They are not part of our militia community,\" he said.\n \n Lackomar said he was told there were five arrests Saturday and another five early Sunday. The FBI declined to comment.\n \n One of the Hutaree members called a Michigan militia leader for assistance Saturday after federal agents had already began their raid, Lackomar said, but the militia member -- who is of Islamic decent and had heard about the threats -- declined to offer help. That Michigan militia leader is now working with federal officials to provide information on the Hutaree member for the investigation, Lackomar said Sunday.\n \n \"They are more of survivalist group and in an emergency they withdraw and stand their ground. They are actively training to be alongside Jesus,\" he said.\n \n Sources from the Michigan militia community said one of the FBI raids took place Saturday during a wake for a Hutaree member who had died of natural causes. A Hutaree leader was arrested during the wake while at the same time agents were conducting raids at other locations.\n \n The Associated Press is reporting that FBI spokesman Scott Wilson in Cleveland said agents arrested two people Saturday in northwest Ohio. A third arrest was made in Illinois on Sunday, a day after raids in northwest Indiana.\n \n Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on Islamic-American Relations of Michigan, made an announcement Sunday during the group's 10th anniversary banquet about receiving a call from a network journalist about the alleged threat against Muslims.\n \n \"Don't allow this news to scare you away from practicing your faith,\" said Walid.\n \n Audible gaps were heard throughout the banquet hall when the news was announced. Walid said he will call local authorities about more information on the allegations. He urged local Muslims to recommitt themselves to their faith in light of the accusations.\n \n From The Detroit News: \n Seven arrested in FBI raids linked to Christian militia group | detnews.com | The Detroit News \n \n\n \n \n Archie, is that you in the article, cooperating with the authorities?\n \n Ethmi, Did you select the heavy metal piece for the promotional video at their website?\n \n HUTAREE.COM\n \n --------------\n \n These \"Christian\" \"Jesus-led\" terrorists need to be smoked out and Fed X'd up the river!",

Right now he looks at what everyone else is charging and adjusts accordingly. If less milk exists he can charge more. Basically the market maximizes the charge acceptable by the buyers. Now what happens if the state is the only buyer of milk? If the state says \"we will pay $5\" then you either get $5 or you get nothing. Furthermore, the state has no basis on which to come up with $5 since the market is only them. The state might come up with some formula that takes estimated costs plus a pre-determined profit margin. This doesn't help when circumstances change though. Like say slaughtering cows makes the farmer more money so instead of milking they make them steaks (I know you don't do that with dairy cows but whatever). Now you have a milk shortage since demand for milk was the same but less supply existed yet pricing never changed thanks to a formula. The opposite could occur too. You could pay too much and thus have too much milk. The best thing about a free market is you always get a price that reflects what people are willing. to pay and everything adapts automatically. The down side is, this leaves some people without milk. \n \n Anyway, my point is the down side with state-funded healthcare is that prices are much harder to pinpoint and healthcare can suffer or be too expensive as a result. Expand this globally and there is some evidence to suggest that it works if somebody out there has a market rate for the other governments to look at. The US might be the market guideline and countries can adjust accordingly. If that is gone then who knows....but this is just a theory.",

   "The problem with state-funded healthcare is the problem you have with anything that is paid for by one person; you don't know what is best. \n \n For example, how much should a dairy farmer charge for a gallon of milk? Right now he looks at what everyone else is charging and adjusts accordingly. If less milk exists he can charge more. Basically the market maximizes the charge acceptable by the buyers. Now what happens if the state is the only buyer of milk? If the state says \"we will pay $5\" then you either get $5 or you get nothing. Furthermore, the state has no basis on which to come up with $5 since the market is only them. The state might come up with some formula that takes estimated costs plus a pre-determined profit margin. This doesn't help when circumstances change though. Like say slaughtering cows makes the farmer more money so instead of milking they make them steaks (I know you don't do that with dairy cows but whatever). Now you have a milk shortage since demand for milk was the same but less supply existed yet pricing never changed thanks to a formula. The opposite could occur too. You could pay too much and thus have too much milk. The best thing about a free market is you always get a price that reflects what people are willing. to pay and everything adapts automatically. The down side is, this leaves some people without milk. \n \n Anyway, my point is the down side with state-funded healthcare is that prices are much harder to pinpoint and healthcare can suffer or be too expensive as a result. Expand this globally and there is some evidence to suggest that it works if somebody out there has a market rate for the other governments to look at. The US might be the market guideline and countries can adjust accordingly. If that is gone then who knows....but this is just a theory.\n\n \n You might want to rethink your milk example. The price of milk is fixed by the government.\n \n\n ....\n Consumer Level\n Several States regulate either the wholesale or the\n retail prices of fluid milk products, or both. States differ\n in the regulation of resale prices-some set minimum\n prices, some set maximum prices, and some set\n both minimums and maximums. For example,\n Pennsylvania essentially sets minimums at every market\n level for milk produced and marketed in the State.\n Minimum prices are set at a stop-loss level (conditions\n based on the estimated average cost of production),\n and market prices are generally above them. Other\n States, such as Nevada, set prices that retailers must\n pay for milk, but do not restrict the price the retailer\n charges consumers. State milk pricing regulations are\n much less prevalent than they used to be.\n http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib761/aib761c.pdf\n",

But one chapter of the tale remains a blank - his education at Columbia College, a place he rarely speaks about and where few people seem to remember him.\n \n Contributing to the mystery is the fact that nobody knows just how well Mr. Obama, unlike Senator McCain and most other major candidates for the past two elections, performed as a student.\n \n The Obama campaign has refused to release his college transcript, despite an academic career that led him to Harvard Law School and, later, to a lecturing position at the University of Chicago. The shroud surrounding his experience at Columbia contrasts with that of other major party nominees since 2000, all whom have eventually released information about their college performance or seen it leaked to the public.\n \n For better or worse, voters have taken an interest in candidates' grades since 1999, when the New Yorker published President Bush's transcript at Yale and disclosed that he was a C student. Mr. Bush had never portrayed himself as a brain, but many were surprised to learn the next year that his opponent, Vice President Gore, did not do much better at Harvard despite his intellectual image. When Senator Kerry's transcript surfaced, reporters found that he actually had a slightly lower average at Yale than Mr. Bush did.\n \n Some political observers cite such disclosures as proof that candidates' intelligence cannot be judged solely by their political careers or the schools they attended. Grades provide a rare measure of intellect that is immune to political spin, proponents say.\n \n \"We like to pretend IQ doesn't matter, but it really does with a lot of jobs, including the presidency,\" a professor at Smith College who studies the effects of human intelligence on the economy, James Miller, said. \"We can't trust the information that candidates give us, so it's important to look for objective data that they can't falsify or distort.\" Obama's Years at Columbia Are a Mystery - September 2, 2008 - The New York Sun\n \n As you can see from this article, even though sanctimonious leftists like you continue to attack George Bush's intelligence, he scored a higher grade point average than both Gore and Kerry whom you have no qualms at all about claiming their superior intellect to Bush and any other conservatives we hold up for comparison.

The shroud surrounding his experience at Columbia contrasts with that of other major party nominees since 2000, all whom have eventually released information about their college performance or seen it leaked to the public.\n \n For better or worse, voters have taken an interest in candidates' grades since 1999, when the New Yorker published President Bush's transcript at Yale and disclosed that he was a C student. Mr. Bush had never portrayed himself as a brain, but many were surprised to learn the next year that his opponent, Vice President Gore, did not do much better at Harvard despite his intellectual image. When Senator Kerry's transcript surfaced, reporters found that he actually had a slightly lower average at Yale than Mr. Bush did.\n \n Some political observers cite such disclosures as proof that candidates' intelligence cannot be judged solely by their political careers or the schools they attended. Grades provide a rare measure of intellect that is immune to political spin, proponents say.\n \n \"We like to pretend IQ doesn't matter, but it really does with a lot of jobs, including the presidency,\" a professor at Smith College who studies the effects of human intelligence on the economy, James Miller, said. \"We can't trust the information that candidates give us, so it's important to look for objective data that they can't falsify or distort.\" Obama's Years at Columbia Are a Mystery - September 2, 2008 - The New York Sun\n \n As you can see from this article, even though sanctimonious leftists like you continue to attack George Bush's intelligence, he scored a higher grade point average than both Gore and Kerry whom you have no qualms at all about claiming their superior intellect to Bush and any other conservatives we hold up for comparison. The fact is that your ilk constantly lies to yourself as you claim the left is ineffectually superior to conservatives when they in fact cling to philosophies and policies which have failed every time they have been attempted.\n\n \n \nMy! My! My! What a huge amount of hatred for a person who says he's \"in the company of the master.\" One wonders which master. Does the master burn red with with heat and carry a triton?\n\n \n Is this what you call refuting a post which offers evidence in support of an argument? Have you liars nothing real to offer in order to defend your position other than attacking my relationship with Christ? I mean, if I'm so wrong, it should be easy for you to actually prove it rather than just throw out ignorant and hate based snipes. And while you're at it, show me what I said that was a huge amount of hatred, I reposted my post for you and everything. emoticon_rolleyes",

Most people don't switch churches because of a few words the minister said that they disagree with, at least not round here.\n\n \n Wright's church has a culture and history of black liberation theology which promotes racism and separation between the races. It is an abhorrent theology which seeks to separate rather than unite the races. And he stayed in that church for 20 years, until \"Liberation Theology\" was exposed as a racist school of thought so we are dealing with much more than one or two comments here, but 2 decades of comments in a church that has mixed black muslim theology with a luke warm christian interpretation. Obama proves his hypocrisy by having stayed in such a church until its racist roots were exposed for all the world to see.

And if you can supply stats on incest, would you then please produce stats that it is occurring in republican families rather than democrats? Because it is well known that democrats are the most ignorant among us since by their complete political world view they continue to promote the same policies which have always failed.

   "Well, you're wrong. I paid my way through college, majored in something that I knew I could make money doing and took risks like relocating.\n\n You acknowledge taking risks - and they happened to pay off. If they hadn't, after all that hard work, would it have been your fault? What about all the unfortunate events that could have derailed you if they had happened - the kinds of events that undoubtedly have derailed others?\n \nAdd to that several patents, publications and an acknowledged industry-wide expertise in a chemistry niche after 25 years in the field and your concept of \"luck\" doesn't apply. IMO, calling someone's hard work to become successful \"luck\" is degrading to those that earned their way in life.\n\n Oh, absolutely, and I apologise if I gave that impression. I don't for one moment want to downplay the importance of hard work and dedication.\n \n Let me backtrack a bit and clarify: I don't believe in enforced equality. On the other hand, the undeniable role chance plays in all our lives prevents me endorsing raw sink-or-swim capitalism either. I don't even believe there is a definable one-size-fits-all 'happy medium'. \n \n What I believe is that the role of government ought to adapt to the prevailing circumstances: I think there are times when inequality is so great, and so difficult and slow for the free market to close, that it is not only more humane but in the long term better for everyone for that inequality to be reduced through policy and legislation. I personally think healthcare and education are key levelers of the playing-field: inequality there can easily overshadow the other differentials - like the dedication and hard work you are rightly proud of - which are deserving of reward.\n \n I also believe the complexity and interdependency of the global free market is at present too great to be rationally understood, and free market decisions must be rational in order for the system to function safely unsupervised. The recent banking collapse, which has heaped a generation of financial misery on billions while the instigators, by and large, parachuted to safety, can be directly attributed to such inevitable shortsightedness. \n \n Yes, it's self-correcting: as we speak financial models are being re-written. But the re-write won't incorporate an assumption that the rewrite is also wrong in some way - do you understand what I mean? Without some cautionary legislative grit in the gears, we'll be full steam ahead towards the next 'unexpected' global collapse.",

I went to the photo galleries of Der Spiegel and browsed thru so many WWII photos of Germany in ruins, most of them poignant, sad really. Specially some of them aftermath of the firestorm attack on Dresden, in February, 1945 and the strafing survivors of the initial bombing who were massed on the city&#8217;s riverbanks. From some thirty miles away, Gerhard Richter one of my favouriite painters, as a boy of thirteen, witnessed the glow in the night sky of Dresden&#8217;s immolation. His \"Mustangs\" paintings refer to that massacre of civilians.\n \n \n I met a German in Adelaide who was posted at Normandy on that day, and being experienced in combat, when he saw the ships he skipped breakast for it is no good to have food in your stomach if you get a gut shot. I told him any gut shot is bad for your stomach.\n \n He survived that day, of course, and was the following year taken prisoner in Germany.\n \n Isn't it great that Germany hasn't been involved in any war since, apart from being dragged by the US into Afghanistan ?\n \n emoticon_xbye",
