These countries were very vocal in the fact that they did not support the coalition in Iraq, but they now want to benefit economically from the rebuilding contracts. Bush has even called these countries to ask them to forgive Iraq's debt to them, however they all refuse to do so. It seems to me that if these countries had any interest in helping Iraq get back on it's feet and established as a respectable country, they would forgive these debts as a show of good will. Their refusal to help Iraq shows that they are only interested in putting money into their own economy, at the expense of the American taxpayer.",

   "I can't believe that they expected a piece of the rebuilding money... but they did. If these people even went to Iraq, they'd probably be attacked verbally or even physically trying to do work because they're the ones who kept Saddam in power... who sold the guns and bullets that mowed so many Iraqis down? France and Russia. Who built the WMD facilities that allowed production? France. Who sold the Iraqis bioractors in 1996? Germany. Who bought the oil that kept Saddam in power the whole time? France and Russia got 56%, China got a large piece too.\n \n What great friends we have in the world. They can still get on that list, they just need to send troops or money. This is a great decision... I really don't want a former ally like France getting any of our money (and I know someone will attack that, but only 33% of Americans still consider France an ally).",

But I too think that these others should at least have forgiven the debts. I agree that these particular countries (France Russia and Germany) have given nothing in the way of support for the Iraqi people, regardless of the US involvement.

   "If France makes Iraq pay, we make France pay. They still owe us some money from WW I that has 70 years interest on it, and it's more than Iraq owes them... if they want to make Iraq pay I want to make France pay.\n \n The Germans and Russians will probably forgive the debt even with this. They both kind of expected it... and Germany has been kind of quietly cooperating the whole time because the Chancellor just bashed us to win the election. He really wants on our good side because we're ready to close some bases and give some cold stares...\n \n Japan was owed the most, and they'll forgive most of it for sure. Even if France and Germany insist on repayment, the Iraqis can probably get around it with their new government. I imagine the talks will be something like \"cut 2/3s of it or we're not paying any of it.\"",

If they want Bush to reconsider I'm sure they have to but offer up a few troops to help in Iraq and forgive the Iraqi debt which I don't expect to see the new Iraqi government pay anyways. France of course will never let it come to this but I think there is some hope that the other three will eventually come around leaving France isolated and alone.",
