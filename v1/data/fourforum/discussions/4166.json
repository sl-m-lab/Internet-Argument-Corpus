A similar quote to \"The second amendment ain't about duck huntin'\", but stated in a court opinion, in fancier talk. By people in robes who really know the law.

If the NRA wants to adopt that system, it would be fine with us.' \"\n http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/guns2w99.htm\n\n _________________________\n \n Hi, everyone!\n \n I'm a new member and I would be happy to correspond with anyone on this list, either on-list or off-list.\n \n As for the original message from VOR, I would like to add that it is always wise to consider the source of your information. Handgun Control, Inc. is unlikely to be an accurate or unbiased source of information on this issue.\n \n Nancy Hwa's taunt regarding the \"sealed tin\" and the \"fact\" that the citizen must account for every \"bullet\" (more properly, each cartridge) is simply inaccurate. The issued rounds do not usually come in a sealed tin, but in hermetically sealed paper and tinfoil pouches, much the same as some food packaging. Of course, it also has a criss-crossed string tied around it and FIRMLY knotted--which is the part of the packaging that stops the criminals from using the ammo for murders, rapes, and robberies! :) I have personally purchased Swiss surplus military ammo in California, packaged as I described. The standard amount of issued ammo for the Swiss Assault Rifles (genuine fully automatic rifles, or what we would call \"machine guns\", not semi-auto rifles) is one magazine load (the reserve soldier would be expected to use that one magazine to fight his way to his duty station, where more ammo would be available), which varies with the caliber. The older 7.5x55mm Swiss caliber was issued in quantities of 24, because that was the number of rounds in one magazine of the SIG PE 57 and the SIG AMT rifles. The current SIG (Schweizer Industrie Gesellschaft) rifle, the Type 551 (5.56x45mm caliber, same as NATO), has a 30 round magazine, so the issue ammunition is provided in blocks of 30. The so-called \"sealed tin\" is not generally issued to individuals but to military units, as it contains hundreds of rounds. This poses no obstacle to criminals whatsoever, since these are common calibers that can be easily purchased in large quantities in almost any town in Switzerland--so the touted \"accountability\" is purely an illusion rather than a deterrent to crime.\n \n Citizens are expected to practice on their own so that they can pass the qualifying test once a year, and they can also use their issue rifles to enter competitions if they wish, since that would improve their skills without any effort on the part of the military. There are high quality, government maintained 300 meter ranges all over the Swiss landscape, which can be used for free or for a nominal fee. Just pay for your own ammo.\n \n The Swiss are allowed to buy almost any type of firearm for personal use and in most of the Cantons (Swiss states), it is legal to carry a concealed handgun with an easy-to-obtain permit. A few years ago, the Swiss military changed their anti-aircraft defense system from a gun-based network to a missle-based network, which left them with hundreds of surplus Bofors 40mm (that's a 1.6\" bore diameter, which is really big) fully automatic anti-aircraft cannons and zillions of rounds of high-explosive and armor-piercing ammo. They sold all of it to the public. Pretty tough gun control.\n \n A girlfriend of mine visited some business associates in Switzerland a few years ago and took pictures of the firearms that were privately possessed by a single family of 4 people. 1 government issued SIG Type 57 fully auto assault rifle (7.5x55mm Swiss), 5 privately owned machine guns, 7 hunting and target rifles, 4 shotguns, and 6 handguns. Nice collection, and these were just ordinary people. When the Reserve soldiers leave the service (at age 45-50 or so), they are allowed to purchase their issued rifle at a greatly reduced price, so many of them do so.\n \n Even if you only counted the currently issued fully automatic rifles (machine guns) and the older rifles owned by retired Reserves, and ignored privately purchased firearms , any criminal in Switzerland can figure this out: \"If I need a firearm to commit a crime, I can find one by breaking into almost any home in Switzerland which has a resident of military age.\" Pretty tough gun control, right Ms. Hwa?\n _________________________\n \n Randall N.
