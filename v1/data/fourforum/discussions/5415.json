Students are taught at a young age that A's are good and if they get high grades they are good.

However if you're taught a wide curriculum, then inevitably there'll be subjects where children are bored, seeing as not every subject appeals to everyone (I still don't see the appeal of chemistry for example, despite 5 years of studying it). No matter how it's taught, some people will still find some subjects very tedious and boring. In these subjects, children will just cram, get the good grade and drop the subject asap. Without narrowing the curriculum (and as such education in general), this will continue to be the case. Personally, I prefer a wide curriculum with some boring parts.\n \n That said, without tests, it'd be hard to regulate schools.\n \n -Wez",

The one thing they can do is give teachers a lot of freedom for the curriculum so they can take a topic the way that interests the class. Sure there are 25-30 kids in each class and there's no pleasing everyone.\n \n \n In terms of tests what exactly do you mean by regulate? Why is it important?\n \n I'll get back to you when you answer that, I'm just not entirely sure what you mean.",

I would say that this should be the responsibility of the parent. There should be a lot more communication between teachers and parents than there is now (pretty much now the only communication is through report cards). If it was clear that one school and/or teacher really didn't know what he/she was talking about or needed more help it should be brought to attention and dealt with. I mean really how much regulation is there now? Until NCLB we just gave kids F's when taking standardized tests which really didn't help much. NCLB is the right idea (sort of) but they focus too much on tests. We need real communication. Teachers cannot communicate a child's ability in a subject with one letter, the problem is that we would need to lower the teacher:student ratio which would cost money, and that's one thing we aren't doing.",
