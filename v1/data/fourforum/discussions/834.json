   "For those who have studied the men who wrote the Consitution along with the document itself, the meaning of their words are easily understood if we are simply honest with ourselves. For those of us who cared enough to study the nuances of the English language during the late 18th century things become even clearer. \n The meaning of the word militia can easily be found within the words and other writings of the very men who wrote and ratified it as well as other political figures of their time and more recent times. \"Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officials.\" George Mason, June 16th, 1886. \n A Supreme Court ruling in 1886 simply reinforced what every Founding Father said about it when first ratified. \"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the states......\" Patrick Henry made a statement nearly identical to Mr. Mason's when asked about what definition of \"militia\" they intended. \n I could easily go on for hours qouting statements made only by the Founding Fathers reinforcing this defintion of militia, After many years of attempting to find one voice of disagreement among the Founders on this issue, I have yet to read the first. I have also never found a Supreme Court ruling prior to the 20th century that even hinted at a different meaning. Enough said.\n Well regulated has a meaning that would have the average liberal quaking in their boots. Unfortunately, you can ask any friend you may have that lives in Switzerland and they can tell you the meaning of our own Amendment when the average American cannot. How you ask? They copied the idea of the Founders and actually use it to this day.\n Folks, put simply the govt. has an obligation to see that all able bodied men are trained and ready to defend the United States if need be. That's right, the Founders wanted a citizen Army that was both well trained and well armed. If you understand the then popular uses of the term \"regulated\" and the Founders desire to avoid a large standing Army this definition is the only one that is even close to logical. \n Many opponents of the Second Amendment like to point out that the term can also refer to keeping tabs on the people who have arms. This defintion is completely illogical as the idea of this kind of gun control had never been hinted at prior to this time or for that matter in the almost 100 years AFTER it. To subscribe to this idea you would have to believe that people as a whole simply decided to avoid discussion of this portion of the Second Amendment for, oh say, several decades. This is laughable. \n Finally there are the people who argue \"that the security of our free state\" is no longer dependent upon a militia. While this is an argument it is also an admission that the Second Amendment means exactly what pro gun forces have been saying for decades. And, with due respect, I and many others I know would disagree. If America's security was dependent upon such a thing at a time when traversing the Atlantic ocean was a long, inefficient, and very often deadly undertaking in and of itself, it is certainly more necessary now in our world of trans continental flights.\n This generally covers the portions of the Second Amendment that are most often disputed. If you don't like the Second Amendment that is your right, but be honest about it. To many liberals who despise the Second hide behind twisted definitions and misinformation rather than admit they disagree with the men who wrote it.\n In conclusion, here are a few more words from the men who know best \"what they meant\". \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped.\" Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist 29. \"A free people ought to be armed.\" G. Washington Jan. 7th..Boston Chronicle. Enough said",

   "Enough said\n\n \n Anti-gunners don't care. They want ALL the guns not matter what is historically correct. Men who lived during the birth of this country were made of a much different metal than liberal anti-gunners today. What once considered a persons responsibility and own personal domain has been superceeded for \"collective good\" and what is \"benefit to society\". Never mind that democracy is fragile and that the majority of all living humans past and present has lived not as free men. Never mind that that those lessons and hard won freedoms are traded away for the convience of state care and protection. Yes horrific crimes are commited with firearms, but they are commited by evil men. Good and evil can be equally acomplished by a firearm. Never mind that evil men commit evil acts and good men can do good with the same firearm. What matters most to anti-gunners is that the evil and the good should be punished together for the common good of society.",

Default back to the Constitution:\n \n http://www.arng.army.mil/history/Constitution/default.asp?ID=5\n \n \"The Second Amendment qualified Article I, Section 10 by making insuring that the federal government could not disarm the state militias. One part of the Bill of Rights, insisted on by the anti-federalists, states, \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n \n The whole point is to not disarm the citizens. When the Federal Government can give orders to the National Guard it does not serve the purpose of protection from the Federal government. The National Guard is a defacto extension of the Department of Defense. They wear the same uniforms. They train together. They play golf together. The laws that enact the National Guard call for more cooperation between states and Federal government; and they spell out the conditions that states will give up authority to the Federal government, but they do not give up the right of the citizens to give up their arms.\n \n \"The Militia Act of 1792 subsequently expanded federal policy and clarified the role of the militia. It required all able bodied men aged 18 to 45 to serve, to be armed, to be equipped at their own expense and to participate in annual musters. The 1792 act established the idea of organizing these militia forces into standard divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions and companies, as directed by the State legislatures.\"\n \n Look at the spirit of the law. It emphazies that every man will be responsible for his own training and equipment. Citizens are responsible for their own well being. Good citizenship is part of being responsible and taking care of yourself. Expand the philosophy of good citizenship to today. It means that every citizen is responsible for thier own protection from crime. It is not your neighbors, the city, state, or federal governments responsibility to protect you. All the above can do thier part to protect you from violent crime, but it the end it is your own responsbility.",
