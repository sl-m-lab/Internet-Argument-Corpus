   "Condoleezza Rice accused Iran of terrorism support and by this way made a hard unforgivable of her political rank mistake imo. Obviously she is trying to push vacillating Bush to the aggression against Iran. Well, if Bush yields to it, USA will fall into new war with huge losses. Americans soldiers will die for Cheney, Rice and Ramsfeld's ambitions! It is time to stop! We have got enough of dead guys!",

   "Eh, I think that Rice needs instead of Iran accusation to find the source of terror threat among our allies, I guess. No kidding! These are facts. Look, GB is our major ally in Europe but created the most favored conditions both for Islamite radical organizations of all sort and their separate reps. We've been at pains to get abu Hamza out from GB during the last 3 years (he was a participant in 9/11). What do you think about the arrest of three British who prepared act of terrorism in States? I think it's much more important than Iran problem. While we will be fighting Iran Muslims may well blow up the White House! Ms. Rice, please think about it!",

   "Iran is and has been the foremost sponsor of terrorism since the Shah was overthrown. Iran is ruled by a thugocracy and its government is hated by the younger people most of which have been born since the revolution. The sooner they go the better it will be for all of us. One could argue that the REAL reason for the invasion of Iraq was to apply pressure on iran.",

We have the most draconian Terrorism Laws outside of a dictatorship. \n \n On the issue of Abu Hamaza, he wasn't a participant in 9/11. He does have links to terrorist organisations and that is what he has been arrested for. We also have this pesky thing called Rights and it is up to the Americans to present the evidence that would prove that Hamaza committed crimes that effected the US. Would the US just extradite someone without due process ?\n \n So if you are going to criticise any party in this situation then blame the US for not presenting credible evidence.",
