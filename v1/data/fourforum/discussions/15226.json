That's why states are in competitive a bidding wars against each other. It's not unusual for the states to offer inducements at significant the cost of their taxpayers, to compete in bidding wars to attract corporations.\n \n Most often after accepting the state's costly considerations, the corporations do not deliver the promised jobs.
