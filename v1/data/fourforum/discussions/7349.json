   "OK - Let's recap.\n \n It started here.\n \n \nI believe some religious morals should be in politics, suchs as dont murder.\n\n \n Which infers that we have a law against murder because of religion. I disagree and say so here:\n \n \nLaws against murder have valid secular arguments. Don't flatter yourself, it has nothing to do with your religion.\n\n \n Then you say:\n \n \nIt's called the ten commandments, it has a lot to do with my religion.\n\n \n And I responded.\n \nJust because your religion's rules align with valid secular law, does not mean that your religion is the reason for the law.\n\n \n \n Then you on to say these things:\n \nYou said that murdering had nothing to do with my religion, that is bullcrap i dont get it, the ten commandments were laws set in stone from God through Moses. WE believe it and your saying it has nothign to do with my religion.\n \n I know, I said it because that law is so blatantly obvious and is part of the Christian religion, and then you said it had nothing to do with my religion, and that is false.\n\n \n \n At no point am I telling you that no-murder rules are in the Bible (I know they are, I have read it cover to cover). I am saying the fact that they are in the Bible is not the reason the also exist in US law. There are SECULAR reasons for the law.",

The goverment structure is actually closer to what those Roman pagans had going on.\n\n All of the founding father had a religion, whether they were diest or soem form of Christianity.\n \n Patrick Henry: \"It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason peoples of other faith have been afforded asylum, prosperity and freedom of worship here.\" \"The Bible is worth all other books which have ever been printed.\"\n \n John Adams: \"We have appointed a continental fast. Millions will be upon their knees at once before their great Creator, imploring His forgiveness and blessing; His smiles on American councils and arms.\"\n \n John Adams Regarding the Age of Reason: \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard [scoundrel, rogue] Paine say what he will.\" and again later to John Paine: \"The people of New England, if you will allow me to use a Scripture phrase, are fast returning to their first love. Will you excite among them the spirit of angry controversy at a time when they are hastening to amity and peace? I am told that some of our newspapers have announced your intention to publish an additional pamphlet upon the principles of your Age of Reason. Do you think that your pen, or the pen of any other man, can unchristianize the mass of our citizens, or have you hopes of converting a few of them to assist you in so bad a cause?\"\n \n Benjamin Franklin: History will also afford frequent opportunities of showing the necessity of a public religion...and the excellency of the Christian religion above all others.\n \n John Quincy Adams: \"So great is my veneration for the Bible that the earlier my children begin to read it the more confident will be my hope that they will prove useful citizens of their country and respectable members of society. I have for many years made it a practice to read through the Bible once every year.\"\n \n U.S. Grant: \"The Bible is the sheet-anchor of our liberties.\"\n \n Andrew Jackson: \"That book, sir, is the rock on which our republic rests.\"\n \n Robert E. Lee: \"In all my perplexities and distresses, the Bible has never failed to give me light and strength.\"\n \n Abraham Lincoln: \"I believe the Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man. All the good from the Saviour of the world is communicated to us through this book.\"\n \n Samuel Adams, \"Father of the American Revolution\" (to Britain) \"We again make our solemn appeal to the God of heaven to decide between you and us. And we pray that, in the doubtful scale of battle, we may be successful as we have justice on our side, and that the merciful Saviour of the world may forgive our oppressors.\"\n \n George Washington: \"You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. Congress will do everything they can to assist you in this wise intention.\"",
