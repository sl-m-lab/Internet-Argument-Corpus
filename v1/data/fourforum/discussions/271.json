   "I never really understood this debate. It should be obvious to anyone; the two theories do not necessarily negate each other. I can see how people would want to refute the volumes of asinine claims made by creationists. That much I understand. What I don't get is this idea that the science of evolution negates the belief in creation. I my view, the existence of life, and it's ability to adapt and reconfigure itself into more feasible forms, only adds to the evidential arguments for the existence of god. The fact that we can get order from chaos, and that patterns of symmetry can persist, despite the odds, lends credibility to the idea that the universe is a product of grand design. Why those who like the idea of creation would be so willing to throw out evidence to support their claim is beyond me. Maybe if the literalists actually took the bible literally they could deduce that evolution does not threaten their belief system.\n \n \n What I hate most is the icon war that is ensueing on the back of people's cars. You know, the Darwin fish, the Jesus fish, and one fish swallowing the other. I have the best answer to this idiotic battle. I am going to get the 666 fish to XXXX off the avid bible beater. I actually saw one of those, but I have yet to find it anywhere. If you know where I can get one, let me know.\n \n \n This Genesis Project is more interesting to me than this tired old debate, which has been ongoing for years.",

   "I think that the reason so many people get soo caught up in this pointless battle is because of the sheer number and ludicrousness of the creationists claims. Many people have no idea of the scientific method, or how to asses a scientific article, so they are easily taken in by the circular logic and slick rhetoric that, along with quote mining, form the larger part of the creatiosist reportoir. I think this really annoys scientists and individuals with a *real* intrest science because all the hard work, dedication and honesty they put into their work is pushed aside by creationists with glib, meaningles phrases. \n \n The last straw for me was when a local group was pushing to get creationism taught in our high schools in my town. They may start off as just an \"scientific alternative to evolution\" (though no creationist has ever been able to provide me with the \"Scientific Theory Of Creationism\") but the impact would be terrible for all of science. \n \n Literal creationism directly contradicts modern geology, cosmology, astronomy and paleontology, just to name a few fields. Should astronomy students in college ignore the fact that the light from distant stars could only have reached us after billions of years, and taught instead that the light was created \"in transit\" to create the illusion of an ancient universe? Besides being incredibly bad science (science should always build the theory to fit the data, and not merely \"adjust\" the data to fit the theory), this kind of rhetoric reduces the Creator to a cosmic trickster who can't be trusted.\n \n Most scientistst, even evolutionary biologists, aren't athiests at all. If anything, the idea that all the beauty and complexity around us could have come from primordial cells *strengthens* my faith.\n \n \n\n You know, the Darwin fish, the Jesus fish, and one fish swallowing the other. I have the best answer to this idiotic battle. I am going to get the 666 fish to XXXX off the avid bible beater. \n\n \n LOL! Well, if you find one, do let me know where you got it.\n \n Sheryll",

   "i don't see how you could possibly even compare evolution and creationism. one is a theory, backed up by evidence, and like any theory in science, is not completely flawless or has all of its elements fully explained yet. the other is not a theory, but rather is a completely irrational, baseless, religious assertion. notice how creationists have nothing to say to back up their own belief; all they ever do is attack evolution.",

   "Although I do not see the credibility of the arguments made by creationist, for they are often invalid and unsound, I understand the philosophical argument for a first mover. The similarity in the problems laid out in the cosmological argument for the existence of god and the problems of big bang theory should not be ignored. Both explanations have difficulty rectifying the problems their theories have with the law of causality. The belief in an origin seems to defy logic.",
