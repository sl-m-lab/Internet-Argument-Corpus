These supposed fanatics think they're being cute with an run-around on birth control.\n \n Wait, though. Because someone is going to be seriously maimed or will die because of this. When that happens there will be a massive lawsuit and watch how fast these companies that allow the pharmacists to \"conscienciously object\" to handing out certain prescriptions will change their tune once that happens.",

   "It does nto matter if they pass this or not. Wyoming uses the American Pharmacists Association standard (as do 39 other states) including thier ethics standards. Under APhA ethics standards, a pharmacist may refuse to fill is prescription if they find it personally morally objectyionable to do so. Codifying it seperatley does NOTHING. Pharmicists in Wyoming have always had the right, and likely always will have the right, to refuse to fil prescriptions they find objectionable for moral or religous purposes.\n \n Pharmacists are not doctors. They have the right almost everywhere in the country to choose what they are and are not willing to dispense. \n \n I particularly like this part:\n \n \nIn some states, pharmacists have refused to give patients doctor-prescribed medication and have refused to transfer prescriptions to other pharmacists or return them to customers\n\n \n This has happned 3 times. The pharmacist who did it lost his license.\n \n The right for pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions that they find objectionable has laready been through the courts and the courts found that they do have the right to refuse to fill it if the delay in filling it would not put the customers life in immediate danger. This has been ruled on in every district and the Supreme court has repeatedly refused to hear any cases. \n \n It has been tested, it has been upheld by EVERY court that has ever heard it, and regardless fo what the wyoming board does, pharmacists will continue to have the right to refuse prescritions that they find objectionable. This will inconvenience some people. They will have to get over it. You have no right uner our constitution or anywhere else to force people to abandon their moral or religous views in order to make your life more convenient.",

   "can they refuse certain customers over another? For example fill birth control for one but not another?\n\n \n IIRC it was pretty much entirely personal choice. After all, you are talking a persons morals here, not something with strict guidelines. I do rememebr they could not discriminate soley on the basis of race, religon, etc... \n \n Don't you guys remember a couple years ago when this was a big issue when they were considering allowing the morning after pill??? Lawsuits regarding that and birth control were flying around all over the place. Our local MedicineShoppe was involved in one because it was a franchise locaiton and they did not carry birth control at all. Some idiot tried to sue them to force them to carry it. People who were not XXXXXX just drove the extra 3 minutes to the wal mart pharmacy.\n \n It seems like the debates now seem to mostly be either people nitpicking because they did not like the turnout, or people who were not paying attention, as appears to be the case in wyoming. I mean, we are talking wyoming here, where beating gay guys to death nets you 3 years in a minimum security prison. Nothing drops as easily as they dropped that. It seems pretty apparent that what happened there is they got into the controversy and somebody whispered \"hey, this is all for nothing...regarless of what you guys pass, this is already on the books at the state an dfederal laevel both\" so they dropped the issue rather than go through the storm just to make a nothing law that was already there.",
