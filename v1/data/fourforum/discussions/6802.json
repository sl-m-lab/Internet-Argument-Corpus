   "I am in a bit of a quandry here.\n \n My brother in law came to me last night and asked my advice about buying a home. He is something of a free spirit, as is my sister. Neither one of them works a \"normal\" job. They will have massive inflows of capital, then nothing for several months (for years I suspected he was a professional burgalar). \n \n In the next couple of months, they will be taking in a few hundred thousand dollars and they want to buy a house. What my brother in law essentially wanted to know was if I thought they should finance it, or buy it outright.\n \n My first bit of advice was to put the money in a short term (6 mos) investment, beacause NONE of the real estate folks I know are buying right now. \n \n I can see advantages to both ways. If they finance at a resonable rate, there is a good chance they can get a higer return on their money than the finance charges. On the other hand, if it was me personally, I would buy it outright just for the security that it provides. If they buy outright, and then have a bad year next year, their housing is still gauranteed.\n \n What do you guys think? Personally, I do not carry a note on my home. I prefer the security that comes with complete ownership even if it does cost a little every year in total return because that money is tied up.",

   "I carry a mortgage on 50% of value at 6.5% and have that money invested in 12-15% short-term notes.

Our financial state in the US is getting prograssively worse, and I certainly would not wnat to end up upside down in something and unable to walk away from it. \n \n I generally dislike property equity, except for my home. I will likely always live in my home, and retire there when the time comes. I have made mistakes in the past, or bad calls and worse hedges on investments, that have left me penniles. This has happened more than once, luckily not for several years (besides which, I am a little older and wiser now...learning from your mistakes is the real key to sucess). When I had my children, my opinion as far as home equity changed a little and I decided I would rather have the 100% sucrity of full equity rather then the extra money to play with. \n \n \nComing into a chunk of money affects people in different ways. I've seen people who were former spendthrifts become tight as ticks, just as viewing former fiscal conservatives blow it all on depreciating toys. They should spend a reasonable piece of it on themselves as a reward, and that might be incentive enough to hold the remainder.\n\n \n I can tell you that with these particular folks, money comes in, and they start spending and do not stop until it is gone. The amount does nto seem to matter, it all goes.\n \n My personal strategy when it comes to unusual, large influxes of capital has always been to spend 20% of it max, and put the rest back in somewhere. Anymore I generally put it all back in. I have about all the material posessions I really want. I buy a new car or toy ocassionally, but beyond that, I am pretty much happy with what I already have.",
