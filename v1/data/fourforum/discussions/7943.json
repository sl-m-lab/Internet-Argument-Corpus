Moses was told in Exodus 17:14, \"Write this in a book as a memorial, and recite it to Joshua.\" Exodus 24:4 says that \"Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord.\" In Exodus 34:27 Moses was told to \"write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\" With reference to the wilderness wanderings, Numbers 33:1-2 says that Moses \"recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the Lord...\" Deuteronomy 31:9 says that Moses wrote \"this law and gave it to the priests.\" Verse 22 says that he wrote down a song and gave it to the children of Israel. That song is the bulk of chapter 32. Given this kind of evidence, it is certainly within reason to assume Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.

The book of Joshua is filled with references to Moses, as Joshua acted \"as the Lord commanded Moses\" (cf., Joshua 11:15, 20; 14:2; 21:2, etc.). After Moses died, the Israelites, under the leadership of Joshua, were told to \"do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you\" (1:7). Then, verse 8 says, \"this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth.\" This shows that Moses issued a \"book of the law\" that they were to carefully follow. When Joshua built an altar, he did it \"just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses\" (8:31). \"Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel\" (vv. 34-35a). These verses make it clear that the law they were reading was written by Moses. Other Old Testament passages verify this also, but these should be sufficient to make the point (e.g., 1 Kings 2:3; 2 Kings 14:6; 21:8; Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1, etc.).

Unfortuneatly,Sukenik died in 1953, and no real work was done on this. The articles I saw from Bible Archelogical Society that discussed this did not mention the crosses.\n \n It seems that the crosses are mentioned by evangalistic groups, yet they are being ignored by the groups that are biblical archelogy. The Biblical Archelogy site had pictures of the inscriptions, and although they were quite worn, I was not able to see any crosses on the pictures they provided.\n \n I will admit that this shows that tomb had the names of people mentioned in the New Testament. However, the article from a professional biblical archelogical journal (with pictures on it), did not mention the crosses. The evanglasitic web site did. \n \n The extract from the Biblical Archlogical article dealing with tieh inscriptions is below \n \n\n The modern-day history of the Simon family ossuaries begins in 1941, when Palestine was ruled under the British Mandate. Hebrew University professor Eleazer Sukenik and his assistant, Nahman Avigad, investigated an ancient tomb in the Kidron Valley, east of the ridge on which the Old City of Jerusalem rests and south of the Arab village of Silwan. Sukenik would later become famous for acquiring the first Dead Sea Scrolls for the State of Israel; he was also the father of famed archaeologist Yigael Yadin. Avigad would go on to have a major career in his own right as an archaeologist and epigrapher (a specialist in ancient inscriptions), a career capped by his excavation of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem from 1969 to 1983.\n The Kidron Valley tomb was not, as is so often the case today, discovered during a construction or road project but was instead located by Sukenik and Avigad in a systematic archaeological survey. The tomb proved to be a single-chamber, rock-hewn burial cave; the entrance was blocked, though not tightly sealed, by a partly broken closing stone.\n Sukenik and Avigad documented their finds, carefully cleared the tomb of its contents, and catalogued and stored the artifacts. But, with the exception of some brief notices by Sukenik in scholarly journals,1 complete information on the discovery was not made available for decades. By the time Avigad published an article on the tomb in 1962 (Sukenik had died in 1953), the finds lacked the immediacy of a recent discovery.2 The tomb and its contents slipped into obscurity, garnering little notice for the past four decades.\n The tomb chamber consisted simply of a standing pit hewn into the floor; the digging of the pit formed a continuous shelf along the side and back walls. Interestingly, such an arrangement is often associated with the First Temple period (tenth-sixth centuries B.C.E.). During the late Second Temple period (first century B.C.E.-first century C.E.), more than half of the burial caves around Jerusalem featured finger-like niches cut several feet into the chamber wall; these niches are called kokhim in Hebrew and loculi in Latin. A second, less common, type of burial cave (about one tomb in eight) consisted of wide, shallow arched niches cut into the cave wall, creating a shelf ledge; these are called arcosolia in Latin.\n Despite this tomb's design, the pottery found inside left no doubt about when it was last used. Sukenik and Avigad found 13 intact vessels, including a Herodian oil lamp (considered especially useful for dating). The pottery put the date of the cave's last use in the first century C.E.\n Of greater interest were 11 ossuaries found together on the left side of the cave. Opposite them were scattered, decayed bones, evidence of one or more primary burials left lying to decay on the stone bench. It is easy to imagine the family that owned the tomb placing the body of a close relative in the burial cave just before they were killed themselves or forced into exile by the Romans in 70 C.E. without being allowed to return to the tomb to gather the bones in an ossuary. The published reports by Sukenik and Avigad do not mention what became of these bones (or of the bones that would have been in the ossuaries, which were undisturbed) after the archaeologists found them; presumably the bones were re-interred elsewhere, in accordance with Jewish law and custom.\n All 11 ossuaries were plain, undecorated chests, but nine of them-an unusually high proportion-bore an inscription (and some had more than one). Ossuary inscriptions were rarely carved by a skilled professional engraver; they were usually crudely rendered, probably by a relative. Their main function was to identify to family members the remains contained in the various chests. Inscriptions are therefore written in chalk or charcoal or simply scratched with a nail into the soft limestone surface. With one exception, the inscriptions on these Kidron Valley ossuaries are as crude as any.\n Sukenik and Avigad found 12 names in 15 inscriptions on the ossuaries and lids, all in Greek letters except for one in Hebrew and one bilingual inscription-in Greek and Hebrew. Four of the names are typically Jewish: Sara, Sabatis (the feminine form of Shabbatai), Jacob and Simon; the first three had not previously been found on ossuaries and were names used chiefly in the Diaspora. And of the eight Greek-style names, most were not known among Greco-Jewish inscriptions in Palestine, but some were especially common in Cyrenaica, in North Africa. The inscriptions thus suggested that the family entombed in the cave came from a Jewish Diaspora community, most likely from Cyrenaica.\n Cyrenaica lay in the eastern part of modern Libya. Cyrene, its chief city during the Roman period, sat on a plateau inland from the Mediterranean, 500 miles west of Alexandria and 700 miles east of Carthage, as the crow flies.\n \n\n \n and further, about the second inscription is\n \n\n Cyrene was founded as a Greek colony in about 630 B.C.E. It later came under the rule of Alexander the Great and then of his successor dynasty, the Ptolemies of Egypt. By the first century B.C.E., Cyrene was the capital of a Roman province. Excavations at the site in the early 20th century, mainly by Italian teams, uncovered extensive remains, including a temple to Apollo, the agora-forum, the theater and a vast burial ground.\n The Jewish community in Cyrene dates to about 300 B.C.E., when Jews came as settlers from Egypt. Jews from Cyrene, like their counterparts from other Diaspora communities, visited Jerusalem during the three great pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles), and it is clear that some of them settled there as well. The Book of Acts, when describing the descent of the Holy Spirit during Pentecost, says, \"There were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem...Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and other parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and other visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes\" (Acts 2:5, 10). According to Acts 6:9, some Jews from Cyrene quarreled with Stephen, who was to become the first Christian martyr; this suggests that the Cyrenians either had their own synagogue in Jerusalem or formed an identifiable group within a larger synagogue. Cyrenians were also a part of the earliest Christian communities in Jerusalem (Acts 11:19-20) and Antioch (Acts 13:1).\n Two of the Kidron Valley ossuaries found by Sukenik and Avigad bear the name Simon. One reads \"Sara (daughter) of Simon, of Ptolemais.\" The city is not likely to have been Ptolemais-Acre (modern Akko, just north of Haifa); given the family's apparent Diaspora origins, a better candidate would be the Ptolemais in Egypt or, better yet, the Ptolemais located west of Cyrene, in the region of Cyrenaica.\n The second Simon ossuary-the one that's of main interest here-is inscribed in three places. The front bears a two-line inscription, possibly written in green chalk, that reads, \"Alexander (son) of Simon.\" Each name appears on its own line. The back of the ossuary contains a sloppily executed three-line inscription, the first line of which is clearly an error. It reads, \"SimonAle.\" Realizing his mistake, the engraver started over again, writing \"Alexander\" on the second line and \"(son) of Simon\" on the third.\n \n\n \n with the analsysi if the thrid inscription being \n \n\n Cyrene was founded as a Greek colony in about 630 B.C.E.

It reads, \"SimonAle.\" Realizing his mistake, the engraver started over again, writing \"Alexander\" on the second line and \"(son) of Simon\" on the third.\n \n\n \n This is a very pro christian ariticle, yet did not mention any cross inscriptions. It does conclude though \n \n \n\n We are left with many questions and no definitive answers. All we can say for certain is that the facts fit: More than six decades ago two scholars uncovered a burial cave last used in first-century C.E. Jerusalem. The names on the ossuaries point to a family that originated in Cyrenaica; one inscription bears the name Alexander, a name rare among Jews at the time; he is identified as the son of Simon. The Gospels, too, speak of a man from Cyrene, a Simon, father of Alexander.\n I find it very unlikely that there could have been two families living in first-century C.E. Jerusalem, both of them from Cyrene in North Africa, both of them headed by a man named Simon and both of which men gave their sons the uncommon name Alexander. I believe the Simon memorialized on the Kidron Valley ossuary was very likely the Simon of Cyrene who carried Jesus' cross at the Crucifixion.\n \n\n \n So, the names are the same., and the very pro-christian writer thinks it could be the family, yet he did not make any mention of any crosses beign found. It sounds like someone elaborated things in the Christian Couriuer article.\n \n Mind you, this archelogical find is probably the closet I have seen to be for evidece. It doesn't QUITE make it, but it is getting close. The article in the an archelogical journal that I woudl trust (even if it IS christan centric) does not mention Jesus, or crosses, but it DOES mention the combination of names mentioned in the bible. \n \n Other articles that mention this find also do not mention the crosses. They do mention the incription about \"Jesus', but Jesus is a very common name, as was joseph. I noticed you didn't mention that one of the inscriptions said \"jesus, son of Joesph' .. \n \n I find it suspectious that other very pro-christian sources that make reference to this find do not mention the crosses, nor does C.K. Barret, in The New Testament Background, SPCK 1987,) who points out the age of this tomb is s between 50 b.c.e. and 50 c.e.",
