There was one time before I believe in the late 70's with the Phillies I think (feel free to correct that if it's wrong) in which the Royals lost. That's never talked about much here. Then again, Kansas City doesn't honstly seem to talk about the Royals much at all. Now if a member of the Chiefs sneezed, it make the front page news. (Okay not really, but you get the idea.",

He was only in his late forties. Also, back in '89, AL umpire Nick Bremigan also died from a massive heart attack. And he was so conciensious about his health. So death can occur at any time in any way.",
