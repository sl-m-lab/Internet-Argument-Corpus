Now, although I still reject any possibility of a biological factor, the mental factor does play out in this whole realm. When you start to think of something, and dwell on it, it in essence, becomes part of you.\n\n \n \n You may reject the \"idea\" of of genetic factor, but to reject the \"possiblity\" is just plain closed minded.\n \n Not to mention, most of the scientific world feels there is a gentic link..and the idea of \"choice\" has long been ruled out. The idea that sexuality is changable has also been ruled as psuedo-science.....\n \n You are still left with a groups of people are attracted to the same sex and will remain attracted to the same sex......\n \n If that be the case, do they not deserve equal rights to live their life as happy as they can make it without oppression?",
