Here's the link: Falwell says Christians shouldn't focus on global warming \n \n Here's the quote if you can't access that page: \nThe Reverend Jerry Falwell says global warming is \"Satan's attempt to redirect the church's primary focus\" from evangelism to environmentalism.\n Falwell told his Baptist congregation in Lynchburg yesterday that \"the jury is still out\" on whether humans are causing -- or could stop -- global warming.\n \n But he said some \"naive Christian leaders\" are being \"duped\" by arguments like those presented in former Vice President Al Gore's documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth. Falwell says the documentary should have been titled \"A Convenient Untruth.\"\n \n Falwell said the Bible teaches that God will maintain the Earth until Jesus returns, so Christians should be responsible environmentalists, but not what he calls ... quote ... \"first-class nuts.\" \n\n \n It really cracks me up, Falwell talking bout \"first-class nuts\". He's the posterboy for \"Private-Lear-Jet Nuts\".",

   "I believe mnny Christians (evangelicals) are moving towards the whole 'good stewardship' issue in regards to environmental practices.\n Had they done so when the topic initially came up a few years ago, they might have garnered some good PR for their leadership in this area rather than derrission.\n \n The Church should seek to win souls over for their God as it's primary goal. And while I believe most who follow the likes of Falwell will be damned by their own stated belief system, what he said is factually correct.\n But, you can do both and in doing so, possibly be more successful in BOTH.\n \n Just this past Sunday, I covered NPR's Speaking of Faith show where the NAE VP of gov't affairs (National Association of Evangelicals), Richard Cizik, spoke positively of seeking to protect the Earth environmentally. Of course, he also said other conservative leaders opposed him.\n \n Ted Haggard (I'm not a gay meth fiend...oh, wait, I AM) was the former pres. of the NAE.\n \n http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/evangelicalevolution/index.shtml\n \n http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/evangelicalevolution/transcript.shtml",
