   "Recently on a web board from my local newpaper, a poster posted (randomly out of no where) statistics and an article about how gay men make up 44% of the new infections of HIV. Although the info is true and from the CDC, I gave some thought to motive. \n \n What does this poster have to gain by making this post, so negatively about gays. Why would a straight (very chrsitian) male want to post such negative stuff about gays? What is there to gain from this? It isn't about spreading Jesus' message about anything or he would have posted info on all new HIV infectrions and how all people are affected. He didn't.\n \n \n On the same newspaper site, another poster is famous for posting pro-white angenda posts where he posts information regarding how bad non-whites are in the world...etc...etc.(Iam sure you have seen this and know what I am talking about). Minorities have higher crime.....\n \n The question I am asking here is what is the difference between these two posters. Their motivation seems to be the same. Neither is out to spread the word about their cause. They just seem to be interested in oppressing the group opposed to them.\n \n The white supremist posts material that shows non-whites in a bad light, therefore shedding the promodial light on his cause.\n \n The Fundamentalist chrisitian posts information about the \n \"non-straight\" in a bad light to shed the promodial light on his anti-gay cause.\n \n Is there a difference in the hate they spread? Are they really any different?",

Although the info is true and from the CDC, I gave some thought to motive. \n \n\n \n Ditto here on the motive- the rate varies country to country. If I quote you UK figures, 26% of new infections in the quarter March-June 2004 were attributed to sex betweem men while 58% resulted from sex between a man and a woman. This is a continuation of the trend that began in 1999 when hetrosexually acquired HIV infections became the single largest source of new HIV infections.\n \n If you are interested, the CDR publishes detailed running reports on the origin of HIV infection (scroll down the page as the first section deals with chlamydia).\n \n But to look at the West is to look at the very tip of the iceberg.... on a world wide scale there are no simple explainations as to the nature of infection patterns. The WHO publishes reports on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. I though this paragraph in the introduction was quite insightful:\n \n \nVirtually every region, including sub-Saharan Africa, has several countries where the epidemic is still at a low level or at an early enough stage to be held in check by effective action. This calls for programmes that can thwart the spread of HIV among the most vulnerable population groups. But in many countries, inadequate resources and a failure of political will and leadership still bars the way-especially where HIV has established footholds among marginalized and stigmatized population groups such as women who sell sex, drug injectors and men who have sex with men. Unless reticence is rapidly replaced with pragmatic and forward-looking approaches, HIV will spread more extensively in many countries which until now have escaped with only minor epidemics.\n\n \n So there you have it- marginalization and stigmatization that are the real issues, not individual behaviour, and that presents the real challenge in beating HIV.",

Valdiserri, deputy director of the CDC's HIV prevention program. About 18,000 die of AIDS each year in the U.S. \n \n The number of new infections has remained stable since the mid-1990s, when the burgeoning use of anti-HIV drugs lowered virus transmissions and death. But the mark is seen as a setback because the government had set the goal of cutting the rate of new infections in half by 2005. \n \n \"We have a ways to go before we reach [that] mark,\" Valdiserri said in a telephone briefing with reporters. \n \n \"It's simply unacceptable that so many people continue to be infected by this virus,\" said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the CDC. \n \n Men who have sex with men bore the initial brunt of the AIDS epidemic and account for 44% of newly diagnosed cases, according to the new data. But complacency brought on by effective AIDS drugs and the time that had elapsed since the initial ravages of the epidemic had led to an increase in unsafe sex practices, officials said. \n *************************************** \n \n So - 5% of the population accounts for 44% of new AIDS cases...and this isn't considered an epidemic? \n \n Glad to see all that \"awareness program\" funding is paying off! \n \n Same-Sex Attraction Disorder kills. \n \n It's interesting to see who truly cares in this situation: \n \n 1 - The Homosexual-enabling Left who not only wants them to continue in their deathstyle, but wants to appropriate special rights to them. All the while supporting and championing their cause as something marvelous to behold and demanding tolerance from all. \n \n 2 - The Christians who know that Jesus Christ is the ultimate bondage-breaker and miracle-worker who can heal them of their sinful urges if they would only turn to Him.\n \n \"This is the best election night in history!\" --DNC chair Terry McAuliffe Nov. 2, 2004 8pm\n \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Now do you see his motivation?

   "How do you know this?\n\n \n 50% Heterosexuals With \n HIV May Not Know It \n By Luke Edwards \n http://www.the-journal.co.uk/cfm/news_story.cfm?storyId=193470 \n 7-21-00 \n \n \n As many as one in two heterosexual people are infected with HIV, the virus that can lead to Aids, and do not know it, according to a North expert on infectious diseases. \n \n Dr Mike Snow, consultant physician at the HIV service, part of the department of infection and tropical medicine at Newcastle General Hospital, believes a certain level of complacency regarding safe sex has increased the danger of people catching the virus. \n \n His comments came after last year's revelations that for the first time the number of registered cases of HIV infections among heterosexuals were larger than those among the gay and bisexual community. \n \n Speaking on last night's Lifeline programme on Tyne Tees, Dr Snow said: \"While statistically the numbers of people catching HIV are small, that does not mean the danger is not a real one. \n \n \"The fact remains that the numbers are not going down they are getting bigger so the problem has certainly not gone away. Significantly while a perhaps a third of gay people who have the virus have not been tested, this figure could be as much as 50% of heterosexual carriers.\" \n \n He feels the failure of the AIDS epidemic to materialise, widely predicted when the disease was first identified in the 1980s, has led society to drop its guard. For some the disease is still regarded as a danger only for the gay community, despite last year's statistics showing heterosexual cases to be on the increase. \n \n The availability of improved medicine to combat the disease has also bred a certain ambivalent attitude, but he is quick to emphasis that while the quality and length of life for HIV carriers can be improved there is still no cure. \n \n He added: \"While modern medicine, in particular the triple drug cocktails, can improve the quality and length of life for a HIV carrier, they are not a cure and there is no easy option. The availability of drugs is not a substitute for practising safer sex. \n \n \"I think what needs to be done is that children need to be educated at an early age about the need for safe sex and this needs to become a part of the curriculum as it were. I'm sure this may attract criticism from some quarters but it is a matter of public health, not public morals.\"",
