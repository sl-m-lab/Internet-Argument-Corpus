   "Hi Justine:\n \n [QUOTE]\nKenneth G. Wilson (1923-). The Columbia Guide to Standard American English. 1993. \n \n homosexual, gay, heterosexual, homoerotic, lesbian (adjs., nn.) \n \n Functional shift permits each of these adjectives to function as a noun as well. Homosexual describes a tendency to feel sexual desire for a member of the same sex, and a homosexual is a person with such a tendency. \n\n \n According to English tradition, syntax allows us to Shakespeare a noun into a verb or and adjective or an adverb. That is like making an action word out of a noun; like 'horsing' around or 'chairing' for the board. Turning things around the other way in this case also appears to be accepted by Webster. That is why his definition number 2 appears as a noun. Although, my personal feeling is that this came about through common misuse of the term, and acceptance by the masses. \n \n \nMr. Wilson << Homoerotic is a synonym for homosexual. Heterosexual describes the tendency to feel sexual desire for the opposite sex, and a heterosexual is a person with such a tendency. \n \n \n However, the above being said, he still is guilty of misusing the term according to the definition of the root. That is why my original statement contained the qualifier 'accurately.' As in, \"The word 'Homosexual' does not accurately describe a person who copulates with a person of the same sex.\"  Again, the reason is based upon the solid definition of the root of the word, which is 'sex.' Head back out to see what Mr. Wilson has to say about that definition. Here is Webster's again:\n \n \nMain Entry: 1sex \n Pronunciation: 'seks\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents  and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior\n \n \n Your 'homosexual' must be either a male or a female. This is where Webster is going to let you down. He is going to apply the noun to which sex?\n \n \nMain Entry: 2 homosexual\n \n Function: noun\n \n : a homosexual person and especially a male \n \n \n Therefore, we can deduce that his definition is based upon common usage of the term, and not by the rules of grammar for the English language. Did you note that in the definition, he uses this supposed noun as an adjective, and added the noun \"person?\" A nice touch. \n \n But again, this does not address the fact that 'sex' is the erroneous root of this word, because gay folks do not reproduce. Plus, every single gay person was fathered and mothered by heterosexual parents. So when you go back to define 'sex,' and hit that 'reproduction' aspect, then the parents reproduced a copy of themselves. Thus, every person ever born is always heterosexual by definition. And again, \"The Fallacy of Homosexuality.\"\n \n \nMr. Wilson << Lesbian refers to homosexual relations between women, and a lesbian is a woman so inclined. Gay means \"homosexual,\" specifically \"homosexual tendencies in a man\"; a gay is a homosexual man. All these terms are Standard English. See also GAY.\n\n \n Do you know why Gay means homosexual? Because the fad caught on and everybody decided it was A-Okay. That is why I agreed that people can call themselves anything they like. Another aspect of The Fallacy Of Homosexuality is, again, that 'sex' is the root of the word, and none of this gay activity ever reproduced a male or female into our species. This guy is defining a group of people by their behavior, and that what makes him a 'lawbreaker.' \n \n Heterosexual males and females are not classified by their behavior. The root word 'sex' appears in the adjective describing each noun, because both males and females are born with the genetic characteristics to duplicate themselves. Asexual organisms are accurately named, because they have the genetic characteristics to duplicate themselves. \n \n By definition of the terms, a homosexual person has never been born. Every single human being ever born was male or female and carried the genetic characteristics to reproduce themselves. Therefore, everyone is born either a heterosexual male or female. The only place that 'homosexuals' exist is in the minds of gay people, and those who also believe this is A-Okay. Me? I'm not buying any of it. In my book, this guy's 'Functional Shift' homosexual train is dysfunctional. \n \n \nJustine << End of discussion. Terral03 give it up, you loose, you're wrong, you need to apologize and go home.\n\n \n Anyone can make their mouth say anything. The mind is a powerful tool that can allow people to see what they want to see. You can continue to create these threads all day long, lady, but you are still a heterosexual woman deluding herself into believing she is something that she is not. You are a heterosexual female in lust with another heterosexual female. That is the way you were born, and that coded dna imprint is written in every fiber of your physical being. \n \n \nJustine << You have behaved like a pit bull doing exactly what it was bred to do, except for the fact that now the humane society must put it down because it just ripped the face off a small child.\n\n \n Heh, yousofunny. Good luck with the gay thing. Maybe one day you will believe it enough to stop convincing yourself. Living in that delusion is fun and games, right up to the moment that you wake up. \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "Heh, yousofunny. Good luck with the gay thing. Maybe one day you will believe it enough to stop convincing yourself. Living in that delusion is fun and games, right up to the moment that you wake up. \n In Christ,\n Terral\n\n I note Terral that you highlight a word from one line, then one from another, then one from another and so on. Such shows that you read down the page instead of across, following the sentences, but instead plucking out all the words that you feel agree with what you believe, and ignoring the rest.\n Anyway, for the purposes of conformity only, I will quote from Webster's, although the Macquarie Dictionary is the standard for Australian English - I still recall that funny attack you made at me for spelling things differently from you... you deemed them to be incorrect, but I followed Australian English standards.\n \n Main Entry: 1sex \n Pronunciation: 'seks\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior b : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n 4 : GENITALIA\n \n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=sex&x=18&y=12\n \n Let's look at #1. Is it about reproduction? No, it just says that a species is divided into female and male - that they have the potential for reproduction is there, but if it were about reproduction then a pre-pubescent human would, according to your re-working, be sexless.\n Let's look at #2. Is this about reproduction? More so than #1, as it talks about the structural parts that determine whether someone is male or female. Again, if it were solely about reproduction, then those members of the human race, with the actual sexual organs, but who can't reproduce, are sexless.\n Now #3. behaviour -that is the key. If you commit a sexual act, and it DOES NOT exclude sexual acts of any form; whether you're a male who has sex with a female, another male, yourself, an inanimate object, another living creature, or anything else. It doesn't say. You somehow have added in details that aren't there.\n \nHowever, the above being said, he still is guilty of misusing the term according to the definition of the root. That is why my original statement contained the qualifier ?accurately.? As in, ?The word ?Homosexual? does not accurately describe a person who copulates with a person of the same sex.? Again, the reason is based upon the solid definition of the root of the word, which is ?sex.? Head back out to see what Mr. Wilson has to say about that definition.\n\n As shown by your Webster quote, sex is about having the attributes of male or female, not about reproduction, though there is an implied ability to do this, it is not stated.\n What word do you think 'accurately describes a person who has sex with a person of the same sex'?\n \nYour ?homosexual? must be either a male or a female. This is where Webster is going to let you down. He is going to apply the noun to which sex?\n\n Main Entry: 1ho\u00b7mo\u00b7sex\u00b7u\u00b7al \n Pronunciation: \"hO-m&-'sek-sh(&-)w&l, -'sek-sh&l\n Function: adjective\n 1 : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex\n 2 : of, relating to, or involving sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex\n - ho\u00b7mo\u00b7sex\u00b7u\u00b7al\u00b7ly adverb\n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=homosexual&x=0&y=0\n Obviously, it's not just 'her' word. Webster, the standard for American English accepts the word. Note here when it says 'towards another of the same sex', here the word 'sex' complies with their own definition of 'sex' and that is, of or pertaining to the features of either being male or female, not of 'the act of reproduction'.\n \n I note too your interesting sentence.\n \nAccording to English tradition, syntax allows us to Shakespeare a noun into a verb or and adjective or an adverb.\n\n You have in fact made Shakespeare into a verb as that is how it functions in this sentence... thus I suppose making use of your own rule.\n It is highlighted now before looking at your next rant\n \nYour ?homosexual? must be either a male or a female. This is where Webster is going to let you down. He is going to apply the noun to which sex?\n\n So, you're saying that the standard for American English is letting people down by not conforming to your rules. This is incredibly funny. You are fighting against the use of the word, based in fact on their own definitions of 'sex'. So in effect, you accept them as a source of authority, only when it fits into your highly amusing theory. When you disagree with them, you conveniently ignore them.\n \n And of course in irony you insult everyone and then sign your posts \"In Christ\"",

   "Hi Montalban: \n \n \nMontalban << I note Terral that you highlight a word from one line, then one from another, then one from another and so on. Such shows that you read down the page instead of across, following the sentences, but instead plucking out all the words that you feel agree with what you believe, and ignoring the rest.\n\n \n I am at a loss as to the point of your complaint. What does the way I read or highlight have to do with the strength or weakness of your case? Please read and write in any way you see fit, and answer only the parts of my posts that you feel challenge primary support for your case. I am your debating opponent, Montalban. Therefore, do not try to tell me how to read/write/answer my posts. The crapola parts of your posts do not require any effort on my part. If I feel the third party reader dismisses everything you have written, then do not even expect a reply. And save your crying for the someone else.\n \n \nMontalban << Anyway, for the purposes of conformity only, I will quote from Webster's, although the Macquarie Dictionary is the standard for Australian English - I still recall that funny attack you made at me for spelling things differently from you... you deemed them to be incorrect, but I followed Australian English standards.\n\n \n \nMain Entry: 1sex \n Pronunciation: 'seks\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior b : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n 4 : GENITALIA\n\n \n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictiona...a=sex&x=18&y=12\n \n \nMontalban << Let's look at #1. Is it about reproduction? No, it just says that a species is divided into female and male - that they have the potential for reproduction is there, but if it were about reproduction then a pre-pubescent human would, according to your re-working, be sexless.\n\n \n What we are looking at are four ways in which this word can be used, according to proper syntax. So, 'sex' can be a reference to either of the two sexes of our species. We agree.\n \n \nMontalban << Let's look at #2. Is this about reproduction? More so than #1, as it talks about the structural parts that determine whether someone is male or female. Again, if it were solely about reproduction, then those members of the human race, with the actual sexual organs, but who can't reproduce, are sexless.\n\n \n Again, we are looking at four ways in which this word can be legally and rightfully used, according to the common rules of proper English grammar. Actually, we are seeing five ways to use this word, if we consider 3a. and 3b.. \n \n Your point here is mute, because of how we are using the word. We are applying the meaning of this word, as a root, to Heterosexual, Homosexual and Asexual. Therefore, the meaning and definition to be selected is for the particular meaning of the word 'sex,' as the primary root of these three words. Then, we are drawing comparisons by analyzing any similarities or differences between those three words, according to the attached prefixes and suffixes. Then, at that point, we compare the Dictionary definitions of each of these three words (and these three words only) to one another. Once again we look for similarities and differences between the meanings of each. The final analysis will reveal that two of these words have things very much in common all the way down the line. However, one of these words is the oddball, and the facts simply speak for themselves. Haven't you ever done this with the Hebrew and Greek? This is much easier, my friend. \n \n \nMontalban << Now #3. behaviour -that is the key. If you commit a sexual act, and it DOES NOT exclude sexual acts of any form; whether you're a male who has sex with a female, another male, yourself, an inanimate object, another living creature, or anything else. It doesn't say. You somehow have added in details that aren't there.\n \n \n You are adding facts that are not there by ignoring the rules of grammar for the very word we are defining. Look at the definition again very carefully:\n \n Definition 3 a << sexually motivated phenomena or behavior b : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n \n The very first word in 3a and 3b has the root 'sex.' Just because you are standing inside of definition number 3, that is no excuse to give 'sexually' a brand new meaning. The root of the word is 'sex.' You just defined that word in definition number 2 with regard to reproduction. Therefore, 'sexually' motivated phenomena or behavior is that which is associated with reproduction. If you want to include gay acts into this definition, then you must find it there; not place it there by your own assumptions. \n \n Now I am using the same dictionary as you, and following the rules of grammar. 'The primary word in definition number 3b is 'Sexual' Intercourse. The root of the word is \"sex.\" Are you going to try and tell me that this word is being used simply to describe a male or female? No, but that is part of the true definition. It is obviously being used according to definition number 2, and there is where your 'species/parent/male/female/reproduction' definition is staring you right in the face. Do not come out here and accuse me of selected vision, then be found guilty of the same offense in the same post. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral03 << However, the above being said, he still is guilty of misusing the term according to the definition of the root. That is why my original statement contained the qualifier 'accurately.' As in, The word 'Homosexual' does not accurately describe a person who copulates with a person of the same sex.? Again, the reason is based upon the solid definition of the root of the word, which is 'sex.' Head back out to see what Mr. Wilson has to say about that definition. \n \n \n \nMontalban << As shown by your Webster quote, sex is about having the attributes of male or female, not about reproduction, though there is an implied ability to do this, it is not stated. What word do you think 'accurately describes a person who has sex with a person of the same sex'? \n \n \n No. Again, the use of the word, as the root of 'heterosexual' demands that we use definition number 2. The word 'asexual' requires us to use definition number 2 also, when used, as an adjective, to describe a plant or animal. Both of those groups are being described by how they reproduce. Homosexual is the term that violates the rules. \n \n You know, every time I see you coming, then I accept that things will be repeated over and over and over again. No worries . . . I have more than one child. Some are faster than others.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral03 << Your 'homosexual' must be either a male or a female. This is where Webster is going to let you down.

GL with that.\n \n \nMontalban << I note too your interesting sentence. \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral03 << According to English tradition, syntax allows us to Shakespeare a noun into a verb  or and adjective or an adverb. \n \n \n \nMontalban << You have in fact made Shakespeare into a verb as that is how it functions in this sentence... thus I suppose making use of your own rule. \n\n \n Yes, Montalban, that is the point of my statement. But, no, I did not make up the rule. \"A noun into a verb  . . .\" is what I said. You once again parroted my words and complained about it. (Did he catch that shift or not? :0) I doubt it ) And no, that is the primary way 'Functional Shift' works in normal every day English. Nouns are often shifted to be verbs, adjectives and adverbs. \n \n BTW, I agreed with Mr. Wilson on that point, but for a different reason; common usage creates words that break the rules. He shifted an adjective backwards into a noun. That is the same way your Church shifted the verb into Eucharist. That was just larceny and total deviation from all the rules. \n \n \nMontalban << It is highlighted now before looking at your next rant \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral03 << Your 'homosexual' must be either a male or a female.

Those are the rules of syntax pertaining to English grammar. The root of the word is supposed to carry the meaning and definition from the word in which it was derived. The rules apply to heterosexual and asexual just fine; everything fits, because they are both describing living things according to the way they do (or do not) reproduce (def. #2). If you would have provided the 'noun,' definition from Webster, you would have found where he deviated from the rules.\n \n \nMain Entry: 2homosexual\n Function: noun\n : a homosexual person and especially a male \n \n \n This definition came about through common use of the word by the masses. People began calling gay men 'homosexual,' and Webster said \"A-Okay.\" But, again, when you break the word (homosexual) down to the root and define all the terms (with 'sex' as the root), then this guy is and oddball indeed. But hey, there are plenty of exceptions to the rules.\n \n \nMontalban << This is incredibly funny. You are fighting against the use of the word, based in fact on their own definitions of 'sex'. So in effect, you accept them as a source of authority, only when it fits into your highly amusing theory. When you disagree with them, you conveniently ignore them.\n \n \n Who is fighting, Montalban? Most of what I write goes right over your head anyway.

Has anyone ever heard of reading between the lines?\n\n \n Thank you for understanding. \n \n \n \n\n Now show me the substance to this argument and lets settle this once and for all ie. until the next thread. I wonder who will get the final word on this one. Isn't it exciting.\n\n \n There isn't any substance here regard Terral03's arguments. Even Jaaaman and Mana'ai have more substance then they do.",

   "Can someone explain to me where this topic originates from, I've obviously missed something.\n\n Yes, it's about Terral03 bringing up a really weird debate based on the notion that the word 'homosexual' contains the word 'sex' and therefore because he believes 'sex' is just about reproduction, only, homosexuals are really heterosexuals! I kid you not, this is the calibre of his original thinking.\n \n At the end of the day, does the correctness of your English grammar really do anything to prove a point you are trying to make in this forum. Are we saying that you can't submit a logical argument just because the terminology is not exactly correct? Has anyone ever heard of reading between the lines?\n\n For Terral03, it does, because he believes, based on this really way out theory, that homosexuals don't exist.\n \n\n Everyone sets their own context and can define what they meant through employing the many resources available in their vocabulary. It is quite simply pedantic or maybe even pathetic, to distort or deliberately misinterpret the meaning of someone's words (assuming they have been clearly stated or personally defined) just because they do not follow a traditional definition out of the Oxford.. Webster.. or whatever!\n \n Now show me the substance to this argument and lets settle this once and for all ie. until the next thread. I wonder who will get the final word on this one. Isn't it exciting.\n\n \n Can I ask the reason for using the Eureka flag? Are you pro-union or are you supporting one of the anti-immigration parties, or are you an Australian for a Republic? It's hard to tell, because it's used and abused by such a wide range of Aussie groups.",
