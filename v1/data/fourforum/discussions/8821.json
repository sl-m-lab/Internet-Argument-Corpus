   "Louisiana man drilling for oil in his 'front yard'\n \n HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices are so high, that oilman Steve Jordan is drilling a well next to his home near Lake Charles, Louisiana, he said on Wednesday. Jordan, 52, said the well will stretch 8,500 feet (2,591 metres) under his house and swimming pool and below the adjacent Calcasieu River.\n \n Jordan argued Americans should permit more U.S. oil drilling to achieve energy independence. They fight it \"and then try to blame U.S. oil companies for the price of energy being so high,\" he said.\n \n http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2006-09-07T122931Z_01_N06141314_RTRUKOC_0_US-OILMAN.xml&src=rss&rpc=22",

   "I can't speak definitively for the USA, but in Canada, anyone is free to do just that.\n \n It's easy really, all you have to do is -\n \n Explore for an oil/gas target for your well\n Buy the mineral rights \n Negotiate surface access\n Build the surface lease \n Contract a drilling rig\n Contract a service rig\n Hire a facilities and pipeline crew to equip your well for production and tie it into the existing infrastructure (if it does in fact exist)\n Pay the owner of that infrastructure their handling fee\n Pay someone to handle the daily operation of the well\n \n Now, just sit back and reap the profits. Assuming of course, that you drilled a productive well, capable of paying back all the invested capital and operating expenses. \n \n You can do all of this, whenever you want, provided you have in the neighborhood of 2-4 million dollars lying around that you're willing to risk on a 10-50% chance of success.\n \n If you still think it's a good idea and you're looking to take a shot, send me a PM, I've got some exploration targets in northern Saskatchewan that I'll give you a real good deal on. ;)\n \n Waxy",
