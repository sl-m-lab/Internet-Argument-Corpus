   "Should the government tax churches? \n \n Churches are supposedly independent, non profit organizations, but are supported by tax dollars. When a church catches fire, doesn't the tax funded fire department respond? Shouldn't they have to pay the same costs for the same services that others get by paying taxes?\n \n To counter that argument:\n \n Don't the churches do things like fundraisers and feeding the poor? If taxed, should they be able to write off certain portions of their taxes with helpful acts such as the above?\n \n Both sides have a pretty good argument, but can anyone give a better one for either side?",

Shouldn't they have to pay the same costs for the same services that others get by paying taxes?\n\n \n Actually, at least in some places, they have to pay for the fire service when it is used. I helped a friend who did bookeeping for a church and was having troubles with the new accounting system. I showed her how to enter a few transactions and I was surprised when I came across the one where the church had to pay the fire dept. to come and put out a fire. If that's not in place everywhere, it really should be the government's fault because they haven't put such a system in place.\n \n However, regardless of whether or not the church has to pay for the services, it is impossible to tax churches. Churches are non-profit organizations, i.e. they make no profit. If they have no profit, then their net income is zero. Obviously, most churches do hold some money back in reserve, but the church taxation laws say that they do not have to pay taxes on this reserve money.",
