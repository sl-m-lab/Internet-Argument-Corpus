   "That's because the only way to analogize something that people have moral qualms over is to use an issue people understand as a moral issue. How else would you expect people to analogize a situation where people morally disagree with something? Obviously they have to use another issue of moral disagreement to make the analogy. If you think their point is \"homosexuals are as bad as kleptomaniacs\" then you've completely missed the point of the analogy. The point is that both are a moral issue, and a moral issue has to be used to analogize a moral issue.\n \n \n \n But vegetarianism is not morally opposed by people, that I know of. So it doesn't make a good example to analogize an issue that IS morally opposed by many people.\n\n \n Why is homosexuality a moral issue?

Jews, wiccans, buddhists, those who are not seen as not fitting gender roles, and many others have been persecuted and suffered bias because of this.

   "It is a common misconception that liberals confuse anti-homosexuality with anti-homosexual. The two words are fundamentally linked, of course, but are not equivalents, at least as far as I've understood the issue. Because of this, most homosexuals disregard conservatives who are against homosexuality as \"anti-gay, anti-liberal traditionalists\". Of course, many conservatives (and I assure you, many liberals too) are anti-homosexual-groups such as \"God Hates Fags\" are considered the general belief of most conservatives, when in reality that is simply not the case. Most conservatives are indifferent about the issue, most of them culturally accept it, like many liberals.\n \n To prove my point, I shall compare two separate dialogues with a liberal and conservative. The liberal, a 20-year-old Sophmore at San Francisco State University, said that gay marriage was a right, as homosexuals have done nothing wrong. I asked her two questions. My first question was \"What do you think the conservative view is?\", her response was that \"homosexuals are sinners and are destined for hell\". The second question was \"Have you ever thought that maybe homosexuals are doing something wrong?\" and she immediately was irritated that I asked such a \"radical\" question and said \"Of course they aren't doing anything wrong. Nothing more wrong than when two people fall in love; when two people get married... it's the same\". The second interview was with a conservative resident of San Jose, California. When I asked him what he thought about homosexuality, he said it was a \"disgusting perversion... gay marriage should be outlawed\", and when I asked him why he said \"because it's immoral... it hurts society\". However, he wasn't able explain why it hurt society. I have also had many dialogues with conservatives and liberals alike, and they all come up with similar answers, occasionally being debatable. The truth of the matter is most liberals and conservatives don't actually understand the issue, and people like \"God Hates Fags\" are one of these. \n \n What is the true conservative belief? The conservative belief is such: \"We don't hate homosexuals; we find homosexuality a damaging act\". The belief is that homosexuality is essentially a disorder, and is against nature to commit the act. Allow me to distinguish this from one who is \"anti-homosexual\". An \"Anti-homosexual\" is essentially a \"homophobe\", in the sense that he is either afraid or hateful of homosexuals. Remarkably, there are fewer of these than we realize. Liberals often misuse the definition on conservatives who are against gay marriage or sodomy. The truth of the matter is that many of these people, specifically more prominent conservatives, do not fall into the category of homophobia. \n \n Just my two cents.",

All it tells anyone is that I am attracted to men. If they are going to jump to conclusions about what I do and who I do it with, then my response to their rudeness is quite appropriate.\n \n And secondly, you mistakenly hold their bigotry and my response to their bigotry in the same regard.

We've discussed this particular study many times....\n \n http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499\n \n Actuarial tables, the only way to make a determination on life expectancy for a group of people in society, were not used in the study. The sample studied, was not the type of sample one can broadly apply to all gay men.\n \n \nIs that evidence enough that homosexuality is disordered?\n\n \n No.",

   "\"Destorys\" :p\n \n I'm sure thousands. There's several ways this is done: Firstly, if a child grows up in a homosexual family. A child need, by nature, to be raised by a father and mother. Throughout nature this is found, and should the child not be raised by a mother and a father together, it can be very destructive for the child, specifically for males if the father is absent. This is often seen in families where a father is absent due to death or divorce. Secondly, homosexuality is a disorder, and it comes with many bad side effects such as suicide, promiscuity, codependancy, drug abuse, alcoholism, depression, etcs. A 1997 study by the well-known Journal of Sex Research reported that 10%-15% of gay men had 501-1000 partners in their life, and an additional 10%-15% stated they had over a thousand partners in their life. Most gays answered between 101-500 partners. This is ridiculously high. According to International Journal of Epidemiology, the average homosexual's life expectance at age 20 is 20 years less than heterosexual men. Finally, according to the CDC, 64% of AIDS victims got AIDS because of gay activity.\n \n Is that evidence enough that homosexuality is disordered?\n\n \n No it is only evidence that some one has an agenda against gay men. The sad thing is that we are told by society that we are sick. When we try and settle down and make families for ourselves we are told we can't do that. So on the one hand we are told we are evil because we are promiscuous and oin the other hand we are told we can't form stable families.\n \n Did you look into the statistics for heterosexual sex? \n \n BTW it is just an opinion that \n \nand an additional 10%-15% stated they had over a thousand partners in their life. Most gays answered between 101-500 partners. This is ridiculously high. \n\n So what if someone wants a 1000 sex partners is it really any of anyones busisness. This post is proof that conservates want government out of their pocketbook and government to control other peoples personal lives.\n \n Also somone hasn't answered my claim that conservates are trying to destroy gay and lesbian families. There are other reasons, besides children, that people get married.",

This is often seen in families where a father is absent due to death or divorce.\nSingle parent families have always been common through death in earlier times or divorce in later. And it is difficult to seperate the damage done by grief or divorce and the unbalanced nature of only a single parent from the specific need for both sexes to be represented. \n \n Here in the UK, single people (including gays) were able to adopt, just not as a couple, so this clearly isn't the issue being fought on here.\n \nSecondly, homosexuality is a disorder, and it comes with many bad side effects such as suicide, promiscuity, codependancy, drug abuse, alcoholism, depression, etcs.\n'Disorder' is hopelessly subjective. It's different from the norm, certainly. But high intelligence is also a disorder in this respect, and is also associated with suicide, drug abuse and depression. In the case of homosexuality, if there is a correlation it is more than likely a result of how gays are treated.\n \nA 1997 study by the well-known Journal of Sex Research reported that 10%-15% of gay men had 501-1000 partners in their life, and an additional 10%-15% stated they had over a thousand partners in their life.

Secondly, even if they are true such generalisations cannot be applied to all gay people, nor can we take promiscuity as 'wrong' unless it is a breach of trust.",

Throughout nature this is found, \n\n Bzz! Wrong! It is quite common in nature for same-sex couples to adopt orphaned animals.\n \n \nand should the child not be raised by a mother and a father together, it can be very destructive for the child, specifically for males if the father is absent. This is often seen in families where a father is absent due to death or divorce. \n\n How? They don't know how to drink beer and play baseball? OMG! They'll never survive!\n \n \nSecondly, homosexuality is a disorder, \n\n Tell that to both APA's. They disagree with you--have since the '70s.\n \n \nand it comes with many bad side effects such as suicide, \n\n No, that's a side-effect of everyone hating you\n \n \npromiscuity\n\n Well, when you're in the closet til you're 30 and never had the whole \"learning about mature relationships\" thing in high school, of course there'll be some of that. At the age of 30, due to never being able to have a relationship, they are still testing the waters.\n \ncodependancy\n\n What? They like to be with their partners? What's your point?\n \n \ndrug abuse, alcoholism, depression, etcs. \n\n More side-effects of everyone hating you. I know someone that said they took drugs and drank so they'd be dead before anyone could love them in the way they wanted to be loved. If that makes no sense, I'll explain. He wanted a man to love him, but he was afraid. He was afraid his family and friends and everyone else would hate him. So, he figured \"live fast, die young--before I find a man\". If he didn't have to fear being hated, guess what? He wouldn't need that XXXX. As to depression, like I said, it's what happens when you feel like the whole world hates you.\n \n \nA 1997 study by the well-known Journal of Sex Research reported that 10%-15% of gay men had 501-1000 partners in their life, and an additional 10%-15% stated they had over a thousand partners in their life.\n\n Given the bathhouses of the 80s, I wouldn't be surprised at the number of partners. However, things have changed. There are lots of monogamous people now. There aren't bathhouse-psychos anymore. Also, people would just find a \"quicky\" because they *couldn't* be monogamous without ridicule. They had to hide behind their wives and act straight by day.\n \n \n Most gays answered between 101-500 partners. This is ridiculously high. \n\n Given the no-interviewing-minors thing...they probably interviewed old people from the 70s/80s that did stupid stuff--not educated people who knew better than to do that and who are more comfortable with themselves\n \nAccording to International Journal of Epidemiology, the average homosexual's life expectance at age 20 is 20 years less than heterosexual men. \n\n As society changes to allow gay people to lead normal lives instead of forcing them to distance themselves and try to escape reality, this gap decreases. If you just let them be themselves and people stop hating, they will have no reason to prefer illusion to reality because reality will not be bad to them. So, be nice and they'll live just as long and have happy, normal lives. Or do you like when people die young?\n \n \nFinally, according to the CDC, 64% of AIDS victims got AIDS because of gay activity.\n\n And when did they get HIV? See, thanks to technological advances, many people more recently infected don't get AIDS and just live with HIV. If someone has full-blown AIDS, they likely were infected quite a while ago. Possibly back when being gay was *really* taboo and they had random partners because they didn't want their wives to know blah blah blah\n \nIs that evidence enough that homosexuality is disordered?\n\n You used that as an adjective to modify....what? Ignoring the odd grammar, that doesn't make being gay a disorder. It means that society is giving gay people problems that they didn't have to begin with.",

   "It is a common misconception that liberals confuse anti-homosexuality with anti-homosexual. The two words are fundamentally linked, of course, but are not equivalents, at least as far as I've understood the issue.\n\n \n As true as this may be, the practice of the difference here is not universally known or utilized. Just as those who say they are against drugs take their frustrations out upon drug users, so to do those who are \"against\" homosexuality take their frustrations out against homosexuals. We've seen this in practice time and time again. From senceless murders of innocent gays and lesbians to governmental restrictions of full human equality towards homosexuals. \n \n \nBecause of this, most homosexuals disregard conservatives who are against homosexuality as \"anti-gay, anti-liberal traditionalists\". Of course, many conservatives (and I assure you, many liberals too) are anti-homosexual-groups such as \"God Hates Fags\" are considered the general belief of most conservatives, when in reality that is simply not the case.\n\n \n The problem is that even if what you say is actually the case, those who actually have a real impact on homosexuals and their lives are the ones who influence the idea that said concervatives are all \"out to get\" homosexuals. \n Maybe a bit of introspective thought by law makers and religious leaders is necessary here.\n \n \nMost conservatives are indifferent about the issue, most of them culturally accept it, like many liberals.\n\n \n With the obvious exception of yourself, for if you truly were/are so indifferent you wouldn't be commenting here.\n \n \n \nTo prove my point, I shall compare two separate dialogues with a liberal and conservative. The liberal, a 20-year-old Sophmore at San Francisco State University, said that gay marriage was a right, as homosexuals have done nothing wrong. I asked her two questions. My first question was \"What do you think the conservative view is?\", her response was that \"homosexuals are sinners and are destined for hell\". The second question was \"Have you ever thought that maybe homosexuals are doing something wrong?\" and she immediately was irritated that I asked such a \"radical\" question and said \"Of course they aren't doing anything wrong. Nothing more wrong than when two people fall in love; when two people get married... it's the same\". The second interview was with a conservative resident of San Jose, California. When I asked him what he thought about homosexuality, he said it was a \"disgusting perversion... gay marriage should be outlawed\", and when I asked him why he said \"because it's immoral... it hurts society\". However, he wasn't able explain why it hurt society. I have also had many dialogues with conservatives and liberals alike, and they all come up with similar answers, occasionally being debatable. The truth of the matter is most liberals and conservatives don't actually understand the issue, and people like \"God Hates Fags\" are one of these.\n\n \n You seem to have a keen interest in the most extremist of ultra-concervative hate groups here. \n My question to you is this: \n Do you believe in God? \n \n If your responce is positive then I must also ask:\n \n Do you believe your God to be a loving God? \n \n Again, if your responce is positive I must continue: \n \n If you believe your God to be a loving God, do you also believe He loves all his \"children\" equally and uncondonditionally as a \"parent\" would? \n \n Once more if your responce is postive I'll ask one more: \n \n If you believe your God to be a loving, bennevolent God, loving His children unconditionally as a parent, then why would this same God create an entire portion of his children just to be hated, beaten, ruled against and even murdered? \n \n I'd love to read your responces to these questions.\n \n \n \nWhat is the true conservative belief? The conservative belief is such: \"We don't hate homosexuals; we find homosexuality a damaging act\". \n\n \n Well, since you've taken it upon yourself to speak for the entire concervative population, I must ask: How is homosexuality damaging? Damaging to whom, to what, in what way? \n \n \nThe belief is that homosexuality is essentially a disorder, and is against nature to commit the act.\n\n \n How is it a disorder when every reputable mental health group agrees it is not? Homosexuality has been removed from the APA list of disorders. Don't try to argue the why or how, the fact remains that no matter what the motivation was at the time to remove homosexuality from this list it remains \"off the books\" as a disorder to this day, thirty years later. \n \n If it is so \"against nature\" then explain why other species of animals have been documented as developing long lasting homosexual relationships as well? If it's so \"against nature\" they why hasn't homosexuality been \"bred out\" of society yet? Wouldn't it go \"against nature\" for this \"disorder\" to survive? \n \n \n \n Allow me to distinguish this from one who is \"anti-homosexual\". An \"Anti-homosexual\" is essentially a \"homophobe\", in the sense that he is either afraid or hateful of homosexuals. Remarkably, there are fewer of these than we realize. Liberals often misuse the definition on conservatives who are against gay marriage or sodomy.\n\n \n Let us set the record straight here. (no pun intended) Sodomy doesn't mean homosexual anal sex, it mean anal sex on a much more generalized playing field. The real truth is that many heterosexuals not only practice sodomy with their opposite gender partners, but more and more teenage girls are \"opting\" for anal and oral sex than ever before. The blame here lies in the push to restrict real world safe sex education in schools. \n \n \n The truth of the matter is that many of these people, specifically more prominent conservatives, do not fall into the category of homophobia. \n\n \n This comment is an absolute lie. It's the \"prominent\" concervatives which are giving the soft-spoken and even accepting concervatives a bad reputation.\n Pat Robertson, President Bush, Governor Schwartzenager, Senator Santorum, and all the law makers and religious leaders who have either spoken out against gay marriage, gay employment equality and gay adoption...inclusive. \n \n \n \nJust my two cents.\n\n \n Which is about all this post has been worth.",
