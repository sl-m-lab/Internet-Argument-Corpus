   "Ok. So I have been wondering what actually constitutes interstate commerce. For example, Person 1 lives in State A. This person goes to another state to buy something. He pays taxes and all and takes the item back with him to State A. Is that Interstate commerce? The act of buying, transporting, etc was done already under the Interstate commerce act. Person 1 will not be selling the item in his state, therefore he will not be doing anything related to commerce in state A...OR another example. Person 1 is accompanied by person 2, both are from state A. Now person 1 buys the said item in another state and then gives that item to person 2. Than they both go back together to state A. Would that be interstate commerce? If so why, please give links to viable sources, etc to verify. Thanks.",

   "Meh, this is actually a constitutional question that has long sense been ignored. The courts have decided that interstate commerce means pretty much anything that isn't 100% within the state (for example all parts, raw materials, labor, seller, buyer) which is a rather poor meaning.",
