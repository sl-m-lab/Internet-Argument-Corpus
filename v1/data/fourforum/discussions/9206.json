The absence of homosexuality in teaching and discussion suggests to children that homosexuality is abnormal.",

Your so called Christian morality is offensive and oppressive to your fellow citizens who are homosexuals.

You have a burden of proof there to prove your claims.\n\n The burden of proof has already been met Jyoshu.\n MARRIAGE is a civil right.\n The right to privacy, and not have that right infringed upon for the interest of sexual morality oppression, is also a right.\n There are NUMEROUS rights that the anti-gay cause has violated on the issue of gays. Firing gays for just being gay. The list goes on and on.",

My son has never learned that one kind of people are less valuable or moral than another based on inherent traits. He would never bully a kid for being part of a Christian family. I would never ask that books of any kind be removed from a library or call their presence a religious agenda. I am not the hypocrite here.\n \n By the way - before you make judgment calls on my son's school you might want to know some facts - like maybe where he goes to school.",

Your value is to treat a certain type of people, who are gay, as though they do not exist.

If this is true, heterosexuals also exist merely by being. There is no need to have any discussion of heterosexual coupling, such as when Cinderella gets her prince.

He asserts that while same-sex behavior is sometimes found in\n captivity, it is actually seen more frequently in studies of animals in the\n wild.\n \n Among birds, for instance, studies show that 10 to 15 percent of female\n western gulls in some populations in the wild are homosexual. Females\n perform courtship rituals, like tossing their heads at each other or\n offering small gifts of food to each other, and they establish nests\n together.

Their bonds, too, may\n persist for years.\n \n Among mammals, male and female bottlenose dolphins frequently engage in\n homosexual activity, both in captivity and in the wild. Homosexuality is\n particularly common among young male dolphin calves. One male may protect\n another that is resting or healing from wounds inflicted by a predator. When\n one partner dies, the other may search for a new male mate. Researchers have\n noted that in some cases same-sex behavior is more common for dolphins in\n captivity.\n \n Male and female rhesus macaques, a type of monkey, also exhibit\n homosexuality in captivity and in the wild. Males are affectionate to each\n other, touching, holding and embracing. Females smack their lips at each\n other and play games like hide-and-seek, peek-a-boo and follow the leader.\n And both sexes mount members of their own sex.\n \n http://www.queermarriage.com/index.php?content=showNews&nID=52",

   "Name me anything non-factual about this book.\n\n \n That's not the point, Foundit! Would you want a factual book about death row in an elementary school library? How about abortion? Because those too are controversial issues in our society--a national debate--just like homosexuality issues. It isn't whether or not it's factual that is the determining factor here whether it should be in an elem. school library. \n \n \nActually, YES. I would. \"Controversial\" is too lame of a wicket for exclusion. \n\n \n Really???? For 2nd graders??? You'd want them to get in on controversial issues like abortion and the death penalty?? Hey, let's throw in safe sex and STD prevention while we're at it! emoticon_wow Wow. And I'm sorry but I just don't believe for a second you'd want a book about Christianity in such a library, given your beliefs about church and state.\n \n \nWHAT is the issue behind the book?\n That gays exist?\n It doesn't say \"Vote yes for gay marriage\".\n The best you can try is to tie it to \"gay pride\", and even that's a pretty lame attempt.\n\n \n No, the issue is gay parenting and adoption. Obviously. And a message that \"being gay is ok\". The very fact this forum is here is testimony to the fact that there is a huge debate in society about all this. Take some of the other forum topics here--abortion, gun control, cloning, euthanasia, teen pregnancy, etc. and I doubt you'd want many of those targeting 2nd graders. (well, maybe I'm wrong--I don't know, now!) But you seem to think that one of the MOST controversial ones (homosexuality) should be made known to them. \n \n And let's face it: if you DO think such controversial issues as these should be in elementary schools, I doubt you'd last very long as the school librarian or a teacher to those 2nd and 3rd graders when the school board, administration, and community parents found out you were going into all these issues.\n \n \nOh give me a fricken break.\n We have all sorts of books out there that sound \"lame\" but that the kids love.\n Have you ever watched Sponge Bob? Tele-tubbies?\n Oh wait. Your side accuses those of being gay too...\n \n Regardless, a penguin couple adopting a little penguin? Cute. Cuddly. Family.\n \"Happily ever after\" stuff?\n Yeah. I don't see why you couldn't think it would make a story book as a heterosexual story.\n Have you ever read Dr. Seuss????\n\n \n Wow, I didn't realize you saw the world through such a lens of sexuality. Foundit, MOST things don't center around sexuality. Believe it or not, there's a big world out there and most people just really don't think of things in those terms. Cinderella was NOT written to celebrate heterosexuality. There is NO straight pride movement behind it, or pushing it.\n \n \nThat's a ridiculous statement. You claim you have kids? Did you ever buy them kid's books?\n Ever READ them??? You obviously have no clue what goes into a kid's book.\n\n \n You mean like all those children's books about teen pregnancy or internet censorship? Or womens' right to choose? LOL . Yeah, Foundit. I don't have a clue. emoticon_xdonno \n \n \nThe penguins would sell as a heterosexual story too.\n\n \n Yes it would--but heterosexuality is NOT a controversial national debate. Sorry, but it's just not. Homoseuxality IS. Maybe there will come a time when that debate is settled and it doesn't occupy a position among other major social controversies of our time, but until then, how about letting my kid grow up at a kid's pace rather than an adult one, will you?? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nThen tell me Jyoshu. How EXACTLY can sexual orientation be presented or examined in schools so that it doesn't offend your \"controversial\" complaint?\n\n \n It CAN'T, right now anyway.

   "That's exactly what it is. Do you not realize this is all part of the same thing? Parades, rainbow flags, getting the gay pride message in schools, etc.? It's ALL about visibility.\n\n \n Since it is all about visibility, you are saying this is your issue. You don't want gay to be visible. It's really not about the type of visibility, just visibility itself.\n \n \nNow I'll grant you this book was more subtle that these examples. Butto say this book is simply about penguins is just disingenuous. And even if the author didn't intend there to be some social commentary message there (which I don't believe for a second), it will be taken that way by elements of you movement.\n\n \n What is the social commentary message that will be taken by which elements of my movement? Perhaps you could also define for me what you think my movement is, and if being gay or in a same-sex relationship exists as a reality outside a movement, as it does for the penguins.\n \n \nAgain, this is a controversial issue. We aren't talking about something cut and dry, accepted by even most people. Society isn't really on your side here.\n\n \n Oh really? I feel homosexuality is generally accepted in society. There are many who do not, sure, but simple controversy is not a reason to suppress knowledge. We would never learn anything new, and remain backwoods hicks forever. Learning involves looking at the world around you and asking questions. \n \n \nBut even if more of them were, we can do better than use schools for social movement battlegrounds. We can do better for our kids than that.\n \n \n \n \n \n I'm all for \"looking at why it bothers some\", just not not using schools as the battleground. Do it somewhere that doesn't distract from education.\n\n \n You are peddling paranoia, ignorance and fear here. You are promoting that people walk around with self-imposed blinders. You are not advancing education.\n \n \nBut even then, at least there's not really a national debate about it going on. It's not that that book itself is controversial--it's that the issue behind it that is controversial and little kids aren't ready for it any more than they would be for a book about abortion or capital punishement. Get it?\n\n \n There are a lot of issues involved in this book that kids can understand. Such as family, and family love. Why couldn't kids understand that there are same-sex couples and families in the world, among their friends, maybe also their own family? You mistakenly think you can isolate them from it. You want to try to, by not allowing this book, but that isn't going to do it.\n \n \nOh puhleeeeeeaaaesse. emoticon_rolleyes Do you actually think this book would have been written if not for the homosexual overtones and social commentary about two same-gender beings raising a younger one? Are you THAT out of touch with reality? How about the books out there on 2 daddies, or whatever? They are there to promote some social message on a very controversial issue.\n\n \n Well, duh, no a book with a gay theme, would not be written, if it were a straight theme. Every book has some sort of message, including the ones that present straight couples. What is the message in the gay books you object to? Is it the fact that they are gay and living their lives in society with the same acceptance and purposes that straights do? \n \n \nEr, no. The element that changed was that one has a very controversial and jury's-still-out national debate behind it, that probably wouldn't have been written otherwise. The other is pretty much just a book about a young woman that wanted to go to the ball and overcame her evil stepmother and sisters with some magical help. Please don't tell me you don't understand the difference there (and that it ain't just gender!).\n\n \n Wow.

   "Since it is all about visibility, you are saying this is your issue. You don't want gay to be visible. It's really not about the type of visibility, just visibility itself.\n\n \n Well sure, of course it's about visibility to an extent, because there's a national debate going on about this. It's like saying you want the issue of abortion visible to 2nd graders. Depending on the situation, visibility isn't automatically the best option.\n \n \na.) What is the social commentary message that will be taken by which elements of my movement? b.) Perhaps you could also define for me what you think my movement is, c.) and if being gay or in a same-sex relationship exists as a reality outside a movement, as it does for the penguins.\n\n \n a.) In this case the social movement involves acceptance of homosexuality as ok, a view of gay adoption and parenting. Now, in and of themselves, I have no problem with gay adoption. But I DO have a problem with a debate like that being played out among little kids because that's not the place for this debate, IMO. Let's put it this way: if you are going to allow THAT stance, then you need to allow the counter views, to be fair. Is that a debate you really want 2nd graders to be in on? Maybe you really do. I don't. They need to be learning to read, write, and do math, among other things.\n \n b.) Your movement, as I see it, takes one side of the national debate on homoseuxality issues. It's goals are to see homosexuality as completely accepted and morally ok, for marriage to be redefined, and for religion to accept it. But none of that is really the issue here--there are elements to the gay pride goals that I agree with. What is at issue here, IMO, is whether that debate should play out in an elementary school.\n \n c.) Yes, being gay exists outside the movement. I'm not sure why that's pertinent here, though.\n \n \nOh really? I feel homosexuality is generally accepted in society. \n\n \n Hogwash. It's a facade. It looks that way because it's politically correct these days to say so and for someone to LOOK like they are supporting the gay pride movement. But let's face it: ballot initiatives usually pass by a wide margin every time gay marriage comes up for a vote. That pretty much tells the real story, because people are able to vote in anonymity.\n \n \nsimple controversy is not a reason to suppress knowledge. We would never learn anything new, and remain backwoods hicks forever. Learning involves looking at the world around you and asking questions.\n\n \n I'd agree with the general population where parents can monitor what their kids are getting to some extent, but not directly to 2nd and 3rd graders, or younger. By your logic of \"controversy-doesn't-matter\" we might as well be explaining the ins-and-outs of abortion and how people are fried in an electric chair. You just don't open the floodgates and allow any and every controversial issue at little kids. Your fear-peddling idea that refusing to do that would produce backwood hicks is downright funny.\n \n \n ... You are not advancing education.\n\n \n No, I'm not advancing controversial debate. Controvery and education are not the same thing, particularly for little children.\n \n \nThere are a lot of issues involved in this book that kids can understand. Such as family, and family love.\n\n \n So you'd be fine approaching it completely from the standpoint of family love and not bringing the gay message into it at all??? That it could be explained as merely two good friends raising a youngling as a family? Good.\n \n \nWhy couldn't kids understand that there are same-sex couples and families in the world, among their friends, maybe also their own family?\n\n \n Because that's no less than a national debate than abortion or capital punishement. That view is ONE side of the debate, and if you are going to push this debate into elementary schools, you have to allow the other side. The best solution is to not take the debate to little kids.\n \n \nWell, duh, no a book with a gay theme, would not be written, if it were a straight theme. Every book has some sort of message, including the ones that present straight couples. \n\n \n But if there happens to be a straight couple in the book, it's theme is NOT about being straight, as you seem to think. Listen carefully, because neither you nor Foundit seem to get this: Cinderella (as an example) is NOT about being straight, straight pride, or anything pertaining to straight. It's NOT about sexuality. That's NOT the theme. I've NEVER seen a book with straight sexuality as a point of pride being a theme.\n \n \nWhat is the message in the gay books you object to? Is it the fact that they are gay and living their lives in society with the same acceptance and purposes that straights do? \n\n \n It's the fact you're peddling one side of a controversial issue debate here to little children than I have a problem with. There are elements of your movement's message I agree with, but that doesn't mean I think it should be snuck in on kids in the form of a penguin book.",

What about books about having sex? Playboy? Those probably won't make them have nightmares. This gets back to socially unacceptable again.

I asked you to prove an absolute. If you think being gay is 100% wrong then this assumes an absolute. I would like you to tell what this absolute is. For example, the christian God is an absolute to some...ie, what is right and what is wrong is not relative but is a set standard set by God (in my example). If you don't believe in an absolute then you can never say something is 100% for sure right and you have to admit that you could be wrong or no one is right...something like that.\n \n \nRegardless, as usual, you have ignored my entire argument.\n HOW do you prove something is \"not wrong\"?\n You demonstrate that there is no grounds for it to be considered as wrong.\n It's a proving the negative issue.\nstttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttrawman\n \n You can't make your own argument and then claim I said it.\n \n \n\n As I have pointed out in the past, there is a HUGE difference inbetween \"society\" and the \"government\".\n The \"society\" can make whatever moral value judgments they please.\n The \"government\" is held to higher standards.\n \n If you don't want to prove that there is a legitimate state interest for the society's prejudice to be expressed in law, so be it.\n Makes my job a whole hell of a lot easier...\nok? Society makes laws. The people appointed to develop these laws and carry them out is called the government. I think we got this part. The only \"higher standard\" the government is held to is, in general, being a servant to the people (society). \n \n As for \"legitimate state interest\"...this phrase sounds good but has no meaning. The only \"legitimate state interest\" is listening to the people and what they value. Even so, who decides what a \"legitimate state interest\" is? Seems rather subjective...perhaps we should do what we always do when it comes to having differences of opinion...VOTE. Back to having it decided by the people again.",

This gets back to socially unacceptable again.\n\n No. This gets back to the standards I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT which are invoked in assigning a rating to movies or music.\n Standards we ALREADY HAVE which are satisfied by these books.\n But you want to add NEW standards with boundarieless words like \"controversial\"...\n \n \n \nI wish I had ignored it because the post you made sounds to me something like this: Me: \"I think green beans taste bad\". You: \"WHAT!!! you are an idiot! Green beans taste bad...how could you think anything different?\"\n\n And instead of ignoring it, you're HARPING ON IT while refuting none of what I actually said about what YOU actually said.\n Funny how that works out. You continue to claim I'm wrong, but you give nobody any actual reason or way in which I was supposedly wrong.\n And you're still talking about it, even though you seem to wish you hadn't...\n :xbanghead \n \n \n \nFor the third time. I asked you to prove an absolute. If you think being gay is 100% wrong then this assumes an absolute. I would like you to tell what this absolute is.\n\n Steeeve, maybe you're not getting me.\n YOU assume gay is an issue of \"right\" or \"wrong\". I don't.\n Gay is no more \"right\" than straight is.\n Gay is no more \"wrong\" than straight is.\n Horse is no more \"wrong\" than donkey is.\n \n Get the picture?\n You're asking me to \"prove\" something which I don't really hold to in the first place. It's like asking me how tall oxygen is.\n \n \n \n For example, the christian God is an absolute to some...ie, what is right and what is wrong is not relative but is a set standard set by God (in my example). If you don't believe in an absolute then you can never say something is 100% for sure right and you have to admit that you could be wrong or no one is right...something like that.\n\n Maybe we should start with whatever statement I made which prompted you to ask me to prove \"100% right\" in the first place.\n What did I say?\n \n \n \nstttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttrawman\n You can't make your own argument and then claim I said it.\n\n I'm sorry, were you just trying to provide an EXAMPLE of a strawman argument?\n Or try to pretend that I made one?\n \n Because if it's the first, you succeeded.\n If it's the second, maybe you should go back and re-read.\n I never claimed that you said that.\n I was talking about how the conversation NEEDED to proceed.\n Obviously, you don't want to go there.\n \n \n \nok? Society makes laws. The people appointed to develop these laws and carry them out is called the government. I think we got this part. The only \"higher standard\" the government is held to is, in general, being a servant to the people (society). \n\n Wrong. Very wrong.\n If that were true, then the founding fathers would have written in \"simple majority rules\" into the constitution, and left it at that.\n The numerous amendments demonstrate that there IS a higher standard that the government is held to. Equal protection. Legitimate state interests. etc.\n \n You keep wanting to ignore these things and focus only on the voting, but that doesn't make the other aspects disappear.\n \n \n \nAs for \"legitimate state interest\"...this phrase sounds good but has no meaning. The only \"legitimate state interest\" is listening to the people and what they value.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Steeeeve, this discussion is never going to work if you just sit around and say, \"Well, the sky has no definition. It's the entire universe.\"\n You can't just claim a word has no meaning just because YOU MAKE UP a meaning that hsa no meaning.\n There are numerous court rulings establishing that the prejudice of the people is NOT a legitimate state interest.\n You saying otherwise is not an argument.\n \n Why should we throw equal protection out the window just because the people say so???\n \n \n \nEven so, who decides what a \"legitimate state interest\" is? Seems rather subjective...perhaps we should do what we always do when it comes to having differences of opinion...VOTE. Back to having it decided by the people again.\n\n The same people who usually \"decide\". Or maybe JUDGE is a better word.\n The JUDGES. People we employ to make these types of decisions.\n \n You're just complaining because it's not going your way. You're just complaining because you WANT a simple majority to be enough to decide.\n \n Segregation was ended by judges and \"legitimate state interest\" AGAINST the will of the people. Was that wrong?\n Ending interracial marriage was ended by judges and \"legitimate state interest\" AGAINST the will of the people. Was that wrong?\n Hell. Alabama still had an interracial marriage law ON THE BOOKS until about the end of the last century. By your way of thinking, their interracial marriage law should have been enforceable up until it was removed.\n \n There is a REASON that the system is set up like it is. And over and over again you pretend that ignoring those reasons, and just pretending that the words that have a clearly defined meaning mean whatever you say, is an argument.\n It isn't.",

   "What I want to know is why should homosexual relationships be considered disgusting and immoral, and answer this without involving religion please, because that seems to be the only excuse that people have: \"because the Bible says so.\" Really, well if the Bible hinted that heterosexual relationships were evil and wicked, would those of a heterosexual preference appreciate being discriminated against? Honestly take this into consideration. Would you want your partner, children, and yourself to be denied as a family because something that can't even be proven as fact is condemning you? \n \n I know there are people out there who are teaching their children to hate those they have never met, those they don't even know. We are imprinting our children with our own beliefs, not allowing them to think for themselves anymore. \n \n What school aims to accomplish is to teach children FACT, which is why I understand that religion should not be taught. I'm not saying that religion is a horrible thing, because there are many positives that can be accounted for and it can set morals for an individual. However, religion still remains a belief, and a belief is merely for the individual. You can't prove it, you can't see it or touch it. But what is fact is that not all homosexual people are horrible beings just as not all heterosexual people are horrible beings. What harm is caused by teaching your children about their environment in a healthy manner? To acknowledge, in a neutral manner, neither promoting or demoting, that homosexuality does exist, is merely telling the truth. I see no harm in telling the truth.

   "Well sure, of course it's about visibility to an extent, because there's a national debate going on about this.\n\n \n That doesn't make sense. \n \n \nIt's like saying you want the issue of abortion visible to 2nd graders. Depending on the situation, visibility isn't automatically the best option.\n\n \n I didn't say it was always the best option. Why is it not an option when it comes to homosexuality? There are some important differences. The fact that the two issues are debated, does not make them similar. \n \n \na.) In this case the social movement involves acceptance of homosexuality as ok, a view of gay adoption and parenting. Now, in and of themselves, I have no problem with gay adoption. But I DO have a problem with a debate like that being played out among little kids because that's not the place for this debate, IMO. Let's put it this way: if you are going to allow THAT stance, then you need to allow the counter views, to be fair. Is that a debate you really want 2nd graders to be in on? Maybe you really do. I don't.\n\n \n I don't believe the basic human right to be treated with dignity and fairness needs to be debated here. Clearly the kids are already picking up on this topic, as we see horrible homophobic names being called among classmates. What problem do you have with just letting the fact that these families and people exist, who are gay, be presented showing basic human respect? What is wrong with sharing knowledge without judgment and condemnation and a narrow and closed minded prejudiced view? Doing so, is not taking the side of gays. \n \n \nc.) Yes, being gay exists outside the movement. I'm not sure why that's pertinent here, though.\n\n \n Because you seem to think it's all part of an agenda, whenever gay is presented or made visible.\n \n \nHogwash. It's a facade. It looks that way because it's politically correct these days to say so and for someone to LOOK like they are supporting the gay pride movement. But let's face it: ballot initiatives usually pass by a wide margin every time gay marriage comes up for a vote. That pretty much tells the real story, because people are able to vote in anonymity.\n\n \n That is incorrect. Those opposed may have more motivation to vote, and not everyone does vote. These are not scientific polls. Also, these amendments dealt with marriage, not homosexuality.\n \n \nI'd agree with the general population where parents can monitor what their kids are getting to some extent, but not directly to 2nd and 3rd graders, or younger. By your logic of \"controversy-doesn't-matter\" we might as well be explaining the ins-and-outs of abortion and how people are fried in an electric chair.\n\n \n Sheesh, in and of itself controversy doesn't matter. There are other reasons to not get into certain discussion pertaining to abortion or detailed execution. There clearly is age-appropriate material for any topic. I repeat these topics are not the same thing, simply because there is debate.\n \n \nYour fear-peddling idea that refusing to do that would produce backwood hicks is downright funny.\n\n \n Nope. There would be no progress, no new learning, if that were the only reason we used to suppress knowledge.\n \n \nSo you'd be fine approaching it completely from the standpoint of family love and not bringing the gay message into it at all??? That it could be explained as merely two good friends raising a youngling as a family? Good.\n\n \n Would you be fine with it being two friends if it they were a straight couple? Everytime a straight couple is mentioned, it is a friend or a roomate, even when it is mom and dad, I think not.\n \n \nThat view is ONE side of the debate, and if you are going to push this debate into elementary schools, you have to allow the other side. The best solution is to not take the debate to little kids.\n\n \n They already know homosexuality exists, because your side must attack what it wants to suppress in society.\n \n \nBut if there happens to be a straight couple in the book, it's theme is NOT about being straight, as you seem to think. Listen carefully, because neither you nor Foundit seem to get this: Cinderella (as an example) is NOT about being straight, straight pride, or anything pertaining to straight. It's NOT about sexuality. That's NOT the theme. I've NEVER seen a book with straight sexuality as a point of pride being a theme.\n\n \n Then why aren't Cinderalla and the Prince presented as two friends, if it is not about sexuality? They are definately presented as more than just friends. Wow. Are you really this wilfully blind or dense?\n \n \nIt's the fact you're peddling one side of a controversial issue debate here to little children than I have a problem with. There are elements of your movement's message I agree with, but that doesn't mean I think it should be snuck in on kids in the form of a penguin book.\n\n \n \"Snuck in on kids\", you claim by a whole movement. Yet you also acknowledge that homosexuality exists as a reality in society, outside of the movement. Now, aren't you being paranoid?",

I think it's funny how the idea of a healthy traditional marriage between a man and women is, these days, often portrayed as a \"fantasy\" like Ozzie and Harriet. It's almost like liberals sometimes WANT marriages to be unhappy and fail. I find this fascinating. The fact is, there are many, many happy marriages--very traditional ones--in society. I happen to be in one. It's no fantasy! It's very real and just because you didn't grow up around it or live in a different sort of family doesn't mean others don't. (Isn't it funny that people who think this employ the same assumptions about traditional families that their opponents employ over non-traditional ones? :p )\n \n I also find it interesting how critics of the traditional family sometimes equate it with patriarchal way of doing things, or in some cases even asserting it's abusive. It's sad really, how liberalism has decided to have no tolerance for traditional values EVEN when those traditional values are good and ok, and people in them are happy. \n \n Believe it or not, many traditional marriages aren't abusive, they aren't patriarchal, and the family members happen to be very happy people.

It says that we who are gay, who are just being ourselves, are not \"ok\", \"not normal\", not accepted. This clearly leads to exclusion.",

   "Foundit, do you not realize that movies are often rated R because of gay-related issues in the movie? When was the last time you saw a rated PG movie with 2 men kissing? By the standards you're calling for here, the book probably wouldn't be available for the children to read. So ... care to revamp those standards? emoticon_xangel \n\n Care to prove your standards?\n Can you show me any movie that would have gotten a \"PG\" rating if a woman were substituted for the man?\n \n \n \nYou're missing the point. It's not a matter of degree, it's a matter of the kids need to be reading and being taught matters that pertain to education: you know--reading, writing, math, geography ... Not social awareness that so-and-so has 2 dads. It's not the school's place to instill values.\n\n I'm not \"missing the point\". You're CHANGING the point.\n I was talking about your absurdly arbitrary and inane standard of using \"controversial\" for deciding that things shouldn't be present on the bookshelves of schools.\n This book isn't \"social awareness\". It's a factual book about penguins.\n And it DOES NOT instill values. Quote me the \"values\" that this book teaches...\n \n \n \nFoundit, you don't have a clue here. No, I don't think a book should be there trying to instill the values of accepting interracial marriage. (not because I disapprove of the values, but because that's not the place to push it!) If they do because of what their parents taught them, that's great. But let the school be a school, for cryin' out loud, not an activism site.\n\n I'm not talking about a book \"instilling the values\". The penguin book DOES NOT instill values.\n I'm talking about a book that has a white cinderella and a black prince.\n \n But I guess you answered my question.\n You're consistent in caving to prejudice...\n \n \n \nAs I said above, this misses the point. It's not a matter of degree.\n\n Not a matter of degree?\n What is it a matter of then. How does one judge whether or not \"controversial\" should be a standard for rejecting a book from the school shelves? Explain yourself.\n \n \n \n? Of course I don't expect them to lie or be hidden. I don't see that has anything to do with the debate being played out in schools.\n\n How is that any less \"controversial\" than this book?\n How is that any less qualified as an \"agenda pushing\" statement than the book is?\n \n It has EVERYTHING to do with the debate because it exposes the hypocrisy of your standards.",

   "Education News CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will not conduct a formal review of a book which it originally banned because some people felt it promoted homosexuality.\n \n The school system last month banned \"And Tango Makes Three.\" The book tells about two male penguins in New York's Central Park Zoo who paired up and hatched an adopted egg.\n \n Superintendent Peter Gorman says top staffers mistakenly sidestepped a formal process and pulled the book from four elementary school libraries after some people questioned the controversial but true story.\n \n Gorman initially said the school system would convene a staff committee to review whether the book is appropriate for young children. He said his chief of staff would file a complaint based on what parents had told Gorman. A spokeswoman for the school system says a staff attorney basically nixed that idea.\n \n Now, the book will be reviewed only if parents ask for its removal. Officials say that hasn't happened. \n http://www.myfoxwghp.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=2018893&version=1&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=3.8.1",
