   "Calif. Senate Passes Gay Marriage Bill\n by Mark Worrall 365Gay.com San Francisco Bureau \n \n Posted: September 1, 2005 2:53 pm ET \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Sacramento, California) The California Senate on Thursday became the first elected state body in the country to pass legislation to allow same-sex couples to marry. \n Called the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, the bill would require local clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but allow people opposed to gay marriage to refuse to conduct weddings.\n \n The measure passed 21 to 15 - a majority larger than marriage advocates had expected..\n \n The vote followed more than an hour of impassioned debate.\n \n Now is the time to answer for ourselves, 'what is the right thing to do.?' For me, my higher power tells me, 'love one another'\" said Senator Nell Soto. \"That is embedded in my inspiration. Let us be judged as a group of tolerance and of hope. I urge your support for this bill. Love one another, not judge one another.\"\n \n The legislation now moves to the Assembly where it is in for a rough ride. A similar measure was defeated by four votes earlier this year when a quarter of the Democrats voted with Republicans to reject it. (story) \n \n At that time the legislation was considered dead - at least for the rest of this session. But, Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) - the bill's author and one of six openly gay members of the Legislature - refused to give up. \n \n In a surprise move Leno attached the measure as an amendment to a marine bill that was already in committee in the Senate. \n \n It was that bill that the Senate passed Thursday. \n \n \"Today represents another milestone toward the fulfillment of the American dream for thousands of lesbian and gay couples in California,\" a jubilant Leno said following the vote. \n \n \"Society is strongest when it upholds the basic civil rights of all its citizens, including the right to marry the person you love. I'm grateful that a majority of my colleagues stood up against discrimination and in favor of allowing same-sex couples who want to devote their lives to one another, raise families, and protect themselves and their children the same rights and responsibilities as different-sex couples with the same goals and dreams.\" \n \n The vote represented months of intense lobbying by Equality California the state's largest LGBT civil rights organization. \n \n \"Today is an unforgettable moment in California history that marks the courage of brave legislators and demonstrates the strength of our democracy,\" said Geoffrey Kors of Equality California. \n \n \"The state Senate of the largest state of the nation just took a bold and giant step in the direction of equality and respect for all families by voting to end discrimination against tens of thousands of same-sex couples and their children.\" \n \n But, even if the bill passes the Assembly there is no guarantee it would be signed by Gov. Schwarzenegger. \n \n The governor has sent mixed messages about whether he would sign the legislation if it were passed.\n \n The issue of same-sex marriage also is being waged in the courts.\n \n In March, a San Francisco a judge ruled that it is unconstitutional for the state to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples. (story)\n \n Attorney General Bill Lockyer has appealed the ruling. Earlier this month the California Supreme Court declined to fast track the case. (story) \n \n Both Lockyer and The National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal had petitioned the Supreme Court to bypass the appeals courts and hear the case now. Once the appeals process is exhausted the case will likely end up in the high court in about a year.\n \n By that time voters are likely to have weighed in on same-sex marriage. A conservative group called the \"Voters' Right to Protect Marriage Initiative\" has begun collecting signatures to have a proposed amendment to the California Constitution banning same-sex marriage placed on the 2006 ballot. (story) If approved by voters it would not only bar gays and lesbians from marrying but also void the state's landmark domestic partner law.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",

Assembly passes bill to allow gay marriage\n \n SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) - A bill that would allow same-sex couples to marry won final passage on Tuesday in the California Assembly, marking the first time a state legislature in the United States has endorsed gay marriage.\n \n The bill by San Francisco Democratic Assemblyman Mark Leno passed by a 41-35 vote, with the help of four Democrats who had not voted for it when the Assembly had previously taken up the legislation.\n \n The state Senate backed the same bill last week.\n \n \"I couldn't do anything but keep going. It says something for being a little bit tenacious,\" Leno told cheering supporters.\n \n Both the California Assembly and state Senate are controlled by Democrats. The office of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has previously opposed gay marriage, issued a statement saying he believes that the issue is best decided in the courts.\n Interesting... when \"activist judges\" decide the matter, they whine that it should be left to the legislature. When the legislature decides, they whine it should be left to the courts! Too bad they only have two sides of their mouth to speak out of.",

   "Assembly Passes Calif. Gay Marriage Bill\n by Mark Worrall 365Gay.com San Francisco Bureau \n \n Posted: September 6, 2005 10:30 pm ET \n Updated: 12:01 am ET \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Sacramento, California) Second time a charm. The California Assembly passed legislation Tuesday night to allow same-sex couples to marry. \n \n Gay and lesbian couples crowded into the legislature early this morning to see the historic vote. It was put off twice during the day when backers did not think they had enough votes. Finally, late Tuesday evening, when it looked as though it could pass the measure was put forward. \n \n The bill passed by the slimmest of margins - one vote. But, it made California the first state in the nation to have a same-sex marriage law passed by the legislature. In Massachusetts, where gay marriage has been legal for more than a year, the decision was made by the courts. \n \n The Senate passed the bill on a 21 to 15 vote last Thursday. (story) \n \n The measure failed by four votes in the Assembly earlier this year when a quarter of the Democrats voted with Republicans to reject it and a handful abstained from voting. (story) \n \n At that time the legislation was considered dead - at least for the rest of this session. But, Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) - the bill's author and one of six openly gay members of the Legislature - refused to give up. \n \n In a surprise move Leno attached the measure as an amendment to a marine bill that was already in committee in the Senate.\n \n Once the bill and its marriage amendment passed the Senate it was back in play in the Assembly.\n \n \"Do what we know is in our hearts,\" he said. \"Make sure all California families will have the same protection under the law,\" Leno implored the Assembly during the debate.\n \n Assemblyman Paul Koretz, D-West Hollywood, called bans on gay marriage \"the last frontier of bigotry and discrimination, and it's time we put an end to it.\"\n \n Assemblyman Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat who abstained when another gay marriage bill fell four votes short in June, said he was concerned about what his three children would think of him if he didn't join those \"who sought to take a leadership role in terms of tolerance, equality and fairness.\"\n \n Republicans who spoke against the bill said that voters rejected gay marriage when they Passed Proposition 22 in 2000. They said traditional heterosexual marriages are best for children\n \n ``We are rolling the dice and taking a huge gamble'' with the lives of children, said Assemblyman Ray Haynes, R-Temecula.\n \n Called the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, the bill would require local clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but allow people opposed to gay marriage to refuse to conduct weddings.\n \n \"Today in California, love conquered fear, principle conquered politics and equality conquered injustice,\" said Geoffrey Kors, Executive Director of Equality California following the vote.\n \n \"For the first time in our nation's history, the people's elected representatives have taken a stand to protect all families and ensure equality for all. We are counting on Governor Schwarzenegger to lift the burden of discrimination from hundreds of thousands of California families by becoming the first governor in the nation to sign legislation ending discrimination against same-sex couples obtaining a civil marriage license. His legacy will in large part be based on whether he signs or vetoes this historic civil rights legislation.\"\n \n Following the vote, Margita Thompson, Schwarzenegger's press secretary, would not say whether Schwarzenegger would sign the gay-marriage bill, noting that he supports the state's current domestic partnership law.\n \n ``The governor believes that the people spoke when they voted in Proposition 22,'' which defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman, Thompson said. ``It's now before the courts, which is where the governor believes it belongs. He will uphold whatever the court decides.''\n \n Last year in a Tonight Show appearance Schwarzenegger said gay marriage would be \"fine with me\" if it were enshrined in state law or ruled legal by the courts. (story)\n \n The issue of same-sex marriage is slowly heading toward the California Supreme Court. In March a San San Francisco judge ruled that state laws preventing gay marriage are illegal. (story) The case is currently under appeal.\n \n Meanwhile, a conservative group called the \"Voters' Right to Protect Marriage Initiative\" has begun collecting signatures to have a proposed amendment to the California Constitution banning same-sex marriage placed on the 2006 ballot. (story) If approved by voters it would not only bar gays and lesbians from marrying but also void the state's landmark domestic partner law.\n \n A new poll, released on the weekend, shows that California voters are equally divided on the issue of same-sex marriage. The Public Policy Institute poll shows that 46 percent are in favor of allowing same-sex couples to marry and 46 percent are opposed. \n \n The result is a slight increase in the number supporting gay marriage over the last poll on the issue, but has given Equality California reason to believe that if the proposed amendment makes it to voters a majority would reject it.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",

Gay Marriage Bill 'Still In Play'\n by Mark Worrall 365Gay.com San Francisco Bureau\n \n Posted: September 9, 2005 8:00 am ET \n \n (San Francisco, California) It may be down, but it isn't out, supporters say of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says he intends to veto.\n \n The gay marriage bill was passed in the Assembly Tuesday night by one vote. (story) The Senate passed it on a 21 to 15 vote last week. (story) \n \n While Schwarzenegger has said, through his press secretary, that he will veto the bill (story) the legislature has still has several options to keep it alive.\n \n It is doubtful the bill could gain enough support to override a veto, but supporters of the measure say they could delay sending it to the governor's office.\n \n Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) one of six openly gay members of the legislature and the author of the gay marriage bill, spent Thursday mustering support for parliamentary maneuvers to delay the bill from reaching the governor's desk. \n \n That would give supporters of same-sex marriage time to increase pressure on Schwarzenegger to back down.\n \n One tactic Leno is considering involves holding the bill back until next year - a move that most Assemblymembers appear not to support. But, another tactic under discussion, and one which appears to be gaining support, would see the bill held for two weeks. That option would not require any specific action by Assembly, just the leadership.\n \n The bill has not been printed following its passage in the Assembly and already the state's largest LGBT civil rights group - Equality California - has begun demonstrations.\n \n Thursday night dozens of same-sex couples held a candlelight vigil in front of the Capitol. Over the weekend demonstrations are planned in other cities throughout the state, and EC has already begun an email campaign encouraging its supporters to flood the governor's office with condemnation.\n \n The protests come as Schwarzenegger prepares to announce his candidacy next week for a second term and as he heads into a tough special-election battle in November that would alter government spending, make it harder for teachers to gain tenure, and immediately overhaul political boundary redistricting to break Democrats' control.\n \n The governor's opposition to same-sex marriage has lost him considerable support on both and not from supporters of same-sex marriage alone.\n \n Schwarzenegger also has indicated he will veto a raft of other bills the Democratically controlled legislature has passed including bills allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and a hike in the minimum wage.\n \n The vetoes forced the governor to choose between rallying his Republican base and alienating key constituencies such as Latinos and gays. As his approval ratings continue to fall losing the broad support of moderates and minorities is likely to have a significant impact at the ballot box.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",
