   "This is mainly for live debates (face to face in real time, so may not necessarily work)\n \n I believe this way works because the teacher prevented me from speaking in the debates at school for two reasons:\n \n 1. I dominate the floor\n 2. The arguments produced are too supported that it's almost impossible to argue against it and she doesn't want to make it seem like there is a right/wrong answer to the question\n \n Process:  (minimum)\n \n Take 30 minutes top (if you've had the right teaching) to prepare, and this depends on which debate. If you're really good, you'll only need one source. However, to be more structured, you should have multiple (if you have multiple, it will definitely take longer than suggested time).\n \n Most of your arguments need to be conjured on the spot, so you really need to know what you're talking about. This depends on which debate you're involved with (congress, discussion, stim<--I think that's what it's called)\n \n So in that suggested time that was made in the first paragraph of process, you need to do a lot of work. If you are at least effective at me, you will only need one source that is one page (front and back full).\n \n In debates, never EVER state information. Information can be easily looked up. There are acceptions to this rule. If you use a lot of information to recreate your process of thinking, or if it seems like the people don't know the fact. Here is the important part:\n \n Arguments should be analytical statements of facts. So you have to read the facts, then follow an almost complicated process. The human brain is so incredible that it should be able to do the following the picosecond you read it:\n \n 1. read each sentence, and then break it down, analysing it to the marrow, which includes word usage and grammar.\n 2. Get the meaning of each sentence and compare each sentence with each other, find any holes and fill them with your arguments.\n 3. Keep comparing each sentence, first by pairs, then as a whole (get the meaning of the paragraph if possible, which means find holes and contradictions)\n 4. Get the meaning of each paragraph and compare each paragraph with each other, find any holes and fill them with your arguments. This should already take into account the holes you already filled in, it should also backup your arguments.\n 5.Get the WHOLE picture<--this is crucial. This is how you can enter a debate and not even know a single thing about what it is. Well because of this process, you WILL learn what it is.\n 6.Remember to write your arguments down\n 7. Now that you're read every line to the marrow, you have to scrutinize it. Which means read between the lines.\n 8. Find holes in the picture and fill them in with questions. Then answer those questions with your arguments.\n \n ***Note: Because the human brain is great at analytical learning, this should be done with ONLY ONE READ THROUGH. If you really find the need to reread, go ahead, but it shouldn't be necessary.\n \n Now that you know what you are arguing, do the following:\n \n 1. Read your arguments, find holes and fill it with questions. Answer the questions with your arguments\n 2. Reformulate your arguments so they back up one another\n 3. Think of every argument that could be used against you (even facts and especially examples). I do this, and I basically know every argument they use. Some arguments I think of for them aren't used, but that's good for me. Sometimes they'll use arguments that I didn't think of. However, if done properly, those arguments that you don't expect should add up to be less than 0.1% of their arguments.\n 4. Repeat these last 4 steps untill you feel ready.\n 5. Hopefully by now you know your arguments by heart\n \n Now you have well established arguments, do the following DURING the debate:\n \n 1. CAREFULLY listen to their arguments. Very little of your focus should be on them, because you really care about the point their making, not the fudge.\n 2. THINK what your counter argument is going to be (if done correctly, you don't have to do this)\n 3. If you had predicted their argument correctly, THEN you can divert your attention to the speak. Scrutinize every single word that is audible.\n 4. Jot down new arguments (assuming you could do step 3)\n 5. Speak with confidence, volumizing voice (breathe from the diaphram, and make it fill the room), give yourself a certain unique presence. Show no sign of fear or nerviousness. But don't get too cocky or over confident\n 6.Observe reactions of the debators and the audience.\n 7.Try not to read from a paper or anything, you don't want to show any signs of weakness.\n \n Your arguments should:\n \n 1. Be analytical arguments of facts and other things\n 2. Have a point\n 3. Support your own side\n 4. Bring down your opposer(s)\n \n These should make your arguments supportive.\n \n I think THE most important thing to remember is this:\n USE ANALYTICAL ARGUMENTS, NOT FACTS!!!!!\n \n Remember, the best debator is the one who can fight for anything, even if they don't support it!!!!!<--I can do this, so I'm a decent debator.",
