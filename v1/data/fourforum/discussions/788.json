It was not declining in the years right before the start of the Brady Law.You'll have to provide better evidence to show me that the Brady Law did not affect crime at all. \n \n When the Brady Bill was being debated in congress even the NRA wanted a background check. The NRA wanted a background check that could be done instantaneously. The Brady people wanted a background check that would take several days to do. I think the Brady people had a better idea because you can do a more thorough background check if you have several days to do it.\n\n \n \n Please provide a link or where I can check your stats.\n \n A deep background check violates my right to privacy. All you need to know is if I am 1) convicted felon 2) domestic violence perp 3) mentally ill and nothing else.\n \n You don't need to know my credit history, arrest record, outstanding parking tickets, outstanding lawsuits, my private or business affairs, who I have had sex with, and my income tax reports.",

   "VOR:\n \n Again you are focusing on guns as the solution to ending crime. I have seen you agree that there are other reasons why people use weapons the kill and there are other reasons why crimes are committed.\n \n Root causes of crime are: family stability, the economy, violence, hoplessness, education, and other social ills. None of which are removed by taking guns away from society. If you really want to make a deep and long lasting effect you focus on the root causes not guns. I will agree with you guns play a major role in gun deaths, but there is a broader issue, it is ALL crime.\n \n I can not prove to you that helping family stability, the economy, violence, hoplessness, education, and social ills will help reduce crime. It is a very complex issue with more that I am willing to deal with within this board, but I don't agree with your single minded focus on guns. All I can say is well educated and employed doctors, laywers, engineers, teachers, and managers as a rule do not sell illict drugs, do not hold up banks, do not stick up liquor stores, do not do drive by shootings. If more people become stable like doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, and managers, then maybe there will be less crime and those people can own guns in peace. I do not agree with any law that changes the mode and behavior of good people who own guns. Laws should focus on changing the mode and behavior of criminals and leave good people alone. My $.02",
