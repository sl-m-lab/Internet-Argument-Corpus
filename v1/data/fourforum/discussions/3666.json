   "To Close_slave_can:\n \n \nState your proofs that the holocaust happened and I will use creationist type tactics to \"prove\" the holocaust is \"just a theory\". This will clearly highlight how dubious creationist tactics are.\n\n \n You obviously appear to believe that all creationists are up to some \"creation conspiracy\" to convert people to believe the Bible by any means neccessary, including lying, if needed. Keep in mind that Biblical Creationists are Christians and thus are bound by God's Word, which says not to lie. If they were to lie while still saying that they believe the Bible, would they not be hippocrites? As I have stated before, for example the evolutionary lie about there 3rd stage supernovae in our universe when there is none, the minority of evolutionists are the one's who either accidentally or purposely (in this case) twist or change the evidence and lie. To them lying is not bad, nor is it good - as they have no absolutes with which to judge lying to, such as the Bible.\n \n Could you list some examples of where creationists have lied, mislead people by twisting the evidence to suit their own agenda?\n \n I'll play along, for now. Evidence of holocaust:\n * Mass graves and massive layers of bodies when Russian and English forces moved in on Germany at wars conclusion.\n * Observation of bodies being unloaded from trucks by resistance fighters.\n * Survivors of camps when Alied Forces reached the camps.\n * Number records I believe of how many were killed each day.\n * Probably burners and other equipment that I don't really want to think about were left behind.\n * The fact that only certain groups were killed, e.g. Jewish, homosexual, and so on.\n \n I'm not really into history that much, these are just educated guesses. Before you start, I could have a guess at what you are most likely going to say. And no, it is not by using these made up creationary tatics, it is just by reinterpretation of the evidence. \n \n Let me illustrate what I mean:\n You could claim that the observations of bodies being unloaded from trucks were an unrelated case of an outbreak of some deadly airborne biological virus. The German military were called into help control the out of hand situation. Those people who caught the disease had to be seperated from the main population so as to save the unaffected ones, the movie \"Outbreak\" clearly demonstrates this idea of seperating the affected from the unaffected. The number records were not about how many were killed by the troops, but how many died via this terrible virus. Too many people were killed by this virus that writing down names became impossible, a more effective system was introduced using numbers. Because this virus infected so many people with a 100% fatality rate, the body's at these \"seperation\" camps had to be burned to be able to recieve more of the infected. This also accounts for the massive amounts of bodies that the British and Russian forces found when they moved in on Germany. For some unkown reason, the virus only appeared to affect those who were Jewish, homosexual and the gypsies (however it is spelt). This may be because they were not as \"highly evolved\" as \"normal\" Germans. \n \n There, I have created a story based on the evidence that I know of. Of course, I don't believe this, but I am just illustrating how interpretations of the same evidence come up with different stories. This is not some creation tactic, just that the conclusion that a person comes to over the evidence depends on the \"mindset\" of the person. If he believes the holocaust to be a ruse, than he will come to that conclusion after examining the evidence. However, if he believes that the holocaust was an actual event, than he will come to the conclusion that it was a real event after looking at the evidence. Both the doubter and believer have the same evidence, in this case listed above in dot point form, but they came to radically different conclusions. Why? Because they had different interpretations of the evidence that is based on underlying assumptions or belief systems. \n \n We can similarly apply this to the creation/evolution debate. Both sides have the same evidence, in this case it is fossils, plants and animals, mutations, planets, etc., they have different conclusions because of the different underlying assumptions or belief systems that they base their interpretation of the eivdence on. For example:\n * Creationist:\n - Mindset: Believes the whole Bible from Genesis 1:1 through to the end of Revelation.\n - After looking at the Earth he concludes that God made it.\n \n * Atheistic evolutionist:\n - Mindset: God is not real, therefore natural processes must have made everything.\n - After looking at the Earth he concludes that it must have been formed by natural processes, hence the different theories. \n \n The evidence is the same, but the interpretations (or conclusions) are different because they have different mindset (or glasses) or their underlying assumptions or belief systems are different. This is the core of the whole debate. At the roots this whole evolution/creation issue, is really Christianity vs. atheism.",

That is quite a reasonable position. I am a bit biased myself, since I have a masters in science I would like that if you use strict guidelines then you have more authority on humble claims then people who do not.\n\n \n I'm saying that people's bias and mindset's impacts a lot on what they believe to be true about a wide range of issues. This is evident in many cases throughout our lives. An atheist will never accept the fact that creation happened or could have happened, why? Because he has already ruled out that possibility due to his starting assumptions (i.e. there is no God). We both have the same evidence. But the atheist will not even consider creation as a resonable interpretation of that evidence because his mindset tells him not to. Likewise, a Biblical creationist will not believe evolution as it goes against the Word of God. They will therefore come up with different interpretations of same evidence because they are starting off with different assumptions and different world views (or mindsets).\n \n It is this battle of the mindsets or starting assumptions/beliefs that forms the real creation/evolution debate. If we are to reach a conclusion, we would have to take off our world view glasses and see the evidence from the other guy's glasses. I, a Bible believing person, can see the amazingly beautiful world that God has created and how all the evidence we observe and test fits perfectly with what the Bible has to say about our origins. I also have the ability to see the world through evolutionary glasses and can understand many of their claims. But, because I understand some of the evidence, I know that evolution cannot account for several observations we see, thus making creation more reasonable. \n \n The issue about stars being millions of light years away and their light taking a long time to get here was always troubling for me, before I read \"Starlight and Time\" by Dr Humphreys. I thought that the evolutionary interpretation was more reasonable, but now I can see that the Bible was correct because Dr Humphreys using General Relativity and different asssumptions to the evolutionary scientists has shown that it is very possible that we can see light from very distant stars in a young universe.",

Wether Humpreys is correct or not people have gotten useful results based on the appearance of the age of stars, it does not matter if it is true or not.\n\n \n That was only an example from my experience of how different starting assumptions often lead to different conclusions over the same evidence. That is all why I included it for. It clearly illustrates how changing the evolutionary assumptions leads to a different conclusion about the nature of the universe and our position in it. But for some small reason, I think it went Swish, right over your head and you didn't get what I was hinting at. But the evolutionary scientists didn't take the effect of gravity on time when they were doing their maths. Since there is different strengths of gravity all over the universe, time too is a varriable which changes. The only that the time taken for light from distant stars can equal the distance is if there is no change in gravity all over the universe. But we know that there is lots of changes in gravity all over the universe. Thus their calculations of how old a star is will be out by a large margin. \n \n Besides, if what Dr Humphreys is saying is true, than the information recieved from stars is recent and revelent; however, if evolutionary theory is true, we are just studying an illusion - there's nothing there. The light showing the explosion just hasn't reached us yet. \n \n I only know that most of the information that we get from stars and about stars is from their spectra.

   "Hello Close_slave_can:\n \n \nAs far as I can tell most websites and people that argue that creation should be taught in schools point out that human being have limitation and there claims should not be trusted. If nothing can be trusted then nothing can be trusted why single out evolution in particular?\n\n \n The only thing that I can say in regards to this issue is that people were not there in the beginning to see anything. We have no eye witness accounts from any human being at all about what happened. For example, if a teacher said to her class something along the lines of:\n \"Okay class, this is what has been called the \"Lucy\" type skeleton. This is our ancestor that existed over <insert any age you want to< years ago....\"\n \n A student may reply with something like:\n \"But Miss, how do you know that? Were you there millions of years ago to see the supposed evolution of man?\"\n \n What does the teacher say? If she says no, than she has admitted that she cannot be sure that it happened as there was no human account of this; if she says yes, than she is lying and her students doubt her even more.\n \n Therefore evolution is a belief system about the past, told by men who were not there, but who are trying to recreate events of the unobservable and unrepeatable past. Creation is likewise a belief system about the past, but the Bible says that it is the Word of God - and God was there in the beginning and He doesn't lie. Therefore, Genesis is His account of how He made everything. The assumption here is that the Bible is the Word of God.\n \n I don't really care wether or not creation is taught in schools, just as long as the teachers don't teach evolution as it the truth. There are many holes in evolutionary theory that are yet to be reasonably answered. The teachers don't need to teach creation, just teach some real science and the students will see that evolution has many unanswered holes. It is far from the truth, it is only an unrepeatable theory or belief system about the past. If we take away evolution from schools, then everything that our school system is teaching kids is either in the present or in the recent past (a few thousand years say). We know that the events happened the way that they did, because we have got definite eye witness accounts from people who were there. In science, we can repeat many observations and experiments and come to a conclusion about them. All of these can be shown in the class room. They can be physically applied, like Maths and many sciences, e.g. genetics, astronomy, quanta to quarks, motors and generators, etc., etc.\n \n In summary, I don't think that these people - whoever they are - are saying that we can't know nothing for sure, or that the works of man cannot be trusted. They trust the works of man when they hop in the car, or go flying in a plane. Since I wasn't in WWI or WWII, I may know what happened because I may have read eye witness accounts of people who were there in the midst of it, or by reading people who have done a lot of research on the matter, collecting statements and so on. Anything that has been observed by many people at the same event has a high chance of being correct. I was not here in Australia over 200 years ago to witness the Europeans taking over Australia, but I know what happened because there are eye witness accounts recorded and many have done research on this issue. \n \n However, I don't think that we should trust fallible man when it comes to stating what happened in the unobservable and unrepeatable past as they were not there and we have no human eye witness accounts. I think that these people are referring to events that occurred in the distant past for which we have no eye witness accounts, e.g. origin of life. Also, they have realised that the application of science is limited to the present, and cannot deal with the past without making many assumptions. \n \n This is my best guess.",

Words like, \"by evolutionary theory, Lucy type is thought to be\"; or \"we think she existed over several eons of years ago but this is based on several assumptions - which limits the accuracy. The fact that science is ill equiped to deal with the distant past also severely limits the accuracy.\" \n \n Notice how these are much more accurate and tells the students clearly that science cannot prove any of this, it is someone's interpretation or belief about the past. It also tells them the truth.\n \n \nThe fact that a subject fails to capture the total truth and convince students it is the total truth is a common occurence.\n \n \n Not on subjects such as mathematics and legal studies, drama, etc. I'm not saying not to teach evolution in schools (mind you I wouldn't be sad to see it shoved down the darkest black hole), but it should be taught for what it really is - an unprovable and unrepeatable belief system about the past - as well as stating other reasonable beliefs, i.e. creation. In chemistry, we learn about the different models of the atoms, in physics we are taught about quanta and quarks, etc., unobseravble stuff.\n \n \nMy physics text book admitted on the first page that a leaf falling of a tree can only be modelled to limited degree of position. certain Billions upon billions of atoms buffet it and cause it to spin. The same applies to all projectile motion. The effects of wind restistance is just ignored.\n \n \n The air resisteance in projectile motion is ignored for HSC students in calculations because it would be too hard to work out the answer if it were included. This is only because in the HSC, projectile motion is not rocket science, in maths, gravity is usually given a value of 10 m/s/s. In that very same text book, does the author admit that evolution or the big bang theory for those who say the two aren't related, are just unproven theories about the past? That would be the first one I have heard of then.\n \n I understand what you are saying however, \"why pick on evolution for not being trusted when other subjects have a similar problem?\" Good point, possibly because the others do not affect the way in which you live your life (e.g. morality). I mean, who cares if there are or are not electrons in objects (an exaggerated example) as it doesn't affect us - just as long as the object works. It won't affect how I behave, for example. Whether or not I believe evolution will.",

   "To Close_slave_can:\n \n \nHaving evolution change your morality is not what I hope vast majority of people that make the science sylabus want.\n \n \n I'm sure that it is not what they are aiming for, but it does happen. \"If no one made me, then no one owns me and no one can tell me what I can and can't do\" is the typical attitude.\n \n \nI hope they just want to teach students the main scientific theories.\n \n As do I. But it should be taught as that, an unprovable and unrepeatable theory in a way that the students know for sure that it is not even close to being the truth, but is only one interpretation of many of the physical evidence. State both evidence for and evidence against it. Currently, only the evidence for it is being taught. Even some of this evidence, such as the peppered moths, are actually pointing toward a creationary model. Many of the so called human evolution skeletons are most likely true humans, such as Erectus, Neandertals (however it is spelt); they are taught as primitive ancestors that evolved from an ape like ancestor. Even the latest \"hobbit\" skeleton is most likely a group of humans inherited certain characteristics, the most notably being size, and migrated down to Indonesia after the seperation of the human race at Babel. It should not, as stated in my last post, portrayed as the truth.\n \n \nDo you know of anyone that turned from god due to evolution because the consider a clear proof against god?\n \n \n Interestingly enough, Dr Tas Walker did a creation/evolution seminar at a local Church in which he brought up one story about a little girl and her father who were watching the \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" produced by the BBC and at the end of it, the little girl said to dad that she didn't believe in God anymore; other then that, no I have not meet anyone else - I don't generally talk to strangers if I can help it, kind of shy. For some reason, it's different on the forums. In actual fact, dinosaurs fit perfectly with the Bible's account of our origin. Evolution is however a very big road block for people coming to accept Christ, see for example, Colin Cummins Testimony. Note especially the sentence: Whenever I could I spoke to my colleagues about Jesus Christ. It quickly became evident that the biggest hindrance for the majority of these people was their evolutionary worldview. \n \n \nAt any rate I actually don't have a problem with schools not teaching evolution at all since people decide on it themselves and if they \"need\" it uni they could teach what is currently the small bit of compulsorary bit information to themselves using the net.\n \n \n Still from Colin Cummins testimony, he states that: \"I [Colin] got my hands on as much Creation Science material as I could find. The more I read the more convinced I became that I had been misled in those vulnerable school years when I accepted without question the world view of secular science.\"\n \n From this, it seems to me that many kids are vulnerable during their school years when you accept anything the teacher says without question. I am with you in this case, let people themselves decide. Let them find out information about the whole debate from the creationary and evolutionary websites and see which one is more reasonable.",

Take gravity - we notice that apples fall from trees. But we can only assume that apples in the distant past fell from trees, and assume that they will fall from trees in the future. Yet such an assumption is valid under science.\n \n So even in the distant past it is considered a scientific fact that gravity acted in the same way it did now.\n \n You said it yourself, it is an assumption! You have to assume that gravity has been the same for eons of years. What is an assumption? Basically it's an unprovable starting faith, i.e. it can't be proved to be true. Note that assumptions, by their very nature, cannot be proven nor disproven. But there are two ways we can test the assumption:\n 1. We can test it in the real world today. Obviously, gravity in the distant past cannot be tested in the present.\n 2. We can ask ourselves, \"How reasonable is the assumption?\" If gravity was less or more in the past, or if it wasn't present at all, we wouldn't be here. Our ancestors (whichever interpretation of the evidence you wish to believe) would have either floated off into space or be flattened like a pancake, and hence, we would not be here today. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe (or assume) that gravity has remained how it is today since life started to appear or be created, since we are here today in our present form which is similar to the structures of previous humans of thousands of years old (by Biblical creation model), e.g. homo erectus.\n \n It is not \"scientific fact\" [as you stated] - it is a reasonable assumption that cannot be proven nor disproven. Since science uses observation, experimental validation and repeatability, (which all can only be done in the present) science cannot deal directly with the past, it can, however, be used indirectly by using assumptions. In your example about gravity, you appear to have confused assumptions with scientific fact. Your example is a reasonable assumption.\n \n Presumably many Creationists disagree with this, maybe they could make some stickers for textbooks about it.\n \n This statement is an example of an unreasonable assumption. Creationists have not said any such thing. Obviously, during the Biblical creation week, there would have been more gravity around Earth and less in other parts of the universe, Dr Humphreys' book \"Starlight and Time\" describes this in much more detail. After creation, gravity has remained more or less the same other wise life would cease to exist.\n \n The evidence for the age of a fossil like Lucy is based on the extrapolation of physical laws to the past. So it is entirely reasonable under science. In fact if anyone were to call such an assumption unreasonable I would have to call them a hypocrite. This is because everyone in their daily life uses extrapolation and inference to conclude \"facts\" about the past or future. \n \n You neglected to mention that the dating methods require assumptions. When projecting radiometric dating methods and other scientific laws (that work today in the present) into the past, you have to take several things into account and make the following unprovable assumptions:\n * The starting conditions are known (for example, we know how much daughter product was present at the start).\n * Decay rates have always been constant.\n * No parent or daughter elements have been lost or added (Uranium, for example, is washed out of rocks much faster than most other elements. \n \n What about \"bad\" dates? When a date differs from that expected, researchers readily invent excuses for rejecting the date. This after-the-event reasoning shows that radiometric dating has serious problems. For example, researchers applied posterior reasoning to teh dating of Australopithecus ramidus fossils. Most basalt samples closest to the fossil-bearing layers gave dates of about 23 Ma (Mega annum, million years) by the argon-argon method. The authors decided that was \"too old\", according to their beliefs about the place of the fossils in the evolutionary grand scheme of things. So they looked at some basalt further removed from the fossils and selected 17 of 26 samples to get an acceptable maximum age of 4.4 Ma. The other nine samples again gave much older dates, but the authors decided they must be contaminated and discarded them. That's how radiometric dating works. It is very much driven by the pre-existing long-ages worldview that pervades academia today. \n \n A similar story can be seen with the dating of the human skull known as KNM-ER 1470. An initial age of 212 to 230 Ma was, according to the fossils, considered way off the mark (humans \"weren't around then\"). Various other attempts were made to date the rocks in the area. Over the years, an age of 2.9 Ma was settledf upon because of the agreement between several different studies (although the studies involved selection of \"good\" from \"bad\" results, as above). \n \n However, preconceived notions about human evolution could not cope with a skull like 1470 being \"that old\". A study of pig fossils readily convinced most anthropologists that the human skull was much younger. After this was widely accepted, further studies of the rocks brought the \"age\" down to about 1.9 Ma - again several studies confirmed this date. Such is the dating game.\n \n Are evolutionists being dishonest? No, it is just that all observations must fit the prevailing paradigm, or belief system. Molecules-to-man evolution over eons of years is so strongly entrenched it is not questioned - it is \"fact\". So every observation must fit this paradigm. Unconsciously, the researchers involved - \"objective scientists\" in the eyes of laymen - select the observations to fit the basic belief system.\n \n Notice that the long \"dates\" that are brought up through various methods are based on unprovable assumptions. This is not the science that involves observation, experimental validity and repeatability.\n \n Also anyone who disagrees that science can determine facts about the past should also attack forensics science as used in court first. Noone ever uses \"science can only make assumptions about the past\" as a defense in a murder trial, why do you think that is?\n \n Forensic science deals with evidence that is generally only a few years old at most - not eons of years. As such, they know the circumstances under which the event took place, as it has been observed that the conditions are no different then today. But we have no idea what the Earth was like eons of years ago and therefore, we have to make assumptions about it's conditions, as this has never been observed. The evidence can be tested experimentally for prints and blood, that may lead to a match with the accused's genetic make up. The event can be recreated in similar circumstances and then tested for any similarities of the evidence. Even forensic science isn't 100% true - the evidence has to be interpreted and with that interpretation, it implies that a person is guilty or not. It cannot say for sure, but in the criminal court system, only \"Beyond resonable doubt\" has to be proved.\n \n You are also missing my argument when it comes to the science and the past. I am stating that science cannot be used in the distant past. We cannot scientifically measure anything older than ourselves without using assumptions. But when we are projecting into the distant past, really big assumptions must be used.\n \n Key to this is to realise that scientific facts don't demand 100% proof, they only require strong support. In the case of the Lucy fossil there is plenty enough evidence to cite the age as a fact, and the teacher should do just that. If someone asks how it was aged then there are answers to that. But the age that Lucy is given is a scientific fact, and that Lucy is related to us via common descent is also a scientific fact.\n \n The term \"fact\" is defined as \"thing that is (known to be) true\". Facts do require 100% proof, and scientific facts likewise, require 100% proof. The laws of nature are examples of scientific facts as there is not one observation that goes against them and hence, it is known to be true without doubt. The \"age\" of Lucy is based on unprovable assumptions (i.e. can't be known to be true). Therefore, by definition, they cannot be \"facts\" as it would be a contradiction of terms: known to be true (fact) vs. can't be known or proved to be true (assumption).\n \n There is no \"evidence\" for the age of Lucy. It is based purely on assumptions (some of which are listed above in this post). It is more like a belief about the past, and definitely not a \"fact\" - only a fool would claim otherwise. \n \n I'll deal with your other remark about Lucy being our ancestor as \"fact\" seperately:\n Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who, having painstakingly examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis (an objective method that does not depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry), do not believe that these creatures are human ancestors. \n \n He states that although initially it was thought that they were human-loike or at least intermediate between apes and humans, the reality is that they \"differ more from both humans and Africian apes than do these two living groups from each other. The australopithecines are unique.\" Oxnard indicates that the non-ancestor status of these creatures is supported by an increasing number of investigators who are \"idependent of those representing individuals who have found the fossils.\" Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not habitually walk upright, as many still insist they did. This is consistent with the relatively recent discovery that lucy's wrist had a locking mechanism enabling her to knucklewalk, like chimps and gorillas. \n \n Despite the fact that homo hablis is more than one creature, CAT scans of the bony labyrinth have also concluded that it was even less bipedal (the ability to habitually walk upright) than it's supposed predecessor the australopithecines or Lucy type fossil. Hmm, that's not how it is supposed to be! Homo Erectus has been shown to habitually walk upright, in fact, he had the ability to do everything that we do today - hop, skip, jump, run, crawl, etc., etc.\n \n So where is the missing link? Well, as it's name suggests, it's still missing. The so-called human evolution is not a scientific fact, as there are massive fatal holes in it's theory. It wouldn't even pass on the balance of probabilities! Far from \"fact\". \n \n Your both statements are incredibly incorrect. Neither is \"scientific fact\" and the term \"fact\" alone means \"thing that is (known to be) true\". Neither are known to be true, nor is true, nor can ever be proved to be true.\n \n Also while we are on this topic, where is the political movement to attack the teaching in history classes that the Egyptian's built the pyramids? Afterall Noone was there to see it being built, and noone was there to validate the written records were actually written at the time and aren't frauds.\n \n Why not? How does it contribute to our society? This is a whole other argument here. I don't really know much about ancient history, but I do know that the Israelites were there before the time of Moses. They were made to be slaves and build many buildings, including pyramids I dare say. People were there to observe the pyramids being built, silly! The workers themselves observed it, the pharoah observed it and everyone in Egypt observed it! If there are eye-witness accounts there, then we can find out how their society worked. If they are frauds, how, then, were they constructed? Writings on the inside of the tomb most likely told of the construction and whose it was. Basically, people know that the Egyptians built the pyramids because we have eye-witness accounts and the writings on many Egyptian buildings and tombs (pyramids) also confirmed this.\n \n This isn't my area of interest, but we have conclusive evidence that states that they built it and why they built as well as how they built it. Besides, what does this have to do with events in eons of years ago in the past that has not been observed, nor have there been any accounts written describing what had happened by anyone there (because there was no human there!)?",

We can observe this in a lab or anywhere else today, not only eons of years ago. The thing about the Earth being millions of years old has to do with radiometric dating. This is a different issue but still just as scientifically sound as the fact that we can observe species of animals evolve as well as humans.",
