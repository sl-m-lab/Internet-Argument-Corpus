The tide has turned, and the majority of the American public is finally waking up to the fact that gays aren't the diseased evil recruiting promiscuous sinners that anachronisms like Archie paint us as, and that sky isn't going to fall if our relationships with those we love are granted the same (not \"extra,\" not \"special\") legal rights as theirs.",

That's why same gender marriage has never been respected or honored by the larger community Op, because it can never fulfill the reason that marriage and families were originally formed.\n \n And even though past civilizations have accepted gay people as a real, and even vital part of the community in some Societies, in no other generation in the history of the World has same sex marriage ever been considered as a good or positive option for the improvement of the Society.\n\n \n Your argument seems to be that only people oppressed as slaves deserve to be granted equal rights under the law. But equal rights are for everyone, and there is no litmus test of who is the most oppressed. Your argument that same-sex marriage has never been respected by the larger community is not true; it's respected by the larger community, legally, in two states now and in a growing number of countries. The tide of change is toward equality, not backwards toward repression and inequality. \n \n So I should not have the right to marry unless I can be fruitful and multiply? You are saying that I should not have the right to marry a man either, then, since I cannot be fruitful and multiply at all at this point in my life. I am 53 years old, and my ability to conceive and bear children is past. You are in effect saying that no post-menopausal women like me should have the right to marry anyone. You apparently would strip us of the right to marry either a man or a woman, because we cannot be fruitful and multiply. \n \n Most gay people can be fruitful and multiply when they are of the age to do so. Many gay people do bear and raise children. So your argument to exclude gay people on this basis from marriage makes no sense; gay people of childbearing age can and do bear children, and people who are past childbearing age, like me, cannot. The ability to bear children does not depend on our sexual orientation.\n \n You also contradict yourself in this post. In one sentence you say, \"You have all the same rights that we all have.\" Two sentences later you say, \"Nor do you deserve the right to marry unless you can fulfill Gods command to be fruitful and multiply.\" You contradict here what you said two sentences earlier. \n \n You also say that we want a \"special dispensation for being gay,\" and then you argue that people who can bear children are the only ones who should have the right to marry. That sounds like you want a special dispensation for people who can bear children. The laws of no states require people to be able to bear children in order to marry. And most gay people of childbearing age can bear children, and many do so. So excluding gay people from marrying makes no sense under the rationale you present here.",

   "Nothing you said changes the fact that one person, the Oregon Attorney General is blocking the will of the people from being known by not submitting the required State Approved Ballot Title. foundit attempted to claim this was a fairly won victory, and I just pointed out that wasn't true at all. And these gay talking points about seeking EQUALITY have to end. Unless you can produce evidence that gay people were originally kidnapped from their native lands by force, brought here in shackles, sold like farm animals, owned like property, and forced to work like beasts of burden as they were whipped and beaten if they didn't perform as required.

Now we see the mind numbing dogma that has been persecuting gays for years. And now that we have a voice, now that we have finally said enough to your radical incoherent mind numbing tirade of slanderous bull, you have obviously gone into a mode of severe mental meltdown. \n \n Comparing gays equal rights to slavery is as assnine as any thing you have said on this forum thus far. You saying that unless we were in bondage and were slaves you would REFUSE us equal rights of any kind! Unless your forgeting it is people of your distinct odd calibur full of pointing blame, ridicule, and judging others when they dont have the backbone to judge themselves in the mirror and instead take their frustrations out on others and target them due to self weakness and loathing to incure a disgusting self satisfaction and glee in the suffering of others, that are the basis for all the injustices done to those who have been affected by the horror and torment of persecution due to belief or difference than others.\n \n Sorry everyone but this is just too much for me. The nerve of some people! Have fun with God Archie Im sure when your at the pearly gates and when you stand before St Peter and hold out your hand expecting the riches of heaven and glory of your own dilussional self satisfaction, I hope he writes your name next to those of the pharascee's and pulls the lever.",

   "Your argument seems to be that only people oppressed as slaves deserve to be granted equal rights under the law. \n\n \n That isn't my argument at all Op. It is that to co-opt the the term equality is to compare yourselves to a truly oppressed people who were in fact slaves who were owned by other people and forced into labor like animals for hundreds of years against their wills. Nothing of the sort has ever happened to gays in America, nor is anything like that happening now. I can marry a woman today in America and you can marry a man. We have the same exact rights to marry, so we are completely equal in the rights that we have.

But you're in denial is all. The requirement that has always existed in Society is not that couples MUST procreate, but that they qualify as a normal nuclear family. I know this concept is foreign to you but there is something to be said for natural parents actually raising children they themselves conceived and bore. At least there used to be something to be said for it. But your community is attempting to redefine what is normal by invoking your abnormal view of family on the larger community.

Many gay people do bear and raise children. So your argument to exclude gay people on this basis from marriage makes no sense;\n\n \n Naturally????

NO Op, the only way it works for the homosexual community is to once again pervert the family structure in the same way that homosexual sex is a perversion of what is normal.\n \n \nYou also contradict yourself in this post.

It just points to the difficulty in dealing with a community that is attempting to distort what's normal and traditional for the majority based on the unnatural desires of a militant minority. You see, you do have all the same rights to marry that we have, but if you want your right to marry within your same gender as you are seeking which is a special right, then I said i will support your agenda when you can procreate NATURALLY as the other 96% of the civilization can.

Nothing radical or extreme, just exactly what you came from, and what I came from and what my daughters came from.\n \n Are you really trying to tell me that what I'm defending and attempting to preserve is wrong or somehow evil? So are you then calling your own beginnings evil and wrong? And are you actually calling what has always been the traditional family anywhere on Earth evil and wrong? And that it requires that we allow same gender sex to exist in order to fix some inherent flaw in what has gotten us this far?\n \n Can you guarantee me that your new definition of the family wont completely destroy what we now have and rip the traditional nuclear family apart until it's something we wont even recognize in 10, 20 or 30 years? Can you make any guarantees at all that your same gender sex wont mean the death nell for traditional families everywhere if allowed to take hold everywhere?",

I was lucky to have a wonderful grandmother and a dad who loved me and was close to me and who lived a very long and happy life. I am glad for you that your mom has lived a long life as well, and that she is still with you. \n \n On the subject of same-sex marriage changing \"what the nuclear family consists of,\" this has already happened, and not because of same-sex marriage. Divorce and remarriage and decisions by people to have children out of wedlock have already led to new family forms. Same-sex marriage has had nothing to do with that. There are relatively few gay people in the world, and the number of families headed by same-sex couples is tiny compared with the number of divorced parents and remarried parents and single parents. \n \n Same-sex couples have been marrying and raising children together for a long time, without any legal protections afforded to our families and our children. Same-sex marriage in fact is nothing new, nor are families headed by same-sex couples. What is new is that we are finally winning legal recognition for our families and our marriages, which benefits primarily our children. Not extending legal recognition to same-sex couples will not stop same-sex couples from existing and from forming families. It will simply continue to disadvantage our families legally, especially our children. Legal recognition of same-sex marriages is simply the legal recognition of families that already exist.\n \n Same-sex marriage is already here, whether it is legally recognized or not. California and Massachusetts are simply the beginnings of the laws catching up with social reality. I live in Ohio, where same-sex marriage is not recogized by law. But same-sex couples still marry and form families in Ohio, and we will continue to do so whether our marriages are legally recognized or not.",

   "I agree with you regarding the ever changing family dynamics that exist due to divorce, remarriage, out of wedlock parenting and common law relationships Op. If you look at these social realities objectively, one must admit that they exist due to the demise of a definite universal moral compass in our society. What the gay lobby is arguing is that since we have already gone down that road of adopting the secular humanist philosophy of, \"If it feels good, just do it\" which has led us to the amoral place we find ourselves at, then why not go one step further and just accept gay marriage too.\n \n Let me recap the concept of the slippery slope that my side, the traditionalists have been arguing against for decades now. When the sexual revolution began and people started having random premarital sex, traditionalists argued that this would lead to increases in STDs, promiscuity, unwanted pregnancies and a general decline in the standards of morality within our Society. We were called backwards thinking control freaks who sought to dictate our morals to the masses while taking away the god given freedoms that America represents for all people. And yet all of our concerns of 40 and 50 years ago are a social reality today in America.\n \n Each new generation has continued down the slippery slope of moral decline based on the liberal applications of sexual promiscuity of the generations that have preceded it. This has led to premarital sex that now includes rainbow parties for 12 and 13 year olds who participate in orgies, abortions to the tune of 1.4 million a year, a 52% divorce rate, out of control promiscuity as reflected in pornography, common law cohabitation, and out of control STDs. And here we are at the end of the trail of total depravity when the majority of our citizens moral compass has been so dumbed down that even seemingly intelligent people like you, people who's company I know I would personally enjoy sharing, have absolutely no concept of what is truly right and normal or moral according to our Creators standards.\n \n Do you think that I don't know that the generation that is now in grammar school is as we speak being so manipulated, brain washed and indoctrinated into believing as you want them to so completely, that IF AMERICA SURVIVES FOR ONE MORE GENERATION, the NEA in partnership with the GAY LOBBY will have accomplished their complete agenda and what you seek will have been accomplished in this Country as they will agree with your agenda since they were taught that it is right without concern for the rights or authority of what their own parents would have them be exposed to at such young ages? And all of this indoctrination in the name of preventing bigotry like mine. How lost are we Op, when a person is considered a bigot for having a moral standard that is different from those who promote sexual practices that God condemns in the Holy Bible? Can you see why I call our Society REPROBATE? Because wrong has become right, and right is now seen as wrong. Just exactly what the bible said would take place in the last days of this Age. Do you think I am blind to that reality? So I will speak like a voice in the wilderness, and I will condemn the path we are going down as a civilization even though I know that because we live in a world of spiritual darkness, that the darkness will attain their temporary victory.\n \n But understand this Op, I am standing against this moral decline on principle because I know that our God will not suffer our rebellion as a civilization forever. As I am attacked for being a bigot and a homophobe by those who can't stand against my moral position, I constantly insist that I have no personal stake or animosity against any homosexuals in life at all. I am the only true christian on this forum who has repeatedly screamed the facts and posted the scriptures that explain that homosexuals can be saved like anyone else, but must repent as anyone else must in order to receive what has been freely offered by our God. If I was like Fred Phelps as I have been accused of, I would have been constantly damming you all to hell with no hope of salvation and been done with this attempt to get anyone around here to actually view this World through the prism of Gods moral perspective. \n \n I know that our day of reckoning is coming as a Society and that what is being accomplished is just one more nail in the coffin of our destruction as a Nation. God will not be mocked forever, and all of this false joy over accomplishing this alleged victory of gay marriage over so called bigots and religious homophobes like me is just so much more self deception that is leading to the mass destruction of those who are unable to see that they are fomenting it themselves.

Can you see why I call our Society REPROBATE? Because wrong has become right, and right is now seen as wrong. Just exactly what the bible said would take place in the last days of this Age. Do you think I am blind to that reality? So I will speak like a voice in the wilderness, and I will condemn the path we are going down as a civilization even though I know that because we live in a world of spiritual darkness, that the darkness will attain their temporary victory.\n \n But understand this Op, I am standing against this moral decline on principle because I know that our God will not suffer our rebellion as a civilization forever. As I am attacked for being a bigot and a homophobe by those who can't stand against my moral position, I constantly insist that I have no personal stake or animosity against any homosexuals in life at all. I am the only true christian on this forum who has repeatedly screamed the facts and posted the scriptures that explain that homosexuals can be saved like anyone else, but must repent as anyone else must in order to receive what has been freely offered by our God. If I was like Fred Phelps as I have been accused of, I would have been constantly damming you all to hell with no hope of salvation and been done with this attempt to get anyone around here to actually view this World through the prism of Gods moral perspective. \n \n I know that our day of reckoning is coming as a Society and that what is being accomplished is just one more nail in the coffin of our destruction as a Nation. God will not be mocked forever, and all of this false joy over accomplishing this alleged victory of gay marriage over so called bigots and religious homophobes like me is just so much more self deception that is leading to the mass destruction of those who are unable to see that they are fomenting it themselves. If my motivation was hate and not love Op, the last thing I would do is share the truth with you.\n\n \n I have made no comment on your motivations. They are in your heart, not anyone else's. However, you should realize that no amount of preaching, cajoling, warning, threatening, moralizing, harping, denouncing, sputtering, roaring, or howling on your part will get me to agree with your religious beliefs or with your position regarding gay people. I simply don't agree with you in these areas. You can hold whatever religious beliefs you want, and that's fine with me, but trying to talk me into embracing them is a futile effort on your part. I have a faith that is meaningful to me, and I am not looking for a different faith. \n \n As for the world being in decline, in every era of American history that I have studied, some people have argued that we are in an era of decline. I don't believe that about the present era, just as it was not true of past eras that people argued were times of declension. I see social problems, and I see positive efforts to improve the world all around me. I see our current social condition as mixed. I am not a premillennialist, certainly. I don't predict the downfall of humanity. I think that in some important respects we are doing better as a society than we were in the past. Women and African Americans and gay people have more freedom today than in the past. \n \n I do not see moral decline. I think people are no less committed to their families than they were in the past. And people don't get divorced because they believe in liberal values. The divorce rate today is higher among evangelical Christians than it is in the rest of the population. Most evangelical Christians are not getting divorced because they embrace liberal values. As for other social problems, STDs have been with us for a long time. So have drug abuse and alcoholism. So has promiscuity. These are not new. Nor are they advocated by gay rights activists or by those who support same-sex marriage. Folks who choose to get married are not saying, \"If it feels good, do it.\" They are saying, \"I do,\" to a lifelong commitment to a loving spouse. \n \n The gay couples who are getting married are advocating and practicing committed, married monogamy. To argue that they are leading everyone down a slippery slope of immoral, promiscuous behavior makes no sense. They are getting married, with all of the obligations and commitments that opposite-sex married couples have. You turn reality on its head when you argue that getting married amounts to promoting promiscuity and immorality. This argument of yours makes no sense. \n \n I don't know why you are throwing in the NEA into your post, since they have nothing to do with the issue we are discussing. You seem to pick up the name of any organization or cause you dislike and toss them randomly into the mix of your argument. The same is true of \"secular humanism.\" You don't know that the same-sex couples who are marrying are secular humanists. Some probably are, and others are probably deeply religious. Many are Christians. They just understand Christianity differently than you do. There is no contradiction between being Christian and supporting same-sex marriage.",

But here's what I said:\n Archie thinks that teaching equality is \"psychological abuse\" and \"brainwashing\" despite every single medical organization's official position that it is nothing of the sort.\n \n ....\n \n Except that professionals have determined that it is not psychologically or psychiatrically (or even physiologically, however that might be) harmful. But Archie has never been one to listen to people who disagree with him, regardless of how qualified and experienced those other people are or how unbelievably unqualified and uneducated he is regarding that topic.\n \n ....\n \n And Archie still thinks that homosexuality coupled with the desire for equal rights qualifies as a \"psychological disease\" even though all the professionals say otherwise.\n\n \n \nOnce again, b]all of the research by the practicing professionals shows that this claim is false[/b]. When will you pay attention to reality?\n \n ....\n \n Psychologists and psychiatrists have found no abusive results of homosexual- and homosexuality-friendly environments. They have determined that homosexuality is not a disease or something that needs to be \"fixed.\" I can't say the same about delusion, which is clearly abound in your case. You can find that in the DSM. [bolding added]\n\n \n \nOnce again, the APA and the other APA don't consider homosexuality aberrant or wrong, but \"delusion\" is right there in the DSM-IV for people who know how to read...\n\n \nNot even a post that mentions these sources are evidence of anything. Is this another one of those cases where you think that because you make a claim, it must be accepted as true?\n\n I have a damn good track record here, and I'll remind you why: Here I've made a claim, you've finally merely acknowledged that my claim exists and have challenged the claim, and what follows is the evidence for my claim:\n \n AP[sychiatric]A CEO and Medical Director James H. Scully Jr., M.D., wrote:\n \n&#8220;Based on scientific and medical evidence the APA declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973 &#8211; a position shared by all other major health and mental health organizations based on their own review of the science... [bold added]\n\n \n From the AP[sychological]A\n \nIs homosexuality a mental disorder?\n \n No, lesbian, gay, and bisexual orientations are not disorders. Research has found no inherent association between any of these sexual orientations and psychopathology. Both heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior are normal aspects of human sexuality. Both have been documented in many different cultures and historical eras. Despite the persistence of stereotypes that portray lesbian, gay, and bisexual people as disturbed, several decades of research and clinical experience have led all mainstream medical and mental health organizations in this country to conclude that these orientations represent normal forms of human experience. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual relationships are normal forms of human bonding. Therefore, these mainstream organizations long ago abandoned classifications of homosexuality as a mental disorder. [bold added]\n\n \n More from the AP[sychological]A\n \nIs Homosexuality a Mental Illness or Emotional Problem?\n \n No. Psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals agree that homosexuality is not an illness, a mental disorder, or an emotional problem. More than 35 years of objective, well-designed scientific research has shown that homosexuality, in and itself, is not associated with mental disorders or emotional or social problems. Homosexuality was once thought to be a mental illness because mental health professionals and society had biased information.\n \n In the past, the studies of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people involved only those in therapy, thus biasing the resulting conclusions. When researchers examined data about such people who were not in therapy, the idea that homosexuality was a mental illness was quickly found to be untrue.\n \n In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association confirmed the importance of the new, better-designed research and removed homosexuality from the official manual that lists mental and emotional disorders. Two years later, the American Psychological Association passed a resolution supporting this removal.\n \n For more than 25 years, both associations have urged all mental health professionals to help dispel the stigma of mental illness that some people still associate with homosexual orientation.\n \n Can Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals Be Good Parents?\n \n Yes. Studies comparing groups of children raised by homosexual and by heterosexual parents find no developmental differences between the two groups of children in four critical areas: their intelligence, psychological adjustment, social adjustment, and popularity with friends. It is also important to realize that a parent's sexual orientation does not indicate their children's.\n \n Another myth about homosexuality is the mistaken belief that gay men have more of a tendency than heterosexual men to sexually molest children. There is no evidence to suggest that homosexuals molest children. [bold added]\n\n Once again, reality kicks your XXX. The professionals -- based on the science -- say that you and your primitive beliefs about gays are wrong and hazardous. So you feel free to thump your Bible and insist that your selective reading of ancient goat-herder mythology proclaims you right. People with brains that actually function properly know otherwise. We know that what will happen is that you will either cry foul that gays and evil liberals have infiltrated the APA and the other APA or -- more likely -- blame the evil secular trend of today's world for that awful science that doesn't agree with Archie's fantasy world.\n \n Or you'll continue to ignore these facts. I'll put my money on this one. You ignore the rest of reality when it doesn't suit your inane positions; why should now be any different? This is why you won't watch For the Bible Tells Me So.",

That is the point I was expounding on and the original concern I voiced in the posts above. If the gay lobby and the NEA are so justified in their actions, then why must they bypass the parents authority in getting this perverse info to minor children? \n \n I'll tell you why, because they know that the vast majority of parents would opt out of receiving this info just as the last generation did when parents had to be notified according to school policy. When that prevented the ability to indoctrinate the necessary percentage of students, they then determined that the policy needed to change, so now schools wont inform parents and give them the choice to determine what info their minor children are spoon fed by these so called educators.",

And as for kicking my XXX, emoticon_smile emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_xgood Dream on!!! \n \n Evidently you will never comprehend that many sciences, especially psychiatry is based on nothing more than guess work. And not even educated guess work in most cases. Here's what I mean...\n The Therapeutic State ~ Treatments Without Diseases\n By Thomas Szasz\n \n Thomas Szasz (tszasz@aol.com) is professor of psychiatry emeritus at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. His latest books are Coercion as Cure: A Critical History of Psychiatry (Transaction) and The Medicalization of Everyday Life: Selected Essays (Syracuse University Press).\n \n In the psychiatrically correct view, mental illnesses are &#8220;just like bodily illnesses&#8221;; in fact, they are authoritatively declared to be &#8220;brain diseases.&#8221; The truth is that they are not. In medicine, there are diseases and, sometimes, treatments for them. In psychiatry, there are no diseases; nevertheless there are always treatments; that is, procedures declared to be &#8220;therapies&#8221; for what, in fact, are diagnoses. The disanalogy between bodily disease and mental disease generates many confusions, perhaps most importantly the false belief that anti-psychotic drugs function analogously to antibiotic and antihypertensive drugs.\n \n There are objective criteria to determine whether a person has or does not have, say, a case of acute gonorrhea. This makes it reasonable to ask whether an antibiotic drug, say penicillin, is effective against gonorrhea. However, it is not reasonable to ask whether an anti-psychotic drug, say Zyprexa, is effective against schizophrenia, because there are no objective criteria to determine whether a person has or does not have this alleged disorder. This is why it is futile to debate whether one or another psychotropic drug &#8220;works.&#8221; All we can know is whether a particular mental patient likes or does not like to take a particular psychotropic drug; whether a particular family member likes or does not like his &#8220;loved one&#8221; to receive a particular psychotropic drug; and so forth. \n So as you can see, if psychiatry admits it can't even credibly diagnose schizophrenia, which has many consistent, or at least repetitive symptoms, then how can you possibly claim that they have nailed down homosexuality as you describe? And beside that, can you post where I EVER said that homosexuality was a mental illness anywhere? You love to raise fallacious points as if they were actually argued, and then when I question you on it as I did above, you jump on it as if I actually argued it. So how again did you kick my XXX by making an unprovable point that I never raised or argued in the first place? Other than in your mind of course. See post 43 for confirmation of what I'm saying. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=313619&postcount=43\n \n Also, you forget that I was around in 73/75, and remember in REAL TIME when homosexuality was removed as a mental illness. And I also remember that the gay lobby financed the trials and so called science that was responsible getting it removed. Basically, what it came down to was they interviewed enough people who said that they felt gay as children before they were sexualized, so the shrinks determined that it must be genetic or something like that. Even though 35 years later in 08, the so called gay gene still hasn't been absolutely identified. \n \n http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=8247",

   "foundit, did you happen to notice this question that I asked lyteboy in the post above in bolded letters? And beside that, can you post where I EVER said that homosexuality was a mental illness anywhere?\n\n You attack the APA for a decision that you don't even contest?\n Your hypocrisy knows no bounds.\n \n Regardless, you aren't going to answer for the OTHER LIES you told, are you.\n You're just going to ignore them, and refuse to substantiate your claims, aren't you...\n \n \n \nThe only evidence I posted wasn't even an attempt to prove gays are mentally ill, but only showed that psychiatry is a pseudo science at best according to Thomas Szasz, a professor of psychiatry emeritus at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. His latest books are Coercion as Cure: A Critical History of Psychiatry (Transaction) and The Medicalization of Everyday Life: Selected Essays (Syracuse University Press).\n\n It's funny you try to rest your hat on Szasz.\n He's not what you represent him as. There are some serious holes in his claims.\n While teaching at SUNY, Szasz offered private psychotherapy to individuals with \"problems in living,\" consistent with his belief that mental illness is a myth and that drugs do not solve emotional conflicts. He did not apply psychiatric disease labels to his patients because he believes that such diseases are fictional. Szasz's critics maintain that, contrary to his views, such illnesses are now regularly \"approached, measured, or tested in scientific fashion.\"[11] The list of groups that reject his opinion that mental illness is a myth include the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\n \n The journalist Jacob Sullum, who received a 2004 Thomas S. Szasz Award,[12] summarized some specific criticisms of Szasz's views when he noted that critics \"offer various alternatives to the Szaszian perspective, which insists upon an objectively measurable bodily defect as the sine qua non of a true disease\". If mental illness is a myth, the critics argue, so is physical illness[citation needed], because both categories have fuzzy boundaries and are to a large extent culturally determined. Viewing mental illness as a myth, they assert, is a fiction supported by Szasz in order to maintain the integrity of psychotherapy as a moral enterprise. Critics of Szasz also contend that the distinction between mental and physical disease is misleading, since, as the American Psychiatric Association puts it:\n \n &#8220; There is much that is \"physical\" in mental disorders and much \"mental\" in \"physical\" disorders.[13] &#8221; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Szasz\n \n But once again, you see something you like, so you repeat it without concern for veracity...\n \n \n \nIf anyone around here is claiming that homosexuality is a mental illness, it would be lesz who started that thread which implies that your brains are abnormal when compared to straight mens brains\n\n emoticon_xdonno \n Different does not mean \"mental illness\".\n \n Just QUIT with your obvious dishonesty already.\n It's so old it's boring.\n You complain that you're alone, yet you act PURPOSELY in a way that MAKES you alone.\n \n \n \nAnd based on his evidence, would evidence that a gay mans brain resembles a straight woman's brain more than a straight mans brain be solid evidence of a distinct deformity with it, or an abnormality at the very least?\n\n It's really quite underwhelming how you take somebody saying that two brains are similar, and you twist that into a million and one things, obviously false, and never even hinted at by the original person.\n Would it kill you to be honest about what another person says for a change?",

So by asking the question based on issues your side raises, I'm being dishonest, but by not posting that I'm only asking a question isn't dishonest on your part? Once again, your dishonesty and double standards are mind numbingly hypocritical and judgmental. But it's to be expected from your side I guess.",

   "It's filthy propaganda because it's being shown to minors who are not yet at the age of consent. http://www.massresistance.org/docs/events05/glsen_043005/tranny/tranny_panel.html And if you read it, they don't pass out info to take home so as to keep parents from seeing any literature about what they're really exposing their kids to. It is deceptive indoctrination that is done behind the backs of, and without the express permission of these kids legal guardians and parents who are responsible for the moral and spiritual upbringing. That is the point I was expounding on and the original concern I voiced in the posts above. If the gay lobby and the NEA are so justified in their actions, then why must they bypass the parents authority in getting this perverse info to minor children? \n \n I'll tell you why, because they know that the vast majority of parents would opt out of receiving this info just as the last generation did when parents had to be notified according to school policy. When that prevented the ability to indoctrinate the necessary percentage of students, they then determined that the policy needed to change, so now schools wont inform parents and give them the choice to determine what info their minor children are spoon fed by these so called educators.\n\n \n Age of consent for what? Gender identity is not sexual orientation. It has nothing to do with people having sex. Indoctrination into what? Treating all people fairly, including transgender people? \n \n The message, as I understand it, of educational programs is to let young people hear from transgender people themselves, in order better to understand them. I would be happy for my daughter to learn about transgender people, and indeed she does, at our church and in our lives, as we have transgender friends. She knows that Julie used to be Rob. It's no big deal to her. It's just who Julie is. \n \n As for whether parents are given the choice to opt out of these educational programs for their children, I don't know and I really don't care. What other school systems in other states do is really not my concern.",

But I don't think that 14 and 15 year old children and even younger, should be exposed to these issues with all of the obvious questions that come with them, especially without the express permission of their parents/LEGAL guardians. And if you have been involved with such programs, then please don't try to tell me the questions and focus of the discussions don't go into very adult areas of inquiry. \n \n Just putting myself in their place tells me I would ask about sex and identity issues, reproduction and lifestyle interests.

What seems so normal and acceptable to you is disgusting and nauseating to many of us in the straight community.\n \n Now let me share why I believe the militant gay community is so in your face about their extreme lifestyles. And it directly reflects my disgust at the way the NEA and the Gay Lobby is indoctrinating our young children with offensive material. In both cases the gay community understands that the only way to desensitize people to their lifestyle is to force us to be exposed to what they represent as much as possible so we will learn to accept what they represent. This is the reason for their community outreach programs and gay pride parades, unity walks and rainbow marches. It is all intended to make their most extreme views seem normal over time. And I don't mind telling you Op, it terrifies me that what I consider their dark message of deception has been so professionally marketed over the decades. It is a true us against them scenario since your side isn't even trying to just blend in or acclimate into American Society, but are dedicated to reshaping our society into the extreme image that is the gay community.",

   "The only thing hazardous around here is your blind faith in anything you can call science.\n\n Would you like to refute the studies, Professor Quantum Mechanics? Seriously, you -- a scientifically ignorant bumpkin -- are trying to tell me -- a person with a BS in a hard science who teaches advanced hard science -- what is science and what is not?\n \n \nSo as you can see, if psychiatry admits it can't even credibly diagnose schizophrenia, which has many consistent, or at least repetitive symptoms, then how can you possibly claim that they have nailed down homosexuality as you describe?\n\n No, this dinosaur Szasz thinks that psychiatry can't do these things. He thinks that there are no mental disorders, and he thinks this because the causes aren't completely known. That's a textbook example of the argument from ignorance fallacy. (That's one of your favorites.) The APA and other professional organizations who are actually with the times and have improved their research methods reject his claims.\n \n \nAnd beside that, can you post where I EVER said that homosexuality was a mental illness anywhere? You love to raise fallacious points as if they were actually argued, and then when I question you on it as I did above, you jump on it as if I actually argued it.\n\n You don't get to pull this. They're not fallacious. You've endorsed and repeated claims about how homosexuality and homosexuality acceptance are dangerous to society. You've said that they are dangerous to children psychologically and psychiatrically. You've said that homosexuals need to be \"fixed\" (have their sexual orientation changed). You posted lies about alleged homosexuals' affinity for molesting boys. You said that you think homosexuality is immoral and \"morally depraved.\" You said that teaching acceptance is \"brainwashing\" and is \"abuse.\" You object to homosexuality being accepted as \"right and normal.\" You said that homosexuality is a destructive lifestyle. (In fact, I challenged you to explain how homosexuality is destructive, and you didn't even try.)\n \n \nSo how again did you kick my XXX by making an unprovable point that I never raised or argued in the first place? Other than in your mind of course. See post 43 for confirmation of what I'm saying. [link]\n\n Or see this post that includes just a small number of the baseless, bigoted assertions you've been making. We know that you don't give a fat rat's XXX about honesty or integrity, so we aren't surprised that you just up and lie about points that you \"never raised or argued in the first place\" even though they're right there.\n It is, of course, telling that -- after I posted several excerpts that counter many of your bigoted claims -- you jump up and down and stamp and go nuts because I didn't show where you used the words \"mental disorder\" even though you said that homosexuality was \"wrong\" and not \"normal\" and needs to be \"fixed.\" Cry me a river, you poor, persecuted thumper. Anything to distract from the fact that, yes, you got your XXX kicked on these points.\n \n \nAlso, you forget that I was around in 73/75, and remember in REAL TIME when homosexuality was removed as a mental illness. And I also remember that the gay lobby financed the trials and so called science that was responsible getting it removed. Basically, what it came down to was they interviewed enough people who said that they felt gay as children before they were sexualized, so the shrinks determined that it must be genetic or something like that.\n\n I quoted the explanation of what happened. We really need no further confirmation that your reading skills leave much to be desired, so there's not much point in helping us out. Once again, you go ahead and refute the science, Professor Quantum Mechanics.\n \n \nEven though 35 years later in 08, the so called gay gene still hasn't been absolutely identified.\n\n You sound just like your hero Szasz. foundit pretty much made you look like an idiot when he referenced Mendel. But that's what you get for being scientifically ignorant.\n \n \n \nNow remember, I never even brought this subject up, electrolyte did.\n\n Look, if you want to behave like this, I clearly can't stop you. You made this an issue when you said, using all capital letters, that the article was, and I quote, \"FACTUAL.\"",
