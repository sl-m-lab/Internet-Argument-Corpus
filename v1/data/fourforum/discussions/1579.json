   "I was wondering if anyone had the faintest idea wh on earth the army is so right wing, aka cnservative, in the UK. i have always admiredthe army, but am a solid labour voter, so am quite annoyed that theyare complete contrasts. i know that the army is strict and so on, which may be considered conservative attributes, but i just want to know if anyone else has any ideas about this. Also, anyone could tellme about aldershot, a militay town/city, in the UK, and tell me about its political makeup. i just ondered this because i know loads of people who are joining the army, and most are wrking class, labour voters.",
