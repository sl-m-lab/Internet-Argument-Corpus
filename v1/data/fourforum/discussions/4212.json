   "Nagorno Karabakh conflict and America\n I got deeply dissatisfied with Americans. It is highly inadmissible to produce such assertions concerning Nagorno Karabakh conflict as the US Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Johns did. I think it is absolutely incorrect of Americans to be a stand-by of Azerbaijan in this question. If the matter is in Azerbaijanian oil (that the Americans want to secure a grip on) then they should keep in mind the Armenian lobby in the Congress as well! It would be very nice if American politicians start to think with what is between their ears. I sometimes seriously doubt there is anything at all.",

   "Gevorkian Azat lol, do u think America wants their oil, yeah? omg, don't u be so naive, buddy. Wanna know why America wants Azerbajan? We want it for the future war against Iran. Didn't u know it? lol Azerbajan is a very good place for our military bases. Air bases and everything else of the kind. Do u know how it is convenient when u only have to fly some 500 km drop yo bombs upon Tegeran and be back. u will even have some time left to write a letter home and have a nap after lunch, huh. again, we will have a chance to have several hundreds soldiers from north Azerbajan absolutely for free. after war in Iran Azerbajan will have Iranian northn provinces and will retract their claims for Karabakh. Armenians relax and enjoy it. Wheeeee",
