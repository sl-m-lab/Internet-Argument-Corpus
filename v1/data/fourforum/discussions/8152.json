   "I have never understood why some people become so offended and irate at the idea of homosexuality, especially among consenting adults (as most people will acknowledge that homosexual acts also occur among minors who are \"experimenting\")? What I have always found curious is how furious it makes some people. Why? What's the big deal? What is so wrong about two people loving each other and wanting to nurture and stand by the other person?\n \n What is so wrong about two adults who already share are all the bills, live together and fulfill every other task that hetero couples do having some sort of insurance or legal recognition of thise fact (ie: marriage)? How exactly is the legal union of gays and lesbians going to destroy the \"traditional\" family unit? That family unit will exist regardless, as will gays and lesbians. I don't see what one has to do with the other.\n \n There are those that believe that homosexuality is a choice- that homosexuals make a decision to be sexually attracted to members of the same sex. One question.... why would anyone, in this day and age, CHOOSE to be a targetted minority and have to put up with all the slander and abuse that accompanies such a choice? It also raises another interesting question- do you (the heterosexual reader) choose to love members of the opposite sex? Are you just as turned on by members of the same sex, but you squash such urges down?\n \n I don't know about any of you, but as a heterosexual female, I feel I was born this way. I can no more help the crushes I get on certain men then I can the color of my hair or eyes.\n \n So 1) Why are we attacking people that, for the most part, are peaceful and not interferring with anyone else's lives? and 2) If you honestly believe it is a choice, why are you so worried? If it is a choice, with significant social and familial disapproval, even if your son or daughter does stray over to the homosexual side, you can win them back with bible passages and prayer. So what's the problem?\n \n Oh for the record. I saw a hilarious Christian program a while ago about \"reformed\" homosexual males who had found god and were married (to women) and doing just peachy. Each one wore some variation of the same khaki pants and polo T-shirt, and smiled a little too much, and there was quite a lot of male eyes landing on other males. This program was aired on a channel which also featured a regular program called \"John's Thoughts\" (something like that), in which a man with a bleached crew cut would come on and sqwack at the audience about the virtues of heterosexuality and his love for his wife. So, a question for the truly righteous.... do stories such of the above make you feel exultant, like you've saved some sinner from the fiery depths of hell?\n \n Homosexuality is not an act. It is a state of being. Even if one refrains from ever having sex with the same sex, as long as they consistently and strongly desire or fantasize about such actions, they are homosexuals. (Sort of the same way a hemophiliac is a hemophiliac, even if kept in a bubble his entire life filled with fluffy pillows and never given the oppurtunity to bleed).\n \n Blah. I just don't see how it's anybody's concern but the couple involved, and why SO MANY people consider it their business. I'm not a god-fearing Christian that believes the dead go to either heaven or hell and the smurfs are evil, though, so maybe that's the problem... emoticon_xdonno",

What I have always found curious is how furious it makes some people. Why? What's the big deal? What is so wrong about two people loving each other and wanting to nurture and stand by the other person?\n\n \n People are afraid of things they don't understand. There is no excuse for their behavior however. I read more and more about people being upset for being called bigots over their views and verbal objections but these labels will become more and more common as more people realize they really are just bigots. \n \n \nWhat is so wrong about two adults who already share are all the bills, live together and fulfill every other task that hetero couples do having some sort of insurance or legal recognition of thise fact (ie: marriage)?\n \n \n \n Absolutely nothing. As time goes by, the general public are becoming more accepting. \n \n \n \nHow exactly is the legal union of gays and lesbians going to destroy the \"traditional\" family unit? That family unit will exist regardless, as will gays and lesbians. I don't see what one has to do with the other.\n\n \n It wouldn't destroy anything. It would only make marriage stronger. It would reward loving, monogomous couples regardless of a their sexes. \n I have NEVER seen a legitimate explanation of how gay marriabe would destroy traditional marriage. \n \n \n \nThere are those that believe that homosexuality is a choice- that homosexuals make a decision to be sexually attracted to members of the same sex. One question.... why would anyone, in this day and age, CHOOSE to be a targetted minority and have to put up with all the slander and abuse that accompanies such a choice? It also raises another interesting question- do you (the heterosexual reader) choose to love members of the opposite sex? Are you just as turned on by members of the same sex, but you squash such urges down?\n\n \n They think that claiming it is a choice, somehow makes their bigoted hurtful ways acceptable. It doesn't. No matter how many gays tell them it's not a choice they still feel that it's still up for debate. The American Psychological Association says it not a choice, but they can't \"prove\" it. This view is critical to their opposition. \n \n \n \nI don't know about any of you, but as a heterosexual female, I feel I was born this way. I can no more help the crushes I get on certain men then I can the color of my hair or eyes.\n\n \n It seems you have a good understanding of how homosexuality works. Your right, gays have no more control over their homosexuality and straights have over their heterosexuality. \n \n \nSo 1) Why are we attacking people that, for the most part, are peaceful and not interferring with anyone else's lives? and 2) If you honestly believe it is a choice, why are you so worried? If it is a choice, with significant social and familial disapproval, even if your son or daughter does stray over to the homosexual side, you can win them back with bible passages and prayer. So what's the problem?\n\n \n Most people, of any intelligence, realize that Bible passages and prayer can not change someone's sexuality. The Bible is usually just used as a weapon. They act as Jesus would..emoticon_xkill <end sarcasm<\n \n \n \nOh for the record. I saw a hilarious Christian program a while ago about \"reformed\" homosexual males who had found god and were married (to women) and doing just peachy.

They have done nothing more than ruin someones life. The only life they have, how selfish. I wonder if they ever stop and think what it would be like to force themselves, for the rest of their life, to be gay? I doubt it. \n \n \nHomosexuality is not an act. It is a state of being. Even if one refrains from ever having sex with the same sex, as long as they consistently and strongly desire or fantasize about such actions, they are homosexuals. (Sort of the same way a hemophiliac is a hemophiliac, even if kept in a bubble his entire life filled with fluffy pillows and never given the oppurtunity to bleed).\n\n \n Right. Heterosexuals wouldn't consider their heterosexuality as an act would they? Why should homosexuals.",
