   "From \"Overdrive\" magazine.\n \n MORE LAWS AND TOUGHER ENFORCEMENT PUT IDLING DRIVERS AT RISK OF FINES AND PRISON\n \n New Jersey's Deptartment of Environmental Protection made a 20 county sweep in august and found 101 trucks in violation of the state's three-minute idling limit.\n \n \"All 101 drivers will be fined $200 for the first violation,\" says department spokeswoman Erin Phalon. If they idle over three minutes again, the next fine will be $400, she says. The state will impose $1000 and $3000 fines on drivers for third and fourth violations.\n \n It's not just New Jersey. At least 25 other state and local jurisdictions have no-idling laws, enforcement is more likely than ever, and similar laws are under consideration in other areas with air quality issues. Most enforcement starts with a warning, but penalties can reach $25,000 and include a year in jail.\n \n \"Tickets are written on a pretty much infrequent basis,\" says Todd Spencer, vice president of the Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association. \"Most of those we've heard about are coming from places like Manhattan or New York.\"\n \n \"All these laws do is incrementally strip us of our freedom,\" says owner-operator Joe Rajkovacz of Wisconsin, who believes no-idling enforcement will soon be widespread. \"There are already a lot of areas with these laws.\" \n \n Despite the potential fines, some drivers appreciate the results of no-idle enforcement, including reduced noise. \"I like sleeping where it's quiet,\" says Styline Transport driver Timothy Begle of Dale, Ind.\n \n ........How much no-idle laws contribute to cleaner air depends on which statistics you look at. \"Most of the laws are passed for a specific metropolitan area,\" says Spencer. \"A lot of the air quality programs are local, so to understand the benefits you have to look at the local problem,\" says Suzanne Rudzinski of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \"In some areas it's going to be more important than others.\"\n \n In certain neighborhoods, exhaust from idling big trucks is a significant pollution source, says Linda Gaines, U.S Department of Energy analyst. But if you look at the total pollution from truck stops on a global scale, it's not that much, she says. Gaines adds there's no \"silver bullet\" to decrease global air pollution. \"Idle reduction is the low hanging fruit,\" she says.\n \n EPA studies show that only 10 percent of particulate pollution comes from on-road diesel engines. In typical U.S cities, 95 percent of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon pollution comes from gasoline vehicles, the EPA says. More alarming statistics about diesel exhaust come from a 1998-99 study of the Los Angeles area by California's South Coast Air Quality Management District. It claims diesel exhaust causes \"70 percent of the total cancer risk from air pollution.\" The 70 percent figure describes diesel exhaust's contribution of \"toxic risk,\" not it's share of pollution, says Gennet Paauwe, spokeswoman for the California Air Resources Board. \n\n \n I know that since I'm not an OTR driver, I'm not supposed to care about this. That's what Ms. Gaines meant by \"low hanging fruit.\" When only a small group is targeted, no one else pays attention. \n \n What we all must ask ourselves is, will the EPA's appetite be satisfied forever with only this low hanging fruit, or will they become hungry again later, and seek higher hanging fruit? Who among us does not have higher hanging fruit?",

   "I thought the reason big rigs stayed idling is because it uses more diesel to start the engine than it does to let it idle for a while, and during startup the burning of the fuel is not nearly as efficient creating more smoke.\n \n I wonder if they have actually done a study to figure out how much smoke is belched out during startup and compare that to idling. \n \n The studies they are talking about are just talking about total emissions from diesel in certain areas. That probably has nothing to do with idling.\n \n I'll bet you get more crud coming out during startup than 10 minutes of idling.\n \n Please, can a truck driver clear this up?",

   "It completely depends on climate/temp.\n \n In warm temps, extended idling is pointless, and in fact, hard on the engine. A certain amount of idling must be done in order for a hot engine to be allowed to cool, but once the engine temp has cooled and stablized, any further idling is a waste of diesel and emissions, not to mention hard on the engine. If the truck is going to be parked for any significant length of time, shutting the engine down once it's cooled is the best bet. The start up emissions are neglible, as the return to operating temp would not require a significant idling time.\n \n In cold climates, it's a whole different story. In many cases, a truck MUST be left idling or it you simply won't be able to start it again. Start up, and the ensuing idling to bring the truck up to acceptable operating temps, is not only hard on the engine, but does produce large amounts of emissions. There are alternatives though. Simple block heaters can be effective, but the best solution is a pro heat system. A small auxillary diesel engine runs that heats the vehicle's coolant, maintaining engine temps, and providing heat for the truck's interior/sleeper.\n \n As for the fines, it's all a matter of common sense IMHO. If idling is excessive in certain areas in a warm climate, then perhaps a limit should be enforced. However, in cold climates, when there is no real alternative, the regulations should take that into account.\n \n Unfortunately, both the greenies that push for the laws and the cops that enforce them are generally severely lacking in the common sense department.\n \n Waxy",

Most of the younger guys (25 and under) that purchase the new diesel engines in light duty trucks say, \"You don't just kill the engine when you get somewhere without letting it cool down for about 15 minutes.\"\n \n And they actually believe it.\n \n As far the real reasons, again, Waxy said it.",
