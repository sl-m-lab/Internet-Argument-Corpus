   "As is widely known terrorists come from affluent families. And not only terrorists but revolutionaries, for instance Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and in my own country most of the Marxist ideologues came from middle or upper class families. Osama bin Laden the most (in) famous terrorist of the XXI century is a member of a rich Saudi family.\n Faizal Shazad is the latest example of the proverbial rich little kid gone wrong, not like the son of Michael Douglas but much worse.\n So here he is in the land of milk and honey, with a wife who also has a tertiary education ( a degree in accounting) and he with a degree in business and later an MBA. What a better ticket to riches? OK he was not particularly intelligent, his grades were in the D, E, and F band but wow! Good enough to get an MBA. To be honest, a guy I worked with who was if not dumb, borderline, also got an MBA and that made me think that is no wonder that guys and gals with MBA lead many businesses to the ruin. Anyway, instead putting his MBA to good use such as realizing the American dream, Shazad has created a nightmare for himself and his family.\n Maybe Sheikh Shazad had a Master in Bomb Assembly.\n The moral of the story is that no matter what riches America may offer to Muslims, the pull of religion is stronger. And also it would be safer to accept as immigrants not rich kids, but poor people whose only interest in life is to make ends meet in order for their children once they grow up not having to worry about how to make ends meet.\n We poor people are the salt of the Earth.\n \n http://www.smh.com.au/world/loner-failed-in-search-for-the-american-dream-20100505-uaop.html",

A quality way of life, opportunity for themselves and their families and to be left alone by their government. Sound familiar anyone.",
