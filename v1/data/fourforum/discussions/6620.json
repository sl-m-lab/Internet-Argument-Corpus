   "While officials in European Union enforce measures against intellectual piracy in Europe, underground printing industry prospers in Ukraine, country that claims for EU membership. Ukrainian authorities are back-strapped in front of those publishing companies producing fake books under names of world-famous authors like Dan Brown (The Da Vinci code), John Grisham (The Broker), Clive Cusser (Dark Watch) and Michael Connelly (The Closers) and many others.\n \n Though it may well be that Ukrainian police \"can do nothing\" because they have a share in this business. It is obvious prosperity of Ukrainian book-pirates started after \"Orange revolution\", thanks to America's assistance to Ukrainian opposition in the period of the last year's presidential elections. During \"Orange revolution\" dozens printing shops were operating in the country (many of them located in Western Ukraine) placed at disposal of \"orange\" revolutionists by US sponsors and NGOs. During the revolution, innumerable leaflets, broadsheets and agitational booklets were printed there promptly. But then the revolution was over and printing capacities passed to the control of new regime of Victor Yuschenko and now book pirates take advantage of it... \n \n By the way, just the same takes place in Kyrghyzstan. In the view of global anti-piracy campaign (including book piracy), irresponsible behavior of American authorities and NGOs distributing high-performance printing equipment to oppositional forces in various boiling corners of the world is highly inadequate and requires attention of global society.",
