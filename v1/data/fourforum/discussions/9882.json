As farmers across the western world grow more crops for turning into bio-ethanol and bio-diesel and less for food, supply is being squeezed. \n Though touted as a way of offsetting global warming, biofuels have only had one clear effect so far, which has been send grain prices rocketing. While the British consumer has yet to notice much beyond the rising price of a loaf, the least well-off in other countries are already suffering.\n\n \n The article goes on to discuss the problems that this is causing in developing countries. Now, I am not foolish enough to believe that a lot of people actually care if people are starving to death in Africa. It is Africa. Starving to death is ind of what they do. They have had a lot of practice at it, evolved it to a fine art. If we actually cared, we could have stopped it decades ago.\n \n HOWEVER....there are some new components to the whole \"starving in Africa\" thing that, IMO, make this particularly noteworthy. The biggest one is that those starving people are attacking oil fields and pipelines in Nigeria and giving aid and comfort to Al Queda everywhere else. They have apparently stopped starving quitly and are now making noise as they starve. \n \n IMO, turning food into fuel so mr and mrs middle class american can afford to drive their suburban to McDonalds is just a bad policy...especially if when they get there they cannot afford to supersize their extra value meal because buns cost $2 each. \n \n It will not take too long for the American lower class to start suffering from the same. Buried in the CPI data where nobody ever looks were some pretty damn disturbing numbers related to food price inflation. The most dusturbing was the compound annual rate for the 3 months ending in March. 7.6%. That is pretty scary. \n \n Most large food producers buy their materials (corn, soybeans, etc...) on contract, so we have not even strated to see the tip of the iceberg yet. In the last year, the cost of corn has doubled. Soybeans are up 70%. Food producers such as Coca Cola, Tyson, and Fanestil have already taken a major hit to their bottom line. The Big Box retailers are weathering the storm a little better and absorbing some of the cost increases, but even the Might Wal Mart (tm) has admitted that they will have to slowly increase prices in order to preserve profit. For already struggling middle and lower class Americans, increased food costs coupled with increased fuel costs will be more than many can handle.",

   "Destroying food so that we can continue to drive around in SUV's has always struck me as incredibly stupid. \n The sheeple these days have no idea what the consequences will be of the bio-fuel mania. Well, they'll know about it when the price of food doubles or triples, but then it will be too late.\n It just goes to show you how shortsighted and narrow minded sheeple really are. Instead of using less energy to compensate for the fact that we're short on oil/energy, we'd rather destroy a basic human need.\n Apparently these days a fueled up SUV is more of a basic human need than food.\n \n The sheeple would rather not eat than give up a little bit of their comfortable lifestyle.\n I swear to God, if we could make ethanol out of babies we would do so.\n \n What also gets to me is that a lot of ethanol is made from corn, which is basically the least efficient material that you can turn into ethanol. Sugarcane and cellulose are much more energy efficient materials",

   "What also gets to me is that a lot of ethanol is made from corn, which is basically the least efficient material that you can turn into ethanol. Sugarcane and cellulose are much more energy efficient materials\n\n In this country, yes, much production will be geared to corn. I places like Brazil, no. The majority of the US does not have a clmate to support sugarcane production. Florida, Louisiana, Hawaii, and parts of Texas do, but the farm belt is much more suited to produce corn. I don't know if you have ever seen much of Florida, but we have already killed off far too much of the glades for Citrus and Sugarcane production. I doubt that the US can really step up sugarcane production without disturbing or destroying an ecosystem. \n \n I agree though...the solution is to use less energy, not to change the energy we use. Ethanol is even less efficient than most other fuels...which begs the question of why we would switch to a less efficient fuel in the first place?",

   "There are two problems that nag at me on the fuel economy issue. One is the Federal Highway Safety Standards which add several hundred pounds for this and that. As a daily commuter, I never touch the highway and my speed does not exceed 35 mph yet I am forced by the gubment to lumber about with an \"uparmored\" Saturn. I would be delighted to purchase a stripped down, light weight pocket-sized rice rocket, but I am not going to spend in excess of $14,000, plus insurance and depreciation to gain 8 mph. Would that the gubment would allow smaller-sized vehicles for the off-highway or suburban commuter...I, like many families would have two cars: One would be my present 4-door sedan, the other, a hyper efficient Algoremobile. \n \n Another problem is the question of mass. The gubment has long advocated that heavier vehicles are safer. This is actually not the case. Similar vehicle weights increases safety, not a wide differential of weights. The way I see it, and Jo will correct me if I am wrong, but Physics states this: If I travel in my 2,000 lb Toyota Yaris and hit a 4,000 lb Cadillac Guzzler, and the combined velocity of impact is 90 MPH, I will sustain a velocity reduction of 60 MPH whereas te Guzzler will realize only 30 MPH reduction. How has the heavier vehicle increased my highway safety?\n \n I personally do not care a whit for the kind of vehicle I drive. I would commute to work on a solar powered pogo stick if the science and the gubment could make it work. Nevertheless, there are those suburban safari goers who simply cannot go Krogering without a land yacht to haul the little dears about. Kids these days whisk about on leather seats and numb their brains to back seat DVD players. When I was a boy, we had an analog version of the DVD player. It was called a BOOK! We read! \n \n I'm sorry, I fell into an eldery rant there. I want to use as little gas as possible. I am not an Environmentalist, I am a greedy, penny pinching miser, and if you build a cheap, lightweight, no frills, durable vehicle, I will buy it. Until then, I will keep piling miles on the 96 Saturn (251,000 and counting).\n \n Question: If Global warming trends continue, would not a greater part of the US be conducive to sugar cane growth thereby alleviating our dependence on foreign oil? True, it might devastate the American sweater industry...",

You, through no fault of your own, are put at higher risk due to his higher level of safety.",

   "Excellent post E Mutz. In addition, the CAFE standards imposed by the government on vehicle manufacturers caused two side effects. One, all passenger sedans, in attempting to meet the fuel economy target, began to look alike, IMO. Aerodynamics is aerodynamics. \n \n Worse, it fueled the demand for SUVs, built on the light truck platform and thus exempt from fleet averages, and open to unlimited designs. I'm surprised tail fins haven't become popular again.\n \n I privately rail at SUV drivers when I see them speeding past or attempting to park in a lot. I may be a bit hypocritical because I drive a full-sized pickup. In my mind I draw a distinction between the two though. A pickup truck speaks of utility and handiness. Otherwise, my choice would be the Speck Miser with overdrive.",
