   "I was wondering if my dog uses reason to some degree or if he feels emotions like I do. I did a bit of research and I found websites like this that make the distinction between reflexive, or instinctive actions and learned actions. \n http://www.wagntrain.com/OC/\n \n So is it correct that any action that is not instinctive, is an action that involves some form of logic? It makes sense to me that for any organism to learn something, it has to use logic. Here is a website that illustrates types of learning displayed by other animals\n http://asci.uvm.edu/course/asci001/behavior.html\n \n The website explains \"insight learning\" and I googled for more reading and I found this\n http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/apr/29/theobserversuknewspages.uknews1\n \n Apparently many aves from the crow family and the Kea are very intelligent creatures that are capable of learning without instruction and not by trial and error, but by reasoning before-hand.\n \n Dolphin creativity\n http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/051107_dolphinfrm.htm\n \n As for emotions, every animal acts on pleasure and pain so I'm guessing this is why my boy stomps his feet every time he sees his leash and knows we're going for a jog in the mountains. He must feel something, right? I'm saying it's happiness as we experience, but something like it. Further reading on animal emotion\n \n Dolphin Suicide\n http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/2373\n \n My last question is, what are the fundamental differences between human and another animal? If animals can think and feel emotions to some extent then shouldn't they be treated with more respect?",

   "That depends on what you mean by a distinct line.\n \n It may be true that animals do not have the same level of logical reasoning that humans do (some of us anyway), but I think to say that there is a distinct line is overstepping the mark.\n \n It is more a gradual slope. Animals are just a bit further down the slope. It may be that some animals are further up the slope than some humans.\n \n It's like me saying that I'm good at maths.\n \n Compare me to a dog, and you'll see that I'm very good.\n \n A 5 year old (ruling out prodegies), I'm still very good.\n \n Martin Colbert who was in my maths class at school, well I'm fairly good (but he was very good).\n \n Charles Epps (on NUMB3RS), okay maybe not.\n \n Everything is relative.\n \n Of course, animals have reasoning and logic, just at different levels.\n \n Smiley",
