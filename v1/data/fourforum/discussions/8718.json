   "I used to think that I would personally never have an abortion. Ieven considered myself to be pro-life at one point. Circumstances in my life have caused me to completely re-evaluate how I feel about all of this.\n \n I live with mental illness and a personality disorder. I also have narcolepsy. The worse the narcolepsy gets, the harder a time I have with mental problems, and vice versa. Right now I am able to hold a precarious balance with 10-11 hours of sleep nightly, strong medications, and the support of my loved ones. I am a single parent to a six year old and I work full-time, with great difficulty, to care for her. After the birth of my daughter I had post-partum psychosis for about a year. Prior to that and since then I've had other psychotic periods brought on by high levels of stress, lack of adaquate sleep, and other health problems. Just a couple of weeks ago I had a psychotic episode lasting a few days caused by a new narcolepsy drug I was trying. I called my SO, utterly terrified, and asked him for help. When he arrived at my home I was shoving a dirty sewing pin into my forearm over and over again. I just wanted my life to end in the worst way, but I couldn't bear doing that to my little girl. The infection has healed now, and the bruises have faded. You can still see all the little marks where the pin punctured my skin, but the anxiety is going to stay with me much longer, I'm afraid.\n \n Have you ever been through this? Losing control over your mind? It's the most overwhelming feeling of terror I can imagine. Two days was bad enough. I couldn't even consider going through that again for another year. There is no way in hell I will put myself *or* my child through that again willingly. She needs a mom who can take care of her. That's far more important than any potential child.\n \n Based on most pro-life beliefs my options are to either be celibate for the next 25 years minimum, or take the risk of putting myself and my child through misery (since any contraceptive method includiing sterilization carried some risk of failure). I don't find either one of those options acceptable. I really hope none of you ever find yourself facing that kind of choice.",

I would have to give both children up or their lives and well-being would be at risk. That's assuming I even completed the pregnancy without a successful suicide attempt. This may be of little consequence to an infant, but to my daughter it would be devastating. \n \n As for remaining celibate, something tells me that very few of even the most ardent pro-life advocates would be willing to do the same, particularly if it meant severing a healthy long-term relationship that has been in existance for years already. Especially if that relationship provided you with much of the support you needed to function on a daily basis.\n \n What makes you think I don't take any precautions to prevent pregnancy? My whole point is that even if I were to have a tubal ligation (which is *not* the most effective form of artificial birth control anyway) there would still be a risk. The risk I currently have of concieving accidently is very very low. I find it to be incomprehensible to choose celibacy over the one in a million chance I may need to have an abortion at sometime in the future. \n \n This is what I find to be unintelligent about the pro-life point of view. The rigid and uncompromising position that it puts many women in. The idea that a one in a million chance of accidental conception could trump one's ability to engage in a normal and healthy romantic relationship.",

And a 40yr old is not comparable to a new born in some ways...whats your point? All of them are human though. \n\n \n By simply existing? Not hardly. Anyone who has a current license to practice medicine and dispense prescriptions is capable of writing me one. Not to mention that even with a doctor to write me a script, I still have to take it for it to have any effect. So the only born person with any amount of direct control over my brain chemistry is ME. The doctor also has a choice of what and whether to prescribe me medication, whereas a fetus has no choice about how much it effects my production of hormones. If a medication is affecting me adversely I can stop taking it. If a doctor is not giving me effective treatment, I can switch doctors or ask to try something else. And if a fetus is causing a compromised state to my mental health the ONLy way for me to end that is to stop gestating it.\n \n \n \nIn that cause you shouldn't have the right to kill another human just because others feel you can. \n\n \n Of course the fact that I agree have this right is inconsequential I suppose?

I'm not going to lose any sleep over the issue. Besides that, if the USA went so far as to outlaw abortion even for medical reasons (as would have to be the case in order to make it illegal for me to get one) then I suspect I would be living somewhere else as quickly as possible. \n \n [Yet you can't be sure that abortion would even prevent you from \"hurting your child\"....and you claim the reason is for your child but all of your arguments have been about you.[/quote]\n \n Given my medical history it's as sure as i can possibly be. I do know that I could never intentionally harm my child while in a non-psychotic state, and that while in a severe psychotic state I cease to have any control over my thoughts or actions. I also know that PPP has thus far been the only trigger to result in that level and duration of psychosis. It would make sense that at hte very LEAST I would avoid that particular occurance from happening again, and to complete another pregnancy knowing what I know would be neglectful and reckless on my part. Since I know that ending a pregnancy early (whether by natural or atrificial means) does *not* result in psychosis, therefore an abortion would be a reasonable and safe course of action to take in regards to preserving my mental health. \n \n \nYou aren't telling the full story...you surely could make it work even if it makes your family have to work harder...\n\n \n Make what work?

   "The risk still exists as there have been reported cases of postpartum pscyhosis after abortion.\n\n \n Then I'm sure you should have no issue proving it. Regardless, if I had any sort of history of psychosis following the early loss of a pregnancy, that might cause me concern. I haven't, so it doesn't.\n \n \ndepends on who you ask i suppose....8-12 weeks is what you normally hear.\n\n \n Who do you normally hear it from? I've never seen anything other than the 8 week mark given from any medical source.\n \n \nYet it is not the common 1st trimester procedure...\n\n \n And what does that have to do with the price of tea in China? The only other surgical abortion technique used during the first trimester is manual vacuum aspiration, which is just a very similar but slightly less invasive procedure. Unless you can show me some link between manual vacuum aspiration and psychosis that does not exist for D&C, then I have to ask why it was even brought up to begin with? \n \n It would seem pretty clear from my past experience that the level of hormone present in my system during the early stages of pregnancy is NOT sufficient to trigger psychosis whether it is interrupted by natural or artificial means. \n \n \nYet you seem to think this warrents a death sentence...\n\n \n Self defense would be a more accurate legal comparison. If someone were actively harming you and the only possible way to stop them was to kill them, would you do it? I hope so. \n \n \nThen don't use that kind of argument then...You are pretty much telling me my argument is dumb (which it is) yet I was using your own logic to produce that result.\n\n \n No you weren't. I'm not obligated to live by the morals of others. You were arguing that in that case I'm not obligated to live by MY OWN morals. How is that comparable to my argument? \n \n \nYour argument makes no sense. I pointed out that you shouldn't have sex if you don't want to deal with the risks of pregnancy and possibly abortion and I also pointed out that sex is not nessecarly needed in a relationship. You turn around and think I am the same way and don't want to deal with those risks...this may or may not be the case. Like I pointed out, if I wanted a child then sex is one way to get there. The consequences of my actions would be fully accepted. There is no \"putting my money where my mouth is\" because i am not saying that no one should have sex. You are performing a classic strawman. \n\n \n Wrong. I never implied you were saying that no-one should have sex. Your contention is that voluntarily abstaining from sex within a long-term romantic relationship is not harmful to or antithetical to that relationship. I disagree. If sex is such an unneccessary part of a marriage or romantic partnership, then surely you should have no trouble proving it. If you have the balls to say that *I* should sacrifice myself for your pro-life ideals, then why would you be unwilling, even temporarily, to do the same? Think of all the good you'd be doing for your cause by proving all of us immoral sex-crazed baby-killers wrong once and for all.\n \n \nWho says I haven't?\n \n <skipping some for the sake of length<\n\n \n If you are in fact currently abstaining from sexual intercourse within a healthy marriage or long-term romantic relationship, and plan to do so until such a time comes that pregnancy is no longer physically possible, either due to an advanced menopausal state, or a medically neccessary removal of the reproductive organs, then your argument may have some validity here. Otherwise you are only speculating about what you would or would not in reality be willing to do if you were in my shoes.\n \n \nWho said it is better? I think celibacy would be the safest option though.\n\n \n I say it's better, and since I'm the one who has to live with whatever choices I make, then my opinion is the one that counts here. Safety is not the only concern. Though sex is a neccessary part of my relationship, the benefits of that relationship to my ultimate well-being go way beyond just the sex. Ending the relationship in order to avoid the remote possibility of pregnancy and thus abortion would have a greater overall negative impact than any abortion possibly could. There is also no realistic possibility of maintaining the relationship while abstaining from sexual intercourse.\n \n \nYou could have someone else care for them for 9 months or have a family member help. What do you do in the case that you have an episode caused by non-pregnancy reasons?\n\n \n Prior to going on medication I was still married and her father took care of her while I was in the hospital. When I wasn't in the hospital she and I were both in danger, and we are lucky that nothing happened. Even if he were currently willing to take on full custody, which he isn't, it would be for much longer than nine months. As it's called postpartum psychosis, it occurs after having given birth, not during the pregnancy itself, and can go on for an indefinite amount of time. Last time was at least a year. In many cases the psychosis become worse with each re-occurance. \n \n The last psychotic episode I had lasted all of two days, and my mother was able to take emergency time off of work to take care of her. She is not available to do this for any prolonged amount of time however. She works 70 hour weeks to support her and my father as my father is now too ill to support them financially in full. We know what caused the last episode, and are thus able to prevent it from happening again.\n \n You are acting as if something like this would have no consequences for my daughter though. Of course if something were to happen to me then someone else would have to care for her. And of course there is always the possibility, though thankfully now less likely, that that could happen independantly of pregnancy. The big difference here is that post-partum psychosis is one of the few serious mental health issues that is fully PREVENTABLE! Preventable by NOT GIVING BIRTH. I may not be able to prevent or forsee every issue that could cause a decline in my mental health, but I have every intention of preventing those that I can for the sake of my child, as well as for my own sake. There are only two 100% effective options for preventing birth (not pregnancy) available at my disposal. Abortion and abstinance. Only one of those options is acceptable to me.\n \n \nBecause there is an absolute right and wrong answer to this kind of question.\n\n \n According to who? You? If it were black and white then no one would disagree with you. \n \n \nFor the sake of argument...lets assume an abortion did cause psychosis. What would you do in this situation?\n\n \n I'd insist on a hysterectomy since the risk to my health from a pregnancy would far outweigh the medical risks and consequences of having the surgery. That is not the case however, and thus why I wouldn't be able to have it done even if I wanted to. Hysterectomies DO have grave medical consequences and increase your risk for fatal diseases significantly, so they are not given without very good cause. Since I know you're going to ask me, if hysterectomy were not an option at all, and abortion did cause psychosis, I'd still probably take the risk since my odds of pregnancy are still very low, and ending my relationship would have a devastating effect on my overall suicide risk anyway. \n \n There really are no perfect solutions to this problem. All i can do here is carefully assess the risk given what I know and take the option with the lowest risk. You may not like the fact that for me the option with the lowest risk is to take the small chance of needing to have an abortion, but that doesn't change the facts.",

Who has a right to decide what constitutes a good reason for abortion for someone else? What if the pregnancy causes no immediate medical risk to the mother, but she is already supporting children on her own and will have to take a significant amount of unpaid time off work to give birth? What if doing so would leave her and her children without a home or a way to feed themselves? If she wants an abortion them who else has the right to decide that that isn't a good enough reason? I'll tell you who; no one! No-one else is going to have to live what she lives or take care of her responsibilities. No one else has the right to decide for her whether or not she gives birth. \n \n I don't think my reasons are better than anyone else's just because they involve a medical risk. And I certainly don't see ANY reason why I should have to plead my case to a judge (who could very well be pro-life and I would have no recourse) who doesn't know anything about mental illness, neurological illness, or any other medical knowledge for that matter. If abortion is outlawed then people like me would have to place out very lives in the hands of someone who is NOT A DOCTOR and has no business making MEDICAL DECISIONS for other people.

The \"pro lifers\" have to deal with the fact that women are going to have it tough and that it is indeed unfair sometimes. I feel that it has never been morally right to classify humans and it has never worked well in that past and thus I argue against abortion.\n \n But even with your argument it really makes me wonder why you error on the side of death. I can't imagine erroring on the side of death for a murder suspect....\"well, we will execute him and if it turns out he was innocent then we will know!\". but thats just me\n\n \n If we are pro-choice, then we think the mother should have rights. If you are pro-life, you think the fetus should have rights. I don't think the fetus should have rights over a mother until its in its third trimester, in which case if the mother didn't want the baby, she should've aborted before. A pregnant woman should never be forced to give birth. Forcing a woman to give birth is like rape, you do it against a mother's will, and the other side argues that you are stopping a life from being created. Should rape be legal because it has the possibility to create a life? Should we outlaw condom and birth pill sales because its preventing a life from being created? To me, its completely unconstitutional and completely immoral to be forcing our contrys women to provide us with babys against their own will.\n \n My friend said to me yesterday \"jeez, pro lifers are so annoying. I mean, we have so many unwanted children in this world, why would we possibly want more?\". I agreed. Why would you want more unwanted children in this world steeeve? Simply because a fetus is a life, does that mean that is has so much power to ovveride a womans choice? You claim the pro-choice argument is based on selfishness, while i think the contrary. I think the fetus is rather selfish, living off of the mother against her own will, sucking up her resources and causing her pain, and she cant do a darn thing about it, you say. Then, the fetus demands to be born, fed, and raised.\n \n Who's selfish now steeeve?",

   "This nothing to do with the \"elite\", whatever the fork that means. To suggest that those that profess a pro-choice positon do not respect the dignity of human life, is not based in fact.\n \n \n Yes it does. The elite self appointed \"persons\", who have power, are proposing to decide who is not a person based on development and size. \n \n \nYou are forgetting an utterly unique characteristic of this supposed person. It is contained in and completely dependent for ALL physiologic needs, including respiration, kidney & liver functions, hormonal support, digestion, etc, upon another human being. This is the entire issue.\n\n \n So what is your point? That the level of dignity one should afford a human being is based on their level of independence and development? This has implications for the large underdeveloped people as well the small, and I am sure is troubling to the handicapped. If I were Neil Armstrong, I would not feel comfortable going out for a space walk knowing someone with this argument were in charge of making sure my connection cord was working right. They might get bored, or just choose to cut the life supply for any reason at all. \n \n \nThat is a straw man. Pro-choice proponents do not have a low view of human life. That is an unfounded characterization. No one is perceiving anything as having less dignity or flawed.\n\n \n Pro-choice proponents have a lower view of human life than pro-life proponents. Lets look at the two main views.\n \n This is the view which drives the pro life movement: That the creator created human beings in His image and imparted value, meaning, purpose, and dignity. I will argue that it is the view which presents the highest view of human life, and thus the highest view of women. This view allows that there is inherent dignity within each human life and therefore everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. And, even if they aren't, their life has value. This value was not given by humans and therefore cannot be taken away by humans.\n \n The predominate view which is at the heart of the pro choice movement is secular humanism. Everything has happened by chance and therefore mankind is a random wart on the face of a random meaningless chance universe. Therefore all human life is just the sum of its parts and is of no more value than dirt. It has no inherent meaning. Therefore, this view cannot disagree that women have no intrinsic value - they are no better than dirt. \n \n Therefore, the view which predominately drives the pro life movement places a view of women that is exceedingly and abundantly trancendent above the view which predominately drives the pro choice movement. The pro life view of women is of a different quality and order.\n \n \nWhat I asked, and you didn't answer, was not whether abortion should be illegal. It is obvious that you think that. If you call it murder, do you then think the mother and physician should be arrested for premeditated murder?\n \n\n Sure, if abortion = murder and if it is indeed premeditated. You left out the guy, and those who might be pressuring her into it as well. Of course each case is unique though.",

Like those religious healing shows, those are the biggest fraud i've seen on TV. Yet a biased scientist is rare. Scientists are fallible, just like anyone else. Me, you, steeeve, thelmoose, the pope, everyone. They're all fallible. But, scientific evidence is not fallible, while faith and religious evidence most certainly is. The only reason that most christian zealots, gaaah, i mean christians believe that abortion is wrong is because it is \"God's creation\". Thats why most atheists, scientists, and great thinkers are pro-choice.\n \n If there was no faith in god, then i assure you that the pro-life movement would be nonexistant. If males had to go through what women did in pregnancy then i also assure you that the pro-life movement would be almost non existant. Religious faith is not good for our society. It is holing us back from advancing, and keeping us at a primitive stage. It tries to condemn cloning, abortion, and embryotic stem cell research when all three are breakthroughs in science, and can help people greatly. Sadly, religion and faith are very primitive, and our destroying our society.\n \n Let me ask you something, have you ever been pregnant?",

   "You obviously don't deal with philosophy books too often. The idea that everything has some bit of faith is not a foreign one....it requires an understand that you really can't prove anything for sure.\n\n Thelmoose had the best response to it, and I'm not even going to try to do better.\n \n I will add this though...\n Such a level of \"analysis\" overlooks the reality of the situation, whereby you ignore the fact that you have no objective evidence for your position, and you ignore the objective evidence for the other position. It's a tactic I see more and more with conservatives to eschew the knowledge (with objective evidence) that exists to try to pretend that it has equal footing with beliefs which lack objective evidence or have doubtful evidence.\n \n \n \nthe meat of the matter is actually that Simone is using a faith.\n\n If you're talking about \"science\", then you're just plain wrong.\n I realize you won't admit that, and I also see that nobody else is in the same boat as you trying to pretend what you are, so I'll leave it at that.\n \n To try and denigrate science as a \"faith\" is nonsensical.\n \n \n \nthen this argument is over....if you aren't on the topic of abortion (Simone was) then why am I even bothering.\n\n Looking at your statements, I see virtually nothing actually talking about abortion anymore.\n The fact that you want to drop this with me is not surprising...\n \n \n \nNo, but atleast state remotely on topic. Dang. This whole time I was under the impression that you were defending Simones \"science\" and you aren't. In fact, it was a basis for a majority of my comments. Do you not agree that it is a pointless debate when the two parties involved differ on what they think the argument is about?\n\n Like I said.\n If you can point to some CONTEXT whereby I was misunderstanding your statements due to CONTEXT, then it is important.\n \n If you are making sweeping generalizations about science being a faith, and not isolating your comments within a specific CONTEXT, then no. I don't agree.\n \n You were arguing that science takes faith.\n I disproved that with the definition of faith. A firm belief in something for which there is NO proof.\n You tried to obfuscate that issue by ignoring the word PROOF, and focus on the meaning of \"facts\".\n Science HAS proof. Whether or not you want to \"believe\" it, it has objective proof that can be independently verified.\n Faith does not.\n \n And now you're trying to derive significance from your misinterpretation about how I was supposedly doing something I never even hinted at?\n If you think your own failure to recognize that I was not doing something I never hinted at made you incapable of debating this topic, then that's your own opinion.\n I think I did fine on my end.",
