   "I have seen some infants that were baptized as young as two days from birth, other people as late as 60 years old. To which holds the most spiritual truth ?\n\n This is an odd question, considering you don't seem to believe in any truth that is spiritual.\n \nA child baptized at 7 years of age will know little, if anything about what the act of Baptism and accepting Jesus as His Lord and Saviour, truly means . Yet, the 60 year old that has lived life, and will truly surrender his heart and soul to Jesus at the time of Baptism, should have the maturity to understand what he is doing and the convictions he is making \n\n Is Baptism about accepting Jesus? Some Protestants believe you can perform a one-off act, Orthodox, such as myself do not. Therefore Baptism is not 'the end' of one's life into Christianity, as you would think, but the beginning.\n Why give a child a name at birth? How is he/she aware of who he/she is? We give children a name because they are individuals, it makes them part of our family, though they would be without the name, still be part of our family, but the name makes them unique. Likewise Baptism is the entry into the family of God. It is a statement of intent that the child is part of this family, as is giving your child your surname.\n \nWith this scenario, which is the more likely to end up in the \"heaven\" of the afterlife, the 60 year old, that has lived and turned his life over to Christ, or the 7 year old , who knew nothing of life at the time of baptism, had not excercised his free will, and had yet to live any life ? If Baptism at birth is all that is required to have eternal life, with no faith, no convictions, on the part of the newborn/young person, then what is the total value of a late in age, Baptism ? If the infant's baptism is a locked seal to heaven, are our churches doing a grave injustice to the souls on earth , by not making infant baptism the \"standard \" for all religions in the western world ?\n\n Your questions are very much loaded with assumptions.",

If a person is truly saved, yes &#8211; they will remain true to God. If they are baptized, but are unsaved, then they are as one who does not believe. There is a difference in believing in God and believing God. But, you know that.\n Ezekiel 3 : 20 says, &#8220;Again, when a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.&#8221; \n So many times I have talked with friends that tell me that they were baptized when they were boys and have nothing to worry about. I don&#8217;t push the Bible on them, but I do tell them that they need to read that part again.\n \n And as far as young people being baptized and not knowing why &#8211; I agree.

I agree , it is a highly debatable question , and I surely hope I dont start any wars by asking it. :) As I have posted here earlier, I believe in Christ and His Works, but have so many questions, because I am not in the \"light \" anymore. I was raised up in the southern baptist group, to where the younger one was baptized , the better . But those baptisms were always as a result of \"revival week\" that seem to happen in August. The whole week was dedicated by the preacher to get people to give their heart to Jesus, and come up front , and publicy confess to the church members. The baptism for that person wanting to be saved, would be in the local creek the following Sunday. \n \n As I said way back on here , I left my regular church attendance when I was 13, and my Mom stayed on my case about going back to church , and getting baptized, for a loooong time :) . I am 52 now, and have still not been baptized, I guess it bothers me , and it makes me even more inquisitive about religion and clarification of scripture, which makes me look like a non -believer , which I am not.",

It's like practice before the big game. The true baptism is from the Holy Spirit and no one can dunk you but yourself.\n You have the light in you, Greg.

Is this a accurate interpretation, or am I not getting it in the right order and mixing up the interpretation ?\n\n \n Christ told us to be baptized (Matthew 28:19, John 3:5) and he endowed baptism with the power to cleanse us of sin and save us (1 Peter 3:21).\n \n None are without sin (Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8) and we sin after baptism (or profession of faith).\n \n Nothing unclean will enter heaven (Revelation 21:27) and we are unclean once we sin again.\n \n Eternal security after \"being saved\" was not a teaching of the Church. Salvation is an ongoing process, not a one time event or declaration of faith:\n \n 1. I have been saved   through grace by the sacrifice of Christ. He has redeemed the world, brought salvation into the world and made it possible as a free gift, undeserved.\n \n 2. I am being saved   by cooperating with Christ in sanctification during my life.\n \n 3. I will be saved   at the last Judgment. That is, I hope I will be saved provided I fulfill the proper requirements Romans 11:22. Paul almost always speaks of hope, not assurance.\n \n Even Paul (an apostle) considered it possible to lose his own salvation (after baptism and profession of faith). Consider these verses by Paul who is often championed as the advocate of eternal security:\n \n Romans 11:22  paraphrased \"remain in God's kindness or you will be cut off\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 9: 25-27\"Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Well, I do not run aimlessly, I do not box as one beating the air; but I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.\"\n \n Philippians 3:8-16  \"Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like hiim in his death, that if possible I may attain the resurrection of the dead.\n Not that I have already obtained this   or am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize   of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained.\"\n \n Also consider Hebrews 10: 26-31  \"For if we sin deliberately AFTER receiving the knowledge of the truth, THERE NO LONGER REMAINS A SACRIFICE FOR SINS, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries. A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by WHICH HE WAS  SANCTIFIED, and outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said,'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.' And again, 'The Lord will judge his people.' It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n \n Other relevant verses: Matthew 7:21, Matthew 24:13, Philippians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 2 Timothy 2:11-13, Hebrews 6:4-7.",
