   "I want to say first that this thread is primarily aimed at conservative Christians. In other words, I don't need a bunch of anti-fundamentalist stuff spewed all over here. If I wanted that I'd do it myself :) cuz I have plenty of beefs with them. You are welcome to post on here if you're not a conservative Christian (I'm not by any means), it's just that I want this thread to actually have a focus instead of being a ****ing contest. Ok then, lets get to it.\n \n Why is it that the focus of so much of the religious right's attention is on homosexuality and sexual sins in general (but homosexuality in particular)? There is a legitimate biblical argument (although I disagree with it, but that's beside the point) for saying that homosexuality is one among many sins and that sin is sin is sin in God's eyes. I've heard this put forth by Bassman and a couple people I know. Yet the majority of conservative Christians, including many who supposedly think this way, don't seem to believe this way. Homosexuality is emphasized more than any other sin mentioned in the Bible. Let me give you one example among many of this emphasis.\n \n \nLove does not rejoice in iniquity (I Corinthians 13), like gay sex, adultery, etc.\n \n Love does not do harm to a neighbor (Romans), like entice one's neighbor into illicit immoral relationships.\n\n On the first one (the Corinthians quote) two examples are given. One of which is of course gay sex, despite the fact that any number of things could have been listed here, the other is another sexual sin.\n \n In the second quote, \"Love does not do harm to a neighbor,\" yet again any number of things could have been mentioned- murder, any kind of physical harm, theft, lies, emotional abuse, among others, but what is brought up? \"Enticing one's neighbor into illicit immoral relationships.\"\n (By the way, the subject of this thread that the quote was taken from was not homosexuality or anything related to sex at all, it was about God in general.)\n \n So, I say again--What's with the emphasis on homosexuality and sexual sins?",

I've heard this put forth by Bassman and a couple people I know. Yet the majority of conservative Christians, including many who supposedly think this way, don't seem to believe this way. Homosexuality is emphasized more than any other sin mentioned in the Bible.....So, I say again--What's with the emphasis on homosexuality and sexual sins?\n\n \n A number of reasons. First, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n \n Second, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n \n Fourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n \n Fifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n \n Sixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n \n Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n \n And eighth: They refuse to repent of it, making their own salvation a serious question mark.\n \n And there's more but that's for starters.",

   "churches seem to not want to change in a changing world and keep the status quoe witch seem doomed to faile\n\n \n The evidence is to the contrary:\n \n Survey Finds Conservative Churches Growing, Liberal Ones Declining\n \n Perhaps the only surprise in a recent survey of churches and other religious bodies in America was that anyone was surprised at the results.\n \n Conservative churches in the U.S., including the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches as well as evangelical and charismatic denominations, are growing fastest, while the \"mainline\" Protestant churches, which are increasingly liberal, have seen continuing declines in their membership. The findings were released in September in a report titled \"Religious Congregations & Membership in the United States: 2000,\" which was sponsored by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) and published by the Catholic-affiliated Glenmary Research Center of Nashville. \n \n \"I was astounded to see that by and large the growing churches are those that we ordinarily call conservative,\" Glenmary's director Ken Sanchagrin told the New York Times. \"And when I looked at those that were declining, most were moderate or liberal churches. And the more liberal the denomination, the more they were losing.\"\n \n Some of the reported explanations for why conservative churches are growing almost seemed contradictory. Sanchagrin described conservative churches as \"demanding in some way?[they] expect you to come two or three times a week, or not wear lipstick, or dress in a certain way.\" But Bill Leonard, a professor of church history at North Carolina's Wake Forest University, said that \"their worship services are user-friendly. You don't have to dress up. They put the words on the screen. There's fewer pipe organs and more guitars and drums.\" Rodney Stark, a sociologist on the west coast, believes the service schedules of some shrinking churches demand too much, saying, \"the . . . fools who only have a service at 11:00 a.m. are going to miss the male football-watching crowd.\"\n \n Mark Tooley of the Institute for Religion and Democracy, which promotes evangelical renewal in the mainline denominations, focused on theology instead. \"Liberal theology commits suicide by de-emphasizing the need for personal conversion,\" Tooley said. \"For conservatives the main objective of the church is to evangelize.\"\n \n The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is one of the denominations whose membership is declining, falling 12 percent in the last decade. Parker Williamson, editor of \"The Presbyterian Layman,\" a conservative newspaper, thinks he knows why. \"The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) leadership no longer knows what it believes. Who is Jesus Christ? . . . They were asked to declare in Louisville that 'Jesus Christ is Lord,' and they could not do it.\" Meanwhile, the smaller, more conservative Presbyterian Church in America grew 42 percent in the last ten years.\n \n Among the other churches losing members are the United Church of Christ (the first denomination to ordain open homosexuals), down 14 percent; the United Methodist Church, down 7 percent; the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., down 6 percent; the Episcopal Church, down 5 percent; and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, down 2 percent.\n \n The fastest growing of the major denominations were the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (also known as LDS or Mormons), which has an aggressive missionary program, up by 19.3%; the \"Christian Church and Churches of Christ,\" up 18.6%; the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, up 18.5%; and the Roman Catholic church (aided by 57 percent growth in the Hispanic population), up 16.2 percent.\n \n Among smaller denominations, significant growth in membership was reported by the Salvation Army (up 225%); the Evangelical Free Church (up 57%); Pentecostal Holiness churches (up 53%); the Wesleyan Church (up 47%); the Church of God based in Cleveland, Tennessee (up 40%), and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (up 36%).\n --PSS \n \n http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=CU02J1&v=PRINT\n \n p.s.

   "You're on the wrong side of God's Word, Orion. One day you will know this.\n\n \n Am I? Will I? If so, it won't be for lack of trying, EZ. I've been a student of comparative religion for over 20 years. Guess what - I've never found \"God's Word\". What I've found instead is man's attempt, across various cultures, across time, to define the divine as well as man's relationship to the divine. Many of these attempts have had the effect of putting the divine (\"God\") in a box. Your tribal god is quite anthropomorphic, EZ. He's apparently a male, prone to anger, jealousy, retribution, and comes across as a cosmic bean counter who demands that accounts be settled, as in the Christian doctrine that Jesus \"died for our sins\". Call me crazy, but, somehow, I expect more from a divine being, and I have no intention of putting such a being in a box. \n \n What I've found, in my studies, is the recurring idea that it's what you DO that counts. A simple and elegant concept, is it not? It's a concept which transcends religious exclusivism, an exclusivism which seems to be so much a part of your theology, EZ. Think about it, EZ - it's what you DO that counts, be you Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Wiccan, agnostic, or atheist. You do it without any expectation of future reward for yourself - you do it without any expectation of accumulating brownie points. Instead, you do it because it's the right thing to do - feeding the poor, giving shelter to the homeless, challenging bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression. \n \n With regard to the hereafter, I'll cross that particular bridge when I come to it. No sense worrying about it now. Life is meant to be lived. I'm sorry that you apparently fail to recognize that fact.",

   "I know this post is relatively late in coming, but this thread kind of exploded, and I still haven't gotten the chance to read everything yet. :) \n \n \nA number of reasons. First, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n\n There you go again with the obsession with sex. I didn't hear you say \"murder pride\" parade, or \"theft pride\" parade. Besides, I don't see the Christian right making a fuss about white supremacy groups. I don't see you protesting when they get their name on adopt-a-highway signs, or when they are out publicly spewing their sin.\n \n \nSecond, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost.\n\n I'm totally with you there. Every time I talk to a gay man or a lesbian, it just starts turning me gay too.\n \n \nThird, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n\n First of all, some  gays and lesbians do this, not most. Second, so what? There are tons of different kinds of people who distort the bible for their own purposes, so that doesn't explain the focus on homosexuality.\n \n \nFourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n\n That is about sin in general, so, yet again, that still doesn't explain the focus on homosexuality.\n \n \nFifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n\n All sorts of people call you those things, and it is only in self-defense against the attacks made on them anyway.\n \n \nSixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n\n Yes, \"the gays\" have secret meetings, they even have a secret handshake and passwords that change on a biweekly basis. Haven't you heard? They are converting our children into little gays, they call it the \"homo youth.\" They have all sorts of propaganda for these kids, and fabulous uniforms with pink triangle armbands and cute little hats too. They are raising up an army so they can take over the country and install RuPaul as president.\n \n \nSeventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n\n I don't see you jumping on all the other sins that cost us all sorts of money. How much more money gets spent on health care because of obesity, smoking, drinking, etc. (gluttony). I don't see you protesting the obese, smokers, and drinkers. Do you have any idea how much we spend on incarcerating people? I don't see you protesting criminals.\n \n \nAnd eighth: They refuse to repent of it, making their own salvation a serious question mark.\n\n Again, that could apply to any number of kinds of sinners, so it still doesn't explain the emphasis on homosexuality.",

'How many beans are in this jar?' is a closed question, with one objective answer. If there are as many guesses as there are beans, and they are all different, one must be correct.\n \n This is not a good analogy with the questions asked and answered by religions, which are open, and which refer to concepts and entities whose real-world existence is itself the subject of those religions' speculations.\n \n \nThe truth claim of the atheistic stance is not cancelled out by competing truth claims.

Does the term 'intellectual honesty' mean anything to you?\n\n \n It's not a question of what they believe apart from the Bible. But how intellectually honest is it to pose as a Christian and read: \n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \" 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\"\n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \" If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders 10nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n (etc.),\n \n And then try to tell me Jesus and the Bible say gay sex is okay? Forget it.\n \n Orion, when you decide to come out of the closet and tell us who your so-called \"god\" is (you know, the one who approves of gay sex, fornication, Wiccanism, and the worship of Satan), and where it lives, etc., you will start to gain credibility around here for being knowledgeable and fair minded. It's not enough to constantly bark at other people's religions - if you want to run with the big dogs you have to be able to document your own beliefs. Which you are unable to do.",

   " I'm not sure this exchange is advancing the thread in any way, so this is my last contribution. The last word is yours if you want it.\n \n You responded to my observation that different religions' truth claims cancel each other out with your jar of beans analogy.\n \n I pointed out that the analogy was a poor one. 'How many beans are in this jar?' is a closed question, with one objective answer. If there are as many guesses as there are beans, and they are all different, one must be correct. \n\n As I said, there are a humongous number of beans, and that no guess may in fact be correct. An analogy needn't mimic a situation in every detail in order to illustrate a particular point. In this case, the point was (and is) that contradictory guesses don't \"cancel\" one another out. Indeed, the more guesses there are increases the probability that one is correct. [It is noteworthy that there is a dearth of religions that believe in a malevolent god. Because of this, the probability that one guess is correct may not be approaching unity, as the number of guesses increases.]\n \n There is an objective truth about god (assuming one buys classical logic), just as there is an objective answer to the number of beans. That is (well formed) truth claims are either true or false. That we cannot know whether claims are true or false is immaterial; they are either true or false nonetheless.\n \n The notion that contradictory claims regarding the same issue \"cancel\" each other out is wrong. The (well-formed) claims \"2+2 is 4\" and \"2+2 is not 4\" don't cancel each other out. They aren't both wrong. In fact in the case of a statement and its negation, one statement is correct. As before, you wouldn't want \"the notional christian god does not exist\" to be cancelled out by \"the notional christian god does exist\". \n \n \n This is not a good analogy with the questions asked and answered by religions, which are open, and which refer to concepts and entities whose real-world existence is itself the subject of those religions' speculations. \n\n Well, I don't know what you mean by open. There is an objective truth about the condition of god. Possibly you may be getting confused about truth versus knowledge. Yes, religious claims, and anti-religious claims, are speculations. That does not mean that the claims are neither true nor false. Each (well formed) claim is either true of false. Just as each guess at the number beans is true or false. That we can't know whether a religious claim (or anti-religious claim) is true (or false) is immaterial. The claims are still not canceling each other out.\n \n \n \n Christianity's truth claim that Jesus was the son of god is contradicted by Islam's truth claim that he was just another prophet. Judaism's truth claim that there exists a single patriarchal deity is contradicted by polytheisms with multiple male and female deities. No amount of counter-assertion can bury the fact that the world's religions, extant and extinct, make or have made truth claims that cancel each other out. \n\n Once again, \"2+2 is 4\" doesn't \"cancel\" out \"2+2 is not 4\". I believe you are making some kind of circumstantial fallacy. \n \n \n As I said, feel free to have the last word. \n\n Please continue if you like. Somebody may be interested.",

Feed the poor, clothe those who need it, help hurricane survivors, visit the elderly, volunteer at no pay for community projects; preach the Gospel, defend liberty, stand against oppression, and so on and so forth.\"\n \n Question / contention answered / refuted? You bet. \n \n\n You seem to have ignored my response to your last statement. It didn't end with that. Go back and look.",
