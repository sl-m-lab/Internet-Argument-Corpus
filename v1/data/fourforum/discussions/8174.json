   "Yes and No. \n \n A potential person must always be given full human rights unless its existence interferes with the rights of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness of an already existing conscious human being. Thus, a gestating fetus has no rights before birth and full rights after birth. \n \n If a fetus comes to term and is born, it is because the mother chooses to forgo her own rights and her own bodily security in order to allow that future person to gestate inside her body. If the mother chooses to exercise control over her own body and to protect herself from the potential dangers of childbearing, then she has the full right to terminate the pregnancy. \n \n Anti-abortion activists are fond of saying \"The only difference between a fetus and a baby is a trip down the birth canal.\" This flippant phrase may make for catchy rhetoric, but it doesn't belie the fact that indeed \"location\" makes all the difference in the world. \n \n It's actually quite simple. You cannot have two entities with equal rights occupying one body. One will automatically have veto power over the other - and thus they don't have equal rights. In the case of a pregnant woman, giving a \"right to life\" to the potential person in the womb automatically cancels out the mother's right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. \n \n After birth, on the other hand, the potential person no longer occupies the same body as the mother, and thus, giving it full human rights causes no interference with another's right to control her body. Therefore, even though a full-term human baby may still not be a person, after birth it enjoys the full support of the law in protecting its rights. After birth its independence begs that it be protected as if it were equal to a fully-conscience human being. But before birth its lack of personhood and its threat to the women in which it resides makes abortion a completely logical and moral choice. \n\n \n http://www.elroy.net/ehr/abortionanswers.html",

A hair follicle is practically nothing but dead tissue besides the few cells that make up the base! It is nothing like a zygote, who is a living functioning being. They use this approach in their whole essay as if it made sense.\n \n It made no sense at all, in fact, it made them look awfully stupid when I read it.
