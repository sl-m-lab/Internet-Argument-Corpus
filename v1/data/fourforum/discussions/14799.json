   "Police say teen killed man in self defense - ksl.com\n \n \nROY-- A 17-year-old girl fired two shots from a revolver to defend her aunt from an attack by the woman's boyfriend Thursday, police said Friday.\n \n The shot fatally struck the man in the chest in a domestic violence incident that Roy Police Chief Greg Whinham said he could only describe as a \"tragedy.\"\n \n The 6:30 p.m. Thursday shooting marked a violent end to a daylong series of interactions between John F. Sharp, 37, and Mellony Pursel, 32, who had lived together in Roy but were separating, Whinham said. Pursel was struck in the arm and shoulder area by one of the rounds that left Sharp's body, but she is expected to recover. \n \n Initial evidence indicates the shooting was in self-defense, occurring as Sharp was choking the woman, Whinham said. The investigation is continuing, however, and the shooting will be reviewed by the Weber County Attorney's Office. \n \n \"This is something we do far too often,\" Whinham said Friday, referring to police responses on domestic violence incidents. \"The reality is that we did everything we could. His family did everything they could. ... The choices he made were his own.\"\n \n The volatility of the situation first erupted at 4 a.m. Thursday when Sharp returned to the home at 1920 W. 4400 South, where the couple had separated a few days before. Sharp wanted to reconcile with Pursel, but she asked him to leave. Roy police responded in a keep-the-peace call to help the estranged boyfriend find another place to stay.\n \n Less than six hours later, at 9:24 a.m., Sharp returned to the home and began destroying property, breaking electronics and dumping out drawers.\n \n \"There was no assault. There was significant damage of property,\" the chief said.\n \n The 17-year-old girl is the niece of Pursel and, along with her 7-month-old daughter, has been living at the residence, Whinham said. Her husband is out of state on military assignment.\n \n Once again, police were called to the home and Sharp attempted to flee, but he was captured after a foot chase.\n \n At the time of the arrest Sharp was \"aggressive and violent,\" and became more agitated while at the Weber County Jail. He was booked at 11:05 a.m. for investigation of criminal mischief, interfering with arrest and evading officers.\n \n Sharp was released at 5 p.m. Thursday after posting bond, agreeing to the provisions of a no-contact order and assurances that he had family and a place to go. From there, Whinham said Sharp was with family members in the Roy area but became agitated with them and left.\n \n \"There were dynamics going on between three houses,\" the chief said. \n \n By 6:30 p.m., Sharp forced his way into the house he had shared with Pursel and started choking her.\n \n The teenage girl grabbed a .357 revolver yelled at Sharp to leave her aunt alone. When he rushed toward her she fired two shots, striking Sharp. Her infant was in a baby carrier on a couch in the same room.\n \n The police department began getting calls in a very narrow time frame from Sharp's family about the fact that he had left them and was upset. Winham said those calls came about five minutes before the 911 call was placed from Pursel's home.\n \n \"His behavior was escalating,\" he said.\n \n Police arrived to find a wounded Pursel, the teenage girl and the infant outside the home. The trio were evacuated to a nearby convenience store for their safety while officers went inside.\n \n Sharp was dead at the scene.\n \n Police say Sharp has no prior record of domestic violence. Acquaintances of Sharp who spoke to KSL said this comes as a complete shock.\n \n \"There was no indication at all he had been harmful to women,\" Whinham said, adding that he had been married before and in relationships.\n \n He said Pursel, her niece and Sharp's family had all been forthcoming in the investigation, adding that the man's parents, siblings and officers had tried to calm him down through the course of the day.\n \n \"Anyway you look at it, it is a tragedy,\" Winham said.\n\n \n Stories like this really don't inspire confidence in any of the liberal sanctioned methods of self-defense and personal protection.",
