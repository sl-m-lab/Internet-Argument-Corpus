   "At the moment I haven't decided yet if I am voting for Bush or Kerry, but I'd like to start a debate on the topic of Iraq. Here is my opinion on the matter:\n \n I approve the way Bush handled 9-11, we were a furious country and wanted someone to blame for the attacks. When we found out who it was (or at least supposedly was) we attacked Afghanistan. What I don't approve of is how Bush handled Iraq. First of all, he didn't have the proper evidence. While Tenet said it was a \"Slam dunk case\" Bush still should have waited until he was sure, absolutely sure there were WMDs. All of this, however, is pointless, because Iraq was in no way a threat to our national security. A good president should think of his country's national interest, and how in any way was it in our interest to go into Iraq? Also, Saddam was a horrible person, no one disagrees with that, because it is a fact, but is it any of our business on how he rules his country? If the United States has a problem with it, we should bring it up in the UN, as we did, but if we want to go in there to stop the problem, we should wait for UN backing. Finally there is the matter of money. It is costing us $151 billion for the war that is about $82,000 a MINUTE. Now we all know that war is expensive, but isn't it insane how much money this is costing the country? Not to mention the fact that the US as a country gets nothing out of this ordeal, besides maybe a few contracts. Just thought I'd share my opinion, and I hope this sparks a nice debate.",

However, that made the assumption that democracy will actually work in the Middle East, and that it will spread. Turkey, who struggled for democracy still hasn't gotten alot of the kinks out and they've been a democractic nation for quite some. No one else has followed. From a pragmatic view it made sense, start with the center, which is luckily secular for the most part and move out. Problem is, the assumption that Democracy will work is starting to look rather sketchy, if not false.\n \n About the military, basically no one likes us, and the few people who do, we already have massive bases, such as the Navy HQ in Bharain and Air Force Command in Quatar. Turkey wouldn't even let us FLY over their country even after we bribed them with triple digit billions. \n \n The idea of Iraq as spreading democracy made sense, but was based, on what looks like faulty assumptions. \n \n We did not go there to free the Iraqis. Whoever tells you that is nuts. \n We did not go there to get back for 9/11. There are no links beyond pure speculation. \n We did not go there short to middle term oil gain. Now, long term oil control, and break up of OPEC, that's a viable theory that is worth discussing.",

   "Ottoman was based on suppression and oppression of miniorities groups to serve the need of the larger nation. The Romans were based on a war expansionist society, the Greeks didn't have a empire, just a band of allied city states.\n\n \n Which presents a large question when attempting to relate US foreign policy to history and current events. It's generally accepted that 9/11 was retaliation by Islamic extremists to US support of Israeli expansionist policy, US military presence in Saudi Arabia (the holy city) and US intervention in other ME nations. The US support for current Israeli expansion was and is perpetuated by the powerful US Jewish lobby using Hitler's genocide on Jews as a guilt factor, while US presence in the remainder of the ME problem has always been driven by US demand for a cheap natural resource, oil. \n \n I see the invasion/occupation of Iraq as a bad call, based on emotion (frustration at being unable to capture Bin Laden and offering an opportunity to refocus the US public) and self-serving to the special interests (energy industry) that have an out-of-balance influence on current administration policy. \n \n While similar to Roman, the Spanish and English Empires, instead of true imperialism we've always used existing governments (generally dictatorships) by supplying money and war materials to gain them strength to force alignment with our policies. Vietnam and Iraq being the only notable exceptions to that past policy, both sharply marked failures, our experiences are pointing us in the same direction as those past empires, economic failure. The final blow to free-spending Rome was droughts in occupied lands reducing tax revenue to where the army couldn't be paid, England had the wealth to outspend Spain and was then weakened by that debt, expenses of maintaining their large network of colonized countries and continuing US industrial dominance, with WW11 taking the last of their national wealth. \n \n The US has placed itself in a position of economic vulnerability very similar to those past empires. Our current enemies have exploited that weakness and we've managed to turn world opinion against us with our mistake in Iraq. We've amassed debt to the point of no return, our industrial dominance has disappeared, taking our tax base with it, our currency is on the way to failure against other forms of monetary exchange and we seem intent on following this pattern.

That said, empires don't disappear overnight - they either fade away slowly or, more often, are replaced after a period of bloodshed (in the case of England, by a series of artificially liberated puppet governments).

What do you all think?\n\n \n While patriotism sounds nice, power always goes hand in hand with money based on national wealth, either existing, the industrial capability with markets to grow that wealth or military ability in invade and use the wealth of conquered countries. Following WW11, the US dominated world markets due to the fact that the industrialization geared up to win that war was easily convertible to civilian applications and world markets consisted of an industrially devastated Europe, Asia and Africa. \n \n By the 1970s, Europe and Asia, Japan and China in particular, had regained their financial health and made inroads into the largest consumer market in the world, the US. The US had two later surges of prosperity, the '80s when Regan took advantage of the 1976 deregulation of oil and established the ME as our source of cheap oil, and the dot.com bubble, based on paper equity gains that proved to be non-existent. Looking at the 30-year decline of the US dollar, currently being accelerated by a massive imbalance of trade, US industrial dominance started fading after oil deregulation and, aside from those aforementioned two instances, IMO will not recover without an economic disaster to lower a standard of living currently being sustained by deficit public and consumer spending. Based on Iraq, we certainly don't have the military occupation capability to pillage the resources of other countries without a general draft and certainly don't have the competitive industrial capability to generate enough wealth to pay for that by picking off third tier nations such as Iraq one at a time. \n \n Who next in line? Without a nuclear war, I'd have to say China. That's where world capital is going, and their intense internal planning, gained by sending their intellect to the best schools around the world for the past three decades, is making good use of that capital and formulating trade agreements (without military actions) to supply their lack of natural resources. Combined with their overall low standard of living, it's almost impossible for other nations to compete with their industrial output and exports are what create immense national wealth. \n \n If Europe unites fast enough with those nations still affording opportunities for cheap labor and rapid modernization, enough niche markets can be developed to somewhat share a portion of China's vast potential consumer markets with domestic Chinese production. \n \n According to most futurists, the US will eventually unite with Canada and the rest of the Americas, but I feel those will be survival efforts, not an effort for industrial dominance. We're already using the natural resources of those countries at a rate to where not much will be left for export purposes. \n \n I still believe 9/11 and then Iraq were the first visible nails in our financial coffin. Spending half of one's operating budget on military and internal security, regardless of how they relate to a public debt/consumer driven GDP, is not sustainable with a declining tax base.",
