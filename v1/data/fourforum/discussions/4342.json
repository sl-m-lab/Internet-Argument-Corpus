   "Students conduct mock 'gay marriages'\n Parents angered by lunchtime ceremonies on campus\n Posted: February 19, 2005\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \n \u00a9 2005 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n Students at a California high school conducted mock same-sex \"wedding\" ceremonies at lunchtime on campus, prompting protests from angry parents.\n \n The school's Gay-Straight Alliance promoted the event at Silverado High School in the high-desert town of Victorville Feb. 11 to mark National Freedom to Marry Day.\n \n Six female couples and three male couples took part in the ceremonies at the school's outdoor central gathering area.\n \n About 40 parents, community members and students showed up in chilly, rainy weather to protest the event, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n \n One protester, Therese Shore, said her son Andrew Stading, a Silverado senior, was reprimanded by school officials the day of the event for wearing a custom-made protest T-shirt bearing slogans such as \"Gay is not the way\" and an obscene slur about homosexuals, according to the Times.\n \n \"I don't want them shoving homosexuality down my child's throat,\" Shore said.\n \n One student's father, objecting to a taxpayer-supported school holding such an event, held up a sign reading \"I don't.\"\n \n \"I think the school and the district made a terrible, terrible judgment,\" he told the Times.\n \n The district issued a statement, calling the ceremonies \"a lawful exercise of the right of free speech guaranteed to public school students under state and federal law.\"\n \n Some protesters objected to school rules barring religious demonstrations on campus.\n \n \"I'm Christian. I'm not allowed to bring my Bible, preaching to people,\" said sophomore Christina Wilson, 15.\n \n Wilson and others carried signs with such slogans as \"God objects.\" \n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I just want to know.... \n \n Why? \n \n If they spent more time learning and preparing their minds for the real world instead of spending time in mock gay marriages of which they probably don't take seriously to begin with --- it just doesn't belong in a school of learning regardless of whether you support the sexual lifestyle or not, a school is not a center for people to promote their sexual lifestyles!!! Period!!!! what next --- Tranny Day? \n emoticon_wow",

   "Definitely agreed. At my high school, I have a feeling that the kids wouldn't be doing that much protesting either. Sure, I agree that some of them are just reflections of their parents, and that will always hold true, which can be annoying, but we all just have to get over it. So they conducted a mock wedding...who cares? They spoke up about their sexuality. Good for them.\n \n Personally, I think it was a pretty good idea, even if they did do it in a way that would surely attract a lot of critism and problems. At my school we do things a little differently, but hey, I live in a completely different state and area, so there we go. We had a day at our school where all GLBT teens wore neon orange hoodies or shirts, but didn't say what they were for.\n \n The school figured it out...eventually. Most of the students actually thought it was great and were asking how it was that we got up enough courage to tell a bigoted area who we were and what we were.

There is wide consensus for freedom of speech, and it is in the Constitution. Even if there were many people who were against freedom of speech, the government passing a law restricting this, could be found unconstitutional in court. The law banning gay marriage has been found unconstitutional in state courts. There is hardly the same kind of consensus against homosexuality and gay marriage that there is in support of freedom of speech. General support for freedom of speech has not changed. It spans accross centuries, generations and ideologies, religions, or non-religion. There are logical arguments in support of freedom of speech, unlike the fallacies which are used to argue against gay rights. Gay rights have advanced, unlike for example the ideology that we can't have free speech, as a result. \n \n \nThat's because the overall and overwhelming consensus is that the passage you are talking about isn't about the context of slavery, but about something completely different.\n\n \n There are others, supporting slavery. There are others supporting many areas of morality we no longer believe in. The overwhelming consensus of Christianity was not always against slavery, but once in support of slavery. Ineresting that we can use context when looking at things society will not tolerate. However, oppression of gay people is the one thing still acceptable in some circles, so it is okay for many Christians to use the Bible and their religious beliefs and doctrines to support this one particular act.

Do you not realize that all of the mojor social and civil right changes that have taken place in history resulting in Consitutional amendments happened because enough people at the time decided it was the right thing to do? Courts don't make amendments. At one time many, many people in America didn't find slavery immoral. That started changing as time went on. Do you not realize that for the abolitionists, it was a MORAL issue? Or for those who stood up for women's voting rights? \n \n Sorry, but you are wrong on this--morality does indeed have a great effect upon our constitution, regarding the amendments and other laws as well. I think it is safe to say that the founders of the constitution crafted it because they it's principles were RIGHT. Legislation does not take place in an ideological vacuum.\n \n \nEven if there were many people who were against freedom of speech, the government passing a law restricting this, could be found unconstitutional in court.\n\n \n Only because the 1st Amendment is there--the amendment would not have been added in the first place if enough people didn't feel that giving freedom of speech was not the right thing to do: this is morality, my friend.\n \n \nThe law banning gay marriage has been found unconstitutional in state courts.\n\n \n That's because of activist judges who have taken the 14th amendment out of context.\n \n \nThe overwhelming consensus of Christianity was not always against slavery, but once in support of slavery.\n\n \n This just isn't true. You're assuming that just because some southerners at one time tried to misuse the Bible to justify what they did, that the Bible must indeed claim that. You've fell into their trap yourself.",

   "Because that's what most people believe is RIGHT. Don't you? If so, then it's part of your morality, as it is mine.\n\n \n No, not simply because it is what most people believe, there are also logical arguments. That is why almost every single person believes in freedom of speech. That will not change very much at all, unless there is a logical argument against general freedom of speech.\n \n \nDo you not realize that all of the mojor social and civil right changes that have taken place in history resulting in Consitutional amendments happened because enough people at the time decided it was the right thing to do?

Do you not realize that for the abolitionists, it was a MORAL issue? Or for those who stood up for women's voting rights?\n\n \n Of course it was a moral issue. And through logical arguments, the minority was able to convince the majority. I don't believe there are a majority who would amend the Constitution of the U.S. to ban gay rights. \n \n \nThat's because of activist judges who have taken the 14th amendment out of context.\n\n \n Is any decision you don't agree with simply, \"activist\"?\n \n \nThis just isn't true. You're assuming that just because some southerners at one time tried to misuse the Bible to justify what they did, that the Bible must indeed claim that. You've fell into their trap yourself.\n\n \n I am correct. For most of it's history, Christianity did generally support slavery...\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_slav1.htm",

   "That's only for your religious community to deal with. The government cannot take one religious view or rule. That one view cannot be forced onto everyone by society. For example, the sale and consumption of pork isn't banned, in order to comply with Hebraic law. \n\n \n No, but the sale of alcohol is banned on Sundays in some states. There are a whole plethora of so-called \"blue laws\" that impose one group's morality on everyone and they are perfectly legal. I doubt that many of the states that have Blue Laws are eager to change them, either. So your assertion that government can't force a religious view on the population is false and disproven every Sunday in many states. \n \n\n Also, it seems to me that selective prejudice is at work with \"cafeteria Christians\" who pick and choose from the Bible. They say marriage must be between a man and a woman, or that homosexuality is immoral, because that is in the Bible. However, they don't say a slave must always obey his master, even though that is in the Bible. Almost all will say slavery is immoral, even though it is clear from a literal reading of the Bible that slavery is very moral. If the Bible says it, isn't that the end of debate? You can't say that's only the end of debate for homosexuality, but for nothing else.\n\n \n It also says that a woman must obey her husband at all times......Damn, why couldn't I have married a strict Christian woman. :)",

   " This just isn't true. You're assuming that just because some southerners at one time tried to misuse the Bible to justify what they did, that the Bible must indeed claim that. You've fell into their trap yourself.\n\n \n Actually, the bible and christian religion does give information of how to specifically treat your slaves and servants. It gives detailed instructions on what to do with slaves.\n \n Jesus even mentions them.\n \n There is no repudiation of slavery or slaves, but there are instructions on how to go about it. Logically, this means that Jesus wasn't fighting against it, but actually working for it.\n \n Therefore, the Bible, which is the word of GOd, and Jesus is GOd, supports slavery.\n \n \n As for Activist Judges, that's merely a rhetorical cop-out that people use when a court makes a decision they don't like.\n \n \n \n No, but the sale of alcohol is banned on Sundays in some states.

Not everything it does is what it's supposed to do or ought to do as a government. Blue laws are antiquated and need to be chucked.",
