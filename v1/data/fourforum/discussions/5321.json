   "The 84,000-ton, 1,048-foot warship, which served the Navy for 32 years, thus became the first U.S. carrier to be sunk since 1951, and the largest warship ever sunk. Photo at bottom.\n =====================================\n \n Carrier America sunk off coast\n Before the ship was laid to rest, it served as a target of explosions that will help build a better carrier.\n BY PETER DUJARDIN\n 247-4749\n \n May 20 2005\n \n The Navy sent the retired USS America aircraft carrier to its final resting place at the bottom of the sea Saturday, in a closely guarded series of explosions that the Navy didn't announce until days later.\n \n The 84,000-ton, 1,048-foot warship, which served the Navy for 32 years, thus became the first U.S. carrier to be sunk since 1951, and the largest warship ever sunk.\n \n \"Explosions were internal to the ship and allowed a controlled flooding,\" said Pat Dolan, a spokeswoman with the Naval Sea Systems Command. She declined to say where the ship now sits, except that it was 50 nautical miles - or about 58 miles - off the coast, and more than 6,000 feet below the surface.\n \n The Navy previously said the final explosions would be off North Carolina.\n \n Before it sank, it also served as a target for a series of explosions over 25 days designed to help in the making of the of the Navy's next generation carrier, the CVN-21, now being designed at the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard.\n \n But the America, built by Newport News Shipbuilding and named by President John F. Kennedy, has its base of fans, many of whom are stunned by the Navy's decision.\n \n \"Very depressing,\" said Lee McNulty, a New Jersey resident and president of the USS America Foundation, which wanted to turn the ship into a museum. \"Not a day goes by that I don't think about it. I just can't believe that she sunk. She's gone. Of all the carriers, that one should have been saved, just for the name of the America.\"\n \n McNulty, a former boatswain's mate third class on the ship during the Vietnam War, contends that the main reason the America was sunk did not have to do with testing for the future carrier. The main idea, he contends, was simply to shed the carrier and get rid of it at a cheaper price than the Navy would otherwise have to pay.\n \n Sinking of the America - which was allowed under law only because it was part of an approved fleet exercise - cost $22 million, the Navy said. Scrapping it at a shipyard could have cost triple.\n \n Dolan said that Steve Schrobo, the Navy's mission director for the explosion effort, could not grant an interview about the event because he hadn't yet briefed the Navy's leadership - including the admiral in charge of the Naval Sea Systems Command carrier program office.\n \n \"A solemn moment of silence was held as the aircraft carrier ex-America slipped quietly beneath the waves,\" Dolan told the USS America Carrier Veterans Association on Monday. \"We thank and honor all the veterans of the USS America who lived and fought for freedom and democracy aboard this majestic vessel.\"..\n \n http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-19807sy0may20,0,3706668,print.story?coll=dp-headlines-topnews\n \n http://navysite.de/cvn/cv66_9.jpg",
