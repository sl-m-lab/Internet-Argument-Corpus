I do like the really old stuff though, like fisrt season, Dan Akroyd, John Belushi Gilda Radner(!) Jane Curtain etc etc. They were all amazing and that stuff is timeless! The Judy Miller Show, anytime Dan Akroyd was supposed to be selling something, The Killer Bees Ok enough ranting about that I guess. This season is getting steadily better especially in comparrison to last season. Dane Cook hosted this past Saturday, now I may be biased because it was Dane Cook, but that was a hilarious episode and I LOVED the monologue, if anyone saw it.\n Ok sorry, next show....uh, Grey's Anatomy is good, though I wouldn't watch it if George (TR Kinght) wasn't on it. He's just too adorkable. Plus he has great comedic timing.\n \n Ok, whoo, that was a long post, sorry. Just thought I'd add that and keep this thread going.",
