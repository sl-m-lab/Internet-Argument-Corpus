   "\" Sep 23 URGENT REQUEST FROM REPUBLIC OF AMERICA FOR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP (CONFIDENTIAL!)\n \n \n \n Dear American, My Dear Friend: \n \n I am Ministry of the Treasury of the Republic of America. \n \n I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business relationship with a transfer of funds of great magnitude. \n \n My country has had crisis that has caused the need for large transfer of funds of 800 billion dollars US. If you would assist me in this transfer, it would be most profitable to you. \n \n I am working with \"Mr. Phil Gram,\" lobbyist for UBS, who will be my replacement as Ministry of the Treasury in January. As a citizen, you may know him as the leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the 1990s. This transactin is 100% safe. \n \n This is a matter of great urgency. We need a blank check. \n \n We need the funds as quickly as possible. We cannot directly transfer these funds in the names of our close friends because we are constantly under surveillance. My family lawyer advised me that I should look for a reliable and trustworthy person who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be transferred. \n \n Please reply with all of your bank account, IRA and college fund account numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov so that we may transfer your commission for this transaction. \n \n After I receive that information, I will respond with detailed information about safeguards that will be used to protect the funds. \n \n Do not discuss this message with anyone! Time is of the essence! \n \n Yours Faithfully. \n \n Minister of Treasury Hank Paulson. \"",
