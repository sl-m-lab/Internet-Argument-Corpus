   "\" Gerin Oil (or Geriniol to give it its scientific name) is a powerful drug which acts directly on the central nervous system to produce a range of symptoms, often of an anti-social or self-damaging nature. It can permanently modify the child brain to produce adult disorders, including dangerous delusions which are hard to treat. The four doomed flights of September 11th 2001 were Gerin Oil trips: all nineteen of the hijackers were high on the drug at the time. Historically, Geriniolism was responsible for atrocities such as the Salem Witch Hunts and the massacres of Native South Americans by Conquistadores. Gerin Oil fuelled most of the wars of the European Middle Ages and, in more recent times, the carnage that attended the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent and of Ireland. \n \n Gerin Oil intoxication can drive previously sane individuals to run away from a normally fulfilled human life and retreat to closed communities of confirmed addicts. These communities are usually limited to one sex only, and they vigorously, often obsessively, forbid sexual activity. Indeed, a tendency towards agonized sexual prohibition emerges as a drably recurring theme amid all the colourful variations of Gerin Oil symptomatology. Gerin Oil does not seem to reduce the libido per se, but it frequently leads to a preoccupation with reducing the sexual pleasure of others. A current example is the prurience with which many habitual 'Oilers' condemn homosexuality.\n \n As with other drugs, refined Gerin Oil in low doses is largely harmless, and can serve as a lubricant on social occasions such as marriages, funerals, and state ceremonies. Experts differ over whether such social tripping, though harmless in itself, is a risk factor for upgrading to harder and more addictive forms of the drug.\n \n Medium doses of Gerin Oil, though not in themselves dangerous, can distort perceptions of reality. Beliefs that have no basis in fact are immunized, by the drug's direct effects on the nervous system, against evidence from the real world. Oil-heads can be heard talking to thin air or muttering to themselves, apparently in the belief that private wishes so expressed will come true, even at the cost of other people's welfare and mild violation of the laws of physics. This autolocutory disorder is often accompanied by weird tics and hand gestures, manic stereotypies such as rhythmic head-nodding toward a wall, or Obsessive Compulsive Orientation Syndrome' (OCOS: facing towards the east five times a day).\n \n Gerin Oil in strong doses is hallucinogenic. Hardcore mainliners may hear voices in the head, or experience visual illusions which seem to the sufferers so real that they often succeed in persuading others of their reality. An individual who convincingly reports high-grade hallucinations may be venerated, and even followed as some kind of leader, by others who regard themselves as less fortunate. Such follower-pathology can long post-date the original leader's death, and may expand into bizarre psychedelia such as the cannibalistic fantasy of 'drinking the blood and eating the flesh' of the leader.\n \n Chronic abuse of Geriniol can lead to 'bad trips', in which the user suffers terrifying delusions, including fears of being tortured, not in the real world but in a postmortem fantasy world. Bad trips of this kind are bound up with a morbid punishment-lore which is as characteristic of this drug as the obsessive fear of sexuality already noted. The punishment-culture fostered by Gerin Oil ranges from 'smack' through 'lash' to getting 'stoned' (especially adulteresses and rape victims), and 'demanifestation' (amputation of one hand), up to the sinister fantasy of allo-punishment or 'cross-topping', the execution of one individual for the sins of others. \n \n You might think that such a potentially dangerous and addictive drug would head the list of proscribed intoxicants, with exemplary sentences handed out for pushing it.

   "No it isn't. To someone who is Jewish that is exactly what they did. Why is it so difficult for you to understand (you don't have to agree) that for Jews Jesus was not the Messiah. \n \n There is a distinction between the religions. They are not the same.\n\n \n You speak in ignorance as if you are an authority about that which you have obviously never studied. The NT is a perfect reflection and extension of the OT, and to deny that is to prove you have no understanding of how intimately they are connected. Here's what I mean:\n Question: \"Old Testament vs. New Testament - What are the differences?\"\n \n Answer: The Old Testament lays the foundation for the teachings and events found in the New Testament. The Bible is a progressive revelation. If you skip the first half of any good book and try to finish it, you will have a hard time understanding the characters, the plot, and the ending. In the same way, the New Testament is only completely understood when it is seen as a fulfillment of the events, characters, laws, sacrificial system, covenants, and promises of the Old Testament.\n \n If we only had the New Testament, we would come to the gospels and not know why the Jews were looking for a Messiah (a Savior King). Without the Old Testament, we would not understand why this Messiah was coming (see Isaiah 53), and we would not have been able to identify Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah through the many detailed prophecies that were given concerning Him, e.g., His birthplace (Micah 5:2); His manner of death (Psalm 22, especially vv. 1, 7-8, 14-18; Psalm 69:21), His resurrection (Psalm 16:10), and many more details of His ministry (Isaiah 52:19, 9:2).\n \n Without the Old Testament, we would not understand the Jewish customs that are mentioned in passing in the New Testament. We would not understand the perversions that the Pharisees had made to God's law as they added their traditions to it. We would not understand why Jesus was so upset as He cleansed the temple courtyard. We would not understand that we can make use of the same wisdom that Christ used in His many replies to His adversaries. \n \n The New Testament Gospels and the Acts of the apostles record many of the fulfillments of prophecies that were recorded hundreds of years earlier in the Old Testament. In the circumstances of Jesus' birth, life, miracles, death, and resurrection as found in the Gospels, we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies that relate to the Messiah's first coming. It is these details that validate Jesus' claim to be the promised Christ. And even the prophecies in the New Testament (many of which are in the book of Revelation) are built upon earlier prophecies found in Old Testament books. These New Testament prophecies relate to events surrounding the second coming of Christ. Roughly two out of three verses in Revelation are based on or related to Old Testament verses.\n \n Also, because the revelation in Scripture is progressive, the New Testament brings into focus teachings that were only alluded to in the Old Testament. The book of Hebrews describes how Jesus is the true High Priest and how His one sacrifice replaces all of the previous sacrifices, which were mere portrayals. The Old Testament gives the Law, which has two parts: the commandments and the blessing/curse that comes from obedience or disobedience to those commands. The New Testament clarifies that God gave those commandments to show men their need of salvation; they were never intended to be a means of salvation (Romans 3:19).\n \n The Old Testament describes the sacrificial system God gave the Israelites to temporarily cover their sins. The New Testament clarifies that this system alluded to the sacrifice of Christ through whom alone salvation is found (Acts 4:12; Hebrews 10:4-10). The Old Testament saw paradise lost; the New Testament shows how paradise was regained for mankind through the second Adam (Christ) and how it will one day be restored. The Old Testament declares that man was separated from God through sin (Genesis chapter 3), and the New Testament declares that man can now be restored in his relationship to God (Romans chapters 3-6). The Old Testament predicted the Messiah's life. The Gospels primarily record Jesus' life, and the Epistles interpret His life and how we are to respond to all He has done.\n \n Without the Old Testament we would not understand the promises God will yet fulfill to the Jewish nation. As a result, we would not properly see that the tribulation period is a seven-year period in which He will specifically be working with the Jewish nation who rejected His first coming but who will receive Him at His second coming. We would not understand how Christ's future 1000-year reign fits in with His promises to the Jews, or how Gentiles will fit in. Nor would we see how the end of the Bible ties up the loose ends that were unraveled in the beginning of the Bible, restoring the paradise that God originally created this world to be.\n \n In summary, the Old Testament lays the foundation for, and was meant to prepare the Israelites for, the coming of the Messiah who would sacrifice Himself for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). The New Testament shares the life of Jesus Christ and then looks back on what He did and how we are to respond to His gift of eternal life and live our lives in gratitude for all He has done for us (Romans 12). Both testaments reveal the same holy, merciful, and righteous God who must condemn sin but who desires to bring to Himself a fallen human race of sinners through the forgiveness only possible through Christ's atoning sacrifice. In both testaments, God reveals Himself to us and how we are to come to Him through Jesus Christ. In both testaments, we find all we need for eternal life and godly living (2 Timothy 3:15-17).\n Old Testament vs. New Testament - What are the differences?\n \n \nAnd no according to the Gospels he didn't come from the seed of David.\n\n \n Really?

   "And what those terrorists need is a good dose of feminism and a bunch of really strong and politically powerful women to set them straight.\n\n \n I thought that even you would know that Jihadists don't think the same way we do - I was wrong. You can't look at foreign politics with Western Lenses, that's the same mistake that makes people think Jihadists can be peacefully negotiated with. The Islamic Extremists are way too narrow-minded to listen to any woman to begin with; much less accept one as a leader.\n \n Before you go on one of your delusional rants, I have to make it clear that I support women's rights; but the Arabs do not. Standing up for women's rights in Arab Countries is not only radical, it's taboo.\n \n This might make it clearer, if you actually take the time to read it for a change.\n \n Islamic Misogyny\n \n \n\n In Woman in the Muslim Unconscious, Moroccan scholar Fatna Sabbah documents how the crucial criteria of female \"beauty\" in Islamic society are silence, immobility, and obedience. Women are supposed to dehumanize themselves in order to be tolerated.\n \n In Islam, males are taught to control desire (shahwa). Women are the incarnation of shahwa. Shahwa comes from the devil. It becomes clear, therefore, why the association of shahwa, the devil and woman is rife throughout Islamic religious literature.\n \n Imam Ibn al-Jawzi taught that female beauty was a manifestation of the devil himself. In his text Dhamm al-hawa, he wrote that the \"beauty of women is one of the poisoned arrows of the devil.\" It is no wonder, therefore, why Islam teaches that hell is largely populated by women. According to a hadith (the record of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad) in Imam Bukhari's Al-Sahih, the Prophet Muhammad states that, as he stood at the gate of hell, he observed that, \"Most of those who entered there were women.\"\n \n In Islam, sex is allowed only in marriage, but even then it is not viewed as an act between two complementary and equal human beings. It is an act concerning only the orgasmic need of the male. Since this need is prioritised, Islam allows the male to marry four wives at a time. The male can also go through serial marriages, since he is allowed to dissolve a marriage unilaterally at any time by simply saying to his wife: \"you are repudiated.\"\n \n Thus, a man does not have to invest in one woman. The concept of \"the couple\" is shattered; the individual woman is seen as useless and expendable. The confusion in which Middle Eastern boys grow up, therefore, is a given. With all kinds of siblings born of different women -- who obviously weren't good enough to be cherished alone -- the boys get their first taste of misogyny and, therefore, self-hate (since they internalise the notion that their own mothers were valueless).\n \n Since it emphasizes the importance of Muslims conquering all non-Muslims, Islam bestows some intriguing sexual incentives. While it is a sin for a male to have sex with an unmarried woman, Allah makes an exemption for the Muslim male who rapes the women of the infidels that he kills. Muhammad did just that.\n \n This explains why any time Islamic warriors defeat another nation, they call the inhabitants kafir (the one who, according to the Qur'an, is ungrateful to the blessings showered by Allah) and rape their women. Pakistani Muslim soldiers raped a quarter of a million Bangali women in 1971 after they massacred 3 million unarmed civilians. This atrocity is not considered a sin in Islam, because the religious leader of the soldiers decreed that Bangladeshis were infidels.\n \n The Islamic temptation to wage violent war against non-Muslims also involves the sexual incentive of the houries (the 72 eternal virgins in paradise that are given to the Muslim warrior who dies in battle). The houri makes earthly women even more redundant. Yet even the individual houri herself is not sacred or special in any way. As Fatna Sabbah notes, she \"has no spiritual dimension; she is a thing because she has neither will nor any possibility of development. . . . [she] has no intellect; she does not think. She is a thing that awaits consumption.\"\n \n The houri is a manifestation of the ultimate misogyny.\n \n In thinking about Atta's will in this context, his worries become understandable. So does his rage. A male cannot despise women and simultaneously love himself. Misogyny is the ultimate death wish.\n \n Men like Atta and Osama bin Laden detest - and wish to destroy - the world that they see outside their cages. It is a world that delights in the beauty that they have demonized -- outside and inside of themselves.\n \n\n \n It would be good if the Arabs realized that women are people, but that's just not going to happen.",

   "You speak in ignorance as if you are an authority about that which you have obviously never studied. The NT is a perfect reflection and extension of the OT, and to deny that is to prove you have no understanding of how intimately they are connected. Here's what I mean:\n\n \n The problem is very simple. You are incapable and unwilling to face the concept that the significant events of the Bible cannot be irrefutably proven true. There is no reasonably conclusive evidence as to Jesus being God, the son of God, being sacrificed for the remission of mankind's sins and his resurrection. Yes there is evidence but not reasonably conclusive. You cannot understand this. You accept your interpretation as rock solid fact, it's not. As long as you hold on to this perception you will continue to resist anything that may threaten to undermine your carefully constructed world. \n \n For someone who is often misquoted you would think you would be mindful of doing it yourself. I said to someone who is Jewish Jesus is not the Messiah. I even qualified it by saying you need not agree on whether he is or isn't, but even that is something you are unable to deal with. Instead you post some lengthy cut and paste job from a Christian based perspective. Gee what a surprise it agrees with your view. I can find an opposing opinion for everyone that you find. That leaves us back at square one. \n \n What is odd is what I said is fact. Jews don't believe Jesus was the Messiah. That is a fact. To argue that simple truth is asinine. By definition a Christian is one who accepts Jesus as their personal savior. That is the minimum to be Christian, no Christian will accept anybody who doesn't, but you will sit there and tell me I don't know anything because Jews should accept Jesus. The point isn't whether Christians can build upon the OT to make the NT. It's been done, I am pretty sure you know this. The point is that there are people who have a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness of all the claims made by the Bible.\n \n Argue until your blue in the face because until something changes in the form of credible evidence it is now, was then and will continue to be your opinion.\n \n \n[INDENT][SIZE=&quot;2&quot;][COLOR=&quot;Navy&quot;]Question: \"Old Testament vs. New Testament - What are the differences?\"\n \n Answer: The Old Testament lays the foundation for the teachings and events found in the New Testament. The Bible is a progressive revelation. If you skip the first half of any good book and try to finish it, you will have a hard time understanding the characters, the plot, and the ending. In the same way, the New Testament is only completely understood when it is seen as a fulfillment of the events, characters, laws, sacrificial system, covenants, and promises of the Old Testament.\n\n \n Not at all Jews have no need for the NT. As a matter of fact they still to this day don't use it.\n \n \nIf we only had the New Testament, we would come to the gospels and not know why the Jews were looking for a Messiah (a Savior King). Without the Old Testament, we would not understand why this Messiah was coming (see Isaiah 53), and we would not have been able to identify Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah through the many detailed prophecies that were given concerning Him, e.g., His birthplace (Micah 5:2); His manner of death (Psalm 22, especially vv. 1, 7-8, 14-18; Psalm 69:21), His resurrection (Psalm 16:10), and many more details of His ministry (Isaiah 52:19, 9:2).\n\n \n You would think the author would not use some of the more disputable translations. To the Jews these verses don't mean what Christians need them to say.\n \n \n \nThe New Testament Gospels and the Acts of the apostles record many of the fulfillments of prophecies that were recorded hundreds of years earlier in the Old Testament. In the circumstances of Jesus' birth, life, miracles, death, and resurrection as found in the Gospels, we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies that relate to the Messiah's first coming.\n \n \n When will we find the prophecy of his second coming? He failed to fullfill more prophecies than he accomplished, even with mistranslations. The second coming is Paul's invention.\n \n \nIt is these details that validate Jesus' claim to be the promised Christ. And even the prophecies in the New Testament (many of which are in the book of Revelation) are built upon earlier prophecies found in Old Testament books. These New Testament prophecies relate to events surrounding the second coming of Christ. Roughly two out of three verses in Revelation are based on or related to Old Testament verses.\n\n \n The details invalidate Jesus. If you are going to use the OT as the guide book then you have to accept that prophecy was no longer possible.\n \n \nAlso, because the revelation in Scripture is progressive, the New Testament brings into focus teachings that were only alluded to in the Old Testament. The book of Hebrews describes how Jesus is the true High Priest and how His one sacrifice replaces all of the previous sacrifices, which were mere portrayals.

The New Testament clarifies that God gave those commandments to show men their need of salvation; they were never intended to be a means of salvation (Romans 3:19).\n\n \n Again this is all subject to interpretation. It is not unreasonable and in some instances more than reasonable to disbelieve the Christian perspective. There is nothing alluded to about the Law. It was intended as a means of atonement for sin. When God says something is forever Jews seem to have a better understanding of the word than Christians.\n \n I am not going to tear up each paragraph of someone else's opinion that you pasted. If you believe in Jesus then by all means do so I am not trying to say your wrong, but try to understand in the end you may be proven right, but you may not and until then you will have to accept that it is an opinion and nothing more.\n \n \n \nReally? And I'm supposed to just take your word for this? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n It would be easier if you would emoticon_smile\n \n How about you tell me what it would take and we can just cut to the chase.",

Under the law, women are accorded a role inferior to that of men, and are therefore discriminated against with regard to personal rights and freedoms.\n \n As Middle East expert Daniel Pipes explains: \"In the Islamic view...female sexuality is thought of as being so powerful that it constitutes a real danger to society.\" Therefore, unrestrained females constitute \"the most dangerous challenge facing males trying to carry out God's commands.\" In combination, females' \"desires and their irresistible attractiveness give women a power over men which rivals God's.\"2\n \n \"Left to themselves,\" Pipes continues, \"men might well fall victim to women and abandon God,\" resulting in civil disorder among believers. In traditional thought, Pipes notes, women pose an internal threat to Islamic society similar to the external one represented by the infidel.\n \n So the Arabs not only deny women rights, but they strive to prevent women's rights as they believe it would be a bad thing. Simone, I hope you stop and consider how lucky you are to be born in a Country where you're thought of as a human being.\n \n Traditionally, the Arab woman marries at a young age to a man of her father's choice. A husband is entitled to divorce any time, even against his wife's will, by merely declaring verbally that this is his intention.\n \n Women in marriage countries don't even get to decide who they marry, and they can be forced to marry someone they don't love or maybe even completely hate.\n ..............................\n \n Wife-beating is a relatively common practice in Arab countries, and abused women have little recourse. As the State Department has noted regarding Jordan (and most of the Arab world): \"Wife beating is technically grounds for divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority from the Koran to correct an irreligious or disobedient wife by striking her.\"\n \n So a woman may be forced to live with a wife-beater, and can be beaten for disobedience. I thought this was common knowledge, and I'm surprised that I even have to say this: married women in Arab countries are basically slaves to their husband.\n \n ..............................\n \n According to the UN, \"utilization of Arab women's capabilities through political and economic participation remains the lowest in the world in quantitative terms....In some countries with elected national assemblies, women are still denied the right to vote or hold office. And one in ever two Arab women can neither read nor write.\"\n \n This reminds me of slaves on southern plantations in the 1800s. Plantation owners preferred less educated slaves, as they would be less likely to realize what a sucky life they had and rebel. The only thing they wanted their slaves to know was how to pick cotton. Likewise, the only thing the Arabs want their women to know is how to serve their husbands. \n \n Moroccan law excuses the murder or injury of a wife who is caught in the act of committing adultery; yet women are punished for harming their husbands under the same circumstances. \n \n In Saudi Arabia, restrictions against women are among the most extreme in the Arab world. Saudi women may not marry non-Saudis without government permission (which is rarely given); are forbidden to drive motor vehicles or bicycles; may not use public facilities when men are present; and are forced to sit in the backs of public buses, segregated from men. At Riyadh's King Saud University, professors lecture to rooms of men while women watch via closed-circuit television from distant all-female classrooms.5 \"[Islamic] Advice columns\" in the Saudi Arabian press recommend strict disciplining of women as part of a proper marriage. Women must cover their entire body and face in public, and those who do not are subject to physical harassment from the Saudi religious police, known as the Mutaaw'in. The Saudis even extend their discriminatory treatment to women abroad. During a visit to the United States by Crown Prince Abdullah, for example, the prince's aides requested that no female air traffic controllers be allowed to control his flight into Texas to meet President Bush. They also requested that no women be allowed on the airport tarmac with the jet.6\n \n Stay on topic, Simone. Just because Bush was mentioned one time doesn't mean that you should go ranting on him now.\n \n\n \n Simone, you've demonstrated little understanding of Arab politics because you look at them with Western lenses.",

There's no real evidence that proves that the Church still supports crusades. You know this, which is why you say \"'maybe' the Church supports crusades\" rather than just \"the Church supports crusades.\" You add the \"maybe\" because you know it doesn't, but you just think nobody can refute it.

   "I'm questioning your logic, whether the scenario is real or hypothetical is irrelevant.\n\n \n No your not and yes it is.\n \n \nJust because something is legal doesn't mean its supported. In Germany, public nudity is illegal, that doesn't mean the Germans support it. \n\n \n That is why it would be illegal.\n \n \n In every developed country, adultery is completely legal, does that mean we all support adultery? \n \n \n No it isn't. Some countries the act carries criminal and civil consequences. In the US it is grounds for divorce. \n \n \nI guess by your logic, we also support racism, sexism, and anti-semitism. After all, we have freedom of speech here in America.\n\n \n I see you still don't understand the distinction between a member and the organization as well as the relationship between them. By my logic The US as an organization does not support racism, sexism and antisemitism. Such acts are reflected in the laws of the country. It supports the right to free speech which is also reflected in our laws. \n Nobody is allowed hate speech which again is reflected in our laws.\n \n An organization can make a statement on a position that some members may not agree with. The members may choose to leave the organization if the divide is significant enough. An example would be Christianity and Lutherans. \n \n \nAlso, it's not even in the Church's power to declare war anymore, and no government would go to war over religion, nor would the church. \n \n \n Anymore? \n \n The Taliban, PLO, Hamas\n \n Most likely they would not these days. Really they never should be involved in war. It's not why it's here.\n \n \nThere's no real evidence that proves that the Church still supports crusades. You know this, which is why you say \"'maybe' the Church supports crusades\" rather than just \"the Church supports crusades.\" You add the \"maybe\" because you know it doesn't, but you just think nobody can refute it.\n \n \n They declared them, they helped finance them, they helped supply them and they helped run them. That would be evidence that they were not opposed to them. \n \n Read what I posted and deal with that not what you want to twist it into. I said that today nobody would condone another Christian crusade. I further said that until the Church makes a statement that they do not approve of the reasons for or the methods used during the crusades it would not be unreasonable to think that they may still think the why and how were acceptable. It has nothing to do with what your whining about.\n \n \nYou say \"maybe the church supports crusades! You'll just have to believe me until you can refute me!\" Why should I believe the Church supports crusades when you don't, yet you're the one trying to imply that \"maybe\" it does? Why should I believe you when you don't even believe yourself?\n\n \n You sound like a 12 year old who is as smart as he thinks he is. I am not making a personal statement either way. Honestly I don't care if they have said anything concerning the atrocities committed during any of the crusades. I also don't really care if you believe me or not, take 5 minutes and look it up yourself instead of throwing a temper tantrum.\n \n \nSure I would. It'd make more sense then saying \"we all support adultery and racism.\" In the scenario, if America supports racism then why don't they practice it?\n\n \n Because the US doesn't support racism. This is now you flip flopping \n and citing where the member is acting contrary to the organization. Once you grasp the organization/member relationship we can continue.\n \n \nOnce again, by that logic, you can conclude that we all support adultery, racism, and flag-burning. After all, those are completely legal in every developed country.\n\n \n No you can't and No they aren't. How do you not know these things?\n \n \nThere it is again. \"Maybe the Church supports crusades. Prove me wrong!\" And now that I've seen no evidence that you actually believe the Church supports crusades, I don't think I need to believe you when you don't even believe yourself.\n\n \n Wow maybe back off the caffeine. I have already answered this. If you decide to bring it up again, do us a favor and base it on something other than mindless ranting about nothing.\n \n \nAnd why should modern day Christians supposed to share responsibility for something that happened hundreds of years before they were born? \n \n \n It isn't individual responsibility. It's the organization that accepts it or doesn't. You share in that responsibility to the extent you are a member of that organization. \n \n \nShould you, as a citizen living in a developed nation, take responsibility for all the racism and adultery going on?\n\n \n If I belong to an organization that promotes it then yes. If I don't then no. Christianity has never supported adultery, even though members have been guilty. That doesn't mean they all have nor that the church condones it.",
