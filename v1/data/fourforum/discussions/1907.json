   "From AR-15:\n \n \n Since Tuesday's votes there have been many discussions regarding the Assault Weapon Ban.\n \n Senate bill s1805 was created to protect firearm manufacturers from legal action. This bill had a great deal of support and looked a sure bet to be passed into law.\n \n Tuesday saw the passing of an amendment to add the Assault Weapon Ban extension to s1805. This meant that both items would exists for a single vote. So while many of us posted our outrage to the Senate vote on the AWB extension, what it did was help kill s1805 and the legal protection for manufacturers.\n \n The newly amended s1805 then was overwhelmingly defeated (90-8) meaning that the original bill which would have passed on it's own, was now dead. This also means that the AWB extension which was added to it, died as well.\n \n This was the best chance for the AWB to be added to a bill before it expires. This does not mean it is a lock to sunset, as anything can happen, but it is a victory for us as the final months tick away for the AWB.",
