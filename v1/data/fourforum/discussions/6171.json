Considering the forum topic, I plowed through endless acronyms and prideful statements looking for economic numbers, but to no avail.\n\n \n Yah, I'm not a big fan of the briefing posts on the site, but it is the only one I could find with the nice charts.\n \n In regards to the economics it is already been factored into the budget. I think it was last years budget that gave the Army the permanent 30,000 increase that makes it happen. The Stryker units have also already been budgeted for, although not all delivered yet.\n \n This is the change that has been talked about for the last 12 odd years or so for the army.

   "The real sad part to the story regarding the military is that Rumpsfield was right. \n \n A smaller, better trained and super armed military is effective at winning wars. Mobility is optimized and the amount of fire power a single soldier can bring to bare would give a WWII division a boat load of trouble.\n \n The flaw in the Rumpsfield security plan is that policing a nation takes bodies. If you compare even New York's ratio of police to population against what we have in Iraq you'll find New York is a winnable war. And New York likes us. They actually want to be policed.\n \n .5% of our population is in the military. The cost relative to maintaining and arming them is still quite an issue. Beefing up the military and doubling will be a massive fiscal undertaking. \n \n Personally, I want the Rumpsfield plan. The stabilizing an enemy issue should not be the job of our military. They are our war machine and they should maintain the duty of winning battles not directing traffic.",
