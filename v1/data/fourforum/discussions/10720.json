   "I am completely, utterly against gun control. I have gone over the net on many sites and in my opinion; the cons strongly overpower and outnumber the pros. I urge you to research like I have and I hope to help you decide for yourself.\n \n the second amendment in the constitution states, \"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" This is very a sound argument used to protect us from a tyrant government as well as each other. But, people fire back with freedom of religion has its boundaries as does the second amendment, its restrictions can be found with common sense. But, is it really common sense to give up our most powerful weapons and be at the mercy of felons and the government?\n \n This, to me, had some truth behind it and it seems to make more sense than the others. \"It's obvious that someone willing to commit a major crime, like murder, isn't likely to worry about a gun control law. The object of gun control is to make it hard for someone that's likely to commit murder from getting a gun and even harder to get a gun capable of killing dozens of people.\"\n In my eyes, it would be next to impossible to stop black markets that are selling illegal guns. It is impossible to get rid of all felons. These two facts are inevitable. Because for every felon they lock up their will be another to take their place. As for the black markets I believe that it is possible to stop them. But what can the government do to stop them that isn't so drastic that the common, law-abiding citizen won't retaliate? \n \n Also, the pros say that guns make killing easier and say that guns kill so many people a year. I am not denying that this is true. But, how many people die every year from an automobile accident? And if guns are so terrible that we must ban them then cars should be banned to right?\n \n As said by yet another pro \"In 1994 Governor Weld of Massachusetts signed a law that banned handgun possession for people under 21 in Boston. A year After Weld signed the law, Boston, riddled with youth murders in the early 1990's, began a 21/2-year spell without a gun murder of a child under 17.\" At first this seemed like a solid statement. I thought and read this over several times and could find nothing peculiar about it. But, it said GUN murders. If it was hard to acquire a gun then wouldn't gun murders go down? If someone really wanted to kill another then gun or no gun wouldn't they use anything that would do the job? I would bet that, although their were little gun murders, that other types of Murders would go up.",
