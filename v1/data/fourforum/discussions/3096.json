   "Terral,\n \n \nTerral's reply << Every aspect of the Lord's Passover pertains to Jesus Christ and His work on the cross. Remember again that the Lord's Passover Supper Ritual is all about SACRIFICE, and Israel's liberation from Egypt (slavery and death). For the people to live, the Passover lamb had to die. Grain is broken to make the bread. Grapes are crushed for the making of wine. What did Christ say? \"I am the bread of life.\" John 6:48. Therefore, the meat of the Passover lamb was His flesh; the bread was His body, and the wine of that Passover supper was His blood. Christ was telling the disciples that HE was the Passover Lamb. Please go back and read the story, where they had to kill the Passover lamb, put its blood on their doorways. As it is written, \n \n \"You shall take a bunch of HYSSOP and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning. \"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite {you.}\" Ex. 12:22+23.\n \n The door posts (vertical) and the lintel (horizontal) were wooden symbols of the cross. What did Christ say? \"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.\" John 10:9. When Christ was on the cross, and asked for water, what did they give Him? \"A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon {a branch} {of} HYSSOP and brought it up to His mouth.\" John 10:29. \n \n After the crucifixion, Christ told these same disciples, \"\"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" Luke 24:44. So Christ was explaining these parts of the Lord's Passover Supper to His disciples, in the same way that I am explaining them to you today. \n \n It is also written in Exodus 12:8 that \"they shall eat the flesh that night\" and in Exodus 12:10  that \"none of it shall remain until the morning.\" The Lamb of the Passover was to be eaten  and in Jesus' institution of the Eucharist he gave us an intimate union of \"dwelling within us as we were to dwell within him.\"\n \n \nOur Lord is speaking figuratively concerning the things of the Spirit. Christ Himself tells you, \"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\" John 6:63. Today, we feed upon God's Word in the form of Holy Scripture. Christ said, \"This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.\" John 6:58. Then, Paul writes, \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 6:23. As manna was the gift of the Lord God from heaven, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. \n \n If the Lord was speaking figuratively then why do some of his disciples leave because what he taught was a \"hard saying?\" (John 6:60, 6:66) Why did Jesus not draw them back and say, wait you misunderstand me, I am only speaking symbolically about the Spirit? Why is this the only parable where Jesus does not elucidate his figurative language to the apostles?\n \n \nThe Apostle Paul did not seek to replace the Spirit of God with his eating and drinking. He did not fabricate a Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Communion Ritual from the Lord's Passover Supper where the Word of God is being replaced with bread and wine. Paul told these fleshy Corinthians, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. He never even mentions this to any of the other churches. Instead, Paul says that food and drink are 'mere shadows.' Col. 2:16+17. \n \n No, Paul did not fabricate anything. Nor has the Church. Paul did not replace the Word with the Eucharist but he did in fact give such strong words about having the right attitude and understanding toward the body and blood that if one takes it lightly then he is condemning himself. It is so important that \"many of you are weak and ill, and some have died\" due to negligence in regard to the Body and Blood. (1 Corinthians 11: 29-30)\n \n Those following Paul carried on this teaching in the early Church:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp  \n \n \nWe are baptized into one body (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we hear and believe the Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. This mystery among the Gentiles (\"Christ in you\" Col. 1:27) is about hearing and believing the gospel. Col. 1:24-27, Rom. 16:25. The Church itself is the body of Christ. 1Cor. 12:27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. It is some among us who are practicing idolatry by replacing the things of the Spirit of God with these man-made rituals. Scripture says, \n \n These are of the Spirit, Maximus, and Christ does not get into anyone by eating bread and drinking wine during cerimonial rituals. \n \n We are baptized into one body, no one argues that. But that is not to say that there are not more than one images and fulfillments of the Body of Christ. There are often several deep meanings and layers of scripture. Abundant examples of that can be demonstrated (just as this is demonstrated with the Church as the Bride of Christ). If we are baptized into one body we are also joined in one body by partaking of the Eucharist. Paul explicitly tells us this:\n \n 1 Corinthians 10:16-17  \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, WE WHO ARE MANY ARE ONE BODY, FOR WE ALL PARTAKE OF THE ONE BREAD.\"\n \n I do not understand why the Eucharist of the Church is idolatry being that it is worship of Jesus Christ. Can you explain that to me? How is worship of Jesus Christ and following his command to \"do this in remembrance of me\" idolatry? \n \n Furthermore, you have yet to explain why Paul himself is not an idolater when Paul makes it clear that he believes the breaking of the bread and drinking of the cup, when commemorated properly, to be the actual body and blood of Jesus (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 1 Corinthians 11:23-32)\n \n I am also still interested to know why Paul celebrates the Eucharist being that he quit administering the Kingdom Gospel and began administering the Gospel of Grace. Why does he partake of a Kingdom Covenant and why does he teach his Gentile churches to do so?",

Why does he partake of a Kingdom Covenant and why does he teach his Gentile churches to do so?\n\n \n \n In John Chapter 6  where Christ makes it very plain that we must eat of His flesh and drink of His blood in very literal terms....so literal in fact that half of his followers left because they could not \"comprehend\" such a \"hard thing\"...\n \n We also have the historical fact that until the protestant reformation -- every Christian Church, going back to when the Apostles first began to spread the Word -- believed in Christ's actual presence in the Holy Eucharist. The idea of the Eucharist being symbolic only came about with Protestantism.\n \n In the Gospels Christ continually warns us that those who are wise in the ways of the world will have trouble accpeting Him. Christ wants us to come Him with the faith of children. Christ said \"This is my body\" This is My Blood\". He was not speaking in parables.\n \n Is this canabalism? Absolutely not. In fact there is an old Cannon law that stipulated anyone thinking the Eucharist was bloody human flesh was to be not allowed to receive the sacrement for ten years ...and murdererss were only denied the sacrement for 7 years.\n \n Does the water, wine and bread become Human flesh?\n \n As Orthodox we do not try to \"solve, rationlize, or explain\" this as Roman Catholics and Protestant do. Rather we accept it as a mystery of our faith and take Christ at His literal word just as the Apostles did. For us Holy Communion today is the same as it was at the Last Supper....and for all Christians ever since. We accept Christ without needing to have things explained. We accept Christ's Word...and do not try to rationalize such things. Anyone thinking otherwise needs to read 2 Peter and ask themself: \"Have I followed and believed as Peter and the other Apostles truly and fully taught?\"\n \n Perhaps this issue is intended as some sort of test by Christ? Imagine being judged and asked: \"You learned and followed many of My teachings...but why did you deny my body and blood of the New Testament in the bread and the cup?\" And then some answering like: \" Well come on Lord...How could that be? How could water, wine and bread actually be anything more than 'symbolic'\".\n \n Christ said those who followed Him without question and totally would receive a greater reward than those who did not.",

This is what the church has erased trying to get rid of Jewish symbolism.\n \n Jesus is the middle matzah, the Afikoman, which is pierced and striped. It is taken during the feast broken and then hidden hidden. After the meal the Afikoman is brought back and shared. The Cup of wine is the 5th cup,Cup of Elijah, is the cup of redemption. So Jesus knowing that he was going to die created a new tradition. He is the new covenant and the passover lamb as with the Jews passing out of slavery in Egypt so Jesus becomes the redemption from the slavery of sin, hence the passover symbolism.",
