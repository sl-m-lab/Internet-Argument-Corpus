   "I read Tsyics World War Three response. He is true on a couple of things.\n 1. China and Russia are nuclear powers. Together, they have more nuclear weapons than we do. But alone, China or Russia has less. But together, as i said, they have more.\n 2. The war will be fought in the middle east. Well, duh. \n 3. The war will cause the EU to get involved.\n But see, a dozen things differ between Russia, China, and America.\n 1. Russia has the worlds greatest airforce. I lived there for a long time and was a pilot. I flew some hot stuff. They have a helicopter kept secret from the world. And a dozen other secret planes. One is a really great helicopter called a Getiv-629. It is a nuclear powered helicopter that can carry a dozen missiles.\n 2. China has more ground forces and a air force almost as small and wimpy as ours.\n 3. They may have the capability to launch nuclear missies at America, but more than likely would not hit America. We would shoot them out of the sky. \n 4. America has a bigger naval fleet and far better nuclear capabilities. When conditions worsened in Russia, I immigrated here and joined a base called Fort Segardis. It is a small nuclear base where weapons (nukes) are heavily guarded and stores. We have a weapon called Titan 3's. We could blow up the earth with just four is what scientists say. \n I disagree, but whatever.\n 5. America would win\n China might have far more ground forces than us, but they would never invade America. We have far more weapons than them. If they launch a nuclear weapon, we will launch a few at the Beijing. If they launched weapons, not only would we launch back, but we would invade China and same with Russia.\n Readers, don't be angered, scared, or whatever of the China-Russia axis. This war might happen, but it might not. You can't read and beleive everything on the internet. I know the person who put this world war three stuff on the forum is not lieing, but I want proof. I have not heard the media talk about it, and I am a doctor of philosophical sciences and political sciences at Washinton. I have never heard of this idiocy. If you have proof, write me.\n -Dr. John Milosevic",

   "I am not even going to bother looking you up in any staff directories this time Sammy John. Your lie below speaks volumes, and I didn't have to go to any effort to uncover it. Tomorrow, why don't you try to convince us that you are actually George Bush himself? We might actually believe that HE writes like a 10 yr old kid.\n \n \n \n \nI moved here from Russia when my brother was arrested. My brother is the old president of Yugoslavia that killed a lot of people. His name is Slubgdan Milosevic. I move here and became a close political advisor to the United States. I learned all that stuff from American president Bush. I brought this up to him, and he agrees. But, if a country launched a missle, we would launch a counter offensive with nuclear weapons and wipe the country out. China and Russia, one missle, we launch a dozen back, and invade with an air assault and a shitload of naval ships carrying tamahawks and cruise missles towards their bases and cities. Then we would invade with some troops, and stuff.\n -John Milosevic\n\n \n Slobodan Milosevic had ONE brother, his name is Borislav. He is 7 yrs older than Slobodon, and his biggest fan. Borislav is a very proper individual, not given to using terms like \"shitload\", especially since he understands and speaks english relatively well, but cannot read or write it at all.\n \n You really think that people were going to believe that Milosevics parents named one of their kids Slobadon and the other JOHN? Are you nuts? \n \n Your writing style is very similar to that of \"Sammy Grevano\" above. How much of a looser do you have to be to lie to people on an anonymous forum board on the internet? None of these people know you, none of them particularly cares who you are. People here are judged by their intellect, which is generally judged by their contributions. Granted if I had your obviously low intelligence (after all, this is essentially your second pathetically planned attempt at a lie....both times the lies were just plain STUPID), I might see it differently.",

And a dozen other secret planes. One is a really great helicopter called a Getiv-629. It is a nuclear powered helicopter that can carry a dozen missiles.\n\n \n \n I just had to address this one because besides the other stuff you said, this may be the stupidest thing I have heard this week. Nuclear power can only be used to produce either steam or electricity (in the case of nuclear fuel cells on satellites). Thsi means that either:\n \n A. The helicopter is steam powered\n B. The helicopter is all electric\n \n \n Since nuclear fuel cells cannot generate anywhere near the power required to power a helicopter, we will assume that you are talking a reactor. The helicopter would have to carry at least a couple thousand gallons of water to cool the reactor, plus several thousand more for steam generation. Water weighs 8.34 lbs/gallon, so you are looking at AT LEAST a 16,000 lb payload of JUST water. THEN, add the 2800 LBS, which is how much a GE \"featherweight\" 1000 HP motor weighs. You are at 18,800 Lbs, and you do not even have the AIRFRAME yet. \n \n 1000 HP is not NEARLY enough to lift that kind of weight, so you have to up the size of the motor, which means carrying more water for your bigger reactor, and a heavier motor....what it boils down to is the fact that it is impossible.\n \n \n \n PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A BOT. Nobody can possibly be THIS stupid.",

This guy has missed a career in sci-fi writing.\n \n A nuclear jet, now that's something that might have worked, using propulsion air as reactor coolant. Of course, the ay this works (in theory) makes sure any resemblance to helicopters (like some kind of rotor and similar) is out of the question.",

   "Ok, one, my name is Joseph. I go by the name John cause I hate the name Joseph. It sounds like a poor farmer that is out picking corn.\n Anyway, this is kind of true. Russians have developed a helicopter that has nuclear energy or something. I don't really remember what the hell it was. But, it was something.

   "Ok, one, my name is Joseph. I go by the name John cause I hate the name Joseph. It sounds like a poor farmer that is out picking corn.\n\n \n If your name is not Borislav, then you are NOT Slobadon Milosevics brother. Nor ws I able to find you in any staff directory at Washingtom University.\n \n \nAnyway, this is kind of true. Russians have developed a helicopter that has nuclear energy or something. I don't really remember what the hell it was. But, it was something. All I know, is when I was in the Russian Air Force, I flew helicopters and airplanes that were more advanced then the Amerikan planes. Granted, ours can't carry as many bombs as yours, and they can't necessarily fly as fast. \n \n \n How are they more advanced then? The Russians latest and greatest stealth technology is roughly equivelent to what the US had in the 70's. They still have not figured out how to mold radar absorbing materials into an air frame, and their last test of their electronic system made the 2'x4' kite that it was sitting on look like it was 300 ft long and nearly a mile tall. That is NOT stealth. \n \n I don't think you have ever flown anything. I don't think you were ever in the air force. I think you are a teenage kid with WAY too much time on his hands.\n \n \nOh, and I am not that Sammy Grevanno guy. He is a retard. I am not him. Besides, unlike him, I am actually worth skin and life.\n Anyway. What do you all think about that World War Three stuff? Is it true?\n\n \n I don't think I am going to waste my time debating with sombody who lies constantly, and I think that you and Sammy are one in the same retard. Your writing style and lies are just too close to the same. Lets step into the way back machine and look at some of the lies you have told in the few posts you have made here:\n \n \nI am a doctor of philosophical sciences and political sciences at Washinton\n\n \n You are not in the staff directory\n \n \nAll I know, is when I was in the Russian Air Force, I flew helicopters and airplanes that were more advanced then the Amerikan planes.\n\n \n A pilot who is so stupid that they do not know whether their craft is nuclear powered or not? COME ON. Pilots are a lot fo things, but generally not stupid. Either when doing your pre flight inspection you were holding a geiger counter next to your engine or you were not. It is not something you can make a mistake about.\n \n \nI moved here from Russia when my brother was arrested. My brother is the old president of Yugoslavia that killed a lot of people. His name is Slubgdan Milosevic.\n\n \n Already covered this load of BS\n \n \nI move here and became a close political advisor to the United States. I learned all that stuff from American president Bush. I brought this up to him, and he agrees.\n\n \n You are a close advisor to the president, and you call him \"American president Bush\"? Another load of XXXX. If indeed you WERE in the soviet military, you could not even get a pass into the white house. You could not even take the tour. And they CERTAINLY would not use sombody as an advisor who does not know the difference between a nuclear powered helicopter and a \"nuclear whatever\" helicopter. You are VERY obviously lacking the grey matter to advise anybody about anything. \n \n \nBack in the sixties and seventies, stealing kids and selling them, was a big thing. I was stolen and sold once. Then, in 1976, my illegal family said I was old enough to leave and support myself. I left, and tried to find my biological parents.\n\n \n I thought you were Slobadon Milosevics brother? That is the problem with lying...you have to remember later what you said.",
