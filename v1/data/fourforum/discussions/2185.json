   "I have heard before how our troops stationed in the San Diego area don't earn enough money to even cover basic expenses. As a result, they have to go to food pantries for handouts, and have to live on food stamps. \n \n Well, Bill Moyers just did a report on it on PBS, and it makes me sick. These people are defending our country, and our government won't pay them a decent wage. To top it all off, they interviewed Rep. Duncan Hunter, who said that the troops prefer it that way, that this country's military members would rather pull themselves up by their bootstraps than ask Uncle Sam for a raise. The same Duncan Hunter that still supports Star Wars and the Osprey aircraft, even though everyone else agrees these are obsolete, needless programs.\n \n He'd rather watch our fighting boys stand in line for food handouts than give them a decent salary. What an outrage- I truly feel sorry for anyone that lives in this idiot's district. He's the same kind of do-nothing congressman that would distract us from REAL issues like this, and worry about flag-burning, gay marriages and Star Wars defense tactics. How does this guy sleep at night? I'm pretty good at controlling my temper, but I can't even begin to tell you all how ****** I am at this jerk. He won't even vote for a pay raise for our fighting men and women. Truly a disgrace to all Americans, and this creep actually has an American flag on his website. Oh yeah, go check it out- what a laugh. I tried to e-mail him, but everything's set up so that you can only e-mail your own congressman. I guess he's got his hands full with his own upset constituents, he doesn't have time for me!\n \n If anyone here lives in the San Diego area, I'd certainly like to hear your opinion. Just how does the XXXXX Duncan continue to get re-elected?",

   "If Bill Moyers said it it probably is being spun somehow.\n \n To say that US soldiers earn that little money is absurd...\n\n \n Oh, of course, if it doesn't come from the lips of Rash Limbo, then it must be a lie.\n \n What Bill Moyers showed was the pay of our soldiers vs. the cost of living in the San Diego area. The soldiers pay is just slightly more than half of basic living costs. They also showed dozens of our soldiers and their families standing in line at food banks, waiting for hand-outs. Probably just hired a bunch of actors for that, right?\n \n As for the \"honorable\" Congressman Hunter, Bill Moyers didn't say anything; it was the congressman himself that made the statements, on film. If Bill Moyers did something to put words in that XXXXX's mouth, then Moyers should go to jail. But I doubt even a wacko liberal like Moyers is THAT stupid. If anyone else thinks I (or Bill Moyers) is lying, then please get the transcript from PBS and prove me wrong.\n \n For the record, this isn't about being liberal or conservative, despite Broker's attempts to turn it that way. It's about our government paying our troops enough money that they can at least feed, clothe and house their families without \"relying on the kindness of strangers.\" The troops won't complain about it themselves, because I'm sure they (and their commanding officers) are convinced it would show weakness on their part to do so. No matter how you try to spin this, it's still a disgrace. If they're willing to lay their lives on the line for our country, then the least our country can do is pay them a decent wage.",
