Going into science with the desire to discover things is a good example of what I am arguing--that the wisest course may to devote your life to something you are passionate about and good at, and something that is a big project like scientific discovery. In this manner, you are likely to achieve a lot which rewards yourself greatly and you will feel a part of something much larger than just you which will also reward you with a sense of a larger purpose and meaning.

That everything is a matter of opinion? What would \"values\" matter then? Why should you start a thread on them and argue about which were the best? It's as pointless as arguing with someone about which flavor of ice-cream tastes better.\n\n \n I was asking, given that your values are not religious, what are they. I was not asking about derivations. Let's be honest; what you are doing here is questioning debating about values that are not religious--that was not the point of this thread. \n \n And values are not the same as tastes. Tastes generally do not involve weighty consequences, values do. If I adopt a value system to kill every man I see, the consequences are dramatically different than adopting a value that prohibits violence. Whether I prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream lacks consequence. I imagine most people like myself will use a combination of bases for choosing values. The likely consequences of values would be an important consideration. I imagine we also probably draw on what seems reasonible and sensible as well as traditional notions of right and wrong. I also think people try to choose a value system with a central principle (like altruism or individualism) and then try to adopt accompanying values that are consistent with that central principle. There are some thoughts off the top of my head.\n \n People like me feel that there is no way to prove in any ultimate way that a value is correct. That does not imply that values are completely arbitrary because, for one thing, different values produce different results. We can argue about which values are most supportable even though we can't prove which are best in the ultimate sense. \n \n One reason I do not wish to enter into a debate with a person of faith is that I respect faith and do not like to be in a position where I have to challenge it.",
