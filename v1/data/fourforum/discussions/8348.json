   "The Definition of fair, in any competition, means that the same exact rules apply to the contestants.\n \n A criminal trial is a contest between disputing parties. \n \n The Plaintiff initiates due process by giving a sworn statement to the police accusing the Defendant of committing a criminal offense.\n \n The Defendant has the right to sign a sworn affidavit to controvert the charges of the Plaintiff. \n \n The Criminal Court Clerk is obligated to place both legal documents on the docket to permit the Judge and/or jurors to hear both sides of the dispute.\n \n If the officers of the court deny the right of the Defendant to controvert the charges of the Plaintiff, then the entire criminal proceeding is corrupted, no matter the outcome.",
