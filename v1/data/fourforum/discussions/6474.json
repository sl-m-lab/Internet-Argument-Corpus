Miller High Life (the champagne of bottled beer) wins more blind taste tests than any other brand.\n \n The best beer I EVER had was in Germany at a construction site. At the end of the work day, our hosts pulled out a black garbage bag loaded with marianated pork steaks and a couple of cases of beer that had been sitting unrefrigerated on the back of the truck all day. They cooked the pork over a charcoal fire, toasted some bread and we had one of the best meals I've had in my life. The beer was almost warm, but that seemed to make the whole meal better.",

I find that I get more expression of the flavors and a more lingering aftertaste in the palate when it is room temperature. \n \n I like irish whiskey the best.
