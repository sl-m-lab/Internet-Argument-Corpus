   "Liberals to introduce same-sex marriage bill in January\n Last Updated Thu, 09 Dec 2004 21:40:37 EST \n OTTAWA - The Liberal government will introduce legislation to legalize same-sex marriage when Parliament resumes sitting in January, Prime Minister Paul Martin said Thursday. \n \n In an opinion released earlier in the day, nine Supreme Court judges asked to review draft legislation extending marriage rights to gays and lesbians said such a move would be constitutional. \n \n \n Paul Martin \n \n RELATED STORY: Supreme Court OK's same-sex marriage \n \n That legal opinion clears the way for the Liberal government to introduce a bill early in the new year. \n \n Liberal MPs will be free to vote their conscience on the bill, but cabinet ministers will be required to vote in favour of it, said Martin. \n \n The prime minister urged members of all parties to carefully consider the issue before voting, saying the proposed legislation will ensure the \"equal treatment of all Canadians.\" \n \n He acknowledged the issue is divisive, but said Canadians can handle the debate. \n \n \"I think this will engender a debate across the country,\" said Martin. \"We are a very mature nation and can undertake the debate.\" \n \n Canada is the \"world's most post-modern country\" and can take the lead in this issue, he said. \n \n Martin's Liberal minority government holds 134 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons, but should have the support of most of the 19 New Democrat MPs and 54 Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs. \n \n Justice Minister Irwin Cotler says he expects a \"significant majority\" of members will support the bill because it backs two key points of the Charter, equality rights and freedom of religion. \n \n As part of Thursday's decision, the court said religious groups opposed to same-sex marriages won't be compelled to perform them. \n \n Conservative Leader Stephen Harper, who called the court's opinion a \"victory for Canadian democracy,\" says he's pleased the courts \"punted this issue back to Parliament.\" \n \n Harper said the Supreme Court supports his party's policy because it also declined to express an opinion on whether the traditional definition of marriage is unconstitutional. \n \n The Conservative leader says he'd like the government to introduce a compromise bill to Parliament that would preserve the traditional definition of marriage in law and include stronger protections of religious freedoms. \n \n Can't use notwithstanding clause, Alberta Justice Minister says \n \n \n Irwin Cotler \n Alberta's Justice Minister said his government, which opposes same sex marriage, will have to weigh its options in the wake of the ruling. But Ron Stevens said they need to be realistic, adding that the decision has restricted their ability to defend marriage. \n \n Stevens said the government does not have the option of imposing the Constitution's notwithstanding clause. \n \n \"Since the court ruled the authority over same-sex marriage falls to the federal government, it is only the federal government who can invoke the notwithstanding clause to maintain the traditional definition of marriage.\" \n \n He said the Alberta Tory caucus must now meet to discuss the province's next move. \n \n \"There are legal options, but I'm going to share them with my colleagues first. I'm not going to stand here today and talk about what-ifs,\" he said. \n \n Stevens said his government's position is not aimed at discriminating against gays and lesbians, but \"upholding the definition of marriage as it is traditionally understood by society.\" \n \n Four years ago, Alberta passed a law stating marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Stevens said despite the Supreme Court ruling that law stands and marriage licences will not be granted to same-sex couples. \n \n Written by CBC News Online staff\n \n Copyright \u00a92004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - All Rights Reserved \n http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/12/09/martin-samesex041209.html",

   "Slippery Slope Fallacy (Camel's Nose)\n \n there is an old saying about how if you allow a camel to poke his nose into the tent, soon the whole camel will follow.\n \n The fallacy here is the assumption that something is wrong because it is right next to something that is wrong. Or, it is wrong because it could slide towards something that is wrong.\n \n For example, \"Allowing abortion in the first week of pregnancy would lead to allowing it in the ninth month.\" Or, \"If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin.\" Or, \"If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone.\" \n \n Fallacy Of Composition:\n \n assuming that a whole has the same simplicity as its constituent parts. In fact, a great deal of science is the study of emergent properties. For example, if you put a drop of oil on water, there are interesting optical effects. But the effect comes from the oil/water system: it does not come just from the oil or just from the water.\n \n Another example: \"A car makes less pollution than a bus. Therefore, cars are less of a pollution problem than buses.\"\n \n Another example: \"Atoms are colorless. Cats are made of atoms, so cats are colorless.\" \n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#composition\n \n \nWhat does that have to do with anything?

Fascism is, after all, far worse than socialism - it combines all the tyranny of socialism with an elitist opposition to democracy and equality. Here in America we are bent on opposing socialism, and considering the recent shift in the socialist camp towards tolerant views on personal behavior, our people see a need to oppose even that.

My assertions are NOT BS!\n \n UNITED STATES AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION LEAD THE DEVELOPED WORLD IN TEENAGE PREGNANCY RATES \n \n U.S. Rate Remains Very High Despite Drop in 1990s \n \n Adolescent Childbearing and Pregnancy Declined the Industrialized World in the Last 25 Years \n \n The United States continues to have one of the highest rates of adolescent childbearing and pregnancy rates in the developed world, despite a substantial 17% decline in its teenage pregnancy rate in the 1990s, according to a new cross-country study by The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI). Currently, U.S. rates are akin to those in the Russian Federation and several eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, and at least four times the rates in France, Germany and Japan.\n \n http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/newsrelease3201a.html\n \n \n Some of the most dramatic improvement has come in the area of teen pregnancy. In 1991, 62 of every 1,000 U.S. females between ages 15 and 19 gave birth. A decade later, the teen birth rate fell to 43 per 1,000.\n \n Even with such progress, U.S. teen birthrates remain among the highest in the developed world. In 2002, Canada's teen birthrate was 20 per 1,000; in France, it was eight per 1,000.\n \n http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/10393663.htm\n \n Teenage pregnancy rates per 1,000 \n Russia - 101.7 \n United States - 83.6 \n Bulgaria - 83.3 \n England and Wales - 46.9 \n Australia - 43.7 \n Sweden - 24.9 \n Netherlands - 12.2 \n Source: Alan Guttmacher Institute 2000 \n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3117108.stm\n \n The U.S. also has highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases in the industrialized world...\n \n Over the past four decades a great deal of progress in STD prevention has been made in the United States. Rates of gonorrhea and syphilis have recently been brought to historic lows. Yet the U.S. still has the highest rates of STDs in the industrialized world, with rates that are 50-100 times higher than other industrialized nations. There are an estimated 12 million new cases of STDs in the U.S. each year. Of these, 3 million occur among teenagers, 13 to 19 years old. A recent CDC report documented that over 85% of the most common infectious diseases in the U.S. are sexually transmitted. \n \n http://www.thebody.com/cdc/stdprev.html",

To all of this we are now attempting to add the financial burden of support for same sex marriage and it is clear that a vast majority of taxpayers are not at all prepared to do this. I cannot sit in judgement of such people because I cannot not know for certain the morality of their views and quite frankly neither can you. The real issue is and has been the rights of both same sex couples and those who do not wish to sanction them or what they do. It truly is a live and let live attitude that I wish to convey but apparently it's not good enough for everyone.\n\n \n \n Are you not aware that homosexuals pay taxes also? What are these \"certain obligations on the taxpayers\"? What is this \"financial burden\" you speak of? Please be specific, as I cannot think of what you are refering to.\n \n Consider two income couples. For tax purposes, in most cases, a heterosexual couple filing jointly are allowed deductions in excess of those allowed a same sex couple who MUST file as individuals.\n \n In most same sex couples, both work and pay taxes. In the case of a one income heterosexual couple, one spouse enjoys the benefits without paying taxes at all. Take the case of social security. For a two income same sex couple, both pay the tax. For a one income hetrosexual couple, only one pays the tax, but both benefit, including survivor benefits denied to the same sex couple.\n \n In most places, schools are supported by property taxes. Homosexuals pay property taxes also. I would venture to say that same sex couples have fewer children than heterosexual couples, yet pay the same taxes. Who is supporting whom here? Allowing legal recognition of same sex marriages would not change this inequity.\n \n If anything, as things stand now, it is the same sex couples paying more of their taxes to support the heterosexual couples; income taxes, social security taxes, inheirantence taxes, property taxes, as examples. I fail to see how granting same sex couples the same legal rights as heterosexual couples would increase the heterosexual couples tax burden, unless it would be to equalize the taxation with the benefits.\n \n \"The issue is freedom of conscience.\" What is this? Are you implying that heterosexuals are entitled to whatever \"it\" is, but homosexual individuals are not? How would heterosexuals be denied this if same sex marriages were legally recognized? I am sorry, but I fail to see this as a legimate issue.\n \n I sincerely appreciate your overall attitude, but I think you are missing some of the key elements.",

   "The falacy of this statement above is that we homosexuals are NOT seeking everyone's approval of how we live or who we love. We already have that within our own community of family and friends. We can already get married within several different religious denominations, including Christian denominations. We are seeking the same LEGAL benefits already enjoyed by others as relating to the 1,000+ federal statutes which are granted to heterosexual married couples. The issue IS equal individual LEGAL rights under the law. Equal LEGAL rights of inheiritamce. Equal LEGAL rights for hospital visitation. Equal LEGAL rights for social security survivors benefits. These are just a few examples of the many LEGAL benefits we are denied.\n\n \n No, what you are seeking is the creation of a new dependent class that the majority of society has decided NOT to support with their tax dollars. You can \"say\" it's about equality, but equality has nothing to do with it. ALL US citizens are free to marry a member of the opposite sex. NOBODY in the US is free to marry someone of the same sex. \n \n\n It simple boggles my mind that so many of the heterosexual society feel threatened and fearful of something that would have no affect on their lives, their relationships, or their LEGAL rights what-so-ever. Where does their irrational phobia stem from?\n\n \n Gay marriage affects my pocketbook, and for that reason alone, I should have a say in whether or not I want to grant public benefits to them.

In their article, \"Wedding Bell Blues: The Income Tax Consequences of Legalizing Same-Sex Marriages,\" James Alm, M.V. Lee Badgett, and Leslie Whittington estimate that legalizing gay marriage would lead to an annual increase in federal government income taxes of between $0.3 billion and $1.3 billion.

These added revenues could be used to help offset the costs of other economic advantages to marriage.\n \n Besides, weddings are great for the economy. The 2000 U.S. Census Bureau reported 601,209 unmarried same-sex partner households in the United States living in 99.3% of all counties in the nation.

For argument sake, let's just assume that the Census data is low and that the Urban Institute figures are high. No matter where that number falls between the two, it is still pretty high. And nearly all of them are unmarried. Think about the consumption possibilities!\n \n We can estimate that some portion of the same-sex partners already living together (the 2000 U.S. Census Data figures) along with some portion of the total gay and lesbian population would wish to marry if same-sex marriage became legal. For the sake of convenience we'll say 500,000. According to Bride's Magazine, the average wedding costs $19,000. Two hundred-fifty thousand more marriages at the average wedding rate would result in wedding costs of $4.75 billion! Mind you, this doesn't include the amount spent on wedding gifts. As a bonus, the first states to allow gay marriage will likely experience an influx of tourism and tourist-related economic activity. For the short time that San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, issued wedding licenses to same-sex couples, more than 3,000 gay and lesbian couples from more than twenty states and Europe flocked to the city to be married.\n \n Of course, weddings are just the tip of the iceberg.

Arby's really isn't a hamburger place - I'd say they do charge extra. But I'll have to check on White Castle and Burger King in my area. \n \n But I think it's a good analogy. Suppose I organize a cheese-hating special interest group. We whine and complain and lobby untill we get congress to pass a law ordering Wendys to charge 10 cents less for no cheese. Now, instead of paying $2.00 like all the cheese lovers, we now only pay $1.90. A victory? Wendy's managment now declares that they have to provide additional training to cashiers, add a button to all the cash registers, restructure their cheese ordering program since a percentage of the carryout customers will now add their own cheese, etc. All these new complications now increased the price of a burger to $2.20. Now I have to pay $2.10, instead of the original $2.00 that everybody used to have to pay. If I'd have left everything alone, I would have come out better financially. But if I have a vendetta against cheese lovers, it would be worth the extra dime for me to see them have to pay the extra 20 cents.\n \n This is the way it would be with gay marriage. It will impose legal problems, complicate corporate benefit programs, complicate school systems, increase the costs of many things we buy. It could easily end up costing everyone INCLUDING the gay couples, more than if they would have just left it alone. But it will be worth it to those who have a vendetta against straight people.",

   "Who cares if he's a \"redneck\" or not? If you and Joe don't want people to makes silly stereotypes about Joe and his partner, then you shouldn't make them about others, whether in jest or not. There was nothing any more 'ugly' in JPSarte's comments than in Joe's. \n \n Lighten up.\n\n \n Wow, when did this get so personal toward my partner and I. He doesn't even read this stuff. Ya'all need to take a jump back and get back on topic.",

   "So are you saying you really are a redneck hick, but not a stereotypical one? \n\n Wow, did you peg me. I'm a redneck, all right, born in Philadelphia and raised in the Dixie state known as \"New Jersey\". emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n What you failed to recognized was humor. What you did was sqaush the lighthearted retort with your \"factual\" answers proving to everyone you are completely devoid of a sence of humor. \n Insted of playing along and having a laugh you simply got ugly.\n\n I didn't \"get ugly\" with you or joe. I replied to you with a factual answer and to joe with sarcasm. I will admit that my choice of the second \"censored\" icon lent ambiguity to my intent, however. I certainly didn't \"get ugly\". I found it mildly humorous and ironic since I'm a \"college-educated, professional, city dwelling, Northern Yankee \". :)\n \n\n Someone who actually has a heart and can see you for who you really are. Yes, I call it as I see it. I don't feel the need to puff myself up when debating or discussing. \n\n Oh, I see. So your habit of making disparaging remarks to people is your idea of having a heart? Interesting. And I see why you don't \"puff yourself up while debating\". You don't have to. You're too busy tearing others down. :p \n \n\n Ah, so now you're an editor or an English teacher? You prove my point. Thank you.\n\n Actually, I did it to disprove your comment below \n \n\n You really do have a major deficit in the language department. I'd check out a local community college for their ESL courses, if I were you. Amazing how you can boast your supposedly intellegent children but you are no where near as articulate when showing if you have any of your own.\n\n \n And in case you're sarcasm-impaired, it was meant to be sarcastic......as was this sentence. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Pumpkin, your responce was clearly your way of firing back when you felt trapped. Your ending emoticons gave that away. Try censoring yourself if you don't want to be caught in your own lies. \n\n \n Watermellon, my response (and yes, it's an \"s\" in responSe) surely wasn't because I felt trapped. It was sarcastic, but not meant to show anger. The real icon that I would have liked to use doesn't exist in this Smile Set, so I picked an ambiguous one in its place. I've debated with joe before. I don't believe that either of us harbors any hatred of the other, but I can only speak for my feelings and guess about his.\n \n\n You were \"got\" and insted of showing anyone you might posess the ability to laugh at yourself you attacked with your comment about joe's \"soulmate.\" \n\n Huh?\n \n\n Your jibe was at joe's homosexuality and you attempted to highlight a stereotype of this. The only way your comment could have been warrented would be if in fact you actually are a redneck hick.\n\n \n Ah, finally you see the irony in my response to joe!!! Maybe there's hope for you, yet........but do get yourself a good spellchecker for the future. Your poor spelling is distracting.\n Hugs and kisses,\n JP emoticon_xlove",

   "I am with Justine on this one. There is nothing Jovial about you. I was only making a joke, you could have played along and had a laugh but instead you made some comment I didn't even get about my soulmate, who couldn't recover furniture if his life depended on it.\n\n \n I replied to your comment in kind. I'm sorry if you didn't find my sarcasm funny. I did. I bet others did as well. :) \n \n\n Lighten up, no one thinks you are a hick. You have to admit that having 7 cars in the driveway is sorta of the stereotypical thing. It was worth a chuckle, not the attack.\n\n \n After going back to my post to you, I saw that my choice to add the \"censored\" icon may have given the wrong impression of my intent. As I wrote above, I did find your comment mildly humorous and ironic, given that I'm a diehard Yankee that'd NEVER be confused for a Southerner in person. (I have a combination Philly-NYC accent and talk fast, hardly a stereotypical \"good ole boy\" style.) :) \n I guess that, in the future, I shouldn't attempt to use humorous irony in response to another's humorous irony. \n As for my dilemma with cars, it can be quite funny at times. Visualize having to move 6 cars so that we can back a car trailer up to the garage to load the seventh. The Keystone Cops have nothing on us. LOL",

   "But what's even more ironic is that the ones who oppose evangelical religious groups have more in common with the people that the early settlers were getting away from. While homosexuality wasn't a politicized issue back then, the early settlers left and came here to escape intolerance of their views. Now Christians are having to deal with the same thing as pro-gay groups have such intolerance about religious views about homosexuality.\n \n If you consider gay people maving legal marriage to be \"progress\", then I guess we are lagging behind that. But I'm not convinced that it's progress, and neither is most of America according to the 2004 election.\n\n \n Sorry, but the only ones with the intolerance around here are the Christian groups that refuse to tolerate homosexuals like myself.\n \n And if you don't think gay people allowing to be legally married is PROGRESS, then I think that is extremely sad, Jyoshu.",

   " It's a logical extension of so-called \"marriage freedom\" to remove the final obstacle, isn't it. NAMBLA would be so proud of you if you did. :)\n\n No, your extension is quite ILLOGICAL. Or, if you truly think it is logical, it can easily be said that the allowing of heterosexual marriage will lead to straight men having sex with and marrying seven year old girls. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n\n Promoting heterosexual marriage is NOW a perversion? Wow, you Canadians really have gone off the deep end.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n No, but promoting the denial of equality in marriage to homosexuals like myself IS a perversion.",
