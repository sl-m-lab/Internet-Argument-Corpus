   "Of course the appeasers will never admit the obvious. The terrorists are getting killed off and eventually we will win this war on terror, just as Bush said we would.\n ==================== \n \n May 05, 2005, 8:07 a.m.\n Picture Perfect\n The war on terrorism is looking good.\n \n The thing I like best about terrorist-takedown reportage is the before and after shot. Take for example the latest, of al Qaeda honcho Abu Farraj al-Libbi. In his wanted posters, he looks very urbane and sophisticated. In the after shot, not so inspiring. And I am not getting on his case about the vitiligo, the skin disease that gives him that mottled look. He could not help that. Rather it is the classic mug-shot mien. Hair mussed, clothes rumpled, downcast - nothing remotely heroic about it. It looks a bit like he is wearing mascara, and one report that indicated he was hiding his movements by dressing in a full chador though another attributed this disguise to the Pakistani security forces who were tracking him. Maybe they were all in drag. Imagine the chase.\n \n My point is not simply to gloat; the pictures send useful messages. To those contemplating a livelihood in the exciting field of terrorism, the connotation is that it's not all romance, bombing embassies by day and carousing at Cairo discos by night. Sometimes it is bailing off a motorcycle in a Pakistani graveyard under fire, taking refuge in a nearby house and being tear-gassed into submission. Not exactly an auspicious end to Abu Farraj's career.\n \n The message to the rest of us is that we are winning. We're winning well. That stated, al Qaeda remains a threat because, despite all the hardships they face, many of these people refuse to give up. Most of them are ideologically motivated and committed sociopaths. They have a need to kill. Our civilization and their organization cannot coexist in this world - they will be the first to admit it. So the Coalition is forced to wage war on them, to track them down, capture, or kill them, one by one. It takes time, but gradually the job is getting done.\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.nationalreview.com/robbins/robbins200505050807.asp",

We cannot send Condi out to negotiate with the President of \"Terror\". Cease Fires will never happen. This whole war on terror is an effort to combat the results of terror instead of having a few resources looking into the reason WHY there are terrorists----It's perpetual war----It's Cold War-Lite.\n \n Why did those young men from Saudi fly planes into our buildings Mr. Mule? Do you remember their main reason? I keep askiing about those 10 & 11 year old Iraqi children affected by this war now----10 years from now. How will they extract their revenge for the mudering (in their perception, the one that counts) of their Parents and Siblings?\n \n I notice that you like to bring other people's words up for debate, and then usually make some kind of inflammatory remark referring to those who disagree with you are somehow \"appeasers\" or even worse, collaboraters. How you percieve disenfranchised Arab people and how you view me is of no concern to anyone but yourself. Instead of you defining them and me, pehaps you should examine how they VIEW US. Then, take a little time looking at historical precident as it concerns the success rate of Counterinsurgencies (Iraq), even though technically, the War in Iraq is not the War on Terror. Time, plus casualties, combined with money spent, usually dooms counterinsurgencies (See Iraq about 100 years ago in British History). They got Home court and they decide when and where we are going to play.\n \n I realize that I did not just cut and paste an article like you do so skillfully, and that I once again used my own words, AND that my opinion differs from yours.

It appears as if you are the type of individual who goes in search of someone else's words that speak the words you wish you could say.

Likewise we can't accurately determine how much funding the terrorists are getting. We do know that the only attack they've been able to mount on the western world since 9/11 was in Madrid, and it was successful in getting the Spanish to cut and run. Otherwise, the only terror attacks they have mounted have been suicide cases - and they must be running low on fools, because the attacks in Iraq are increasingly from remotely detonated car bombs where the truck driver apparently didn't know what was in his cargo.

They don't hold up to scrutany. \n\n actually i like the comparison to vietnam \n \nFor all the claims of popular support for the Vietcong insurgency, far more South Vietnamese peasants fought on the side of Saigon than on the side of Hanoi. The Vietcong were basically defeated by the beginning of 1972, which is why the North Vietnamese launched a huge conventional offensive at the end of March that year. During the Easter Offensive of 1972 - at the time the biggest campaign of the war - the South Vietnamese Army was able to hold onto every one of the 44 provincial capitals except Quang Tri, which it regained a few months later. The South Vietnamese relied on American air support during that offensive.\n \n If the United States had provided that level of support in 1975, when South Vietnam collapsed in the face of another North Vietnamese offensive, the outcome might have been at least the same as in 1972. But intense lobbying of Congress by the antiwar movement, especially in the context of the Watergate scandal, helped to drive cutbacks of American aid in 1974. Combined with the impact of the world oil crisis and inflation of 1973-74, the results were devastating for the south. As the triumphant North Vietnamese commander, Gen. Van Tien Dung, wrote later, President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam was forced to fight \"a poor man's war.\"\n\n NYT link a realization and acceptance of the truth 30 years late..\n or how about this one?\n \n\"Two wrongs don't make a right.\" You hear these two phrases again and again in about every bull session on the shop. \"Two wrongs don't make a right\"...\n \n The troops returning home are worried. \"We've lost the peace,\" men tell you. \"We can't make it stick.\"...\n \n Friend and foe alike, look you accusingly in the face and tell you how bitterly they are disappointed in you as an American. ...\n \n Never has American prestige in Europe been lower. ... \n \n \"Have you no statesmen in America?\"... \n \n I talked to some correspondents from the French newspapers. They were polite but skeptical. They were willing enough to take part in a highly publicized act of vengeance against the enemy, but when you talked about the usefulness of writing a prohibition of aggressive war into the law of nations they laughed in your face. \n \n ...instead of coming in with a bold plan of relief and reconstruction we came in full of evasions and apologies....\n \n We have swept away [the dictatorship], but a great many Europeans feel that the cure has been worse than the disease. ... \n \n The taste of victory had gone sour in the mouth of every thoughtful American I met. ...\n \n The time has come, for our own future security, to give the best we have to the world instead of the worst. So far as Europe is concerned, American leadership up to now has been obsessed with a fear of our own virtues. ...\n\n January 7, 1946. 60 years later the doom sayers still recite the same mantra. \n \n \nLame. They were also the only country we were running a legally debatable no fly zone over. Nothing happening during that which speaks to our invading at all.

Truth is we are bogged down in Iraq and have limited ability do all we could. We are in fact killing Iraqis, people who weren't a problem before we went in. It is really illogical to call this a positive.\n\n Zarqawi is on the lam, also berating the arabs in general and iraqi in particular for not supporting him in Falluja.\n \n i consider going after the terrorists themselves secondary to politically transforming the region.\n yes strike them down another will rise, better let them run around powerless as you cut the legs from their support.\n actually iraqi have killed more iraqi in the past 2 years than we have. we do help things along but we should have done more. but what is important is that despite repeated bombing of police and military recruits stations, many more are lining up the next day for a chance to join up. now that's interesting.\n \n terrorism in Iraq \n Al Qaeda",

It is unfortunate that Roosevelt died, because I believe Vietnamese History would be very different.

Even more are unaware that his Declaration was almost word for word the same as ours. The Viet Minh, which later became the Veit Cong (V.C.), were named after Ho, and they were our allies in WWII, in which they tied up the Japanese with a Guerilla War and tactics The American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) trained the Vietn Minh in.\n \n Unfortunately, Truman was out of the Loop as it concerned FDR's plans for Vietnam. FDR was the Alpha Male, and after he died, it is said that Churchill had an enormous amount of influence in giving Vietnam back to the French. Which is why LTC A. Peter Dewey became the first American Casualty in Vietnam on September 26, 1945, only 24 Days after VJ-Day. Truman took the weapons out of the hands of the Viet Minh, and armed the Japanese POW's, turning them into the Police Force until the French could return in strength. LTC Dewey paid for that decision with his life, and it guaranteed 30-more years of Hostility. May 15, 1975---- PFC Gary L. Hall, Lance Corporal Joseph Hardgrove, and Pvt Danny Marshall, all U.S. Marines in a machine gun team, are mistakenly left behind at Ko Tang, Cambodia----they are the last Americans to die for the War in South East Asia----30-years and 58,000 lives later.\n \n History is a great teacher.

   "Not a bad idea, if we could get reliable data. We have no idea what the terrorist recruitment rate is, but we do know that there seems to be no shortage of recruits for the Iraqi forces in spite of the terrible casualties they've taken at the hands of the terrorists.\n\n \n Well, this may be outdated, but Fox says\n \n Recruitment in Pakistan of potential terrorists appears to be on the rise. Militant leaders freed from house arrest have returned to the mosques to rally the faithful against the United States \n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,82790,00.html\n \n \n\n Likewise we can't accurately determine how much funding the terrorists are getting.\n\n \n Due to the fact that the system of money transfers is virtually untraceable yes, however we can estimate considering the specific accounts that the UN and US tried to freeze but eventually unfroze. Something like 80+% of the accounts were unforzen. That money could easily be in the hands of terrorists. Not to mention that Islamic Charities, many based out of Saudi Arabia are known for supplying terrorists with money and the amount of cash flowing through them hasn't decreased. One has to wonder. I highly doubt that they are finding a hard time getting capital. \n \n \nWe do know that the only attack they've been able to mount on the western world since 9/11 was in Madrid, and it was successful in getting the Spanish to cut and run.\n\n \n That plan probably took pretty long to plan. 9/11 took something like 5 years. \n Before 9/11 we had the initial attack and the 2000 attempted new years's bombings. Planning large scale attacks takes time. Especially for a network that lacks the communication abilities of modern military networks. \n \n \n\n Otherwise, the only terror attacks they have mounted have been suicide cases - and they must be running low on fools, because the attacks in Iraq are increasingly from remotely detonated car bombs where the truck driver apparently didn't know what was in his cargo.\n\n \n Um, not really. In the last week there have been two major suicide attacks, both killing in the high 20s. carbombs don't work very well anymore as many of the soft targets have barriers aganist such. A suicide bomber works very well in sneaking in and bombing a line of compact civilians. \n \n \nAttacks are down, and kill tens instead of hundreds or thousands.\n\n \n The number of attacks are down, yes, but the amount they kill is alot higher. The attacks previously counted were minor skimishes that maybe injured one soldier. The attacks that are counted now are the ones that occured in Kurdish terrortory that killed 60 people and injured 125. The attacks in number are down, but the kills per attack are much, much, much higher. Besides, the only real major attack Iraq suffered in the hundreds was the bombing on the Najraf (sp?) mosque service. \n \n \n\n Based on the measurements you suggest, and that we can make, we are winning. Big time.\n\n \n Right. If you're in denial.",

   "incorrect. the Viet Minh was a coalition of nationalists who fought initially against the french, then the japanese, then again the french. their political ideology were diversed, some were republicans and others were communists. the only thing that unified them was getting the foreigners out. during this fight 2 things occurred after ww2. firstly the communist gained strength due to materiel and financial support from the communists of the soviets and the chinese. secondly the non-communist viet minh realized the falsehood and repugnance of the communist ideology (total contradiction to the traditions of vietnam). the split became actualized once the french left. the republicans appealed to their former enemy the french as well as the americans, thus the north south split. during this period hundreds of thousands northvietnamese emigrated south to escape the communist north.\n the viet congs were not direct descendent of the vietminhs. and the viet congs were not south vietnamese either. the viet congs were infiltrators of north vietnamese sent into south vietname by the communists to terrorize the south.\n \n \n insurgencies were defeated in vietnam. you do not know your history.\n \n\n \n fracas,\n \n If you want to get technical, Ho was a Nationalist first. Exactly what part of my post is incorrect besides your claim we defeated the insurgency in Vietnam? It has been suggested by many Military Historians that we defeated the Viet Cong during TET, 1968----we just did not know it. I believe as long as there were peasants in Vietnam and an American presence, there was going to be Veit Cong. If you read my response in it's entirety instead of cherry picking, perhaps you would have noted that I made mention of Vietnam's history with other occupiers. You know, that whole 4000 years of history thing---you know, throwing them (occupiers) out? Are you suggesting we did not ally ourself with Ho Chi Minh during WWII? Ever hear of the Deerpath Mission? Did I suggest that the Viet Minh were not trying to get rid of the French prior to WWII? I was not commenting on the insurgency there prior to WWII.\n \n I think it is quite Naive for you to believe that the Viet Minh did not morph into the Viet Cong, seeing that almost every Military Historian alive would probably disagree with you. To believe there would not have been some form of Civil War post WWII is also naive and I did not suggest that. FDR had a different vision for South East Asia. It is not a BIG GIANT secret that Ho had communications with FDR, and through FDR's representatives he struck up the same kind of dealy with Ho, that McKinnley made with Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippines prior to the Spanish American War. We reneged on both promises. I did a Term Paper on the similarities of the two wars in college---if it matters, I got an 'A'.\n \n And Finally, we beat the insurgency in Vietnam? Really? I am just curious, when was that? I mean, I know we won damn near every battle, but the insurgent's plans were never intended to beat us with military superiority----because, for insurgents, that is NEVER the goal. It's their Home Court, they just want to run out the clock. I guess all the European Nations that occupied Africa and The Middle & Near East during the great era of Imperialism still maintain power in those regions huh? I know of 2-successful Counterinsurgencies that paid off and worked over a period of time:\n 1. The American Indian's near extinction.\n 2. And the Brutality utilized in maintaining control over the Philppines Post Spanish American War during the Philippino Insurgency (1898-1902).\n \n I do not see the U.S. becoming this efficient in battling the insurgents, because it would cost too many civilians their lives. Only way to beat an insurgent is to be more brutal than the insurgent----you can worry about people's feelings and rights after you squash the enemy.\n \n I can assure you fracas, If I am not familiar with a subject, I will not comment on it. There is absolutely no doubt that you are also educated in Vietnamese History, and nothing in your first paragraph stands out as being wrong----except for the fact you stated I was \"Incorrect\". Your being right about what happened to the country secondary to the rearming of the Japanese and the returning Power Base of French does not take any truth away from the facts as I described them. However, I stand by my statement that if FDR had lived long enough, South East Asia would have turned out very, very different.\n \n We have different opinions on this subject, but I am sure you must agree that we are both aware of complexities that existed in Vietnam long before we ever got involved. And to find out what those complexities are, we have had to do some research and instruction on our own, because no one is teaching this stuff in school anylonger. I understand your reasoning as it relates to Vietnam, we just do not agree----that does not make either of us incorrect, for most of our words are based on the facts as we know them and our world view, experiences, and upbringing have an effect on how we develope our opinions and express them. I do not agree with your opinion, but appreciate the knowledge displayed in your argument---It is my sincere hope that any debate we have can be accomplished without contention or confrontation.",

   "REMF\n \n you speak as if it was the americans fighting in vietnam against vietnamese. the rest of your post really only speak from the american experience. please read what the vietnamese and vietnamese historians write as well.\n \n the history of the vietnam war extends beyond that of the american involvement, as you suggested. but it is not as simplistic as you suggest to be a case of fighting against foreigners. lets give the vietnamese some credits for using their noggins beyond the us vs them mentality. this was not the case. as my previous post suggested, the vietminhs were nationalists first and foremost. yes they fought the french then the japs then the french again. but they were divided in how the country should be ran after victory. the viets were smart enough to know it wasn't an viets vs foreigner war. it was about the new order of godless and famililess communism anathema to 4000 years of culture versus its preservation. this was what the vietnam war was really about. even a viets vs foreigner war was about preservation of 4000 years of culture.\n and thus there was a huge split leading to dissolution of the vietminhs with the communist left in power. the vietcongs are not descendent of the vietminhs because the vietcongs did not exist until the north south split. that the vietcongs were sent into the south from the north also speaks they were irregular troops whose primary mission were not to fight the americans or even the south vietnamese army; they were sent to destabilize the countryside by terrorizing the peasants. thus to suggest that the vietcongs were descendant of the natiuonalist vietminhs would be to suggest that they fought for the people; this was never the case as they fought for the ideology of communism, willing to kill all who opposed, family, friends and strangers.\n and the peasants were largely supportive of the republic. it is a myth that the vietnamese peasants gave rise to the vietcongs. southern military targets were only targets of opportunity for the vietcongs. but by early 1970s the north realized that the vietcongs had failed, not because of battlefield defeats like at tet, but because the southern vietnamese continued to largely support the republic, in the city as well as in the country. they ceased to be either a political or a military force. sure they may have continued to operate, but as nuissance distraction rather than a problem to be reckoned with.\n regarding the nature of the vietcongs i do believe you are incorrect. it is important to understand that they are neither nationalists nor soutvietnamese peasants as once these two concepts are accepted, perspective of the war will change dramatically.\n \n as regard to concern for civilian deaths, i can assure you that neither the north vietnamese care one iota, nor the south vietnamese gave it the same level of concerns as the americans did. that is because both understand that the best wars are the shortest ones, that wars only end when one side loses the will to fight - usually from the brutality involved, and for the south one additional, that defeat would mean even more civilian deaths. this last part was certainly born true when 500,000 civilians died between 1975 and 1987 in re-education camps, another estimated 500,000 at sea in boat crossings, and countless brutalized, beaten, tortured, and raped, unable to escape. i find it tragically shortsighted of americans to be concerned about civilian deaths during war and no to little concern about what happen without victory, in a oppressive peace of defeat. is it really better to live under oppression than to die in the fight for liberty? i can assure you the vietnamese thought i was worth the fight. just as americans did in 1776. too bad in 1975 it was the americans that chose defeat.\n \n and i've said nothing about FDR.\n \n and yes we can disagree without being confrontational or contentious.\n try this mental exercise. accept that the vietcongs were communist infiltrators and not southvietnamese peasants, then ask whether we should support an allied nation being invaded by a neighboring state.",

And that with FDR still in the White House, the United States would never have pledged opposition to the advance of communism anywhere in the post-war world ?\n\n \n I Believe that if FDR had lived, you would have seen the first Multi-National Peace Keeping Force in Vietnam. I believe that in my Heart. It is a well known fact, and a number one complaint of Harry Truman that he was kept way out of the loop as it concerned the plans FDR had for the post war world. It is my complete and total understanding that Independence was the price for Viet Minh support against the Japanese in WWII. We armed and trained the Viet Minh under the name of \"The Deerpath Mission\", supervised by the American OSS. To this day LTC Dewey's death is attributed to a conflict concerning a \"POW Issue\" (1945)----what they do not tell you; they were American Advisors who became POW's because of the snub of de-arming the Viet Minh, and re-arming the Japanese.\n \n fracas, , THE V-I-E-T M-I-N-H were literally named after Ho Chi Minh. Uncle Ho weilded some major power in the day, which was why he was the OSS's Contact and Negotiator. And Alan, I believe it is because of what FDR gave away in Eastern Europe that I believe he would have done anything to make Vietnam a free Nation under no Foreign Rule with Uncle Ho at the Helm. I believe that Ho's Declaration of Independence, which was verbatum with ours, proved he was a Nationalist first, who was molding his sovereign nation after ours, and anyone who has studied young Ho knows he wanted independence first, Lord knows, he did not learn French Military Methods while he was being schooled in France, but he never expressed interest in communism until it became a deal with the Devil---if things had worked out like they were planned, it could have been a very different place. Uncle Ho believed dealing with the Communists was his only choice----it was that, or letting The French & Americans install a Puppet government that violated everything that had been agreed to. Same as Emilio Aginaldo. Looking at Vietnam now, they sure do look like Communist-Lite to me.\n \n This is not my theory, nor am I the only person to ever bring this subject up. It is in the Time Life Series of Books and Videos on Viet Nam. It was in PBS's famous series on the Vietnam War, and if I remember correctly, it is mentioned at the begining of the Oscar winning Documentary \"Hearts and Minds\". From our OSS being there in the 1940's to the CAT PIlots and Air America Pilots of 1950's and 60's, to the Tonkin Gulf, to the TET Offensive, all the way to \"Peace With Honor\", five administrations lied to the American People for their own good. We should have learned something from that.\n \n And finally, fracas----my man (or woman), I would say you are just disagreeing with me to disagree with me, but I agree with your synopsis in your last post and think we are dealing in semantics. It has to be semantics, because you are kind of like scolding me for agreeing with you. Those who followed Ho, stayed with Ho, they became the Viet Cong.\n \n I agree, if we wanted to win in Vietnam we should have been allowed to fight the war in the proper way so as to win it. I agree, we are too concerned over casualties----if we are just, it all works out in the end. I think the concern over Human Rights and Civilian casualties in Iraq is a self induced dog leash. If the Administration had not used Human Right's as an Excuse du Jour after the WMD fiasco, matbe we could have kicked some butt----but they did not send enough troops in to keep the Peace, so-----here we are. Vietnam minus the Super Power, minus the Jungle, but, plus Millions of Disenfranchised Arabs in the region. And it's their Home Turf. \n \n Time is on their side not ours----we have never proven we were serious about winning, we are there because of our prior stupidity, we can't tell who our friend or enemy is, and there is no real end in sight.

   "Not about parties. It is about logic and reason. And that is what I ask of you. Not nonsense. I have given you the numbers. I ask Farcas exactly what are we winning. The facts are the facts. No matter happens in Iraq, good, bad, indifferent, the problem of terrorism remains. So, when we run down the list of reasons to go into Iraq, nothing holds.

This side also believes in the culture of death and that the mere death of innocents is perfectly all right as it is interests of the greater good.

The scale of combat is not the same; obviously, but the goals are the same and it will have to be a fight to the finish. And we are winning. It may not be apparent to the left and they have a vested interest in seeing the U.S. defeated and humiliated because in their eyes the U.S. is the greater evil in the world. They believe in such poppycock as it is possible to negotiate with terrorists and we should look to the \"root causes\" rather than having as our goal the unconditional surrender and defeat of the terrorist network led by bin Laden.

   "This is also the typical argument of the left that the war on terror cannot be compared to WWII. All wars can be compared with one another and the lessons learned can be applied to all other wars. We are in a clash of civilizations; one of which believes that it is their moral duty to smash the other evil civilization. This side also believes in the culture of death and that the mere death of innocents is perfectly all right as it is interests of the greater good. If one compares the ideas and ideology of the Nazis of WWII and the Islamofacists of today one will find them quite similar. The scale of combat is not the same; obviously, but the goals are the same and it will have to be a fight to the finish. And we are winning. It may not be apparent to the left and they have a vested interest in seeing the U.S. defeated and humiliated because in their eyes the U.S. is the greater evil in the world. They believe in such poppycock as it is possible to negotiate with terrorists and we should look to the \"root causes\" rather than having as our goal the unconditional surrender and defeat of the terrorist network led by bin Laden. This is the core of Bush's war on terror. It was long overdue. We have made mistakes, as we did in WWII, but we have learned and are learning from our mistakes. It has been said that WWII was a series of disasters leading to final victory. By this yardstick, Bush's war on terror has been a resounding success.\n\n \n \n No they can't, and you don't even have the oppositions argument down right.\n \n Let me help you out. Terrorist are individuals. They carry no state flag, wear no uniform, pledge no allegence to any nation. They fight for other reasons.\n \n Iraq did not attack us. At the time the United States invaded them, they were allowing inspectors and allowing the process to move forward. America decided to invade another nation without just cause. \n \n If Iraq had attacked us. If we were fighting one nation versus another, you might have a case. But your argument, like Bush's, is other nonsense. You can't defeat the foe we face in this manner. But they do apprecieate the help with recuritment.

It is a well known fact, and a number one complaint of Harry Truman that he was kept way out of the loop as it concerned the plans FDR had for the post war world. It is my complete and total understanding that Independence was the price for Viet Minh support against the Japanese in WWII. We armed and trained the Viet Minh under the name of \"The Deerpath Mission\", supervised by the American OSS. To this day LTC Dewey's death is attributed to a conflict concerning a \"POW Issue\" (1945)----what they do not tell you; they were American Advisors who became POW's because of the snub of de-arming the Viet Minh, and re-arming the Japanese.\n \n \n\n \n I would not want to attack you for \"believing in your heart\" - but that doesn't explain much beyond you admitting to a certain sentiment: it doesn't advance an argument.\n \n I still don't know what basis you might have for supposing that American policy for the containment of communism in the post war world, would have been radically different from the one which was actually followed by Truman et al. Would FDR's plans for the world after 1945 have avoided the American confrontation with communism ? Would the Vietnam war which is thought to show America's commitment and resolve in containing communist expansion, never have happened with FDR still at the helm of the United States ? \n \n At the Yalta meeting in early 1945, FDR (who thought he could \"handle\" Uncle Joe) felt he had no choice but to accept Stalin's demands on postwar arrangements for the Far East. It's quite probable that FDR was naive in his appreciation of communist intentions at that time.

Such as stated by the FARC who have successfully waged a war of terrorist in Colombia for decades. \n\n FARC commies in the back woods of Colombia who finance their popular uprising with drugs. been around since the sixties. haven't done much except kill a few every so often. maintain jungle hideouts and bases that are nearly autonomous within Colombia. yet Colombia remains a recognized and functional state despite FARC ongoing existencE woohoo.\n this only strengthen my point that unless an insurgent group can win over the populace, it will lose. FARC has lost. they are a nuissance and who cares commiting acts of terror everyso often for noteriety.\n meanwhile the colombians are making peace with the ELN.\n \n \nAnd you've been refuted.\n\n with the FARC example? lol\n yeah right\n they are a force to be recon with and colombia is a quagmire.\n \n found this after i posted\n \nMay 9, 2005: For the last two years, every six months or so, the military has launched another large operation to clear rebels out of areas they have long occupied. These operations involve up to 40,000 troops, and have been very successful. The military has been reorganized, and received new training. The army, navy and air force cooperate a lot better now, and better trained troops, and new tactics, have contributed to the success. Having been driven away from most of the large cities, the rebels are now fighting to hang on to sanctuaries along the borders, particularly in the northeast (with Venezuela), the northwest (Panama) and the southwest (Ecuador). FARC, the largest rebel group, has lost much popular support, and, aside from a few bloody ambushes, has not seriously resisted the advance of the army and marines. The government troops are better trained and led than the rebel gunmen, and will usually prevail if the rebels try to stand and fight. FARC's priority is keeping its drug operations going, and that takes priority over trying to defeat the military. The drug operations have been more successful in surviving, mainly because the growing, processing and smuggling of drugs can be moved around, and is. The profits from drug production are so high, there is no shortage of new groups willing to replace those taken out of operation by the police or army.\n",

   "This is nonsense. Look at all of the direct attacks on the U.S. and U.S. interests during Clinton's term of office. His response was these pinprick strikes that only emboldened bin Laden as he has himself said and this led at least indirectly to 9/11. How many attacks on U.S. or U.S. interests have occured since 9/11? The proof is in the pudding. \n \n This \"recruitment\" business is also nonsense. One of the goals of the strategic plan to fight terror was to draw in those jihadists into Iraq so we could kill them there rather than to have to dig them out of their mountain hideouts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A leaderless band of witless suicide bombers are not going to be able to pull off another 9/11. We may be tied up in Iraq for the next two decades and it may be very politically unpopular but that is no way, shape or form a failure of the policy. In fact, it is the policy. Fight them there so we don't have to fight them on the streets of America. As one of the most famous and toughest of the Confederate generals (Nathan Bedford Forrest) put it at the end of the Civil War. \"I don't know about you boys, but I'm a going home.\" There will likewise come a time to these jihadists when they will realize they are not winning and have no hope of winning. That may take years or decades but it is the only sensible policy. We could not have just sit back and let the terrorists continue to attack us and responding with a few cruise missiles. \n \n http://www.civilwarhome.com/natbio.htm\n\n \n \n NOt according to the United States. These are our estimates. Sorry if you don't like them. But, the rest of the world agrees with us. Things are worse.",
