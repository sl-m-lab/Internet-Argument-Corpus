   "A while back Easy cited this silly little website from internet apologist Glenn Miller attempting to make historical sense of the problems with the gospels and the census of Quirinius. I had been meaning to write a comprehensive critique for some time and recently got around to starting it. What follows is part 1, dealing with the possibilty of a \"14 year census cycle\" in Judaea and the tributary status of Herod's kingdom more generally.\n \n Miller beings by saying:\n \n \n...with some evidence indicating that he [Quirinius] either was co-ruler with the governor of Syria (the somewhat inept Quintilius Varus) or at least placed in charge of the 14-year census in Palestine...The census was due in 8-7 BC, and Augustus could easily have ordered his trusted Quirinius (fresh from subduing the Pisidian highlanders) to assist in this volatile project.\n\n \n Ignoring for a moment the idea that Quirinius was \"co-ruler with the governor of Syria\" (this will be examined in a later post), it is unclear why Miller supposes there was a \"14-year census in Palestine;\" nothing suggests provincial censuses followed a 14 year cycle in general and indeed, there is strong evidence that when (and if) they occured, it was on an irregular basis. Consider the case of Gaul. Although it is true that Egypt operated under a regular 14 year census cycle, we know that Augustus ordered a census of Gaul in 27 BCE (Dio, Hist. 53.22.5), again 15 years later in 12 BCE (Livy, Per. 138), in 14-15 CE by Germanicus (Tacitus, Ann. 1.31), and again in 61 CE (Tacitus, Ann. 14.46). Clearly, provincial censuses might occur irregularly. \n \n What about Judaea in particular? There is, first of all, absolutely no evidence for a Judaean census at any time from the imposition of Roman hegemony over Palestine in 63 BCE apart from the Quirinian census of 6 CE. Miller might regard this as a species of argumentum ex silentio, but this would be confused; the point is not that there were no other censues but that it would be gratuitous to suppose there were. An ad hoc invocation of an unevidenced census or series of censuses is unecessary to explain the data given that Luke is entirely explicable if understood to place Jesus' birth during the census of 6 CE. This is only a problem for someone like Miller who, with his a priori commitment to the inerrancy and harmonization of the Lucan and Matthean infancy narratives, cannot admit the possibility that one or both gospels is mistaken about the year of Jesus' birth. But one could go further. \n \n Consider the report of Josephus (B.J. 6.9.3): \n \n \nAnd that this city [Jerusalem] could contain so many peope in it is manifest by that number of them which was taken under Cestius, who being desirous of informing Nero of the power of the city, who otherwise was disposed to condemn that nation, entreated the high priests, if the thing were possible, to take the number of their whole multitude. So these high priests, upon the coming of their feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ninth hour till the eleventh, but so that a company not less than ten belong to every sacrifice -- for it is not lawful for them to feast singly by themselves -- any many of us are twenty in company, found the number of sacrifices was two hundred and fifty six thousand give hundred, which, upon the allowance of no more than ten that feast together, amounts to two million even hundred thousand and two hundred persons that were pure and holy...\n\n \n Regardless of the historicity of the passage, it is clear that Josephus assumes neither Nero nor Cestius Gallus, the Syrian proconsul, had access to up-to-date census records of the sort available from Gaul, having to instead rely on a make-shift \"census\" administered by the Jerusalem priesthood. If we were to suppose Judaea underwent a regular 14 year census cycle, this is simply inexplicable. \n \n Why does Miller suppose the Romans would have conducted a census in Judaea prior to its annexation in 6 CE in the first place? He writes:\n \n \nYou are somewhat mistaken here. It is true that Judea did not technically become a Roman province until 6 AD, but the facts prior to that indicate much tighter authority and control than your statement might lead one to believe. Rome did a military conquest before Herod the Great was even born. Pompey attacked Jerusalem and even invaded the Temple. was made a tributary (read: PAID TRIBUTE$) to Rome until Caesar defeated Pompey in Egypt around 48 BC. Herod the Great's dad had aided Caesar in that endeavor and so won the favor of Julius Caesar (and with it a procuratorship of, [sic] plus Roman citizenship and exemption from taxes.) Then in 47 BC, the daddy Herod appointed the son Herod to be governor of Galilee...still completely under Roman rule. He still had to be appointed tetarch by Antony -- still a thrall, eh?!. He was also proclaimed 'king' by the Roman leaders (Octavius and Antony) in 40 bc -- but he had to re-conquer the land from the Parthians, which he did in 37bc. As a 'client kingdom', they were still under the authority of Rome (all of the rulers, for example, were appointed -- including ALL the Herods -- and ratified by Rome.) Actually, when I keep reading your paragraph it sounds like you are calling Luke mistaken in referring to Rome as 'driving the issue' of the census. He is INDEED making that point, but HE is correct in that...The client-kings WERE still subject to Roman enrollment decrees.\n\n \n In a following paragraph, he continues: \n \n \nThe relationship between Augustus and King Herod had its ups and downs, indeed, but the argument that his Roman-granted title of king meant that his nation was exempt from taxes/tribute/census is just flat wrong. As I hinted at up above, it had become a tribute-paying tributary since its conquest by Pompey LONG BEFORE King Herod gets his title (more below on this).\n\n \n Miller's argument seems to be that because Judaea was made a tributary after the conquest of Pompey, it would have continued to pay tribute to Rome after Herod had been appointed king, and this tribute, we suppose, would have provided the impetus for a census. \n \n There is much wrong with this line of argument. While Miller seems to be aware that administration in Jewish Palestine underwent numerous transformations from the arrival of Pompey to the ascention of Herod, he simply assumes, without argument, that each regime would have the same tibutary status. Though it is true that Pompey's initial conquest and grafting of Jewish territory to the new province of Syria involved the imposition of tribute (e.g., Josephus B.J. 1.7.6 and A.J. 14.4.4) of some form and some unknown quantity, it is manifestly not true that this continued under Herod. \n \n Consider the only piece of evidence that might be construed as suggesting Herod paid annual tribute. In his Bella Civilia 5.75, Appian tells us that Antony \n \n \n...set up kings here and there as he pleased, those he approved paying a prescribed &#966;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; [&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951; &#948;&#949; &#960;&#951; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#945;&#962; &#959;&#965;&#962; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#949;&#957; &#949;&#960;&#953; &#966;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;]: in Pontus, Darius, the son of Pharnaces, son of Mithridates; in Idumea and Samaria, Herod; in Pisidia, Amyntas; in part of Cilicia, Polemon, and others in other countries.\n\n \n But it is extremely unlikely that this means Herod paid anual tribute. The key Greek word &#966;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;, highlighted above, need only mean a \"payment\" of a general kind, be it tribute, war indemnity or other sort of transfer from the kingdoms in question to Rome. The latter is the most likely; though none of the other kingdoms above are known to have paid tribute to Rome (see Sullivan, 1990) -- indeed, there is no unambiguous example of a kingdom paying tribute to Rome at all -- there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting Antony was willing to accept payments from allied kingdoms and even sell offices for a sufficent bribe in order to finance his various endevors, including, but not limited to, his war against the Parthians. In his (admittedly polemical) Philippices (5.4.11), Cicero asks \n \n \nWhat are those enormous profits to be endured which the household of Marcus Antonius has swallowed up? He was continually selling forged decrees; ordering the names of kingdoms and states, and grants of exemptions to be engraved on brass, having received bribes for such orders.\n\n \n Similarly Dio (48.24.1): \n \n \nMark Antony came to the mainland of Asia, where he levied contributions upon the cities and sold the positions of authority; some of the districts he visited in person and to others he sent agents.\n\n \n Although Josephus fails to report the payment of any annual tribute to Rome, he does indicate that Herod both promised and paid Antony a considerbale sum of money (A.J. 14.14.4): \n \n \n...[Antony] was very ready to give [Herod] the assistance he desired because he remembered the friendship he had had with Antipater and because Herod offered him money to make him king as he had promised to him before when appointed tetrarch...\n\n \n Once Herod defeated Antigonus and claimed Jerusalem, this arrangement worked out very well for Antony (A.J. 15.1.2): \n \n \n[Herod] spoiled the wealthy men of what they had gotten...amassed a great quantity of siver and gold and gave it all to Antony.\n\n \n All of this suggests that the payments Herod made was not annual tribute but a sort of gift or monetary quid pro quo.

   "Two additional points.\n \n At some point around the year 7 BCE, Herod the Great settled a Babylonian Jew and some 500 horsemen followers in Trachonitis to make trouble for local bandits (A.J. 17.2.1-2). This village, named Bathyra, was granted \"universal freedom from taxes\" (A.J. 17.2.2) under Herod, small taxes under Philip, higher taxes under Agrippa I, and finally \"when the Romans have taken the government into their own hands, they...oppress them entirely with the imposition of taxes.\" (Ibid) Given that the village was entirely free from taxation under Herod and Roman taxation only shows up after Agrippa, when Philip's territory was incorporated into a province, this is still more evidence that Herod was under no obligation to pay the Romans tribute.\n \n When Antony gave Cleopatra the revenues from tribute paying provinces (Plutarch and Dio mention Cyprus, Crete, Cyrene and the costal cities of Phonecia and Palestine that had been part of Syria), it was a relatively straightforward matter. Instead of Rome, the money would go to Egypt. But what about the kingdoms of Lysanias, Herod and Malchus? If they had been paying tribute, we'd expect Antony to simply divert the revenues, but instead, Antony was forced to contrive a pretext for deposing them; for example, he accused Lysanias of being in league with the Parthians, had him killed, and took his territory (A.J. 15.4.1).\n \n Both of these are examples of positive evidence that Herod was not a Roman tributary. In other words, it is not just that the historical record is silent on the sorts of data necessary to harmonize Matt and Luke (though it is also silent). It is that the historical record positively speaks against it.",

   "1) The issue here is not the accuracy of Luke but the accuracy of a harmonization of Matthew and Luke, i.e., a situation in which Quirinius conducted a census of Judaea during the reign of Herod the Great. Luke itself suggests nothing of the sort.\n\n \n Why would expect to be able to harmonize the different Gospels when they did not all present the same information? Mathew, Mark and John obviously didn't think the census was important- or they knew that it had already been explained by Luke, so they did not mention the census. And Luke would have had no reason to fill his narrative with details that the readers in his day and age would have already have known about.\n \n \nI can make perfect sense of Luke without invoking ad hoc speculation about repeat legateships, additional censuses, unattested tributary statuses, or any of the rest of it;\n\n \n From the ASK website for chapter 12 of Martin's book:\n Was Quirinius Governor in 2 B.C.E.?\n There is one question that needs answering. Many translators of the New Testament render Luke 2:1 as though Quirinius were governor of Syria. In no way does Luke state this in his original Greek text, though I used to believe he did. Luke simply said that Quirinius was ruling or administrating this first registration from Syria, not that he was the governor of the province. The Greek word Luke used to show the rulership of Quirinius was hegemoneuontos. It is a present participle which simply means that Quirinius was ruling or administrating his duties from the region of Syria. There is not the slightest indication in Luke's narrative that identifies the specific office being held by Quirinius while he was administrating his official duties.\n In normal Greek usage at the time, the word hegemoneuontos could refer to any type of rulership from that of an exalted President or a military commander on down through various lesser offices to that of the local dogcatcher for the city. The word could very well refer to the fact that Quirinius was a procurator as Justin Martyr attests. Certainly, Quirinius was NOT the resident governor as so many assume. In no way do the words of Luke mean such a thing. Indeed, shortly afterward, Luke 3:1 referred to Pontius Pilate by the exact same word (and in the exact grammatical structure) and we know from a recent monumental discovery that Pontius Pilate was a Praefectus Judaeae, not a senatorial Legatus (Governor) who controlled one of the major provinces of the Empire. The fact is, Luke's administrative description of Quirinius' powers could dovetail nicely with those of a special Procurator of Augustus precisely as Justin Martyr said that Quirinius was. It is wrong to assume that Luke meant that Quirinius was the governor of the province of Syria.\n There is, however, one possibility that could have made Quirinius to be a temporary governor of sorts. Note that Josephus tells us that Saturninus was still governor of Syria in the latter part of spring in 2 B.C.E. 33 But by the following November, Quintilius Varus was then governor and hearing the charges in Jerusalem against Antipater the son of Herod. Josephus tells us specifically that Varus had lately taken over the governorship from Saturninus. 34 This allows for a six month period in which no one knows who was governor of Syria. This was the summer change-over period from one governor to the next. Could it be that Saturninus left Syria in late spring, handed affairs over to Quirinius for the change-over interval, and then Varus took charge in late September or October of 2 B.C.E.? This is possible.\n There was yet no established custom near the time of Augustus for governors to be in their provincial seats of authority at set times of the year. Cicero left his province before May 1st in 58 B.C.E. 35 His brother, however, did not leave Rome to take up his proconsulship until the early part of May. 36 This example shows that sometimes parts of the summer period saw a province without its resident governor. Obviously, a lieutenant would have been in charge in some capacity. In fact, Atkinson shows that it was common practice for some of the summer months not to have provincial governors in residence. 37 Perhaps this is what occurred in the change-over period from Saturninus to Varus. In truth, there was a good reason why both Saturninus and Varus would have wanted to be in Rome for the summer of 2 B.C.E. That year was one of great significance to the citizens of Rome and to those who lived within the Empire. It was the Silver Jubilee of Augustus' accession to total power and the year he was proclaimed the Pater Patriae. This year was looked on as the apex of the Augustan Peace.",

   "Boy, what isn't wrong with Martin's amateurish speculations? I've got stuff to do, so i'll dissect this rubbish more fully later.\n \n \nThere is one question that needs answering. Many translators of the New Testament render Luke 2:1 as though Quirinius were governor of Syria. In no way does Luke state this in his original Greek text, though I used to believe he did. Luke simply said that Quirinius was ruling or administrating this first registration from Syria, not that he was the governor of the province. The Greek word Luke used to show the rulership of Quirinius was hegemoneuontos. It is a present participle which simply means that Quirinius was ruling or administrating his duties from the region of Syria. There is not the slightest indication in Luke's narrative that identifies the specific office being held by Quirinius while he was administrating his official duties.\n In normal Greek usage at the time, the word hegemoneuontos could refer to any type of rulership from that of an exalted President or a military commander on down through various lesser offices to that of the local dogcatcher for the city. The word could very well refer to the fact that Quirinius was a procurator as Justin Martyr attests. Certainly, Quirinius was NOT the resident governor as so many assume. In no way do the words of Luke mean such a thing. Indeed, shortly afterward, Luke 3:1 referred to Pontius Pilate by the exact same word (and in the exact grammatical structure) and we know from a recent monumental discovery that Pontius Pilate was a Praefectus Judaeae, not a senatorial Legatus (Governor) who controlled one of the major provinces of the Empire. The fact is, Luke's administrative description of Quirinius' powers could dovetail nicely with those of a special Procurator of Augustus precisely as Justin Martyr said that Quirinius was. It is wrong to assume that Luke meant that Quirinius was the governor of the province of Syria.\n\n \n This is nice speculation, but it just doesn't work. While it is true that &#951;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#969; need not imply a proconsular legateship, it can't mean anything else here; if Martin knew anything about Roman imperial magistracies, he'd know that a senatoral proconsul could not serve in a position reserved for equestrians. This is why his analogy to Pilate is hollow. Yes, Luke does write that &#951;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#951;&#962; &#953;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#945;&#962;, and it is true that Pilate was a prefect. Yet Pilate was an equestrian and Quirinius a senator.\n \n Further, there is simply no evidence that Quirinius served Syria in any capacity other than proconsular legate. Martin's \"argument\" is simply to (wrongly) assume that because &#951;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#969; can be applied to several offices, Quirinius served in some capacity, evidence or no.\n \n \nThere is, however, one possibility that could have made Quirinius to be a temporary governor of sorts. Note that Josephus tells us that Saturninus was still governor of Syria in the latter part of spring in 2 B.C.E. 33\n\n \n Saturninus exchanged posts with Varus in 6 BCE, not 2. Martin's assertion is impossible; Herod died 37 years after having been named king (A.J. 17.8.1; B.J. 1.33.8), which itself occured during the consulship of Gaius Domithis Calvinus and Gaius Asinius Pollio (A.J. 14.14.5) , i.e., 40 BCE.\n \n Since Herod was still alive when Varus took over (A.J. 17.5.3; they meet together!), Martin would have to imagine some time travel took place.\n \n Typical sloppy apologetics.",

The answer, of course, is nothing. But this doesn't stop Martin, who simply asserts, without a shred of evidence, that \"it is reasonable that all non-citizens in the Empire also gave some kind of recognizable approbation within the same period of time.\" Why is that \"reasonable\"? Moreover, why would he suppose that is true?\n \n Of course, this bit of speculation can't even get off the ground. Mr. Martin seems to know that the year in question, Augustus' 13 consulship with M. Plautius Silvanus, occured in 2 BCE. But as we have already seen, Herod was already toast. Oops.\n \n Martin's chronological gaffs continue when he tries to connect the 2 BCE citizen-vote of Res Gestae 35 to the loyalty oath of A.J. 17.2.4. But this was years prior, at some point between the years 9 and 6 BCE; by 3-2 BCE, Saturninus was long gone.\n \n Even assuming all the above were true, what does Luke's &#945;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#951; have to do with an oath? In Greek, oaths are described with words like &#949;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#969; or &#949;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#969; + &#949;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#962;, or the verb &#959;&#956;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;. Censuses use &#945;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#951;, and shockingly, this is exactly the word Josephus uses for the Quirinian census of 6 CE (A.J. 18.1.1).",

The answer, of course, is nothing.\n\n \n This exact question was addressed in Martin's book. \n \n From Chapter 12:\n \"It should be remembered that back in 27 B.C.E. Augustus was given complete and absolute allegiance by the Senate and people of Rome. Would there not have been a renewal of their loyalty to Augustus in the Jubilee year? If so, we could well have a reference to an Empire-wide registration of loyalty to the emperor. Josephus mentioned that Augustus demanded an oath of allegiance about twelve or fifteen months before the death of Herod. This event would fit nicely with a decree going out from Augustus in 3 B.C.E. that all were to give an oath of allegiance to him at some designated time during the year. Obviously, the recording of oaths (where people ascribed their names) was a type of registration. That is what Luke said the census was. It was an enrollment of people.\"\n \n \"If the oath of loyalty mentioned by Josephus is what brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem (I will quote the text in a moment), then it makes sense why Mary had to accompany Joseph. In a regular census Mary would not have needed to go with Joseph, nor would Joseph have needed to travel so far. Some have suspected that both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David, and were legitimate claimants to the throne of Israel (had such a throne existed). It could easily be seen why Mary, as well as Joseph, was expected to sign the oath of loyalty to Augustus. All 'royal claimants' would have especially been singled out to give the oath of allegiance. This would even have involved Mary. It was possible in Jewish circles for female descendants of David to have the rights of primogeniture and kingship for their offspring (cf. Antiquities, XVIII. 124 and also Acts 16:1-3 where the principle of legal maternal descent is shown).\n \n \"Luke tells us that the reason why both Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem was because he was reckoned as belonging to the house of David. While everyone else went 'into his own city' (Luke 2:3) no doubt in their own local neighborhoods, those of royal Judaic lineage because of political implications had to register in Bethlehem. This requirement would allow Herod to know who all claimants were in Judaea to the royal throne of David. He was anxious to know who all these people were (in order to keep them subjected to thorough non-political functions) so that his own dynasty would survive. This was especially important at this time in history because there was then a great deal of messianic expectation among the Jews. \n \n \"Registering David's descendants in Bethlehem, the city of David, would have been a ploy not only to get all the people to attend for prestige purposes but for Herod to find out who they were. Since Augustus had ordered that an oath of allegiance be given to him, Herod simply included himself and the legitimacy of his kingdom within the same oath. And since females among the Jews could give Davidic heirship to descendants, Herod included the women as well. This would have given him a complete record of all such claimants to the throne.

What Martin is doing here, bud, is simply describing what we know from the Res Gestae; yes indeed, the Senate and the Roman people affirmed their loyalty to Augustus!

Poor Mr. Martin can only connect the two by asserting that he finds it \"reasonable,\" and you, of course, bring nothing new to the table either.\n \n \nContemporary documentary evidence for Martin&#8217;s conclusion- which you say Martin did not give.\n\n \n As i've already explained, Josephus does not mention \"that Augustus demanded an oath of allegiance about twelve or fifteen months before the death of Herod;\" this occured anywhere from 4 to 7 years earlier -- you have not addressed this. Assuming Martin did actually have his chronology right, he gives us no reason to suppose this has anything to do with what we know from Res Gestae 35.\n \n \nThis is linguistic evidence based on the meaning of the Greek words used in Luke&#8217;s Gospel- evidence which you say Martin did not give.\n\n \n Baaahaha! Wait, wait. Martin asserting -- without so much as using a Greek word -- that &#945;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#951; = oath is \"linguistic evidence\"? Jesus man, how stupid are you?\n \n Of course, I have actually dealt with the Greek in a prior post. Have you so much as acknowledged it, let alone addressed it? Of course not!\n \n \nA reasonable conclusion given the overall historical picture- which Martin backs up with contemporary documentary evidence- that you say Martin did not give.\n\n \n Jesus dude, do you suffer from a learning disability? Is English your second language? Let's parse that paragraph line by line, shall we?\n \n \nIf the oath of loyalty mentioned by Josephus is what brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem (I will quote the text in a moment), then it makes sense why Mary had to accompany Joseph. In a regular census Mary would not have needed to go with Joseph, nor would Joseph have needed to travel so far.\n\n \n Do you see any \"contemporary documentary evidence\" here? Nope. Is this \"a reasonable conclusion given the overall historical picture\"? Nope. For, we know a census might involve travel (P. Lond. 904) but that oaths did not (e.g. Lewis & Reinhold 1990, 2.3; a source that Martin actually cites!).\n \n \nSome have suspected that both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David, and were legitimate claimants to the throne of Israel (had such a throne existed).\n\n \n Any sources to be found here? Nope. Is this a reasonable thing to suppose? Nope, and I already explained why (see, again, Luke 1.36). Of course, you haven't responded to this.\n \n \nIt could easily be seen why Mary, as well as Joseph, was expected to sign the oath of loyalty to Augustus. All &#8216;royal claimants&#8217; would have especially been singled out to give the oath of allegiance.\n\n \n All royal claimants would have been especially singled out! The source for this is...not there. And what about the ancient world makes this reasonable? Who knows!\n \n \nThis would even have involved Mary. It was possible in Jewish circles for female descendants of David to have the rights of primogeniture and kingship for their offspring (cf. Antiquities, XVIII. 124 and also Acts 16:1&#8211;3 where the principle of legal maternal descent is shown).\n\n \n Finally, Mr. Martin cites some sources for a single, ancillary claim here at the end. But what does A.J. 18.124=18.5.3 actually say?\n \n \nbut when on the fourth day letters came to him which told him of the death of Tiberius, he made the group take an oath of loyalty to Gaius and also recalled his army, making them all go home and make their winter quarters there, because since the problems in the Empire with Gaius, he didn't have the same authority to make war.\n\n \n And that has...something...to do with the matrilineal principle, or something. How about Acts 16.1-3? That won't help either; again, Martin is simply assuming, without argument, that Tim's circumcision has something to do with the matrilineal principle, and again, that this somehow shows that \"the rights of primogeniture and kingship for their offspring.\" But neither is true.

   "It is not the \"domain of the historian\" to concoct elaborate fantasies based on nothing but their own desire for the gospels to be inerrant.\n \n This is precisely why actual historians do not subscribe to this rubbish.\n \n \n \n The \"part you quoted\" did nothing of the sort, stupid.\n \n \n \n I'm pretty sure I provided detailed evidence showing that the chronology cannot work. You can either address it, or you can admit both you and your inept hero Martin are mistaken.\n \n \n \n Heh. What Martin is doing here, bud, is simply describing what we know from the Res Gestae; yes indeed, the Senate and the Roman people affirmed their loyalty to Augustus! Now why would anyone think this vote by Romans also involved an oath by non-citizens? Poor Mr. Martin can only connect the two by asserting that he finds it \"reasonable,\" and you, of course, bring nothing new to the table either.\n \n \n \n As i've already explained, Josephus does not mention \"that Augustus demanded an oath of allegiance about twelve or fifteen months before the death of Herod;\" this occured anywhere from 4 to 7 years earlier -- you have not addressed this. Assuming Martin did actually have his chronology right, he gives us no reason to suppose this has anything to do with what we know from Res Gestae 35.\n \n \n \n Baaahaha! Wait, wait. Martin asserting -- without so much as using a Greek word -- that &#945;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#951; = oath is \"linguistic evidence\"? Jesus man, how stupid are you?\n \n Of course, I have actually dealt with the Greek in a prior post. Have you so much as acknowledged it, let alone addressed it? Of course not!\n \n \n \n Jesus dude, do you suffer from a learning disability? Is English your second language? Let's parse that paragraph line by line, shall we?\n \n \n \n Do you see any \"contemporary documentary evidence\" here? Nope. Is this \"a reasonable conclusion given the overall historical picture\"? Nope. For, we know a census might involve travel (P. Lond. 904) but that oaths did not (e.g. Lewis & Reinhold 1990, 2.3; a source that Martin actually cites!).\n \n \n \n Any sources to be found here? Nope. Is this a reasonable thing to suppose? Nope, and I already explained why (see, again, Luke 1.36). Of course, you haven't responded to this.\n \n \n \n All royal claimants would have been especially singled out! The source for this is...not there. And what about the ancient world makes this reasonable? Who knows!\n \n \n \n Finally, Mr. Martin cites some sources for a single, ancillary claim here at the end. But what does A.J. 18.124=18.5.3 actually say?\n \n \n \n And that has...something...to do with the matrilineal principle, or something. How about Acts 16.1-3? That won't help either; again, Martin is simply assuming, without argument, that Tim's circumcision has something to do with the matrilineal principle, and again, that this somehow shows that \"the rights of primogeniture and kingship for their offspring.\" But neither is true. The halakhic principle of matrilineal descent is a rabbinic innovation only applicable in cases of mixed marriage. Of course, Jesus lived during the Second Temple period and was born to two Jewish parents.\n \n Please see:\n \n Cohen, Boaz. 1946-7. \"Some Remarks on the Law of Persons in Jewish and Roman Jurisprudence,\" Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 6: 1-37.\n \n Cohen, Shaye. 1985. \"The Origins of the Matrilineal Principle in Rabbinic Law,\" Association for Jewish Studies Review 10: 19-53.\n \n Cohen, Shaye. \"Was Timothy Jewish (Acts 16.1-3)?

   "Actually, there is more evidence going by the bible that Mary was a Levite, not from the line of David. \n\n \n Documentation? What parts of the Bible are you talking about?\n \n \nAs for the 'oath' .. well, you did not answer the response .. it was for CITIZENS, not for non-citizens. \n\n \n A loyalty oath limited to Roman citizens, rather than the inhabitants of the Roman Empire, would have been useless. And Martin did address this very issue.\n \n From chapter 12 of his book:\n \n \n\n \n There is yet another point. The Armenian historian Moses of Khorene said that the native sources he had available showed that in the second year of Abgar, king of Armenia in 3 B.C.E., the census mentioned by Luke brought Roman agents \"to Armenia, bringing the image of Augustus Caesar, which they set up in every temple.\" 17 It is implied that people had to go to the temples to register for the census. This information is very similar to that engraved on the Paphlagonian inscription (also referring to 3 B.C.), that recorded the \"oath\" given to Augustus. The same oath was sworn by all the people in the land at the altars of Augustus in the temples of Augustus in the various districts. The similarity of language is so striking (and since the year is exactly the same), it may mean that we have Armenian history showing that the registration mentioned by Luke did indeed occur in the year 3 B.C.E.\n The fact that the census of Luke was actually an Empire-wide oath to Augustus was recognized by Orosius, who lived in the 5th century. He must have had early sources for his evidence. He wrote,\n \"[Augustus] ordered that a census be taken of each province everywhere and that all men be enrolled. ... This is the earliest and most famous public acknowledgment which marked Caesar as the first of all men and the Romans as lords of the world, a published list of all men entered individually .... This first and greatest census was taken, since in this one name of Caesar all the peoples of the great nations took oath, and at the same time, through the participation in the census, were made apart of one society\" 18\n \u0095 underlining mine\n Orosius also identified the year for this enrollment and oath as being 3 B.C.E. He said the oath was taken to enroll Augustus \"as the first of all men\" &#8213; an apt description of the bestowal of the Pater Patriae in his Silver Jubilee year and when the priestly celebrations for the 750th anniversary of Rome took place. The fact that Orosius equaled the census with an oath of allegiance to Augustus may well mean that he had historical records that substantiated it.\n \n\n \n \nAs for being \"Davidic', that line goes through the biological father, and since the gospels have Mary has a virgin, he has no biological father, and therefore is not of the line of David.\n\n \n Joseph was descended from King Jeconiah, but Jeconiah was so wicked that God declared in Jeremiah 22:24-30 that none of Jeconiah's descendants would ever sit on David's throne. Thus, if Jesus is Joseph's biological son, He would have been disinherited. So Jesus' legal claim to the throne of David comes from His mother's human ancestry.",
