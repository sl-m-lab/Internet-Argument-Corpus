Carson gathered reporters around him to spread the myth of racial slurs being hurled &#8220;fifteen times&#8221; he painted the protesters not just as racists, but as a terrorist threat. We know this, because Kerry Picket of the Washington Times recorded Rep. Carson as he explained it all to eager reporters.\n \n KERRY PICKET (Wash. Times): Do you think the people outside are generally dangerous or no?\n REP. CARSON: Oh absolutely. I worked in homeland security. I&#8217;m from intelligence, and I&#8217;ll tell you, one of the largest threats to our internal security&#8230;I mean terrorism has an Islamic face, but it really comes from racial supremacist groups.

The Democrat Political Enemies Terrorist Wish List! :lol: \n \n  Bloomberg: Deny Second Amendment to People on Terror Watch List \n In September 2007, the Inspector General of the Justice Department reported that the Terrorist Screening Center &#8212; the FBI-administered organization that consolidates terrorist watch list information &#8212; had over 700,000 names in its database. The list was growing by an average of over 20,000 records per month, according to the ACLU. It currently stands at nearly a million and a half entries.\n \n The provisions of Bloomberg&#8217;s proposed legislation are aimed squarely at gun shows. &#8220;The Bloomberg bill would give the U.S. attorney general unlimited power to impose fees and regulations on gun show operators,&#8221; writes David Kopel for Denver Post. &#8220;An anti-gun attorney general could make the fees so exorbitant that no one could operate a gun show. Extremely complex and time-consuming registration forms that would have to be filled out every week could also drive gun shows out of business.&#8221;\n \n In May 2009, the Inspector General of the Justice Department found that thousands of names were placed on the terror list without predicate. As an example of the sort of &#8220;terrorists&#8221; included on the list, consider the case of Michael Winston Hicks, an 8 year old Club Scout from Clifton, New Jersey. Hicks is considered a terrorist by the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n What is that Pesky word in the Constitution&#8217;s Bill of Rights again? Oh Yeah, now I remember.

There really has not been a lot of information revealed about it. Who is on it? Why? Who puts one on it? How does one get his or her name placed on it? How does one get off it? Can a government official place on it the names of men and women considered unfriendly to or unsupportive of the government official? Can a journalist or anyone considered unfriendly to or unsupportive of a government official or policy be placed on it? Can this happen without the subject's knowledge?\n \n Specifically, could anyone who supports the individual Second Amendment civil right to keep and bear arms be placed on it? Could one who is completing his or her military service, considered suspect last year in a Department of Homeland Security assessment document, be placed on it? Could one who supports, or opposes, any legislative program be placed on it?\n\n All of this could be done to us, loosing our Inalienable Constitutionally recognized as protected rights, without a court trial or hearing our side in any way. Boom! Magically, and without any oversight, you are on the list! No one knows why, you are just on it. Just like the deceased Senator from Massachusetts, Edward Kennedy found himself on it! \n \n America! Does this sound fair? Are you OK with this?

Did the 8 year old boy scout or Senator Kennedy have any idea they were on this list? Question 2. Did they have due process? emoticon_smile\n \n All your political enemies have to accomplish is to get your name added to the Terrorist Watch list. So if you go to Washington and protest the Outrageous spending of your government, That YOU, not them, have to pay back (Tea Party) You are Now a Terrorist! If you are a returning Veteran, (Homeland Security memo) You Are Now A Terrorist! Without any court proceedings, convecting you of anything. Your Rights are gone! Period! \n \n So go ahead and think you have a first Amendment Right to petition your government for the redress of grievances. Oooops You are Now a Terrorist, You just lost your 2nd Amendment rights! And the First Amendment as well, because of Governmental Bullying! Oh You post on this board. We don't like what you say. You Are A Terrorist. \n \n Just think of the Next Republican Administration, and think of someone draconian, Someone you HATE, for the list of possible horrors this bill would have on Democrats! So lets see, if you have ANY opposition to the government, In Any Way, YOU ARE A TERRORIST! emoticon_smile\n \n How do you like that Constitution now? What Rights! We are the Government. YOU'RE TERRORIST! You haven't got any! You are on the list! Don't like that. Now you are on the list twice! What? Go ahead! Say something else!\n\n Perhaps the terrorist watch list could be improved. Opposition to depriving people of firearms on the list is caused more by fear of opposing the NRA than a respect for Constitutional rights. Republicans are quite happy to infringe on other personal freedoms in the name of national security:\n \n \"Yes, if you are on the terrorist watch list, the authorities can keep you from getting on a plane but not from purchasing an AK-47...\n \n \"People who are perfectly happy to let the government wiretap phones go nuts when the government wants to keep track of weapons permits. A guy who stands up in the House and defends the torture of terror suspects will nearly faint with horror at the prospect of depriving someone on the watch list of the right to purchase a pistol....\n \n \"The Obama administration has been criticized by many Republicans for having followed the rules about how long you can question a terror suspect before you read him his rights....\n \n \"The National Rifle Association, the fiercest lobby in Washington, grades every member of Congress on how well they toe the N.R.A. line. Lawmakers with heavily rural districts would rather vote to legalize carrying concealed weapons in kindergarten than risk getting less than 100 percent.\"\n Op-Ed Columnist - Congress, Up in Arms - NYTimes.com",

   "Actually, the Second Amendment doesn't say anything about due process. It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons, but the right can be infringed with due process of law. In fact, the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed. One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation:\n \n \"If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building...\n The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not.\"\n Chicago-Kent Law Review\n \n 18th Century Pennsylvania, which had its own RKBA, passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed. This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown. So why can't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists?\n\n \n ---\n \n This law review article is just another facet of the long discredited &#8220;absolute literal&#8221; interpretation argument against the individual RKBA in the 2nd. Amendment. Here is the full paragraph cited:\n \n &#8220;Unlike the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, the language of the Second Amendment is absolute: \"shall not be infringed.\" If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building. After all, what better place to exercise your Second Amendment rights, than in front of your representatives or even in the courts of justice? As absurd as this would be, such people could not be \"disarmed,\" at least until they began to commit a crime, if the Second Amendment creates an individual right to bear arms. Taken to its logical extreme, we might argue that just as a federal felon, serving time, has some First Amendment rights to press, petition, and religion, or Eighth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel punishment, so too, a prisoner might claim some Second Amendment right. The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not. [Page 233]&#8221;\n \n I read the article in full and its footnotes. The article makes several false assumptions, and even runs a bait and switch scheme over the words &#8220;to keep and bear arms.&#8221; But I&#8217;ll stick for now with the portion of the article cited in this thread, which makes this argument:\n \n &#8220;Unlike the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, the language of the Second Amendment is absolute: \"shall not be infringed.\" If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.&#8221;\n \n Now normally when a &#8220;legal scholar&#8221; puts forth a rule of constitutional interpretation like this, he typically follows up with a citation to SCOTUS case law to support his method of interpretation. The author does not do so. I&#8217;ll tell you why in a moment&#8230;.\n \n He does, however, bring the 1st. Amendment into the discussion. That amendment also reads in very absolute &#8220;thou shall not&#8221; terms: \n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. (emphasis added)\n (And, since it has been incorporated against the states by the 14th. Amendment&#8217;s &#8220;due process&#8221; clause, it might as well now read &#8220;Congress and the states shall make no law&#8221;). \n \n So look at this amendment from the same &#8220;absolute literalist&#8221; viewpoint. Does this really mean that Congress cannot pass a law prohibiting human sacrifice for religious purposes? Does it mean the states cannot have a law that punished someone for yelling &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater? Does it mean Congress and the states are powerless to regulate false and fraudulent claims in advertising? Is Congress powerless to pass laws prohibiting perjury? The answer is always yes if we accept this false &#8220;absolute literal&#8221; interpretation argument advanced in the article. Can you see how absurd this absolute literal interpretation is? \n \n What I find fascinating is that the article&#8217;s author does not avoid this comparison with the 1st. Amendment. Instead, he embraces it. He invites a comparison of the absolute language of the 2nd. to the absolute language of the 1st&#8212; arguing (in the &#8220;logical extreme&#8221;) that if we also give the 2nd. an individual right interpretation then it must be as absolute and unrestricted as the 1st. Amendment rights. In fact he has to make this argument because he cannot have a special rule of interpretation just for the 2nd. Amendment. He realizes that to be coherent the argument must apply whenever there is absolute language in an Amendment. \n \n And this brings me back to SCOTUS case law which destroys the author&#8217;s argument, and which he either cannot find or will not disclose. First, see his literal interpretation argument again:\n \n &#8220;[T]he language of the Second Amendment is absolute: \"shall not be infringed.\" If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories.&#8221;\n \n Now see how SCOTUS has dealt with this absolute interpretation argument before in the 1st. Amendment (and note how the majority references the RKBA and the Miller case):\n \n At the outset we reject the view that freedom of speech and association (N. A. A. C. P. v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460), as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, are &#8220;absolutes,&#8221; not only in the undoubted sense that where the constitutional protection exists it must prevail, but also in the sense that the scope of that protection must be gathered solely from a literal reading of the First Amendment. (FN10)\n \n (FN10) &#8220;That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: &#8220;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . .&#8221; But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: &#8220;[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.&#8221; Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610. In this connection also compare the equally unqualified command of the Second Amendment: &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&#8221; And see United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174. (bold emphasis added)\n \n Konigsberg v. States Bar, 366 U.S. 36, 49 (1961)\n \n This is a direct repudiation of the article&#8217;s argument. Go back and look through the full article. You will not find a single SCOTUS case which adopts this &#8220;absolute literal&#8221; interpretation for any right in the BoR. This is because no such case exists. But Konigsberg exists, along with other cases which also flatly reject the illogic of the &#8220;absolute literal&#8221; interpretation method&#8212;you just would not know they existed from reading the law review article. And that is what I find so very disappointing about this article. I cannot understand how an author who claims to be a law professor can prove so utterly incapable of basic legal research. It&#8217;s not that hard. Back when this article was published in 2000 we had legal research tools that allow you to type in the words or phrases and find cases in seconds. It took me all of five minutes to find and read the relevant potion of Konigsberg the first time I went looking at the &#8220;absolutist interpretation&#8221; argument&#8212;and I did not need a research assistant to help me look it up. \n \n This is just another example of outcome oriented &#8220;research&#8221; where a person starts with a pet false premise and then puts on blinders before going forth to conduct a search only for evidence to support the premise&#8212;finding precious little along the way. This article only reaffirms my belief in this statement: There is no man who is more blind to his surroundings than the one who willingly shuts his eyes to that which he does not want to see and which he wishes to pretend does not exist. I read the article, but I am not willing to be led along by a blind man. I have no desire to end up in a ditch with him. \n \n I have never argued that the individual RKBA is absolute. All I ask for is equal protection for the amendment. Treat it like the fundamental right it is, incorporate it against the states, and then apply the strict scrutiny test for laws which are alleged to infringe upon the right.",

The NRA had nothing to do with his former exposure so that is a tired lie also and more propaganda.\n \n That oath means what it says, \"this Constitution\". People who will not swear that oath are not American nor were the Tories in the Colonies of Pennyslvania it was meant to exclude. I have told you that Benedict Arnold and the king's loyalist were summerily kicked out of the country as traitors and landed in Nova Scotia nearly starving and freezing to death to come back in 1812 and \"try to fight the war again\". They succeeded in burning the Capitol with British warships off the Coast in support. They lost again to make a long story short.\n \n So, according to you, this oath I described and it is set in the Constitution requires every gov't official to take. This should stop the clamor for gun control as the 2A is a personal, individual RIGHT. Actually, anyone who takes the OATH and tries to \"change THIS CONSTITUTION\" is a traitor no different frrom the Tories or any common scallawag. You should be well aquainted with these people!\n \n \nWhen did I claim the government has rights or is it just another one of your straw man arguments? The rest of your post is filled with baseless personal attacks which indicate a bankruptcy of argument and merits no response.\n\n \n I never said you claimed gov't had rights. You sure paint the picture that the majority rules and if you could get enough people, a majority, you could erase the 2A. I explained why you can't...a right can be expanded but not contracted and that is the baseless claim you make for gun control so in essance you are claiming that \"government has rights\" and you are wrong. Government cannot infringe on the rights of the people found in the BOR. THAT IS WHY THE BOR EXISTS and that is why it ends with \"shall not be infringed. Nunn v.

Our opinion is, that\n any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and\n void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our\n forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked\n sons and successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688,\n conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally\n incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta! And Lexington,\n Concord, Camden, River Raisin, Sandusky, and the laurel-crowned\n field of New Orleans, plead eloquently for this interpretation!\n And the acquisition of Texas may be considered the full fruits of\n this great constitutional right.\n \n We are of the opinion, then, that so far as the act of 1837\n seeks to suppress the practice of carrying certain weapons\n secretly, that it is valid, inasmuch as it does not deprive the\n citizen of his natural right of self-defence, or of his\n constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But that so much of\n it, as contains a prohibition against bearing arms openly is in\n conflict with the Constitution, and void; and that, as the\n defendant has been indicted and convicted for carrying a pistol,\n without charging that it was done in a concealed manner, under that\n portion of the statute which entirely forbids its use, the judgment\n of the court below must be reversed, and the proceeding quashed!",

   "Sorry guys, wanted to get into this discussion earlier but was out for a long weekend in Florida watching the space shuttle launch. A very cool experience....\n \n Let me talk about a portion of the concept of \"due process\" for a moment. The judicially created doctrine of \"substantive due process\" holds that the 5th. Amendment guarantee of due process extends to cover all the individual rights in the BoR. In short, an arbitrary denial of any of these rights (free speech, the RKBA, freedom of religion, for example) means that the government violated that person's \"substantive due process right.\" Where the federal government is involved the violation is referred to as a 5th. Amendment \"substantive due process violation.\" And so although none of the rest of the rights in the BoR mention \"due process\" the concept still applies to them. \n \n As an example, take the RKBA ban as applied to convicted felons. Two things are required for this law to survive a claim that it violates a person's right to \"substantive due process.\" First, the felon's status must have occurred by \"due process\"-a legitimate conviction obtained by a constitutionally lawful trial process. Second, the law itself denying such felons the RKBA must meet due process review standards when considered under whatever \"scrutiny\" test SCOTUS ultimately adopts for infringements of the individual RKBA (I happen to favor the \"strict scrutiny\" test). \n \n To bring it back to a discussion of \"substantive due process\" and the current McDonald case, remember that the individual rights in the BoR were always intended to be only restraints against the action of the federal government. The doctrine of \"substantive due process\" has taken these rights and has selectively \"incorporated\" them against the states to bar state action through the 14th. Amendment's \"due process\" clause. That is, the 14th. Amendment's \"due process\" clause means that a person has a substantive due process right not to have the state violate any of the rights in the BoR. Thus the states, for example, must respect the 1st. amendment rights of free speech, press, religion, assembly, etc. This is the argument in McDonald-whether the substantive due process guarantee in the 14th. Amendment also incorporates the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA against the states. \n Substantive due process also extends to find rights not expressly stated in the Constitution, like, for example, the right to vote, the right to privacy in general, and the right to abortion-bringing with it the consequent criticism of activist judges overruling the will of the people expressed by their legislators or the praise for judges standing up for individual liberty, depending on which side of the particular social issues involved you happen to favor. The best explanation of the extension of substantive dues process to find rights outside those listed in the BoR is found in a famous dissent by Justice Harlan, which has since become accepted as a majority SCOTUS doctrine (notice he mentions the RKBA):\n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints....\"\n \n Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (Harlan, dissenting)\n \n Also note the Court is generally reluctant to recognize new rights not specifically enumerated in the constitution:\n \n \"As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225-226 (1985). The doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\"\n \n Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)\n \n However, this is not the issue in McDonald because the RKBA is specifically enumerated in the BoR. SCOTUS is not breaking new ground and creating a new \"right\" from whole cloth (or blank paper). Oh, I acknowledge that some of you( who are wrong IMO) have already concluded SCOTUS did so in Heller-but McDonald would only take that right and apply it to the states. And there is IMO substantial precedent for holding that the concept of \"substantive due process\" as applied to the states includes every fundamental right-and substantial precedent exists for holding that every individual right specifically included within the BoR is by definition a fundamental right. \n \n As for the discussion of temporary protective orders being issued ex parte-that touches on something we more properly call procedural due process and the right to be notified of these hearings and to be heard at those hearings. The law recognizes the practical necessity for temporary protective orders in emergency situations being issued without giving the alleged abuser notice of the hearing or a right to be heard to contest the issuance of the order. However, these orders are of temporary duration (in Va, they are for either 72 hours or 14 days depending on the type of order). They are simply intended to put in place emergency legal protection during the time it takes to set up and conduct a full protective order hearing at which the alleged abuser has a right to be notified in advance of the hearing, a right to have counsel present, to call witnesses and present other evidence, confront and cross examine adverse witnesses, and to argue against the issuance of a full protective order (which in Va can last for 2 years).",

Why was this champion of 'originalism' so quick to embrace this modern and amorphous judicial doctrine....\"\n History reveals a centuries-long authority to regulate guns. Shouldn't that matter? - By Saul Cornell, Justin Florence, and Matthew Shors - Slate Magazine\n\n \n Scalia has joined in substantive due process decisions before. His history is one of attacking the doctrine most often when it is used to legislate from the bench by going outside the BoR to create new rights out of blank parchment where the Constitution is silent. He has a very strong and consistent history of agreeing the 14th. Amendment incorporates portions of the enumerated rights in the BoR. As do all the justices, for that matter. This is the issue in McDonald.\n \n Cornell should know this.... \n \n But since we are on this topic the reverse question can be asked of Justice Stevens, who has long been a fan of using substantive due process to find, create, and enforce rights well outside of the BoR. It will be interesting to see how he squares this past support for such judicial findings with McDonald. \n \n Now I will digress and take issue with something from the cited article:\n \n \"The problem for Scalia, and for those who want to expand gun rights and also stay faithful to the history and text of the Constitution, is that this view cannot be reconciled with the history of the 14th Amendment. In the years before and after the adoption of the amendment, numerous states and cities-motivated by the danger posed as firearms and other deadly weapons became smaller-enacted laws banning the carrying and possession of certain dangerous weapons, including handguns. In other words, there is ample historical evidence showing that at the time the 14th Amendment was ratified, states had broad authority to enact nondiscriminatory gun-safety regulations.\"\n \n Ah, but note the time frame Cornell used in this argument: \"In the years before and after the adoption of the amendment\" and \"at the time the 14th. Amendment was ratified.\" \n \n True, during the time frame he has chosen the states had broad authority to regulate the RKBA. What Cornell does not tell you, however, is that during this same time frame the states also had broad power to deny any and all of the individual rights in the BoR. At that same time the States could also deny the 1st. Amendment rights of free speech (not incorporated until 1925), freedom of the press (1931), freedom of assembly (1937), freedom of religion (1940), the 4th. Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure (1949, although no exclusionary rule remedy for violation incorporated until 1961), the 5th. Amendment freedoms from self-incrimination (1964) and double jeopardy (1969), the 6th. amendment rights to public trial and notice of accusations against you (1948), right to counsel (1963), to confront and cross examine your accuser (1965), speedy trial and production of witnesses on your own behalf (1967), trial by jury (1968), and the 8th. Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments (not incorporated until 1962).\n \n SCOTUS has time and time again reviewed this limited and taken out of all context slice of history Cornell relies upon, and it has repeatedly rejected it as being absolutely meaningless. So Cornell can tell Dorothy all he wants to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, but I say he is being disingenuous when he claims the history of his chosen time frame has any relevance to the incorporation issue in McDonald. His historical argument is the same one used (for example) to try and justify the state of Louisiana's denial of a black man's right to a trial by an impartial jury in 1968 (\"at the time the 14th. was adopted and for all the decades since the states could still deny a man his right to a jury trial\"). In fact, his argument has been on the wrong side of history in all of the cases incorporating the rights I mention above-and it is equally on the wrong side of history in McDonald.",

When asked how many women's lives have been saved by one you dodged like a bat catching insects. They aren't worth the paper they are written on. A woman in danger is best served by getting herself a gun; a cop is not going to be there just because a restraining order/protective order is issued. The sooner you grasp the principle the sooner you will look smarter. Giving notice is an important aspect of law. Courts are for confrontation.\n\n Once again, I never claimed that restraining orders are permanent nor did I claim they save lives. When you are honest enough to debate the arguments I actually make rather than the ones I don't, let me know.\n \n \nWe're #24 on the list. That's hardly worth getting excited about.\n\n I knew you would say something like this. I was talking about developed nations.\n \n \n\n Cornell again? He was discredited, he has no standing.\n \n Where are the examples of gun control laws that existed during the Colonial period in America? Where are the laws that predate the Civil War? Where are the laws that were enacted during the time that the Founding Fathers were still alive?\n\n Why do you claim Cornell was discredited? Plenty of examples of early gun control laws predating the Civil War have been posted in this forum before.",
