McCain was destroying Dubya and had far more respect in the nation then he did. Certain elements of the GOP scuttled his campaign in favor of Dubya even though McCain is by far the better politican, the better dealmaker, a trillion times more competent and far better for the nation. I suppose you are right in the aspect that they seek jobs first though. Another reason why Guilliani will not win the nomination. He believes too much in accountability and measuring performance, something the GOP in the past 6 years reviles like nobody's business. Guilliani would get work to get rid of politicans in positions he put them if they were not performing. The GOP won't have that. \n \n \nThat being said, Guilliani is certainly a man who knows how to get things done. Probably the best of the known hopefuls to date.\n\n \n Without a doubt. \n \n Kronus, I suppose but you are mixing up two forms of authoritan management. Guilliani relies on timely information and measurment of performance to hold people accountable in doing what he wants. Dubya is just overall incompetent in providing a vision, producing benchmarks and even understanding the data. Guilliani makes decisions based upon empirical data. Dubya makes them on who knows what. Plus Guilliani pays strict attention to the numbers, fiancial and otherwise. Still, that'd be a hard management style to apply to the Presidency.",
