The claim that nuclear is 10 to 20 times cheaper than wind is absurd, as are the projections for uranium use based on CURRENT CONSUMPTION. If you are advocating mass adoption of nuclear then you need to be talking about consumption 10 or 20 times current levels. Which means than in half a century or less we'll be out of uranium.",

Perhaps one day man will discover such a wonder, and the need to prevent any change in consumption patterns will finally be removed.\n \n The real reason watermelons oppose nuclear power is because their supposed \"green\" ideology is nothing but a thinly veiled contempt for industrial society. No measure will be good enough for them unless it results in drastically lowered living standards.",
