   "1. In the eyes of the Bush administration, the relevance of international organizations, such as the United Nations, depends primarily upon their willingness to approve US policy, legal or illegal, moral or immoral.\n\n \n Seeing how ineffectual the UN usually is in times of actual crisis would detract from any thoughts that the Bush adm alone sees the UN as the final authority. The funny thing is that nothing about GWII was illegal. Pretty much all war is immoral.\n \n \n2. The Bush doctrine of \"Preemptive War\" may be employed against threats that have no basis in fact.\n \n\n \n Only when its convenient, as in a regime that had been kept cripple for 12 years by the UN and the US. And it wasn't necessarily \"Bush doctrine.\" It was just Bush friends that profit.\n \n \n3. The American people appear to take little notice of the \"bait and switch\" tactic of initiating a war to prevent use of weapons of mass destruction - and then celebrating regime change when no such weapons are found.\n\n \n Oh, they take notice, but like pretty much all other complaints toward the govt, they can't do shyt about it.\n \n \n4. A country of 290 million inhabitants that spends $400 billion a year on its military, providing them with the latest in high-tech weaponry, can achieve clear military victory over a country of 23 million that spends 1/400th of that amount and possesses virtually no high-tech weaponry.\n\n \n This is another thing that made the war look convenient.\n \n5. Embedding journalists with troops leads to reporters providing only perspectives sanctioned by the military in their reports to the public. It is analogous to the imprinting of ducklings.\n \n 6. The American people can be easily manipulated, with the help of both embedded and non-embedded media, to support an illegal and immoral war.\n\n \n I don't know if you've noticed that about 1/2 to 2/3 of the public were and are opposed to the war from beginning to end.\n \n \n7. An imperial presidency does not require Congress to exercise its Constitutional authority to declare war; it requires only a compliant Congress to provide increasingly large sums of money for foreign wars. \n\n \n I wonder when we'll have a system where the military isn't at the beck and call of one person or office, especially when it's to be used offensively.\n \n \n8. It is far easier to destroy a dictatorial regime by military might than it is to rebuild a country as a functioning democracy.\n\n \n I wouldn't say either are easy, but the Bush adm sure played like it would be. It wasn't so easy to depose Saddam as it looked on TV. It took billions of $, loads of high-tech weapons, a \"coalition\" of armies (even though it was mostly US), the destruction of lots of property, the death of 15,000+ people, etc. It was swift, but by no means easy. \n \n \n9. If other countries wish to avoid the fate of Saddam Hussein and Iraq, they should follow Israel's example and develop strong arsenals of weapons of mass destruction for protection against potential US aggression.\n\n \n You forgot that they also have to kiss the a$$ of the US before building the WMDS.\n \n \n10. In all wars it is the innocent who suffer most. Thus, while Saddam Hussein plays games with his interogators, Osama bin Laden continues playing cat-and-mouse, and George Bush stages a jet flight to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to prematurely declare \"mission accomplished\", little Ali Ismaeel Abbas lies in a hospital bed without his parents and brother, who were killed in a US attack, and without his arms.\n\n \n At least he didn't wear a NASA clean-suit! How gay! Flight helmets are much cooler.",
