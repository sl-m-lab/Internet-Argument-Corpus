   "Abortion is not currently a crime. However, because abortion takes the life of an innocent human being for the convenience of another, it is morally wrong - unless the mother's life is at stake. \n Well, 'convenience' is a debatable word here - its convenient for you to let a great number of people in Africa die because you want a TV, or electricity or a holiday, whilst its far less convenient for someone to have to carry a child. They will actually phsyically suffer whilst you just don't get the latest in modern western luxuries. Abortion as a means of birth control is just not a good idea though. \n \n \n \n \n\n While this is indeed a painfully hard situation, there are some things to think about. \n \n 1. The child in her womb has a right to life.\n This I don't agree with really, least not unconditionally.\n \n\n 2. The child in her womb is not at fault, and the guilty father, not the mother nor the baby, should be punished.\n I agree, but I don't think you should really discount the effect that having the child will have on the mother. Whilst being more pschological, its not beyond imagining that it could come down to a life of the mother/fetus issue. The mother has to take priority, it has to be victim < neutral bystander < criminal and in this case the victim is the mother (though this is assuming that this is a later term abortion in my case, I see little difference between preventing a fertilised egg from implanting and preventing an undifferentiated blastocyst from developing further)\n \n\n 3. Abortion will not bring healing. It will take an already painfull situation and make it worse. The girl would have to deal with the burden of abortion plus the burden of the rape/incest.\n I'd hazard a guess that unless the girl in question is strongly religious or prolife, then the burdan of abortion is going to be less than that of the abuse. Even if complications happen the problems caused by the abortion are going to be more due to complications to the abuse problem (i.e rendered sterile by an abusive father) than the abortion itself. Whilst an abortion may not bring healing, you have to recognise that in some (if not the majority of) cases not having an abortion could stand in the way of healing.\n \n\n 4. A child is a child regardless of the circumstances of their conception, and there are in fact people walking around today who are the products of the example you gave here. \n But stress a child, it would be wrong to judge a child by the circumstances of its birth but as a developing embryo I do not think it can be treated the same way. Adoption may be preferable if possible but if someone is causing harm, albeit even unintentionally they are still responsible. The whole idea of manslaughter is based around this, without even going on to criminals being a product of their environment - they may have had apparently little choice in their crimes. This does not exempt them from punishment though - they serve to prevent future crimes or to stop the contining harm being caused.",

   "Doesn't quite work for mine - I was extending the point chloe was making to show that 'convience' means more than she would like.\n \n However Chloes is closer to what I would consider a strawman (not entirely right, straw man is more a false argument made such as 'pro-lifers claim that abortions are carried out because they make money for abortionists'. I would then show that there are clinics that do not charge, therefore the pro-life position is false)\n \n Chloe claimed that abortion is a convenience, this is a very loaded word here and whilst could be argued to be correct (i.e its convenient not to undergo the risks of pregancy, its not really convenient to lose your job so you can have a child, it is convenient not to suffer aggravated mental problems due to having continual exposure to the results of a serious trauma) its exactly the same level of convience that you get by living in a western state and spending money on things other than food for people in Africa. If not more so, you chose a luxury for yourself (say electricity) maintaining a person's life in Africa. You have the resources to feed 20 people, yet you are chosing to use those resources to feed one. How is this different than having the resources to feed 2 people and chosing to only feed 1? In both cases the innocent's lives are at stake should you chose not to share, I fail to see why an unborn child in america is more worthy of life than one in africa if we are saying that all lives are equal.\n \n Closest to a strawman you can get with my statement is me claiming that you beleive that all human life is as entitled to life as any other. Surely you would not disagree here though? If the option is stay in a low paying job due to prenancy and support you and your unborn child or abort and use the money to keep two additional people alive who would have died otherwise, how can you not side with the latter?",
