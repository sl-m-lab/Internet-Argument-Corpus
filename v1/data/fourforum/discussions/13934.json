I'm not so much upset with the way that things are being run, because I know for a fact that's he a puppet for all of the lobbyist, fascists, taxers and all of that. What I'm more upset with, is that he's allowing himself to be a puppet.\n \n By now, I know that he has seen that a lot of the things that are going on under his call are not for the better, and are not working out the way that he said they would. I seriously think that he needs to be impeached.\n \n His stupidity could, very well, lead us into the next world war. And, then, where are we going to sit? We'll all be dead, due to the nuclear destruction that's going on around us.\n \n This, is why, his \"Hope and Change\" are, quite frankly, XXXXXXX me off.

   "I don't. Please explain....\n\n \n And I mean no offense by that...sometimes I have a bad habit of wording things harshly :(\n \n I'll explain what you referenced in your post. \n \n You state the republicans are part of the problem for being so partisan. You aren't alone. Obama seems to be taken back by how much the republicans don't like him. What I can't understand is why people think this is new. It isn't new and it isn't \"worse\". Let me explain what I mean by \"worse\". \n \n Back in the 1800s you had Jefferson and Adams going at it. This was just as brutal as you see today...only without the cameras to take sound bites for us. The two truly hated each other but later made up..kinda like Bush Sr. and Clinton ha! Today it is the same thing, republicans will hate everything the democrats do and the democrats will hate everything the republicans do.\n \n One small difference is that the democrats are much worse at organization than the republicans are. This isn't to say the democrats aren't trying...they just are not very good at doing things when they hold power. This has been the trend for the last 20 years. \n \n So what does this all mean? Basically it means suck it up because it won't change unless you are prepared to undo hundreds of years of human nature. So more importantly, how do you mitigate this problem. The answer, to me, is clear. Have them do less. If congress is forced stick within a balanced budget and only allowed to address powers given to them in the constitution then problems of lobbying, special interest, and pork go away or are reduced to non-annoying levels. \n \n Now you can sit back and complain all you want about how people in congress should have a change of heart but time and time again this has proven not to work and, in fact, is the opposite of what people want. I'm kind of a hypocrite here because I'm saying voters should change their minds about what they want as well. Everyone wants more government to do more things for them and solve all lifes little problems unless, sometimes, they aren't benefiting in which case they protest it (see tea baggers). \n \n So in short, you get what you pay for and we paid for a huge federal government....well, china paid for it.",
