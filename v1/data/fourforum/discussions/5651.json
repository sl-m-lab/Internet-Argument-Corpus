   "From the article:\n \n \n They also are quick to point out that fanatics are a tiny minority and account for only about 1 percent of Muslims worldwide. \n\n Where'd she get this from?\n \n \n Or unless you're mathematically inclined, in which case you see that 1 percent of the world's estimated 1.2 billion Muslims is 12 million Muslim fanatics who consider the U.S. and other Westerners operatives of Satan. \n\n This figure's popping up again without evidence\n \n \nMeanwhile, he's unlikely to have much effect as Americans - even South Carolinians who, admittedly, have a higher-than-average threshold for eccentricity - don't hesitate to call a wacko a wacko. \"Sit down and shut up\" rolls off the tongue in our self-correcting culture, especially when the targets are white Christians. \n\n Personally, I'd say it to any fundamentalist.\n \n \nWhich is why moderate Muslims must be unrelenting in eliminating - not just condemning - Islam's bad actors. When a Muslim cleric urges jihad against infidels, it falls to fellow Muslims to clean out the mosque, to rid Allah's kingdom of radicals.\n\n Like expelling them from the Mosque? Because that's already been done.\n \n \nIt's not enough to assert that 12 million hate-filled zealots who advocate murdering Americans and Europeans are a minority and then, feeling virtuous, return to the business of registering Muslim voters and issuing press releases about insults to Islam. \n\n That figure again. Also, not all fundies are like that. For example, the local Christian fundies who preach in our town centre are complete pacifists, but concentrate their teaching on Love. They do interpret the Bible literally however.\n \n \nAfter the bombings that killed some 50 in London, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a statement that said in part: \"These vicious acts of terrorism deserve the strongest possible condemnation by all civilized people.\"\n \n That's nice, but we've heard these words before. At this point - after 9/11, 3/11 and now 7/7 - they are background noise, providing no comfort and little assurance other than that cliches are indiscriminate.\n\n They condemned the actions. I don't know where that quote came from, but maybe citing what the rest of the speech said would be useful, seeing as the reader has no way of knowing if CAIR didn't then go on to urge members to root out extremists.\n \n \nWe also know that in Muslim nations around the world - as well as in mosques elsewhere - the susurration of prayer is often silenced by the sound of celebration when a terrorist takes out another busload of \"infidels.\" \n\n Rhetoric. No evidence and a sweeping generalisation.\n \n \nI was labled an Islamaphobic and an alarmist.\n\n Yep, you have. I've been labelled lots of stuff too.\n \n -Wez",

It all contributes to extremism.\n \n -Wez\n\n \n 1) Nobody is attacking Islam, infact most people go out of the way to say that Islam as practiced by the majority is peaceful but there is no way of denying facts either that a minority have perverted Islam and use Islam as justification to commit terrorist acts. And to use the term \"minute minority\" is kind of misleading because even though a 'minute minority' actually commit these terrorist acts..... their acts are supported by more than a minute minority in the Islam world. In many countries in the middle east , polls show that a significant number of people have sympathy for sucide bombers. This does not mean they commit terrorist acts but only that they have sympathy .So to deny this reality is to hide your head in the sand.\n \n 2) You find religion all over the world , not just in poor countries. Yes , in all religions you find fanatics who use religion as justification to commit terrorist acts but those acts only enjoy the support of probably 0.1% of the public at large unlike in Islam .\n \n 3) There is also no denying the fact the other religions are more tolerant of muslims than muslims are tolerant of other religions. This may not be a political correct to say but it is true. I have personally heard muslims say many derogatory comments (privately of course ,not in public) about christians, hindus, jewish. This is not only my experience but the experience of many other people as well. Again I am not saying a majority of muslims do this but a sizable portion do it , much more than in other religions.\n This is backed up by polls that show non-muslims have a more favourable view of muslims than muslims have of other religions.\n http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=811",

   "1) Nobody is attacking Islam, infact most people go out of the way to say that Islam as practiced by the majority is peaceful but there is no way of denying facts either that a minority have perverted Islam and use Islam as justification to commit terrorist acts. And to use the term \"minute minority\" is kind of misleading because even though a 'minute minority' actually commit these terrorist acts..... their acts are supported by more than a minute minority in the Islam world. In many countries in the middle east , polls show that a significant number of people have sympathy for sucide bombers. This does not mean they commit terrorist acts but only that they have sympathy .So to deny this reality is to hide your head in the sand.\n \n 2) You find religion all over the world , not just in poor countries.
