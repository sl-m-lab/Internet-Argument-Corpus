   "The war on Hezbollah though still going on has already been lost by Israel. I mean whole world has been witnessing during recent weeks that transformation of Israel from \"terrorists' victim\" into brazen aggressor making the region dangerously unstable.\n Bulk of criticism came from European heavy weights (France and Germany). This means Israel is a loser in informational warfare. To put it simple Jews are not just disliked, they are hated and not only in Arab lands but European ones as well. \n Well I think Israel owes it wholly to its \"sworn friend\" America. \"Sworn friend\" fits here well for I am absolutely sure American spin-doctors are too sophisticated to have made series of primitive errors in the informational coverage. And some stuff was just of provocative nature I should say. \n I think that Condy Rice knows her business well. Israel is definitely bogged in Lebanon. And with Europe turning its back on Israel America is staying the single \"friend\". From now on Israel is fully at Washington's disposal, Iranian future mission included...",

   "This thread seems to have started on Hezbolhgah and ended with the voting system in Israel and the two refugee camps. It was interesting reading how the thread evolved from one thing to another though.emoticon_confused \n \n In respect to Hezbolhah it is deeply embeded into the southern population Lebanese and basically began and developed during the Israeli ocupation of southern lebanon. There is no way that Israel could have ever beaten Hezbolhah by atacking them in southern Lebanon. It would just be like pouring Gasoline on a fire. You have to remove what drives Hezbolhah to have any chance of inhibiting them. From the start of the crisis Israel should have aranged a prionser exhange to get there soldiers back and not gone to war in Southern Lebanon. It has only made them look bad internationally and only made hezbolhah stronger not weaker. Does anyone know where exactly the soldiers were taken from. If it was actually on Lebanese teritory then they were an ocupying force which does change the situation. What is difference between Hezbolhah taking prisoner and Israel taking prisoners - both sides do it.emoticon_xhoho \n \n With repect to the voting system in Israel I don't really care how they vote or whether it is the only democracy in the Middle East. What really matters is Gaza Strip and West Bank being seperated into two serpearate refugee camps and not being one country along side Israel has it should be (Palestine). You can not have aprox 4,000,000 people living in poverty in two large refugee camps since 1967 and take this as acceptable. Just the fact that there are over 4,000,000 Palestinian refugees with no country to call their own is a failure on the part of the UN and all countries in the Middle East. It always seems to be the Palestinains who are fogotten. The Israeli's moan becasuse they are being attacked - at least they have a contry to be attacked in. The Syrians moan because they want the Gollan Heights back - but they still have their own country. The Lebanese moan because they want the Chebba Farms back, mines removed and prisoners released - but they still have their own country. The Palestinian have no rights, no country, no real goverment and they are probably the most deserving for some form of justice out of Israel, Syria and Lebanon but get nothing.
