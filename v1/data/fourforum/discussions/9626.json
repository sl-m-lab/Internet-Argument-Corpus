   "At this point you are just being ridiculous.\n\n \n That was the point. I was matching your arrogance with ridiculousness. \n \n \nPeople are able to learn other languages. We are certainly able to recognize \"religious\" behavior.\n\n \n You mean we recognized religious behaviors as we understand them. You are assuming that all religious behaviors conform to our standards. I do not. Furthermore I do not assume that simply because we cannot recognize the behavior of a animal as possibly religious does not mean them devoid of religion. To declare that other animals are without religion would require a understanding straight from the literal horse's mouth. Hence why I made the comment about your ability to talk to animals and get the straight facts from them on their no religion stances. Most diests have no outward signs of religion yet they have a clear religion. Your argument only works if we assume that all religious behavior is clearly defined and clearly recognizable. It's a very big assumption that fails the reality test when compared to many non-practicing persons of faith. Liberal reform Juadism has many people who wouldn't if glanced at be considered Jewish, as they don't conform to many of the rituals or food laws. I personally know a few Jews who don't follow any of the rituals or outward ideas yet call themselves Jews. \n \n \nI think the burden of proof is on you to show that animals engage in religious behavior.\n\n \n On the contrary, the burden of proof is on you to prove that they don't. I'm just pointing out that Jupiter sized hole in your argument. That of course doesn't mean you're wrong, merely that you have a rather large assumption that your argument is founded upon to prove. I never claimed the animals did have religion, I never claimed they didn't. My point is that you can't say either way without deal with that assumption as well as getting direct information FROM the animals about their alleged beliefs. \n \n \nIt is fairly safe to say that they do not. There is not one example of it. If there is please show me, other than the single items stated previously. \n \n\n \n It is fairly safe to say that they don't do religious behaviors that we believe to be religion behaviors. Like I said before, you are using a assumption that all religious behaviors conform to our beliefs about what consitutes a religious behavior. That you need to prove before moving on. \n \n \nAdditionally, my question was not to you.\n\n \n I'm sorry, I did not know this was a fascist website that restricted the flow of information and posting. \n \n \nProvide affirmative information to show that animals engage in religious behavior.\n\n \n So you're now saying that one cannot point out the flaws in arguments? Symboite does this a fair amount of the time. I don't see you criticizing him for doing just that. Plus many others do this to other users. This is my first experience of you stating that one cannot point out flaws in arguments without making a argument (which I technically have, which is that your argument relies upon uproven and quite arrogant assumptions).\n \n \nFor me to show they do not is the same as me proving that something does not exist.\n\n \n But you have not shown them. You have merely assumed that they do not without any such actual evidence. Absence of proof is not proof of absence.\n \n \nThis is why you have the burden of proof as you are afirming a statement. I am not.\n\n \n On the contrary, I did no such thing.\n \n The most logical, supportable and reasonable stance on the possibility of animals have religion is \"I don't know.\" We do not have the necessary information to say that they don't, nor do we have such information to say that they do. For this to be alleviated, we'd need animals to tell us that they don't have religion or that they do. To my knowledge, no human has learned how to directly communicate things to animals in the form that would allow the transfer of knowledge about the possible religious beliefs. What we have observed is animals mourning their dead, just as we do. But that does not mean we know they have religion or have similar ideas as to what a 'soul' is.",

   "Does it make sense to talk about the \"beliefs\" of animals - whether \"religious\" or otherwise?\n \n A belief: for human beings means to hold something (a proposition) to be true perhaps in the absence of demonstrable proof as required by scientific method.

Belief can also be a stage in the evolution of a bit of knowledge, where belief awaits some methodology of adequate sophistication to validate it as knowledge. \n \n But if this characterization of what a belief is, or can be, has validity in the \"human world\", then how can it be applied in the \"animal world\"?

If you do not wish to examine the flaws in your arguments that is your choice, but do not fabricate argumnents I have made and attack me for not providing evidence for them. I made no claim as to the existance or lack of existance of religion in animals.

It is NOT reasonable to assume that animals have no religious beliefs at all in any way, shape or form. Your argument assumes that all religious beliefs conform to what we believe to be religious. You cannot prove this, nor would you try as it is impossible. I am not disagreeing that animals do not have religious beliefs as we understand religious beliefs. I am disagreeing with your premise that all such beliefs conform to a specific standard and cannot deviate and highlighting it as the problem within your argument.\n \n \nFor you to say that you are not making any affirmative claim, here is your statement:\n\n \n Those quotes providing the foundation for why your assumption is false. The first one shows that your argument is assumption without knowledge of the actual beliefs or lack of beliefs. It does not mean you are wrong, merely that you are going off of a assumption that does not take into account the subject's actual beliefs you are discussing. The second is a subtle jab as to show a possibility as to what could be happening, it does not mean it is. Both were designed as comical to show the flaws in your reasoning. Neither claim that animals actually do have religious beliefs. My conclusion was simply that one cannot know for certain, therefore the most reasonable, logical and defendable is \"I do not know.\" How you failed to recognize this is beyond comprehension as I clearly stated it. This would suggest you deliberately ignored it, in which I must ask you to either read it again or sign you off as someone who deliberately ignores significent parts of a post to suit his argument. In that case you are essentially another form of Ez rider and not worth discussing anything with. \n \n \nThese certainly sound like affirmative statements. You claim that I have arrogance and yet when you make such ridiculous statements, and then they are shown to be ridiculous you then try to prove that you were not making any such ridiculous statements.\n\n \n Did I not say this? \n \n \"I was matching your arrogance with ridiculousness.\" \n \n Shown? I admitted as their specific purpose they were designed to be ridiciulous. I now suspect you have a serious reading comprehension problem or are deliberately ignoring parts as you failed to see this even as it was blantatly written to you and you read through to Jame's post, therefore you must have read it. I see little value in those who engage in Cherry picking and somewhat dishonest behavior. \n \n \nYour first quoted statement above assumes that animals are cognitively equal to humans.\n\n \n Hardly. Perhaps you should attend community college in which to learn reading comprehension. The first statement merely shows you did not discuss the beliefs of the animals with them before assuming they had no such beliefs. This statement has a more subtle point: You cannot make such absolute statements without going to the source, and as you CAN'T go to the source, you can't make such statements. Therefore your argument fails on the very basic level of failing to understand the subject of discussion. \n \n \nYou use a begged question and then you make an affirmative statement and provide not proof.\n\n \n Again Please in the future refrain from outright lies. Where did I use a begged question? That would require me to have a argument, as one of the assumptions is to be proved. As I made no argument other then to show the flaws in your arguments, I therefore cannot possibly ever had used a begged question. Your understanding and grasp of logic completely underwhelm me. \n \n \nWell, I seem to be beating a dead horse here. Although I am certain you will be expecting all the other horses to arrive at the ceremony of the horse gods to let them know the latest stallion will be entering the eternal coral.\n \n Now, I am being arrogant.\n\n \n Just foolish. \n \n As you clearly are ignoring my conclusion in a previous post, here it is again, failure to understand and acknowledge proves my point about your deliberate avoidance:\n \n \nThe most logical, supportable and reasonable stance on the possibility of animals have religion is \"I don't know.\" We do not have the necessary information to say that they don't, nor do we have such information to say that they do.

What you seem far more interested in is ignoring that problem and trying to get me to argue that animals have such beliefs despite my several posts which specifically stated I'm not claiming they do or they don't. The only reason I posted is to point out the problems in your argument.\n \n \nIf this is a possibility, please show this. If it really is as probable as you seem to indicate then you should have no problem finding evidence.\n\n \n Perhaps you need to learn to read better:\n \n \nPerhaps you should learn to read better. All I did was point out your argument relies upon a shaky if not existance foundation. Furthermore I never claimed that animals do or do not have religion and I specifically noted that I did just that. My entire argument is merely pointing out the flaws in your's. If you do not wish to examine the flaws in your arguments that is your choice, but do not fabricate argumnents I have made and attack me for not providing evidence for them. I made no claim as to the existance or lack of existance of religion in animals. I just pointed out that one cannot assume either way reasonably as we lack the information to do just that.\n\n \n If you want someone to argue with over that animals do have beliefs, find someone who actually made or is willing to make that argument. \n \n \nI do not lie. I do not appreciate the accusation. I have provided argumentation based on what you said.\n\n \n No you have not. You are trying to get me to argue something I never intended. Furthermore you are fabricating what the statements actually meant to do just that. While you may not apperciate the accusation, it is true , whether you like it or not. \n \n \nYou do not understand that one cannot logically claim the \"non existence\" of something. You state that it is pointed out to atheists all the time. It may be done so but that does not make it logically correct.\n\n \n So I can claim anything doesn't exist and I need no proof? That does not sound anything close to something resembling logic. In normal world, people argue that something does not exist based upon specific criteria. For instance, one could argue Taiwan's former nuclear program does not exist anymore due to the lack of any logistics, funds or personnel. One could argue that Bush's post-invasion plans didn't exist based on the complete lack of any planning. To claim something does not exist without proof is nothing more then I say so, and even you can see the folly of that. \n \n \nYour begged question is the assumption that animals experience religion at all.\n\n \n No, I made no such claim. All I did was point out that your argument was using a flawed assumption with no actual discussion with the subject in question. For the last time, all I did was point out your argument has very large problems, not that it's wrong or that animals do have beliefs.\n \n \nYou then go on to say that it may just be in some way very different from what we know and we would have to to ask them.\n\n \n And you didn't get the obvious from this? That religious beliefs may come in different forms then we understand them? Wow. That's something else. \n \n \nI gave several arguments against that which you failed to properly address. Instead you resulted to name calling and attacks on my sanity and intelligence.\n\n \n No, you gave no arguments aganist those. Instead you fabricated a argument you thought I made in addition to specifically ignoring large vital parts of my argument. I did not question your sanity or intelligence, just your honesty, which at this point isn't looking all that good given how you are deliberately ignoring many key statements. I suspect you're getting fustrated I'm not falling for the bait and switch (which is a reason you won't address my conclusion, specifically that I made no such arguments as to the existance or lack of existance of animal's beliefs). If you did address my point that I did not argue for either, you wouldn't be trying to goad me into arguing that they do. \n \n \nAt this point, I will no longer address you. I care only to argue with those who are willing to admit their own faulty thinking and look at things stated honestly. I believe I have done that here and elsewhere. \n\n \n Not suprising from a dishonest person. Not to mention your comment is quite hypocritical as your own argument is faulty. \n \n if you do not wish or do not have the maturity to examine your own logic, that is your choice. Just do not attack another for a argument of your own design.",

   "OC: I tire of your illogic: From Wikipedia\n \n \nNegative proof\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n This article is about a logical fallacy. The term \"negative proof\" can also refer to a proof of impossibility. \n The fallacy of appealing to lack of proof of the negative is a logical fallacy of the following form:\n \n \"X is true because there is no proof that X is false.\" \n This is a fallacy whereby the normal burden of proof is reversed. It is asserted that a proposition is true, only because it has not been proven false. Formally, the burden of proof should be on the proposed idea, not the challenger of the idea.\n \n The negative proof fallacy often occurs in the debate of the existence of supernatural phenomena, in the following form:\n \n \"A supernatural force must exist, because there is no proof that it does not exist\". \n However, the fallacy can also occur when the predicate of a subject is denied:\n \n \"A supernatural force does not exist, for I have not seen proof that something supernatural does exist.\".\n \n \n\n \n This is in a list of formal and informal logical fallacies. Here is the link\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_proof\n \n You can feel free to peruse the entire article- it is somewhat extensive.\n \n We could also pull in Occams razor to say that animals do not have religion amongst other claims. It is highly logical, fairly simple, and patently obvious to everyone but \"obvious child\" that this is a reasonable assumption. You idea of its possibility is not a flaw in my reasoning as you claim. For it to be a flaw it would have to be at least a little bit probable.\n \n The negative proof fallacy above is simply for your education since you clearly are lacking it where logic is concerned. Feel free to look it up in your favorite philosophy books as well.\n \n I will allow you the last word as I will not be responding to you further.\n \n Huck",

   "You know, obvious_child, I don't know what axe you are trying to grind here, but, your discussion borders on offensive insult. You seem to be using an unconventional definition of religion, without offering that definition. You further criticize huckleberry as arrogant and ridiculous for not conforming to your unstated definition. As I understand the discussion, he isn't claiming that all religious behaviour is clearly defined and clearly recognizable. The problem is that you haven't offered your definition, and your definition seems to allow religion without evidence of beliefs or practices, without any rituals, traditions, or mythology. To my understanding of the word, the above are indicative of religion. Given the lack of any indication of the above, it isn't legitimate to claim that we don't know if chimps, dolphins, or chickens have religion since there is no indication that of any cultural practice to indicate that it is so.\n \n Nor do I claim that all religious behaviour is clearly defined and clearly recognizable. In fact, if we consider the Neanderthals as an example, we can't even be sure that they had any religious beliefs. In some cases they buried their dead in what seems to be some sort of religious context. But Neandertals were human (although a separate species from us). Were Neandertal burials in the fetal position because of some sort of religious belief or because of the difficulty in digging with sticks? Such burial positions required smaller holes. Was the pollen found in some burial sites because flowers were placed in the grave or because the burial took place in the spring? In fact, we don't know. But at least there is some observation upon which an hypothesis of religious practice can be based.\n \n So, if you wish to assert that whales, and dogs, and rats may have religious beliefs, then please present a definition wherein this is possible. Please offer examples of behaviour that appears to be religious. Please indicate how it may be possible that religious memes are transmitted among animals.\n \n I don't mean to pick a fight. I have the greatest respect for your tenacity in continuing to deal with supersport and wascallywabbit. I further respect your knowledge of the topic of evolutionary biology. I just feel that in this case your discussion is less than precise.\n \n My definition of religion is pretty conventional. It is a set of beliefs and practices generally held by a human community, involving adherence to codified beliefs and rituals and study of ancestral or cultural traditions and mythology, as well as personal faith and mystic experience.",

Therefore we cannot assume they do not. I gave several examples of humans who have no observable signs of religious beliefs. Your argument would claim that they are atheists because they cannot be observed to have religious beliefs. You may be 'logically' correct but factually wrong as they do have beliefs and there are people who have no religious beliefs and thus no observable ones. You never dealt with this problem instead entirely focusing on getting me to argue something I never intended.\n \n \n7) You lose the debate, I win.\n\n \n only if you wish to ignore this problem.

The problem is that you haven't offered your definition, and your definition seems to allow religion without evidence of beliefs or practices, without any rituals, traditions, or mythology.\n\n \n Oh yes he is doing just that. His argument is that since we have not observed religious behavior in animals outside of human introduction, they do not have religious beliefs. I gave a example of non-observant Jews. Huck would argue that they have no religious beliefs since they are not observed to be religious (he ignored this point). This is ludacrious. Diests do not practice religious beliefs as other religions understand them. they do not pray, do not offer rituals, have few or no traditions and no mythology. Yet they believe in the creator. They have no observable religious activities that would show they are not atheists. Under Huck's logic, such Diests are atheists even though they when asked, will admit they believe in a God or at least a higher power. His whole argument is based on observance, yet there are example of where observance would lead to the wrong conclusion. Even more absurd many atheists engage in religious holidays and traditions. Under Huck's argument, since they are observed to be participating in such activities, they have a religion DESPITE being atheists. His argument of observance is fundementally flawed. Let's do more absurd observation claims. The Christmas Tree, Holly and presents are all from Pagan religions. Under Huck's claim of observance, the early Roman Catholic Church would have many Pagan religious beliefs as they observed Pagan traditions despite being aganist Paganism and treating it rather harshly. One cannot rationally argue that one does not have a belief based upon observing them. Huck would argue under his logic that Republicans hold massively anti-conservative beliefs according to their behaviors in Congress. When asked about their politican beliefs, Republicans would contridict Huck's logic. We cannot assume that one does or does not have a belief purely upon their behaviors. I have no outward religious behaviors, yet I believe in a God. Huck would say I have no religion and I'm a atheist despite my belief in God merely because I have no outward religious activities. He never dealt with this problem. I suspect he won't either.\n \n I'm not arguing that animals do or do not. Merely that given examples in humans were no observable beliefs or activities are present that it is foolish to assume that animals who have no observable beliefs or activities are religious-less. Furthermore in many Native American belief systems, the animals and man (and basically everything else with a spirit) share the same religious system.\n \n I take personal offense to Huck's argument as it would cast me as something I not. Most of my friends and my family have no idea what religious beliefs I have as I do not let any of those signs out of the proverbial bag. The few that do only know because they asked me. On other boards many people assume and call me a atheist because they see no observable religious beliefs (marc9000 has done this to me here), then I respond I'm a diest and then they shutup. Hence I have a personal understanding as to why Huck's argument is full of ####.\n \n \nBut at least there is some observation upon which an hypothesis of religious practice can be based.\n\n \n How about certain animals that go into depression when their close relatives are killed?

   "Who's Pad? My handle is pandion, which happens to be the generic name of a diurnal raptor (eagles, hawks, falcons, and kites)\n\n \n Sorry. I abbreviated. I tend to misspell when I do that.\n \n \nBut non-observant Jews are humans and we have observed considerable religious beliefs in humans.\n\n \n True, but his argument relies entirely upon observing if they do or do not. Under Huck's logic if we cannot observe, they do not have would render non-observant Jews to not have any religious beliefs despite being very wrong. Absence of proof is not proof of absence. \n \n \nBut he was talking about animals. Animals have not been observed to demonstrate behavior that indicates religious belief.\n\n \n One could replace animals with anything living. That's not the issue here. It is his method of arguing that they do not have such beliefs because we don't see them. \n \n \nAnd yet, they are human, and humans are known to have religious beliefs. In fact, deists have expressed religious belief.\n\n \n EXACTLY. Diests have stated their beliefs. That's how we know many diests who have no visible religious activities to have religious beliefs. If left purely to observation, we'd assume under Huck's argument that diests are atheists and have no religious beliefs. The point I'm making here is one could subsitute diests for animals and the argument is the same. \n \n \nThen I missed something. If that is what he is asserting, then he is wrong, in my opinion. But on the other hand, I don't think that we can assert that animals just might have religious thoughts because we have no evidence one way or the other.\n\n \n Of course. I've stated several times the reasonable answer is \"I don't know.\" Based upon human examples of observance that would lead to false conclusions, it would imply that we cannot argue that they do or do not without asking them. Many diests are mistaken for atheists yet they are very different in religious beliefs or lack thereof, diesm has even been called atheism because its lack of outward religious signs (among other things). Given a athiest and a diest who have no signs of beliefs, can one reasonable state one has beliefs and one does not without asking them which one they are? \n \n \nWhat? So you are saying that I should go to work on Christmas day even though I won't be paid? How bizarre.\n\n \n I recall for many companies it's double overtime. Back on track, no that's not my point. If we relied upon observance as huck would argue, then we would assume atheists have religious beliefs as they participate in religious actitivies such as Christmas. On that note, I have met a christian who didn't celebrate Christmas and DID go to work (strangest thing ever). Huck would argue that such a person based upon that behavior wasn't a Christian even though he would be wrong. Huck may be logically right, he's just factually wrong in assume that observance can detail if one has a belief or not. \n \n \nSo according to you, not going to work is a religious activity.\n\n \n I meant all of the other stuff, such as setting up trees, presents, parties, etc. I'm not a christian but I play christian carols. \n \n \nAnd of course, yours isn't.\n\n \n I didn't argue that observance can reveal the actual beliefs of a person or organism. I'm just providing examples of where observance leads to a very wrong conclusion. \n \n \nI must have missed where Huck made any such claim. I have a Christmas tree (I hate holly - an evil weed), and wreaths and presents. It's fun, but not for me religious. But to an outside observer it would certainly seem so. That outside observer would be wrong.\n\n \n He didn't make any claims about the RCC. I'm just showing his observance argument to be historically absurd. As you've stated, the observer would conclude your activities in Christmas are religious, yet you state they would b wrong. Just another example of observance leading to wrong conclusions.\n \n \nHow nice that you can tell us what Huck would argue. You have been able to grasp his essence far better than I have. I usually prefer to wait until someone actually makes an argument before I claim that he has made that argument.\n\n \n He stated if one cannot observe it, it doesn't exist. The corrollary is if one can observe it, it does exist. Therefore as we observe the anti-conservative behaviors of the Republican party, we should assume under Huck's set of principles that they are anti-conservative. Just another real life example of how stating the existance or lack of existance purely on observance is faulty. I could use the whole God doesn't exist because we can't observe it, but that's pedestrian and rather boring. \n \n \nBut it is a bit silly to assert that we just don't know if a snail just might have some sort of religious belief.\n\n \n I doubt a snail has beliefs as we understand them. But it may have a belief that would qualify as religious under a different set of principles. \n \n \nGood for you. I assume that you are human and humans have religious beliefs.\n\n \n Some humans would be more correct. \n \n \nThe point is that lots of humans demonstrate religious behavior. Apes, dolphins and snails don't.\n\n \n And lots of humans don't, just like apes, dolphins and snails. I don't know if they do or if they don't. Therefore to clarify I ask. Sometimes people tell me they are atheists, sometime they tell me they are something else. I can't tell until I ask. \n \n \nAgain with what Huck \"would\" say. Where did he make that argument?\n\n \n He argued \"It is fairly safe to say that they do not. There is not one example of it.\" If there is no evidence for it, it therefore does not exist. There is no evidence for my religious beliefs, therefore under his argument, if there is no one example of my religious beliefs, it is fairly safe to say I do not have one. If I have no religious beliefs, I am a atheist (hard or soft take your pick). This would make many non-observable religious people atheists. Wonder how they'd like that? \n \n \nIndeed. You are arguing that maybe animals are religious based on a lack of evidence.\n\n \n Not quite. I'm arguing we cannot rule out they do or do not based purely upon observance as non-observant Jews don't have outward signs (hell, some even break many of the dietary laws and don't practice the rituals), yet have a religion meanwhile atheists have no outward signs and have no religious beliefs. Two individuals with no outward signs with radically different views on religions and God. Lack of evidence would claim in Huck's case, that both have no religious beliefs yet this is clearly wrong. \n \n \nBull! Religious beliefs in humans has been quite apparent for tens of thousands of years.\n\n \n I was referring to Diests and Non-observant Jews. Not the history of humankind. \n \n \nHow is that even relevant? How do the beliefs of native Americans infuse religion into animals? And if true, what about animals on other continents and in the oceans?\n\n \n It is relevant in that other cultures believe animals had religious beliefs. It does not mean they have them, merely that other groups in the past believed differently from us and frankly, both the native americans and us have the same amount of evidence to back our arguments up. Can you say they are wrong? \n \n \nThen why are you offended if you are a closet deist?\n\n \n Deism is kind of suppose to be closet....To be a evangelical Deist is kind of a contridiction. \n \n \nHow is Huck supposed to discern your duplicity?\n\n \n I'm glad you asked! He'd do it by asking. Again this bring us back to my point. Pure observance in Huck's argument would conclude that I have no religious beliefs. It is wrong. As I stated in my first post, asking him if he asked animals about their beliefs is the same way that Huck would discover his method of discernment was wrong about me. \n \n \nHow is that meaningful?\n\n \n It shows that observance leads to false conclusions about internal beliefs which is the basis of Huck's argument. If no examples exist, then it is 'fairly' safe to assume they [beliefs] don't exist. Marc9000 has done it and he was wrong. I see no difference here. \n \n \nExcept that your arguments are mostly what Huck \"would\" claim, rather than what he actually claims.\n\n \n Well everything in this and last post is based entirely off of \"It is fairly safe to say that they do not. There is not one example of it.\" So unless Huck wants to radically change his argument away from that central thesis, I see no fault in my arguments. \n \n \nWhat does that have to do with religion? \n\n \n Why would elephants go to die in a specificed location?

After all, your argument would dictate that based upon observance.\n\n \n I am going to try and make this simple. You are trying to equate two lines of thinking. You are trying to compare the specific observance leading to the general conclusion with the specific observance leading to the specific conclusion.\n \n I would not conclude that you are not religious. The conclusion I draw is that animals are not religious. In fact, it is an assumption that I use in my argumentation. That is what we have been arguing. At least that is what I thought you were arguing. You said the flaw in my argument was my assumption that animals are not religious. I then proceded to show you that the assumption is perfectly reasonable to make. You then tried to make it sound like a ridiculous assumption and failed miserably because YOU and YOU alone are the only one that would make that argument. \n \n You cannot equate my generalization about animals. That is: In General Animals do not have religion. Bases for this generalization is that it has never been observed ever in any animal anywhere outside of human intervention.\n \n You are saying that is the same thing as my saying that Humans, In general, have displayed relgious behaviours and OC has not. Therefore OC is not religious. Do you not see that in my argument I go from numerous specific observances to the general statement whereas you are going from the general statement to the specific observance.\n \n You have turned around your logic and it has really messed you up. You are trying to compare a line of deductive reasoning with a line of inductive reasoning. They are not parallel and therefore non comparable. \n \n Jackamara's principle that religion etc are all socially constructed is what I was answering. I had wanted his answer as to why humans display religious behaviors and animals do not. Given that animals also have social structure. TThe natural conclusion would be if social constructs cause religion etc, why is it displayed in only one social animal and no where else.\n \n You then argue that I would actually have to converse with the animals to come to that conclusion. I then argue that your argument is simply ludicrous as you assume that animals have religion based on ZERO evidence and I assume that they do not based on LOTS of Observation over generations and millenia.\n \n As for your elephant burial grounds etc, the same can be said about animals that travel to the same locality to mate or die or give birth etc. This is very easily explained by instinct. This is the simplest explanation (occam's razer). Your explanation holds no water in terms of a definition of \"religion\". \n \n You then proceeded to tell me that I had to prove that animals had no religion. I explained that one cannot logically prove the non existence of something. It is logically not possible. You then said that is ridiculous in spite of others agreeing with me and with evidentiary support posted by me.\n \n I am still waiting for you to show that animals have religion, to prove your assumption is not ridiculous. If you can do that then I might rethink my argument. However, given that you cannot as it has been a long time coming and you have still not proffered up the necessary evidence, (again the burden of proof is yours since you make the affirmative claim and you claim something outside of the simplest explanation) I will assume you are simply trying to bait me with items about siding with others or calling me an idiot or some such other ad hom argumentation.\n \n Have a nice day.\n \n Huck.",

How does one apprehend the objective reality of science, if not with the subjective brain? \n\n \n This is blatant pedanticism\n \n Science is physical; it can be physically apprehended, whereas the essence of morality, along with its theistic cousins is nothing more than an idea.

In science what passes as \"objective scientific truth\" is sometime shown to be false, this does not mean there is no \"objective scientific truth\". \n\n \n This idea of \"morality\" is I argue, instinct dressed up. Moral laws that follow from the idea of morality are conceived and constructed, and indeed deconstructed, to match the social and biological needs of the tribe. \n I agree to a universal instinct transcending time and space, as perceived and evidenced by anthropological science but the idea of a universal objective morality is a con, the secular cousin of religion.\n \ngobbledygook\n\n \n Why?\n \nI gave you the example of \" Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\", and you ignored it, so I repeat. \n \n Governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed.

Out of courtesy I will NOT laff out loud.\n \n \nChildhood sexual molestation is immoral. Any group which permits such behavior is immoral. \n\n \n This is an exemplar topic for moral or social constructivism, thank you. \n \n 100 years ago, sex with 'minors' was the standard, it was not regarded as 'immoral' as it is today in various societies. This must suggest then morality on sexual relations with minors, has shifted, has in fact evolved to meet the shifting and SUBJECTIVE sanctimonious mood of society. This proves views / morals on minors and sex are socially constructed.\n \n \nCausing unnecessary pain or suffering of an innocent person is immoral. Groups which allow this are immoral, regardless of their particular moral code. \n\n \n What about the enemy, and 'enemy combatants'. The world reality on war morality does not cohere with this point. \n \n At an individual level, humans are prohibited by both internal and external mechanisms from aggrieving the 'innocent bystander', but 'moral' and punitive prohibition is more connected to the consequences and social conditioning in that society. \n \n Morality is social conditioning, moral laws form the precepts of social conditioning.\n \n \nAbsolute, objective morality is an intensely individual occurrence.\n Two individuals, who on the surface may seem to be facing the same moral dilemma, may in fact be in very different moral situations.\n \n A roulette ball is governed by the absolute laws of physics.

I would say they do not. \n\n \n So what this is saying is the nature of morality is largely dependent on the prevailing conditions and circumstances. There is an 'objective morality' out there, and this phenomenon is subject to infinite variables, however the idea of a morality remains constant. \n \n How's this for a compromise: I will agree to the premise that the IDEA of morality is constant and is the rule rather than the exception among societies.",

It's pretty much spot on. Animals are neither moral or immoral. There social organiztion is a product of evolution and natural selection. Animals with hierarchies and pack/herd mentality could withstand attacks and starvation through not only numbers but pack/herd protection and group feeding/migration. They out lived solo hunters/feeders. Early man would have understood this to a point. Morality more likely started as a wiseman's teachings from observations of nature, evolving within the group as a simple philosophy. As more teachings became standards the wisemen would take on a holy-man type roll. And again, in time these standards would become social norms. But each social group would have similar and different social norms.\n \n Keep in mind that while religion seems to have a monopoly on morality, it usually follows social movements. Contraception, for example is still frowned upon in most Catholic settings until the apperance of aids. While still not wholely excepted to this day by the Church a blind eye is given in a global effort to stem the spread.",
