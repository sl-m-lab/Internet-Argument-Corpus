   "An article from Corpwatch:\n CorpWatchX:XBad Karma in the Gulf of Mexico Oil Disaster\n \n Someone sent me an email yesterday titled 'Oil Patch Playground' with pictures of cute bears playing on equipment, climbing ladders on sides of tanks and in an office, in Alberta. I noticed a name on the side of a truck but, couldn't quite make it out...Schl***berger.\n \n Just now, I was looking for a list of products made from petroleum and found this: Oil : Products made from oil\n notice the name at the top - Schlumberger.\n Did a search on 'Schlumberger' and found this: Home, Schlumberger emoticon_ic\n Ooh...the plot thickens!\n \n To see if there is any dirt associated with them I go to Corpwatch and find this little tidbit:\n \n \n Bad Karma in the Gulf of Mexico Oil Disaster\n \n Posted by Phil Mattera on May 10th, 2010 \n \n Originally posted on May 7 at Dirt Digger's Digest. \n \n \n Seems like BP has a partner in crime. So, why is BP taking all the heat??? emoticon_frazzled\n \n 'British Petroleum is, rightfully, taking a lot of grief for the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but we should save some of our vituperation for Transocean Ltd., the company that leased the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon drilling rig to BP. Transocean is no innocent bystander in this matter. It presumably has some responsibility for the safety condition of the rig, which its employees helped operate (nine of them died in the April 20 explosion). '",

This spill is considered the worst oil-platform spill Australia has seen. The rig leaked 400 barrels of oil a day, over ten weeks, (estimated to be 3600 tonnes) into the Timor Sea, seriously damaging the surrounding marine life. \n \n In comparison, the world's largest oil spill occurred in 1991 during The Gulf War in Kuwait, where 520 million gallons were intentionally spilt across the land and into the Persian Gulf in an attempt to stop the United States military invading the area. The spill in the Gulf of Mexico is catching up at a considerable rate, and experts believe that it is now the worst spill in US history. Upper estimates are that it's leaking 100,000 barrels of oil per day\n \n \n \n Oil spills - Australian Geographic",
