   "One goes after another so swiftly you can't take a breath between them. I am feeling grandiose political turmoil in Georgia. Its present young leader Saakashvili has a reputation of a naughty boy. His triumph in Revolution of Roses is hardly 2 years old. During this short period he 'managed' to force economy into chaos, to embitter neighbors and feud with autonomies, to start reprisals against his political opponents and so on and so forth. There's no lack of epithets for Saakashvili. He is 'aggressive and war obsessed'. He is 'maniac and paranoiac'. Definitely, he's a gift for spoiling everything, including his image. Political opponents are using unflattering epithets in open while foreign diplomats bear them in mind, which makes no difference actually. Sakashvili must be absolutely nutty to demonstrate his megalomania in meetings with high-ranking diplomats, influential businessmen and officials from European countries. Another explanation is that he thinks his status of American favorite and scornful attitude towards Europe match each other rather well. \n This is my vision. I think reality must be much worse. One European top ranking official back in Europe from a regular tour to Georgia insisted that Europe should look at Saakashvili with her eyes widely open. In the shortest time terms before the presidential election in Georgia Saakashvili must be changed for another more suitable man. This is his vision. So we are to choose right now between a new 'rose revolution' in Georgia or 'one more dictatorship' in Europe. Definitely, the first is better.",
