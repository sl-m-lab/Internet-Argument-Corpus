This 'thing' is very complicated. I don't think any Americans, myself included, can really grasp the situation in Iraq right now. We cannot rightfully determine for ourselves whether we should be optimistic or pessimistic, because we just don't know what is going on over there. We not only don't have the information to know whether we are winning this thing, or whether we can, we don't have the understanding of the 'the way things work' in the Middle East and that only obfuscates the situation more. \n \n So this is what we know: just about every day Americans die and every day Iraqis die. That's really all the information we have to guide us, and that's just simply not enough to make a judgement.\n \n But there is a crucial fact---when the American death toll rises, the support for the war wanes. Now, given that this insurgency may last for decades, I believe that eventually our short-sighted perception of 'what failure is' will force our mission to collapse amidst bad news of more and more deaths, and less and less recruits.

They both went to church and were religious. And I'm not all that religious but I didn't know that God had a character. Please explain your reasoning you took to conclude that Bush was a man of God.\n \n So basically you don't follow the individual issues, you just choose who you think is more of a man of God and pick them? Good reasoning. Not!\n \n Every politician has their own agenda, or they would not run for office. The job of an election is to decide if their agenda is closer to that of the people.\n \n \n Now on to NCLB, why do you support it? First I do want to make it clear that Kerry was for NCLB as well, and I still think it is a horrible plan. So we have a bunch of kids who apparently aren't measuring up to the standards of other nations. How do we fix that? More tests? Yep, that's right. Let's test them more. If they don't pass these tests we are going to take more time out of the kids' days to teach them how to pass the tests. We also decide to base it on race as well. For the party traditionally against Affirmative Action (I am against it as well), they seem not to care about basing performance on tests on race. Our school passed fine except that our ESOL program (English for Speakers of Other Languages I think) didn't pass the same English tests that native speakers of English had to take. We had kids coming from another country speaking no English and halfway into the year being expected to pass a tenth grade test intended for someone speaking English for a little less than 15 years. Is this fair? I don't think so. Our school didn't pass for the last 2 years because of ESOL kids and if we don't pass (the standards are rising as well, we have to do better than the bar we didn't meet the last 2 years) the state will take over the school in 2 years possibly. So to fix this almost all of our classes take time out of it to prepare for the HSA's, just practice tests from stuff we learned in first grade. We took time out of real learning to prepare for a test. We need a policy that encourages learning, not passing tests.",

The dawa party is based in Tehran (Iran), funded by the iranian government, and is still registered as a terrorist organization by the state department. The dawa party has consistently promised that once the Americans leave, they will be joining Syria and Irans mutual protection pact and will forge closer ties with Tehran.\n \n The sunnis, who have been pretty much totally disenfranchised, are a big problem, becuase there is a good chance that they will essentially fight to the last man. This would not be a problem except that so many of them are baathists (which, contrarey to popular belief, is not a party of people shredders and lunatics, it is simply the socialist party). Syria is also baathist, so they can be counted on to support their socialist brethren with arms and manpower. \n \n The US has no legitimacy left. Bushs lies about WMDs have been exposed, and confirmed by British governemtn documents. He fixed the intel, thats all there is to it. \n \n The US has a HUGE rebuilding debt that we are obligated to pay as the agressor in the conflict. The 300+ billion we have spent so far is nothing. We will be lucky to get out from under that rock for less than $1 trillion. Bush tried to weasel out from under it with a plan to rebuild using oil money. It apparently is not going to fly. Additionally, we are spendign twice what we need to because of Bushs insistence that only US firms get rebuilding contracts. Most of Iraqs oil and infrastructure components are either french, german, or russian. this means that instead of repairng them, we either have to replace them, or build one off parts, with the associated IP nightmare that comes with replicaitng another companies product. Think of it like deciding to rebuild a honda without using any japanese parts or components. \n \n The problem is that we have garnered such ill will, mainly due to Bushs efforts, that nobody wants to deal with us. Everybody in Iraq has lost a family member to the war. Most have lost at least one to starvation or disease since the war. Americans are not being viewed as saviors, but as the SOBs that killed their sons, daughters, etc....\n \n The best solution would be to get a true international coalition, preferably spearheaded and managed by the Un (since under current internationl law theya re the ones that do that sort of thing) in to rebuild the country. That means no more handouts to haliburton or other huge US companies, and most US companies would loose their contracts if they went out for an open bid. thats life. \n \n \nAs far as XXXXX, only one would assume that things get better by doing nothing in a region that has never been dealth with. the XXXXX here is the one that thinks that back in the late 40s when the west via the UN created Israel we were somehow going to avoid becoming involved in a major conflict in the middle east.\n\n \n True enough. The sreation of israel was a stupid plan. We never should have allowed it. We missed that boat, though. We should have let them be destoryed later. That ship sailed as well. Now it is time to quite protecting them form their poor foreign policy and let them sink on their own insterad of showing up with a big bag of gold every time their worthless economyy heads towards a crash.\n \n \nGeeting rid of Bush is no plan and it is no answer to my question, it is just more tripe from the side of the debate that offers no answers or options, they just bitch alot. \n \n It also proves my point that you and your kind are so wrapped up in getting rid of Bush everything else is secondary in your collective worlds.\n\n \n I advocate getting rid ofg bush because he is a lot of the problem. The entire ME is up in arms becuase of that jackass. Iran and syria have put aside their differences and formed an alliance, propped up by the russians who are selling Syria serious weapons (serious enough that military action against either one is really off the table). We can't convince the rest of the world that IRan is working on nukes, because we lied about Iraqs WMDs. The russians are also prepared to sign a contract to retrofit Iranian subs with newer, better antiu ship missiles and upgraded guidance packages and stealth packages. Polls show that the majority of people in the ME feel that the US is a threat to their nation. \n \n Getting rid of bush will certianly not slove all the problems, but it owuld certainly be the first step to solving those problems. Step into the way back machine and go all the way back to jan 20, 1981. Do you really think that the Iran hostage situation would have been resolved if Carter had been re-elected? Of course not, because he would have kept with his idiotic course of action and the situation would have kept getting worse and worse. You cannot keep dointg the same thing and expect different results. That is insanity. \n \n \nIt is why the Republicans handed the Democrats a thrashing, anyone with half a brain can see your side of the issue is excellent at pointing out what it thinks someone else is doing wrong while at the same time offering absolutely no alternative.\n\n \n Then why is it that only 34% of americans now supprt the Iraq war? Americans are not exactl known for their metal prowess. It took them this long to figure out what the hell was going on. there is no new information...we knew before the war there were no WMDs, becuase our own inspectors had told us that. Anybody with half a brain knew we were not going to be greeted with flowers and everbody was going to live happily ever after, and frankly only a complete idiot could possibly have believed that. \n \n IT takes americans a while to catch on. We just don't pay much attention as long as gas is cheap, Mc donalds is open, and our Visa is not maxed. Now people are startign to catch on. Most ofthe recent polls show a democratic congress in 2006, and if we re-ran the last presidential election today, kerry would pick up 67% of the vote...a landslide victory. Personally, I thought kerry was a wanker, too.\n \n You seem to be esentially takeing the position that a bad plan is better than no plan. sometimes if your actions are just going to make things worse, inaction is the best plan.",

Everybody in Iraq has lost a family member to the war. Most have lost at least one to starvation or disease since the war. Americans are not being viewed as saviors, but as the SOBs that killed their sons, daughters, etc....\n \n The best solution would be to get a true international coalition, preferably spearheaded and managed by the Un (since under current internationl law theya re the ones that do that sort of thing) in to rebuild the country. That means no more handouts to haliburton or other huge US companies, and most US companies would loose their contracts if they went out for an open bid. thats life. \n \n \n \n True enough. The sreation of israel was a stupid plan. We never should have allowed it. We missed that boat, though. We should have let them be destoryed later. That ship sailed as well. Now it is time to quite protecting them form their poor foreign policy and let them sink on their own insterad of showing up with a big bag of gold every time their worthless economyy heads towards a crash.\n \n \n \n I advocate getting rid ofg bush because he is a lot of the problem. The entire ME is up in arms becuase of that jackass. Iran and syria have put aside their differences and formed an alliance, propped up by the russians who are selling Syria serious weapons (serious enough that military action against either one is really off the table). We can't convince the rest of the world that IRan is working on nukes, because we lied about Iraqs WMDs. The russians are also prepared to sign a contract to retrofit Iranian subs with newer, better antiu ship missiles and upgraded guidance packages and stealth packages. Polls show that the majority of people in the ME feel that the US is a threat to their nation. \n \n Getting rid of bush will certianly not slove all the problems, but it owuld certainly be the first step to solving those problems. Step into the way back machine and go all the way back to jan 20, 1981. Do you really think that the Iran hostage situation would have been resolved if Carter had been re-elected? Of course not, because he would have kept with his idiotic course of action and the situation would have kept getting worse and worse. You cannot keep dointg the same thing and expect different results. That is insanity. \n \n \n \n Then why is it that only 34% of americans now supprt the Iraq war? Americans are not exactl known for their metal prowess. It took them this long to figure out what the hell was going on. there is no new information...we knew before the war there were no WMDs, becuase our own inspectors had told us that. Anybody with half a brain knew we were not going to be greeted with flowers and everbody was going to live happily ever after, and frankly only a complete idiot could possibly have believed that. \n \n IT takes americans a while to catch on. We just don't pay much attention as long as gas is cheap, Mc donalds is open, and our Visa is not maxed. Now people are startign to catch on. Most ofthe recent polls show a democratic congress in 2006, and if we re-ran the last presidential election today, kerry would pick up 67% of the vote...a landslide victory. Personally, I thought kerry was a wanker, too.\n \n You seem to be esentially takeing the position that a bad plan is better than no plan. sometimes if your actions are just going to make things worse, inaction is the best plan.\n\n \n \n Your first comment is stupid to begin with, I think you are taking the 'point of a gun' cliche a skosh to literally. The fact of the matter is that the government in Germany was a military governor. Macarthur was instrumental in developing the Japanes government.\n \n For your edification, since you obviously have no military background at all. Even in theatre typically military units turn in weapons to central armories when they aren't actually on a mission. So you are the one that doesn't have clue what the heck you are talking about in that regard.\n \n The UN is a mismananged pile of dung that cant be trusted with anything because in and of itself it has never succeeded in its primary mandate. Putting faith in the UN leads me to believe you don't have much of a grasp of past UN missions.\n \n We should have let Israel be destroyed? I will assume you aren't an anti-semite and that was just a poorly worded comment. The fact that they were very nearly exterminated as a people I guess is lost on your sympathies, again a demonstration of your lack of any kind of a historical perspective. \n \n You say the whole thing should be turned over to the UN because they would do a better job, and yet it was a UN commission and resolution that created Israel. Just a bit of a contradiction IMO. Did I forget to mention that the very UN you think would do a better job is the one the arabs defied in the late 40s when they first attacked Israel, hardly a precendent that builds confidence.\n \n Military action is not off the table in regards to Iran and Syria. Neither presents much of a challenge actually for a strictly military option. The real trouble is that a military option will do next to nothing for us in Syria. In Iran, it may be the only option. The negotiations with the Europeans are pretty close to petering out, and the reformist movement is dead in Iran for all practical purposes. The best we are probably going to get in the end is a military option and eliminating their strategic capability. The subs the Russians are retrofitting are junk and would be on the bottom on the gulf quickly if we exercise a military option. The strategic threat posed by Iran is easily countered, it is the asymetric threat that is not easily dealt with.\n \n People dwelled on all the same minutia in 1947 Germany and Japan. The US was overstretched, we were over committed, the occupation was floundering, blah blah. You are a hallmark of the new American public, impatient and short sighted.",

Youa re caliming there is some comparison betweent he situation in Iraq and the situation in germany and japan. In Iraq, we are getting people blown up on a daily basis years after we invaded. In Germany and japan, we were not even armed 4 months after we invaded. Get a clue.\n \n \nFor your edification, since you obviously have no military background at all. Even in theatre typically military units turn in weapons to central armories when they aren't actually on a mission. So you are the one that doesn't have clue what the heck you are talking about in that regard.\n\n \n I was in the military, genius, and a trianing officer for part of my hitch. You turn in your weapon when you are in a secure location, not when people are shooting at you (generally you are not even required to turn it in, you just don't crry it around) 120 days after invasion, both Germany and Japan had essentially been declared secyred. There was no more fighting. In theater, yes, you do not carry your weapon allt he time. In a combat zone you do. 12 das after surrender, nowhere in Germany or japan was still considered a combat zone. years after invasion of Iraq, the entire countyr is still ocnsidered a combat zone.\n \n \nThe UN is a mismananged pile of dung that cant be trusted with anything because in and of itself it has never succeeded in its primary mandate. Putting faith in the UN leads me to believe you don't have much of a grasp of past UN missions.\n\n \n Unfortunatly at this point, under international law, which we voluntarily agreed to follow, theya re still the only organization witht he legal ability to do such things.\n \n \nWe should have let Israel be destroyed? I will assume you aren't an anti-semite and that was just a poorly worded comment. The fact that they were very nearly exterminated as a people I guess is lost on your sympathies, again a demonstration of your lack of any kind of a historical perspective. \n\n \n I don't give a rats XXX that they were almost exterminated (though they were not....not even close). It has nothing to do with the present situation, nor does it have anything to do witht he creation of the state of israel, excpet for mis-placed holocaust guilt. The simple fact of the matter is that israel is largely in the position they are in because of their own polices. They peed in their cheerios. Let them eat it.\n \n \nYou say the whole thing should be turned over to the UN because they would do a better job, and yet it was a UN commission and resolution that created Israel. Just a bit of a contradiction IMO. Did I forget to mention that the very UN you think would do a better job is the one the arabs defied in the late 40s when they first attacked Israel, hardly a precendent that builds confidence.\n\n \n I said we should turn the thing over to the UN because it would lend legitimacy to the operation and because people are more likely to be willing to deal with folks who are not directly responsible for the death of their loved ones. \n \n \nMilitary action is not off the table in regards to Iran and Syria. Neither presents much of a challenge actually for a strictly military option. The real trouble is that a military option will do next to nothing for us in Syria. In Iran, it may be the only option.

The strategic threat posed by Iran is easily countered, it is the asymetric threat that is not easily dealt with.\n\n \n Wow, you have no diea what youa re talking about here, do you? Where are we going to get the troops for an invasion of either Iran or Syria? We have not been able to control the situation in Iraq. Syria has updated russian equipmet. They could actally put up a fight. They have been shipping some of that equipment to Iran. A war in either Iran or syria would bring the wrath of both, and would make vietnam look like a walk in the park. Look at the trouble we have had in Iraq, and multiply it by 10,000 and you might have some kind of idea what kind of tyrouble it would be to invade iran or syria. In Iraq, we were taking on 20 yr old russian gear and a conscript army. Iran and syria both have new gear and well trained armies. Additionally, iranian subs are more than capable fo shutting down the gulf. Even their old diesel electrics are quieter than our nuke subs (electrics are always quieter than nukes). If they lie on the bottom, the only way to find them is with active sonar, which gives away the location of your search vessel.\n \n Our military is alreayd at the end of the line dealing with just Iraq, and you want to add syria and Iran to the list?

   "Your first comment is stupid to begin with, I think you are taking the 'point of a gun' cliche a skosh to literally. The fact of the matter is that the government in Germany was a military governor. Macarthur was instrumental in developing the Japanes government.\n\n \n Really the Iraq and German situations can't be compared.Germany was a historically industralized and united country,had the basis of judical and liberal institutions in place before Hitler came to power,had a powerful middle class and a shamed population that was complient with its conquerers because it excepted that the war was mainly there fault.Iraq has recieved a fraction of the money sent to Germany,has a widespread insurgency,has a government that is seen as dependent with the US and weak,that lacks the necessary institutions and peace that are needed for democracy to flourish,has a infastructure ravaged by war and sanctions,is stuck in between historic enemies,was only held together by the firm hand of a dictator ala the Balkans and most importantly,has a people that despises the Americans and are not particurly complient and certainly not shamed.In truth Grmany and Iraq are completely different.\n \n \n\n The UN is a mismananged pile of dung that cant be trusted with anything because in and of itself it has never succeeded in its primary mandate. Putting faith in the UN leads me to believe you don't have much of a grasp of past UN missions.\n\n \n The UN is what it is because of what the US,France,Russia and GB made it into.Many of the 'failed' UN missions were US initiated like Somalia.\n \n \nWe should have let Israel be destroyed? I will assume you aren't an anti-semite and that was just a poorly worded comment. The fact that they were very nearly exterminated as a people I guess is lost on your sympathies, again a demonstration of your lack of any kind of a historical perspective.\n \n \n Sorry but using the Holocaust as an excuse for Isreal's impetous foreign policy and there repression of the Palestinians is tactless and a pure fallacy.\n \n \nMilitary action is not off the table in regards to Iran and Syria. Neither presents much of a challenge actually for a strictly military option. The real trouble is that a military option will do next to nothing for us in Syria. In Iran, it may be the only option.

The strategic threat posed by Iran is easily countered, it is the asymetric threat that is not easily dealt with.\n\n \n emoticon_wow Do you actually know what your saying?Your making no sense whatsoever.Syria and Iran are not the problem.Neither country backs terrorist groups that are intent on attcking the US homeland.Both countries have shown themselves complient with the US in the past.Syria worked heavily with the US post 9/11 in capturing al-Qaeda members and has arrested many promient Baathists on its own soil.Iran gave its blessing to the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq,has 25 middle ranked al-Qaeda members under house arrest and has stopped any Iraqi Shia revolts in Iraq,including al-Sadr's.Without Tehrans infiltration of Iraq,many of the Shia governing bodies in south Iraq would not be around today and the US would find the Iraqi Shias far less complient.Both countries do not want to see Sunni fundamentalism go unchecked and neither country wants to to see Iraq in chaos.Both countries foreign policy is tilted toward self preservation and avoiding confrontation with the US.Iran can be dealt with with a few Isreali missiles anyway.\n \n Saudi Arabia,Egypt and Pakistan are the real problems.All three of those countries are hotbeds for Islamic fundamentalism,created by there opressive and corrupt governments.Saudi Arabia is the main source for foreign fighters and funds in Iraq,while Pakistan is the same for Afghanistan.The house of saud,Mubarak and Musharraf work of the simple idea that there Wahhabist militants are better used causing trouble in Iraq and Afghanistan then at home.\n \n What's going to happen when,as is worringly possible,Mubarak's,Musharrafs and the House of Sauds governments fall to militant Islamists?Will the US have the troops to deal with such a problem?Saudi Arabia,Pakistan,Egpyt and now,thanks to Bush,Iraq are the future breeding gounds of violent anti-American islamists,not Iran or Syria.",
