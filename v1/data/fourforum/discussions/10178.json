It's meant for kids really but I like it because (apart from the fact you can zoom through it in no time!) his invented world is really unusual and while there are elements obviously based on real myths, it doesn't follow the usual patterns of mainstream fantasy.\n \n I started a 'favourite books' thread a while back which didn't really go anywhere, but I'd be genuinely interested to know what people are reading now!",

   ":) I'm reading, \"The Source\" by James A. Michener. It's an oldy and it's also a 1088 page book. ^^ My Grandy (grandma) is letting me borrow it. I'm a fourth of the way through and it's actually really good. I don't know why, but I just like challenging myself with these big-blocks of deep material. Like \"Roots\", which was also a good book. \"The Source\" is actually an author's interpretation - using archaological finds, historical texts, some science, and a little bit of imagination - of how religion itself started out and progressed over time. All religions, too. Not just one.\n \n Possible spoilers, but nothing too apocalyptic:\n \n It starts out in relatively present-day time with an archaeological dig. In the dig, tons of archaeologists are digging into a place called, \"The Tell\", with each artifact they find being noted and analyzed. Then, after all artifacts are dug up, it jumps over to the distant past - and I mean REEEALLY distant past, back when humans were still progressing through cognitive thought. Back when deities were really only referred to, not by name, but as \"spirits\". And, after each chapter, the book time-skips further and further, following each generation of one family in particular. Each chapter of time has a story and corresponds to an item found in the archaeological dig at the begginning.\n \n Spoilers over.\n \n The book takes a little while to get started, I suppose. But, it's really amazing once you've read far enough. :D I highly recommend it.",

It was an intricate plot about a group of archaeologists who through a series of unexpected events end up going back to the middle ages to rescue their professor and the adventure ensues as you are thrust into a foreign and barbaric time in history when life was both hazardous and cheap. It was an excellent read. Here's the Amazon page for Timeline. Amazon.com: Timeline: Michael Crichton: Books\n \n \n I'm currently reading a book titled \"People of the Earth\" about stone age indians in the southwest. It was written by archaeologists so it accurately depicts the life and customs of the ancestors of todays American Indians. It covers multiple tribes/villages and is dealing with religious power and the spiritual issues from the perspective of people who still thought that the sun slept at night and rose with them in the morning. It speaks to tribal conflicts and the never ending struggle for tribes to survive in the face of harsh winters, tribal attacks, and to overcome the adversities of life in an uncivilized world. Of course there are good guys and bad guys. I'm at the part now where good is just about ready to face the evil tribe for the symbol of spiritual power which the evil shaman called the dreamer is about to destroy.

   "People talk of reality imitating fiction or being stranger than fiction. The truth is that fiction is based on reality and imagination and when well done is indistinct from reality hence some characters such as Anna Karenina become 'real'. \n \n Because of fiction being truthful we can relate to the reality depicted in it. We learn about ourselves in it and about others, we see us reflected in the characters and others also. We know they are not us, but there is something of us in them and vice versa, namely there is an interaction between reality and fiction. That is why literature is art, because it is truthful, because it uncovers truths about us and about others we were not aware of. And those who search for truth and find it in literature are us the readers. And we never stop reading.\n I am reminded of a cover of an old issue of The New Yorker, (which I saved, of course) where a girl is sitting on the deck of a tour bus in New York City, reading, oblivious to the sights around her. What is more real, the buildings around her or what she is reading? The answer is simple.\n \n Yes, thoughts and events in novels, poems, songs, reflect reality for we recognize in them us and events that have happened to us.\n When browsing in Youtube, for Spanish and Latin songs I read the comments of other viewers about the songs and many say: &#8220;this song is about me, the same happened to me&#8221; or &#8220;whenever I listen to this song it reminds me of her/him etc&#8221;\n \n I didn&#8217;t like &#8220;The Womaniser (the first story in the above collection, I didn&#8217;t like the protagonist much) but near the end he has something interesting to say about Josephine, the Frenchwoman he had become infatuated with &#8212;in the end they part company though:\n \n &#8220;Behind Josephine, of course , was nothing&#8212;no fabric or mystery, no secrets, nothing he had curiosity for now. She had seemed to be a compelling woman; not a great object of sensuality, not a source of wit&#8212;but a force he&#8217;d been briefly moved by in the expectation that he could move her nearer to him.&#8221; \n \n I think that sometimes we cling for too long to someone who is not what we imagined and hoped for to be; although we realize we are wrong about that person, we can&#8217;t let go. Until the day of course when are forced to let go, to &#8220;switch off&#8221; to begin another &#8220;era&#8221; as Charlie ruminates in &#8220;The Occidentals&#8221;. Helen in &#8220;The Occidentals&#8221; did not believe in &#8220;eras&#8221; in her opinion life was a continuum. Her &#8220;era&#8221; was her whole life and it ended when she committed suicide, worn out by her losing battle with cancer and with &#8220;the change in life&#8221;. Sad ending but, I felt happy for her in a way, for she achieved everlasting peace. Death is forever.",

   "Why am I not surprised. emoticon_xdonno Here's another with a description by her of her training. :: Pawtucket Open Studios Participant ::\n I received my training as a classical painter with Ives Gammell student Paul Ingbretson. My formal training included still life, figure, portrait and \"plein-air\" . My love of light led me to train in the early impressionist school. For me, light has the ability to create movement, to live, to breath and create atmosphere.. \n \n And here's some history on Paul Ingbretson, just so you know. Paul Ingbretson - Artist, Art - Paul Ingbretson\n \n I'm sure you'll think his painting is blurry also rather than notice the fine detail as in Nadia's first painting which reflected the fine detail of black and white victorian photos on the table. You claim to appreciate art and can't recognize the talent to do that? You're a joke winny, and not a funny one.\n\n \n Hi Archie, \n \n The words Pawtucket and Central Falls caught my eye. Interesting, know those locations very well, worked there for seven years. A small world. \n \n I don't intend to get involved in your discussion about art. I readily admit to be a cultural slob. I also recommend you let Winston ramble on without any further comment. He has been trolling forums for years dispensing his \" immense knowledge and expertise\" on any subject known to man.\n \n Your last sentence describes him well.\n \n Ciao",

From the cradle to the tomb we are participants in the one and only race and that is the rat race.

The reality was that the whole world apart from politicians and the military saw this as an achievemant by mankind not just by a bunch of US pilots trying to best the Russians.\n \n In this alone it is a remarkable piece of truth.\n \n Its also both moving and funny.\n \n Go See!\n\n \n What I find interesting is the distinction he makes between nationalism and patriotism, I think he meant by nationalism, chauvinism or jingoism.\n patriotic sentiments are shamelesly used by politicians to push their private ideological agendas. A recent example of this is Bush & Co, using the resurgence of angry patriotism after 9/11 to invade Iraq, although he and his cohorts knew that there was no linkage between Iraq and 9/11 an no WOMDs\n \n You are right, those were the days. I met several Peace Corps volunteers during the 60's in Chile and they were all super.\n \n Nobody wrote that line for Armstrong, but he had it prepared beforehand. He was prepared. I think he got it perfect, specially the reference to mankind, not the USA. It was a gracious gesture, for he reached the moon on the shoulders of many giants of all nationalities. For without science, European science we would still be riding horse carts. \n And a former Nazi Herr Von Braun was instrumental in the project.\n \n The difference between Vietnam and the present is that people from all social classes were drafted whereas now is just the poor who are the cannon fodder who volunteer for economic reasons and also (same thing) to be elligible for free college education.\n I'd do the same if I were in their shoes. It is a lottery of course to come back in one piece.\n Since now the 'chattering classes' are not affected, they keep silent.\n after all the poor are poor because they like being poor. It is all their fault right?\n Lucky they got Wal-Mart. :)\n \n I was shocked by the images of New Orleans, of corpses floating in the putrid waters, of people abandoned on roads and bridges just because they were Black and poor or was it the other way around, because they were poor and Black?\n The whole world saw these images.\n I haven't got a chance to see the Spike Lee movie you mentioned.",

The filmmaker then evaluates the overwhelming measures that must be taken for the area to rebound and recover fully, demonstrating time and again that this seems an unlikely prospect in the immediate future. Act One covers the events that immediately preceded Katrina's onslaught of horror, with an in-depth exploration of the Bush administration and FEMA's joint failures to understand the potential calamity at hand. Lee picks up this subtopic again and makes it the central focus of Act Two, which expands into a dissection of the government agencies' failure to respond to the crisis with adequate measures; time and again, the director fills his frame, in this segment, with images and indications of naked human indifference \"When The Levees Broke \"\n \n When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com\n\n You surely have seen all episodes of the series.\n \n \n \nOne week after Katrina, a new dimension of the catastrophe is coming to the fore.

Period.\n \n \n \n Have you taken them to task?\n\n \n Long before the Bush administration, it was a well known fact that the levees would not be able to withstand a category 5 hurricane. In fact, money was given to the city to upgrade the levees, but the Democrats in charge did nothing.\n \n The Bush administration declared New Orleans a disaster area something like 3 or 4 days before the hurricane hit the coast, an unprecedented action. This effectively allowed the local governments (Democrats) to request any aid from the federal government and make plans to evacuate the city. They completely dropped the ball.\n \n The people who chose to stay despite the warnings got what they deserved.\n \n The Bush administration sent in the national guard to rescue people foolish enough to ignore the warnings, or the people who wanted to stay so they could rob and loot abandoned shops. \n \n The results of Hurricane Katrina are really no different than other hurricanes that have devastated the lands. In fact, if the levees had held, we wouldn't even be talking about this today. The maintenance of the levees fell under the jurisdiction of the local Democratic government. They failed miserably and many people died.\n \n The only reason Hurricane Katrina was covered was because there was a Republican as president and there were a lot of black people in New Orleans. It was made out to be a racial issue, but few people bothered to examine the history of New Orleans or the levees, or the way other areas devastated by hurricanes were treated. People are still homeless from Hurricane Andrew. Where is the coverage of that?\n \n You can blame the Bush administration all you want, but all it does is show your biased and ignorance. Perhaps it is easier for you to blame one thing in order to avoid the complexities that inevitably surround any issue of this magnitude. I assure you, whatever the Bush administration did wrong, it pales in comparison to the New Orleans officials who failed to upgrade the levees despite being repeatedly warned of their weakness.

   "Well, Winston, you and I agree on Katrina and how disastrously the Bush administration handled things. It was criminal, IMO, and I think for many Americans, their sentiments encapsulated by that moment a woman came up to Condi Rice in NYC when she was buying shoes. And confronted her in what was also a very NYer fashion.\n \n If you get a chance to see Spike Lee's piece, I think you'd find it commendable. I don't know if you've seen any of his other films, but he's unique and groundbreaking among American filmmakers. One of my favorites is still, \"Do The Right Thing.\" <Spoiler Alert<< We were earlier discussing (was it this thread or another?) racial/ethnic slurs and ad hominems. He has a scene in that movie -- it takes place in the melting pot of Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn -- during a very hot summer where ethnic tensions are climbing -- where the camera zooms in on one character after the next, each of a different heritage/s, each letting forth a barage of slurs facing directly into the camera. It's an interesting and powerful exploration of prejudice, as I recall from viewing it.\n \n Going back to books, for a moment, especially since we're discussing southern hurricanes, a terrific novel with a southern hurricane scene is Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora Neale Hurston. If you take Alice Walker's literary views with any significance (she is the writer who won the Pulitzer for The Color Purple that Steven Spielberg made into a film), she said that it was the most important book to her. Meaning, I suppose, influence upon her, as a writer.\n \n But I found it just an extraordinary piece of literature. (Though I'm not a southerner, so I can't speak with that perspective. Nor have I ever been in a hurricane, nor do I wish to ever experience it. Alice Walker is native to Georgia, however.)\n \n Some of the people who stayed had been in hurricanes before, and my impression was that their motivations were partly what one would think appeals to libertarian sentiments. That is, they regarded the government and its opinions with a grain of salt, they were staying with their homes, they'd been through this before, they had a kind of fierce independence, rather, not *dependence* on the government. Some were quite well-to-do, as well. Fats Domino, for example, the famous musician, rode out the storm and was rescued from his rooftop (or whatever), by helicoptor.",

We had been in Australia only for a couple of years and because we had a small child could only go to drive-ins (weren&#8217;t they fun?) and there we saw it. Quite an appropriate setting don&#8217;t you think?\n I have it in DVD now. If you look very closely and attentively there is a shot where you can see Spielberg sitting on the back seat of the car, directing the cameraman.\n \n What I remember about Jaws is Quint (Robert Shaw) running his finger nails down the black-board. Didn&#8217;t that grab your attention. Just remembering gives me shivers.\n It is a suspenseful film and the score is a piece of genius.\n \n What I liked the best about Spielberg movies are not the action parts, but the quiet family scenes, with people sitting at a table, eating or having a drink and simply talking. He got it perfect, they dialogue is so natural, so warm and realistic.\n Think about the scene in Jaws where Matt (Richard Dreyfuss) drops in with a couple of bottle of wine into the Chief Brody&#8217;s home and the three of them just talk.\n Or the quiet scene at sea where Matt and Quint show off their battle scars and Quint reminisces about the war in the Pacific.

   "I haven't seen all of those. I suspect Spike Lee was influenced by (among others) the Italian director who did all those spaghetti westerns. So I can see why one might associate there.\n\n \n You mean, Sergio Leone? I don't think so. I read a long article about Spike Lee, his life and films and he was not influenced by him. What I meant, was that if an Italian had directed \"Do The Right Thing\" he would have been accused of bias.\n \n \nI don't recall \"straight\". I think Jaws was a lot of fun, considering it was his first, and low budget, where is where you see some terrific ingenuity in directors. I think Spielberg has been terrific (I don't know what he's making lately). He really delivers to his audience, though. Tells people they can, indeed, think and reach the impossible. \n\n \n By 'straight' I mean his straight forward movies not the pretentious ones such as &#8220;Saving Private Ryan&#8221;, &#8220;Munich&#8221;, and &#8220;Schindler&#8217;s list&#8221;.\n \n \n With the exception of New Orleans, my experiences traveling in the south, for the greater part, have not been positive. But there are plenty of southern writers and intellectuals I like very much. Another example, Mark Twain. Don't you like his work? I suppose the south produces some of the worst garbage, yet sometimes, some of the best thinkers in America, too.\n\n \n \n There are intelligent people everywhere of every race and gender. My favourite American contemporary writer David Foster Wallace is/was from the Midwest, from Illinois. Neruda was born and raised in the little town of Parral, in a little country at the end of the world &#8212;Parral is a town I&#8217;ve driven through countless times and never stopped to visit his home.\n I like seasons, and that is one thing we don&#8217;t have much of in Sydney. Yes, the days lengthen and shorten and the sun also varies its path. But the weather is so gentle that the main difference between summer and winter is the variation in temperature. We planted various deciduous trees in our back yard and a Californian liquid amber (extremely popular in Santiago) on the front yard, to &#8216;mark&#8217; the stations. Because I like seasons I wouldn&#8217;t like to live in the American south, in a sweaty, moist, swampy region. \n And the prevalent racism is too much for me.\n Did you see the movie &#8220;Driving Miss Daisy&#8221;? if the south is like depicted in that movie, thanks but no thanks.",

   "Well, Winston, you and I agree on Katrina and how disastrously the Bush administration handled things. It was criminal, IMO, and I think for many Americans, their sentiments encapsulated by that moment a woman came up to Condi Rice in NYC when she was buying shoes. And confronted her in what was also a very NYer fashion.\n\n Aboslutely. What in the world was she thinking going on with her life at a time like that? Especially being the director of FEMA and all, you would think she would have taken her responsibilities seriously. But no...she just buys shoes and continues to deal with foreign policy like it was her job or something. The nerve of some people huh? \n \n \n \nthey had a kind of fierce independence, rather, not *dependence* on the government.\n\n Sure they were independent...until after the storm when they all had to be rescued. Funny how all the sudden they were dependent on the government for help, and then complained about how long it took to be rescued. \n \n And to speak to your other point, it should not matter how many times they have been through hurricaines before. If you decide to place youself in known danger despite numerous warnings and against what most people would call common sense, don't then have the nerve to complain about your situation when you get bit on the XXX. If you don't help yourself, you should not expect others to help you either. People call it tragic that so many had to be rescued off their roofs, and that so many died. I call it passive eugenics. \n \n Do you smell that? *sniff* More air for me!",

They should be able to effectively execute these plans when faced with an imprending crisis. \n \n In the case of NO, prior planning seemed almost non-existent. Nagin should have ordered the evacuation the moment the National Hurricaine Center predicted Katrina to strengthen to a Cat 4 storm on the 26th. Instead, he waited 2 more days, and only ordered the mandatory evac after the storm had been upgraded to a Cat 5 and there was only 24 hours before landfall. Nagin all but admitted that the buses were not going to be used for the evacuation by stating that they were moved to a parking lot that had never flooded in previous storms, indicating that he intended them to be there during and after the storm. Later he back-tracked and claimed that he had no drivers to drive the buses out of the city for an evacuation. Again...that is a major gap in disaster planning...and as mayor of the city, he is responsible to see that these steps are taken. He failed dramatically. Nagin even balked at using school buses to evacuate residents, and instead requested that Greyhound Bus Lines pull all of the buses they have in the country and bring them immediately to NO to evacuate his residents. I guess saving lives took a back seat to comfort. \n \n The National Response Plan (the plan current during Katrina) stated: \n \n \nWithin the United States, the responsibility for natural disaster planning and response follows a cumulative structure in which responsibility first falls on local governments. When a local government has exhausted its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process then proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified.\n\n \n Clearly, the local government had not exhausted it's resources. Food and water sat in food banks and stores rather than being routed to shelters (like the superdome), and buses sat flooded in parking lots rather than moving people out of the city. Nagin and the local government were negligent in their duties to the citizens of NO. Don't get me wrong, the response was poor all the way up the chain, but Nagin and the local government had the first and most important responsiblity of a governing agency of moving people out of the way and providing for those that could not be moved. They failed...badly. \n \n Sadly many of NO's best resources, it's people, chose to become victims rather than being responsible for themselves and getting out of the city.",

   "I watched the short film \"The Red Ballon\" today. (Another short French masterpiece is \"La Jetee\" by Chris Carter, shot in 1962).\n \n \"The Red Balloon,\" which is only thirty-four minutes long, is an utterly charming little story of a small Parisian lad and a balloon-a balloon he finds one day, lurking around a lamp-post, while he is on his way to school, and which takes a fancy to him and follows him thereafter like a loving stray dog.\n \n It is a thoroughly simple story of something incredible that could not occur except in the bright imagination of an artist such as Albert Lamorisse, the young (in 1956) Frenchman who made the memorable short \"White Mane\" and who wrote, produced and directed this. Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them.\n \n This little film, which won a special award at the Cannes Festival, is without dialogue. Its sound track has merely music, random voices and street sounds.\n \n Paris looks old, worn out and poor. A city poised between the past (the relatively recent war) and the future. The opening shot of the city from one of the hills is a beauty. I wish I could have framed it and hanged it on the wall. It is something Camille Pissarro could have painted.\n \n When one feels lonely, art doesn't help for it seems to reinforce the sadness and melancholy one carries inside . But what the heck! one can't live without art be it visual (photography, paintings, films) or the written word, or music.\n Without art life becomes empty, it stops. With art life is.\n \n One of my New Year's resolutions is not to waste more time arguing in forums. I intend to keep it.\n \n Adios.",
