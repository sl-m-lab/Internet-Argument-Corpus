   "This study, featuring empirical research on non-clinical gay males, was the first of its kind. It called into question the diagnoses of adjustment disorders in homosexual persons, as well as the objectivity of social scientists.\n \n ....\n She administered three personality tests, including the Rorshach ink-blot test, to thirty pairs of men--one homosexual, one not--matched by IQ level, age, and other factors. These tests were accepted by the community of medical and mental health professionals as indicating the presence of emotional and mental disorders. Presumably, homosexual persons would be easy to differentiate owing to the presence of pathology.\n \n Hooker turned the results of the tests over to a panel of three prominent experts, asking them to diagnose which of the sixty men had a psychiatric disorder, as revealed by the test. She further asked these experts to determine which of the men in each pair was homosexual, not having indicated beforehand that any might be, or the ulterior motive behind this research. The experts concluded that the gay males were no worse, and sometimes better adjusted than the rest, and proved unable to identify correctly the gay male in each pair.\n \n On its face, this research suggested that the assumption that homosexuals were necessarily psychiatrically disordered is erroneous; what is more, it suggested that such diagnoses of disorder may be based not on objective fact, but, instead, may be grounded in popular stereotype.\n \n Hooker concluded from her research that the patterns of homosexuality are as varied and as complex as those of heterosexuality, and that one cannot assume that homosexuals can be easily distinguished from heterosexuals on the basis of emotional and psychological adjustment.\n \n In her 1957 essay she offered the following summation of her research findings: \"[W]hat is difficult to accept (for most clinicians) is that some homosexuals may be very ordinary individuals, indistinguishable, except in sexual pattern, from ordinary individuals who are heterosexual. Or--and I do not know whether this would be more or less difficult to accept--that some may be quite superior individuals, not only devoid of pathology but also functioning at a superior level.\"http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/hooker_e.html",

   "Hooker used three different psychological tests for her study: the TAT, the Make-a-Picture-Story test (MAPS test), and the Rorschach inkblot test.\n \n After a year of work, Hooker presented a team of 3 expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles. She decided to leave the interpretation of her results to other people so as to avoid her own prejudice.\n \n First, she contacted Bruno Klopfer, an expert on Rorschach tests to see if he would be able to identify the sexual orientation of people through their results at those tests. He couldn't.\n \n Then Edwin Shneidman, creator of the MAPS test, also analyzed the 60 profiles. It took him six months and he too found that both groups were highly similar in their psychological make-up.\n \n The third expert was Dr Mortimer Mayer who was so certain he would be able to tell the two groups apart that he went through the process twice.\n \n The three evaluators agreed that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group.\n \n In 1956 Hooker presented the results of her research in a paper delivered to the American Psychological Association's convention in Chicago.\n \n Hooker was the first social scientist to do research and write on the gay community.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Hooker\n \n I think the last sentence is extremely telling.\n She was the \"first social scientist to do research and write on the gay community\".\n An objective observer should quickly question HOW people could claim \"gay\" is a \"mental illness\" when there was NO RESEARCH on it in the first place...\n \n People attack her and her work with absurd and pointless claims.\n What she did was INCREDIBLY simple, and the legitimacy of the test should be recognized based on the simplicity of the underlying assumption she refuted, and the lack of foundation of that original assumption.\n \n If you have a \"Group B\" that you claim are mentally deficient (below 80 IQ), and then you mix up Group A (average intelligence) with Group B and ask EXPERTS of intelligence to determine the difference...\n ... and WHEN THEY CANNOT find the difference ...\n ... then obviously the original assumption is refuted!\n \n The fact that NOBODY did ANY research to attempt to show that \"Group B\" had \"below 80 IQ\" in the first place should tell you something about the assumption...",

   "Archie is trying to disrupt another thread on whether or not homosexuality is a mental illness by attacking Dr Evelyn Hooker's work.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=323223&postcount=18\n He is doing this by quoting a WHITE SUPREMACIST (or what Archie refers to as \"independent\" sources)...\n I address the foolishness raised in the preceding post in the PROPER thread.\n \n Now. On to the dishonest claims that Archie repeats:\n \"Hooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\"\n 1) Hooker DID select two groups of men: One homosexual and one heterosexual.\n 2) Hooker DID match them for characteristics, in that they were \"typical\" homosexual / heterosexuals.\n 3) There is NO scientific standard requiring the participants to be \"ignorant\" to the purpose of the study. While that may be useful for SOME scientific tests, it is NOT a requirement.\n \n \n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society&#8217;s attitudes towards homosexuality. She later boasted publicly that, &#8220;I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.&#8221; [14 American Psychologist, April 1993 Vol. 48, No. 4, 450-453] She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests.\n 1) Again, there is no loss of legitimacy in the participants knowing the purpose of the study.\n Do you think cancer victims testing new cancer treatments are ignorant of the studies they are involved in??? emoticon_xdonno\n 2) I already explained the purpose of making sure the participants, BOTH straight AND gay, were free from other pathologies.\n And it should be common sense to anybody with half a brain.\n Would it make sense to do a study on depression by including participants who suffer from schizophrenia??? NO!\n And here, the question is whether or not HOMOSEXUALITY ITSELF is a mental illness, so it makes sense to ensure that NO other mental issues are involved, so the ONLY question on the table is the HOMOSEXUALITY of half of the participants.\n 3) Gee. She was confident in the results of her study.\n Let's hang her already for the audacity of having an understanding of what she thinks the outcome will be...\n \n \n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report.\n 1) Gee. The experiment made Hooker LEARN THINGS!\n How AWFUL for an EXPERIMENT to actually give the EXPERIMENTER INFORMATION.\n What's truly funny in all this is how Archie quotes this junk like it's actually talking about a problem...\n 2) The article blatantly lies.\n NONE of the three tests distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals.\n I've already quoted that.\n I can REPEATEDLY provide LEGITIMATE resources (not \"I'm a white racist supremacist web-site\" \"independent\" emoticon_xdonno ) that show ALL THREE TESTS were utilized in the conclusion.\n \n 3) \"proved her hypothesis was wrong\"?\n The author of this article is not only a WHITE SUPREMACIST, but he's also stupid.\n The point of the experiment WAS NOT to figure out which ones were gay and which ones were straight.\n It was to determine which ones suffered from a MENTAL ILLNESS.\n The thinking behind this idiocy is that if a person can go out onto the town, spot a \"gay\" person who has pronounced \"gay\" qualities, then that makes homosexuality a mental illness???? emoticon_xdonno\n NO!!!\n The people evaluating the tests had to determine if the people were mentally ill. They could NOT just assume \"gay =< mentally ill\".",

   "Well, Archie has posted another lie in the other thread, and another attempt to derail the subject of that thread.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=323231&postcount=19\n \n Like I said, I will address the \"complaints\" he has about Hooker's study here, although it is increasingly transparent that he is going to ignore the responses. Ignore the truth...\n \n Let's address Archie's complaints...\n 1) ...Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals...\n This has already been explained. REPEATEDLY.\n Would it make sense to do a study on depression by including participants who suffer from schizophrenia??? NO!\n And here, the question is whether or not HOMOSEXUALITY ITSELF is a mental illness, so it makes sense to ensure that NO other mental issues are involved, so the ONLY question on the table is the HOMOSEXUALITY of half of the participants.\n What this complaint is REALLY asking is like having a test to see if a drug causes people to be ill with nauseau...\n And then you incorporate people who are ALREADY NAUSEAUS into the study.\n \n 2) ...Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.\n Say Whaaa?\n HOW is it not \"consistent\", and is the claimed \"inconsistency\" in ANY WAY SIGNIFICANT.\n We might as well get after her for spelling mistakes...\n \n 3) Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.\n A meaningless complaint.\n The only real curiousity in this is whether or not the people WERE gay OR straight.\n \n 4) ... several errors in her mathematical calculations ...\n Geez. I was joking about the spelling mistakes.\n But evidently they go for \"math mistakes\".\n Do the math mistakes IN ANY WAY CHANGE the outcome of her study? \n Considering the author doesn't even try to claim that, the obvious answer is no.\n \n 5) Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.\n There are some key-words that clue me in that the author of different things have NO REAL KNOWLEDGE of what they are talking about.\n Like here. A PSYCHOLOGICAL experiment talking about \"normal\".\n The issue at hand was whether or not the gay people involved were MENTALLY ILL. Being \"normal\" is irrelevant.\n The APA didn't say \"Gays are normal!\". They said \"Homosexuality is not a mental illness\".\n Furthermore, the second statement is just as idiotic as the first.\n The study WAS NOT DESIGNED to do that.\n And as later research has shown, due to GREATER PREJUDICE AND BIGOTRY in society, gays experience more STRESS which cause them to have higher per capita problems in different areas.\n Examining whether they are \"just as stable\" WAS NOT a valid prospect of this research, because it was WELL BEYOND THE SCOPE of this research.\n This research dealt with ONE issue. Is homosexuality a mental illness?\n That's it. That's ALL it needed to deal with, cause it was actually a HUGE question in the first place.\n \n 6) Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration and evaluation of the Rorschach.\n This is also an idiotic complaint.\n (And as a side-note, please remember that Archie's ORIGINAL claim is \"fraudulent\", and NONE of these complaints show ANY fraud. They are just menial mewling.)\n If there is something wrong in what she ACTUALLY DID, then show it.\n But the truth of the matter is that there was an INDEPENDENT EXPERT EVALUATING the test, so if HE found anything wrong, THAT should be taken as something.\n Since he did NOT, it's obvious she didn't make a mistake.\n \n 7) On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.\n Again, already addressed. And it's funny to note how foolish this complaint is...\n The judges WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW who was gay and who was straight.\n So if a couple of male subjects talked about having a male partner, (which is hardly \"could not refrain\"), the CONTROL of the experiment is hurt.\n The judges COULD NOT KNOW who was gay and who was straight because it would BIAS their conclusions on the \"mental health\" of the participants.",

   "Her most significant work was a paper delivered in 1956 to the American Psychological Association in Chicago and published the next year as ''The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual'' in The Journal of Projective Techniques. \n \n Dr. Hooker administered three standard personality tests, including the Rorschach ink-blot test, to two groups of 30 men, one heterosexual, one homosexual, who had been matched in I.Q.'s, age and education levels. \n \n She then asked a panel of expert clinicians to assess the results without knowing the subjects' sexual orientation. To their surprise, the judges were unable to discern between the two groups on the basis of the test. \n \n ''The most striking finding of the three judges,'' Dr. Hooker wrote, ''was that many of the homosexuals were very well adjusted. In fact, the three judges agreed on two-thirds of the group as being average to superior in adjustment. Not only do all homosexuals not have strong feminine identification, nor are they all 'somewhat paranoid,' but, according to the judges, some may not be characterized by any demonstrable pathology.'' http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE0DF173DF931A15752C1A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all\n \n This is at the heart of what Dr Hooker did that some people cowardly avoid with false claims of \"fraud\".\n Up until Dr Hooker's experiment, the \"homosexuals\" that psychiatry saw were the gays SEEKING MENTAL TREATMENT for one reason or another.\n \n It would be like having Group X only being known by the medical community whenever they went to the hospital, ergo the medical community ASSUMED that Group X was typified by being in ill health.\n A rather shoddy assumption, but one indicative of the reality of the pre Dr Hooker psychology analysis.\n Dr Hooker's research was the FIRST major research study on homosexuals.\n \n And the thing of it is that some people try to cowardly undermine her work with false claims of \"fraud\" by quoting White Supremacists and other obviously biased groups. But the truth of the matter is that her work has REMAINED ACCEPTED by the mainstream of the psychology / psychiatry community.\n \n The conclusions are really irrefutable.\n I have tried repeatedly to ask Archie if he disagrees with her conclusions, and he cannot bring himself to give an honest answer. emoticon_xdonno\n \n The impact of that fact should not be lost on people.\n We could REPEAT this study, using the scientific method, and come away with the SAME RESULTS today.\n And it would be just as valid.

   "The Satinover article (and other article that just talks about the 25 page Satinover article) relies on some of Satinover's lies that he has told over the years.\n Lies about how the APA came about its decision to remove homosexuality as a mental illness...\n \n A LOT of them are refuted in this article which shows not only the lies of Satinover, but a variety of other gay-obsessed people ...\n It's a fascinating read that demonstrates the breadth of the anti-gay lie machine, and their attempt to obfuscate the simple fact that homosexuality IS NOT a mental illness. I can't post all of it here (cause there are a LOT of lies that it covers), but anybody who is interested can read the rest at the web-site...\n \n http://www.ralliance.org/TVC_APA.html\n The next TVC claim is, \"After much political pressure, a committee of the APA met behind closed doors in 1973 and voted to remove homosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM-II. Opponents of this effort were given 15 minutes to protest this change, according to Dr. Jeffrey Satinover, in Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth.\"\n \n This is nothing but an outrageous and deliberate misrepresentation of what actually took place. As Bayer documents, the APA's Nomenclature Committee met in \n \n February of 1973. Among those present at the meeting, Dr. Seymour Halleck stressed that there was no scientific evidence supporting the theory that homosexuality was a developmental disorder. He stated that homosexuality should be considered a \"common behavior[al] variant.\" He stated that \"deletion of the diagnosis of homosexuality is not only a humanistic step, it is dictated by the best scientific information available.\" Dr. Wardell Pomeroy, a collaborator with\n \n Kinsey, presented sections of the 1948 study that had been sharply critical of psychiatric orthodoxy. He suggested that psychiatry should have accepted those conclusion 25 years earlier and said \"I have high hopes that even psychiatry can profit by its mistakes and can proudly enter the last quarter of the twentieth century.\" Dr. Alan Bell or the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University presented his own work and that of Evelyn Hooker. He stated that well-adjusted homosexuals and heterosexuals have more in common than disturbed and well-adjusted persons of either sexual orientation. Charles Silverstein presented the work of many scientists showing that the DSM classification was not consistent with a scientific perspective. His presentation included the work of Freud, Evelyn \n \n Hooker, Alfred Kinsey, Ford and Beach, Marmor, Green, and Hoffman. In conclusion, Silverstein stated \"I suppose what we're saying is that you must choose between the undocumented theories that have unjustly harmed a great number of people and continue to harm them and ... controlled scientific studies..\n \n It is no sin to have made an error in the past, but surely you will mock the principles of scientific research upon which the diagnostic system is based if you turn your backs on the only objective evidence we have.\" (Bayer, pp. 118-121)\n \n Socarides and Bieber were quick in their attempt to resist the winds of change. They formed an Ad-Hoc Committee Against the Deletion of Homosexuality from DSM-II. On April 9, Bieber wrote to the medical director of the APA requesting that a committee be formed to review any decision of the Nomenclature Committee. \n \n Socarides and Bieber enrolled some psychoanalytical societies to their foundering cause. In March, 1973, the Council of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine passed a resolution in opposition to change in the DSM-II citing the old theories and without presenting factual data. One week later the board of trustees of the Karen Horney Institute (followers of Socarides and Bieber) passed an identical resolution to that of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine... also without any supporting data. In May, the American Psychoanalytic Association voted to urge a delay in any action regarding the classification of homosexuality in the DSM-II. (Bayer, pp 121-122)\n \n In March of 1973, the APA's Northern New England District Branch passed a resolution calling for the deletion of homosexuality from the DSM-II. Shortly afterwards, the Northern New England District's resolution was endorsed by the entire APA Area Council 1, including all of New England, Quebec, and Ontario. Bayer, pp.122-123)\n \n The APA's Nomenclature Committee went through an 11-month process by preparing a report recommending the change in DSM-II. It was first presented to the APA's Council on Research and Development. The Council unanimously recommended deletion of homosexuality from DSM-II. Next, it was taken to the Assembly of District Branches, where it was again approved. The next step was the APA Reference Committee, composed of the heads of the various APA councils and the president-elect. The Reference Committee endorsed the proposal, leaving the approval of the board of trustees at the December meeting as the final step. (Bayer, pp. 132-138)\n \n Midway through the 11-month process, Robert Spitzer presented a panel discussion at the May 1973 meeting of the association. The members of the panel were Charles Socarides, Irving Bieber, Judd Marmor, Richard Green, Robert Stoller, and Ronald Gold. The session had a huge attendance. At its conclusion, it seemed apparent to observers that the old theories would not prevail. (Bayer, pp. `24-126)\n \n For the final stage of the process, the APA Board of Trustees invited the three most vocal opponents of change, Socarides, Bieber, and McDevitt, to present their case a third time on December 10, 1973. Bieber restated the old theories without presenting data. Socarides and McDevitt complained that the change in classification was motivated by politics, not by scientific studies. Following those presentations, the Board of Trustees met in executive session and voted to approve the removal of homosexuality from DSM-II. (Bayer, pp. 135-138)\n \n Ronald Bayer notes (p. 139) \"Stung by the significance of the ideological rebuff they had suffered, those who continued to view homosexuality as pathological perceived themselves as having been expelled from the center of psychiatric authority.\" \n \n \n TVC then quotes another huge distortion of truth written by Jeffrey Satinover. \n \"Satinover writes that after this vote was taken, the decision was to be voted on by the entire APA membership.\"\n \n Again, this is nothing but an outrageous distortion of the truth. As Bayer documents, Socarides and Bieber once again mobilized their Ad-Hoc Committee Against the Deletion of Homosexuality from DSM-II. They poured over the associations by-laws and found a provision designed to provide some democratic control over the association's corporate life, and then forced a petition demanding a referendum of the Association's membership. Amazingly, those who accused the APA of capitulating to political pressure were now themselves forcing a political maneuver and using a loophole in a provision for non-scientific matters to accomplish their end. They obtained 200 signatures on their petition. After much discussion and criticism of the unseemly political maneuvering of Socarides' committee, the association decided to let them have their way. Ballots were mailed out during April, 1974. Of those responding, only 37% were opposed to the removal of homosexuality from the DSM-II. It was a clear endorsement for the change.

   "What is relevant is that you have submitted 2 obituaries as evidence of Hookers accomplishments rather than any scientific or even one credible objective source that endorsed her study as valid, or honestly carried out. her methodology broke all the rules of a scientific study and all you can do is attack my sources in order to tear down the information they offer.\n\n 1) The obituaries gave serious information as to HOW the studies were conducted, which refute some of the lies put out by your \"articles\".\n \n 2) YOUR ARTICLES ADMIT that Hooker's work is used in NUMEROUS other research articles out there.\n WHY should I have to give \"evidence\" of something that YOUR ARTICLES already admit is true???\n \n 3) Her methodology broke no rules.\n It has already been explained that telling the participants the point of the tests does not invalidate the test.\n If we had a scientific test on a cancer treatment, would it invalidate the results to tell the participants what we were doing? emoticon_xdonno\n Some of the complaints your articles raise are just plain dumb.

Cameron's study. In other words, Bennett is not adducing a second authority for his assertions but merely falling back on the first via its recycling by another writer.http://slate.msn.com/id/2098/#sb42771\n \n The funny thing is that the issue of Paul Cameron's fraud has come up before, and as I recall you DID NOT EVEN TRY to refute that it was fraudulent.\n But here you are, repeating other people's lies... emoticon_frazzled",

   "Dr. Satinover is a psychiatrist and also a physicist. He is the Director of the Durckheim-Gladstone International Center for Quantitative Analysis (ICQA) in Washington, D.C.\n\n I have to chuckle...\n If you google \"Durckheim-Gladstone International Center for Quantitative Analysis\", you get FOUR hits.\n Out of the entire internet, just FOUR measly hits.\n EVERY one simply saying *Satinover is the Director of the Durckheim-Gladstone International Center for Quantitative Analysis...\n I am underwhelmed by this man's lack of importance...\n \n \n \n...false claims, lack of scientific expertise, lack of clinical experience, fabrication of evidence, and obvious bias that characterize the behaviour of the homosexual activists who, in 1973, succeeded in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from their official list of mental disorders.\n\n Blah, blah, blah, blah...\n I am routinely bored by how much these articles TALK about doing something, and then thoroughly fail to follow through.\n \n \n \nIn 1957 psychologist Evelyn Hooker wrote a paper that claimed to show that homosexuality is normal.\n\n Again, I have to laugh at how the UNEDUCATED reveal themselves.\n This was NOT about \"normal\". This is about the CLASSIFICATION of \"mental illness\", and whether \"gay\" automatically qualifies.\n The failure to recognize what is REALLY going on here underlies the lack of knowledge of the people on the subject they presume to speak on.\n \n \n \nAcceding to pressure, the APA in 1971, sponsored a panel, not on the subject of homosexuality, but a panel whose membership was composed of homosexuals. The fact that these panel members were homosexuals was the sole factor that was purported to enable them to speak as professionals. \n The role of that panel of activists was to put pressure on the APA, by disrupting its activities if necessary, to secure an appearance before the APA's crucial Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics, responsible for publishing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\n In reading this, I can't help but think this guy is just looney.\n They claim that the APA CREATED a panel with the PURPOSE of DISRUPTING the APA's activities...\n There is just absolutely no basis for these claims...\n \n The REAL story is that the panel was created to SHOW EXAMPLES OF AVERAGE HOMOSEXUALS. \"At the same convention, there was a panel discussion titled \"Lifestyles of Non-Patient Homosexuals\"\"\n \n They were there to show what typical homosexuals were REALLY like. It would have been COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE if this panel had made its purpose to be disruptive.\n \n Furthermore, to explain the REAL story: \"They also don't tell you that the anti-gay atmosphere of the APA was so intense that one of its members called for police to come and shoot those protesting a lecture on \"aversion therapy\" techniques during the 1971 convention. (Bayer, p. 103)\" http://www.ralliance.org/TVC_APA.html\n \n \nJudd Marmor was now the APA Vice-President, while the President-elect was a homosexual who would keep this fact secret.\n\n I can't help but laugh at the fact that they WILL NOT EVEN SAY THE NAME of the person they accuse of being gay.\n Primarily because once they give the name, people can google and find out he is NOT gay.\n The APA had a person who spoke called \"Doctor Anonymous\" who spoke on terms of anonymity because of fear for HIS safety.\n \n \n \nA group of outside activists and gay psychiatrists and psychologists presented the Committee with arguments made by Evelyn Hooker and Alfred Kinsey that homosexuality was not associated with psychopathology and that all other studies on homosexuality were intrinsically flawed, because of sampling bias.\n\n What @%#* is this???\n There WERE NO OTHER REAL EXISTING STUDIES on \"homosexuality\" before this.\n There were studies that revolved around people who had mental problems, who sought treatment for those mental problems, who HAPPENED TO BE gay.\n But NO study on actual homosexuals who weren't \"mentally ill\".\n \n \n \nIn reporting to the APA, the Nomenclature Committee failed to make any reference to studies critical of the Hooker and Kinsey evidence.\n\n This is just blatantly false on multiple levels.\n 1) They did take into account other studies that were critical.\n 2) The other studies LACK SCIENTIFIC BASIS. It's like trying to determine if gays have poor health, and then only looking at gays who have cancer or heart problems, or lung problems. The gays who DO NOT NEED to go to the doctor are not considered. That is OBVIOUSLY scientifically flawed.\n 3) \"And this brings us back to Charles Socarides and his Task Force on Sexual Deviation. In March of 1972 Charles Socarides Task Force on Sexual Deviation completed its report after nearly two years of preparation. In April it presented its findings to the council of the New York District Branch. The council rejected Socarides report finding that its extreme reliance upon psychoanalytic theory was not acceptable. \n And here's where the REAL story of politics begins. Socarides claimed that the rejection of his findings was not due to their non-factual basis but due to the corruption of psychiatric science with politics assuming preeminence over truth. (Bayer, p. 114) And to this day, more than 30 years later, Charles Socarides still hasn't produced any data to support his homophobic theories.\"\"\n \n The last part is especially damning, and part of the reason why I insisted on having two threads.\n \n The people who WANT homosexuality to be counted as a \"mental illness\" HAVE NO EVIDENCE. They whine and they whine and they lie and they lie about what happened in the 1970's cause they HAVE NO EVIDENCE to explain why the 1970s removal from the DSM was wrong. They CANNOT show why the decision was supposedly wrong.\n \n So instead, they make false and unsubstantiated claims of \"fraud\" and other drivel.\n \n \n \nAs mentioned before, the Committee was presented with Hooker's study. This study failed the most basic tenets of the scientific method. The author deliberately had her associates recruit participants to obtain a pool of subjects who understood what the \"experiment\" was about and how it was to be used to achieve a political goal in transforming society.3 She had no clinical experience in the field or in the scientific methods to be employed...\n\n Does anybody else see how contradictory this claim is?\n They want to pretend she lacked the \"experience\" to do the experiment (but fail to admit that THREE EXPERIENCED JUDGES were the ones evaluating the final tests/results), and at the same time want to pretend that she had enough knowledge to stack the deck.\n As it has already been explained, telling the participants what the test is IS NOT a problem. Just because the participants knew DOES NOT invalidate the test.\n \n \n \nFour years later, a survey showed that 69% of psychiatrists disagreed with the APA Committee report. \n\n While I would love to lay eyes on this supposed report, considering how much of the other claims are just plain false, I have seen one poll on the issue and it does NOT support any significant \"support\" for homosexuality being considered as a mental illness....\n \n \"In another recent study, it was reported that 47.3% of psychiatric training directors (n=198) view homosexuality as normal or somewhat normal, 51.2% view homosexuality as neutral, and 1.5% view it as somewhat pathological or pathological. Townsend-1995, Academic Psychiatry 19:213-218\"\n http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayhealth.html\n \n \n \nIn the Romer brief...\n\n I can't help but laugh.\n This PSYCHIATRIC article is talking about LEGAL rulings.\n \n Or rather, this PSEUDO psychiatric article is COMPLAINING about legal rulings...\n \n Further evidence of the bias and lack of professionalism in this paper. It truly is an anti-gay hit piece trying to pretend it is \"psychiatry\"...\n \n \n \nThe Laumann study: the definitive study\n ....\n Satinover states that \"The reality is that, since 1994, there has existed solid epidemiologic evidence, now extensively confirmed and reconfirmed that the most common natural course for a young person who develops a 'homosexual identity' is for it to spontaneously disappear unless that person is discouraged or interfered with by extraneous factors [our emphasis]. \n\n \n If anybody needs any further proof that Satinover is nothing more than a bald-faced liar, THIS MISREPRESENTATION is the proof.\n \n One of the huge problems for the \"anti-gay\" folk is how they take a legitimate piece of research, and then LIE THEIR ARSE OFF about what it says. There are multiple researchers who publish disclaimers cause some anti-gay hack takes a sentence or two out of their legitimate study, misrepresent the contents to say something typically EXPLICITLY CONTRADICTED in the study text, and then pretend they have \"researched\" a valid point.\n \n Below is the real context of the Laumann study. Evidently Satinover is not the only liar to make this misrepresentative claim.\n \n When Fitz tells us that \"one of the major points of the Laumann study, which the authors themselves did not expect, is that \"homosexuality\" as a fixed trait scarcely even seems to exist,\" what he fails to mention is that this comment is specifically in regards to the difficulty of distinguising between homosexual and bi-sexual people due to an \"overlap\" of the respective populations, nor does he mention the fact that the observed ambiguity of \"'homesxuality' as a fixed trait\" is actually a specific comment about how the subject see themselves and self-identify. Fitz attempts to spin the comment stating that \"the most common natural course for a young person who develops a 'homosexual identity' is for it to spontaneously disappear unless that process is discouraged or interfered with by extraneous factors\" into a general comment about to imply that sexual orientation is not a fixed trait, but the researchers in the study noted specifically that sexuality was not just about the way people self-identify, and that desire and behavior often seemed disconnected from the way that people self-identify.\n http://wthrockmorton.com/2008/01/06/upcoming-ex-gay-documentary-stirs-up-controversy/",
