   "Dr. George Tiller Admits to Performing Abortions the Day Before Delivery | NowPublic News Coverage\n \n \"Notorious partial-birth abortion specialist Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, KS, was caught on hidden video admitting to aborting babies a day before the mother's due date. Students for Life of America (SFLA) today released the video which was made at the Feminist Majority Foundation's annual Women's Leadership Conference held at the National Education Association (NEA) on March 9. \n \n The video reveals Dr. Tiller showcasing massive and graphic pictures of children with fetal abnormalities that he had aborted, so as to make the case for late-term abortions as necessary medical procedure. SFLA's Executive Director Kristan Hawkins, who videotaped the conference and interviewed Tiller clandestinely, commented on the gruesome pictures of aborted children Tiller showed, saying, \"One had an extra arm: could not that child had survived and received corrective surgery? Was violently killing the child the only way to go?\"\"",

Not a journalist with a reputation for objectively reporting information. The same was the case for the video, made by a student anti-abortion group.\n \n In the video in question, the anti-abortion students' audio was so bad, I couldn't understand barely one word Dr. Tiller was saying in his presentation and later, discussion with the \"reporters\". They provided subtitles for that one sentence they wished you to be shocked by, and then, all of the rest of his explanations, that would put the statement in context or perspective, not provided at all for the listener. \n \n As for the fetus with an additional arm, obviously corrective surgery is possible. There must have been other issues besides the arm, whether related to the fetus or the health of the mother. But, of course, we'll never know will we, because they don't let you hear what the doctor was saying about the fetus or the mother.\n \n All this article and video have done, is shown once again, how the anti-abortion movement presents flawed and alarmist information designed to appeal to knee-jerk reactions rather than reasoned discourse.\n \n The fact remains, that one of their sickos, pumped up by the kind of the garbage they put in articles and videos, went into a house of worship and mowed down a physician who lawfully practices medicine.\n \n He was not a sicko and you don't know that he was a sicko because you couldn't understand one word he was saying on that video without the subtitles that they intentionally did not provide the viewer. Intention, easy to infer, because they knew you couldn't understand that statement either. The sound quality equally bad throughout.\n \n But all things are not morally equal. Being fair and unbiased does not mean you must evaluate the parties as if everyone \"has to\" have a wrong. Like it or not, you have only one sicko, the murderer, but not the other, the doctor, who is the victim.\n \n \nEven most pro-choicers are against abortion in such most late term cases.\n\n \n I do not think this is the case. Under Roe, third trimester abortions fall under state regulations. Obviously otherwise healthy and normally developing fetuses in a healthy mother are not legally aborted \"on whim\" because, say, the fetus has one arm or an extra arm. We are talking about a small number of pregnancies where there are very severe developmental issues in the fetus (e.g. the brain) and serious issues related to the health of the mother. Both of which usually develop later on in the pregnancy. Whereby, the decision is still between a woman and her doctor.\n \n I think most informed pro-choicers feel that's where the decision should remain.\n \n What they really need to do, is find a way to stop anti-abortion groups from abusing the terms, meaning and intent of Roe regarding third trimester abortions and the state.\n \n And they should probably pass legislation about taking the life of doctors (and perhaps patients, as well), similar to legislation when people kill police officers.\n \n There should not be just one or two rickshaw centers in the entire country that perform legal, late term abortions, as a condition that's developed because of bombing, murders, shootings, and threats of violence and death.\n \n It's unacceptable. It's coercion of our hospitals and clinics, our medical professionals, our patients, and our legal system and our political leadership -- by domestic terrorists.\n \n And the FBI should probably be investigating the involvement of these groups founded by people who explicitly endorse and encourage violence.",

The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life. The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal.'\n \n \"The National Right to Life Committee has always been involved in peaceful, legal activities to protect human lives threatened by abortion, infanticide and euthanasia. We always have and will continue to oppose any form of violence to fight the violence of abortion. NRLC has had a policy of forbidding violence or illegal activity by its staff, directors, officers, affiliated state organizations and chapters. NRLC's sole purpose is to protect innocent human life.\n \n \"NRLC will continue to work through educational and legislative activities to ensure the right to life for unborn children, people with disabilities and older people. NRLC will continue to work for peaceful solutions to aid pregnant women and their unborn children. These solutions involve helping women and their children and do not involve violence against anyone.\" \n \n I don't agree with the National Right to Life Committee's stance on abortion. I do think their response to the murder of Dr. Tiller is the right one for opponents of abortion to take.",

The source of my belief may be different from yours, but we reach the same conclusion.\n\n \n I don't think you'll find too many here who wouldn't agree with that.\n \n I think it does need to be remembered in this case that this was a partial-birth abortion doctor. Which basically means he killed babies right at or pretty quickly before they would otherwise be born. If someone would be a murderer in the moral sense by killing a baby right after it was born, then they are a murderer in the moral sense by doing it right BEFORE it was born. There's no difference in terms of fetal development or fetal viability. The fact that one is a legal form of killing and the other isn't, is a very poor basis for morality. At one time it was legal for the state to invade peoples' homes over sodomy, but that doesn't mean it was moral. It was still wrong to do so; and it is a very monstrous thing this doctor did. He was a monster, just as his killer was a monster. The doctor's murder cannot and should not be discussed in a vacuum as if he wasn't engaged in horrible acts himself. \n \n I don't think pro-choice people sometimes realize the degree of outrage and anger that killing babies right at term can provoke. There were several movements in Nazi Germany to assassinate Hitler, and religious people sometimes had to wrestle with this a great deal in how they viewed it, reconciling peace with the need to save lives.

The practice of the doctor was immoral and worthy of condemnation. The murder of the doctor was immoral and worthy of condemnation. Do you understand?\n\n \n I understand your argument, and I disagree with you that the actions of the doctor were immoral or worthy of condemnation. You may believe they were immoral, but not everyone agrees with you. In operating his practice, the doctor was providing a service to women, and his patients were exercising their legal and constitutional rights. In the eyes of his patients, and in the eyes of the wider society, the doctor was providing a needed medical service, which is why his practice was legal. The murderer not only killed a human being, he denied the doctor's potential patients access to the medical services that he provided. This was therefore an attack on the wider society, which created the laws that allowed the doctor to practice.\n \n Obviously, the intention of the murderer was to deny women the services of this doctor. That appears to have been the point. The gunman was seeking to deny to women the right of access to these medical services. That's why his action is more than just a murder; it is also the denial of the rights of the doctor's patients. \n \n The problem with the claims that both the victim and the murderer did wrong is that they contain a tacit and thinly disguised approval for the actual purpose of the murder, which was to prevent the doctor from engaging in his medical practice and thus to prevent the patients from receiving the medical services they desire. This was an assault on the doctor, yes. It was also an assault on the rights of the women who want the services that the doctor provided, controversial as they may have been. The society has said that women have a right to choose abortion. You may not like it, but it's true. The murderer not only denied life to the doctor; he sought to prevent women from exercising a right that is protected by the constitution. \n \n I do not believe that our laws are always moral. There are laws that I believe are immoral. But I do think we need to take the laws seriously as an expression of the will of the people as a whole. This is a principle that most conservatives stand for. I am not conservative, but I endorse the principle of respect for the rule of law. Do I ever believe in doing civil disobedience? Yes, sometimes. With careful consideration, and as a last or nearly last resort. I think that when other means have been exhausted, non-violent civil disobedience may be an appropriate and effective tactic for bringing about change. Notice that I said non-violent. \n \n Most change comes when people's views change. Blocking people from exercising their constitutional rights is not an effective way to change hearts and minds, and it is especially ineffective when it involves murdering someone. You may denounce Dr. Tiller as a bad, bad man. But in killing him, the murderer has, I think, set the anti-abortion movement back. The murderer has taken a human life in the name of human life, which is a contradiction, and he has blocked women from receiving medical services that they may seek. That's no way to change hearts and minds.",

   "HUNTSVILLE, AL - \n Jesus Christ, son of God and noted pro-life activist, killed two and critically wounded seven others when He opened fire in the waiting room of a Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday.\n \n Security guards at the Women's Medical Clinic of Huntsville were able to disarm the Messiah before He could reload His weapon, a secondhand Glock 9mm pistol that authorities said He purchased legally at a Jackson, MS, sporting-goods store. \"Abortion is a sin,\" said Christ as He was led away in handcuffs. \"It is an abomination in the eyes of Me.\" Witnesses said the attack, which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring, 51, and clinic nurse Danielle Costa, 29, came from \"out of nowhere.\"\n \n \"He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring,\" receptionist Iris Reid said. \"The next thing I knew, He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving.\"\n \n \"It was horrible,\" said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs, recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen. \"He put his hands over Dr. Woodring's head and told him He forgave him for his sins, and then He shot him right in the face.\" Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room, where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe. Federal investigators are similarly baffled, saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in \"mysterious ways.\"\n \n Speaking to reporters from His holding cell, Christ, 33, said He had \"no regrets\" about what He had done.\n \n \"As I said in John 16:21, every life is precious,\" Christ said. \"This means every life, not just those who have already been born. My father, the Lord, feels the same way I do. In Jeremiah 1:5, He said unto the prophet Jeremiah, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.' The unborn fetus is a sacred, living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such.\"\n \n Added Christ: \"What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so. After all, it wasn't even her decision to conceive me in the first place. But in the end, she made the right decision, bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior. Blessed is she among women.\" According to legal experts, if convicted, Christ could face the death penalty. \n\n Christ Kills Two, Injures Seven In Abortion-Clinic Attack | The Onion - America's Finest News Source\n \n Disclaimer: It's THE ONION (as if most wouldn't figure that out on their own... :p )",

He reportedly belonged to an extremist anti-government group. This was not, apparently, a case of a man who suddenly got so angry that he snapped and killed Dr. Tiller. The murderer had apparently been engaged in terrorist activities for a long time. I am sure more information will come out about the murderer. \n \n There is an extremist wing of the anti-abortion movement that doesn't believe in non-violence. They believe in anything goes, including murder, to stop abortion, and a few of them have acted on this. Most opponents of abortion don't agree with them, of course. But they don't do much if anything to stop the extremists either. I remember about 10 years ago there was an anti-abortion website with a list of abortion providers and their addresses. The list had the names of abortion providers who had been killed crossed out, though the names were legible. The abortion providers and their supporters saw this as a hit list, as a call to murder abortion providers. The people who created the website said it was just a list. A court ordered the website shut down, as I recall. Anyhow, we know that 8 abortion providers have now been murdered since 1977. There is a terrorist campaign to kill abortion providers. \n \n One problem with focusing on what some call the wrongs of Dr. Tiller is that it takes the focus off the murderer and off the terrorists who support murdering abortion providers. And the actions of these terrorists do and will create a backlash against the anti-abortion movement, I think. The National Right to Life Committee leaders are quite worried about this, from what I have read. Most Americans won't excuse a murder just because some people disagree with the work of Dr. Tiller.\n \n I think that if the anti-abortion activists want to win over more hearts and minds, they must come across as in no way endorsing, even by implication, the murder of Dr. Tiller or anyone else. Most Americans do not find terror tactics acceptable no matter what the cause. I think the anti-abortion movement needs to thoroughly repudiate the actions of its extremist wing and to entirely disassociate itself from terrorism. That means not focusing on Tiller's work, or suggesting there was good reason to kill him. It means repudiating completely the terrorist activities and beliefs of those who would use and do use violence against abortion providers.",

Flat out killing an infant that could be born at that point for any small issue of 'health', no matter how small, seems pretty inhumane to me. in this case, I think 'dishonoring women' (whatever that is supposed to mean) is pretty mundane price to pay to avoid horrendously killing infants right before they could be born.",

   "If you want to provide honest and full context for the murder, you need to include the ongoing terrorist activities of the murderer. He apparently believed it was okay to kill doctors who provide abortions.\n\n \n Yes, some pro-lifers believe the issue is so bad that it's time to take up arms over it. Just like some believed it was time to take up arms in other cases of infanticide, genocide, or other killing, in society. You don't seem to understand the level of outrage that exists over things like partial-birth abortion. Rather than merely waving these cases off with the cop-out moniker of \"extremism\", it would be more beneficial to also use cases like this to see why it is that people are so outraged by abortion that they would take up arms--particularly late term abortions, that even many pro-choice people are against.\n \n Should people do this (take up arms and shoot doctors)? No, of course not. But there are reasons it happens, and we don't need to pretend that the horror of abortion isn't part of that reason. Outrage is never going to go away in our society when viable infants are being killed. That 900 lb elephant is still in the room even when people don't want to talk about it, as you seem to not. And since it's not going to go away (because people natually get outraged at killing infants) then we need to take it into consideration. As long as late term abortions are being carried out, people are going to be terribly, terribly outraged to levels not seen over any other issue in society IMO. Since it's not going to go away, we need to be willing to consider what it is that causes people to be so outraged that they would actually see this issue as one over which to take up arms rather than just doing nothing more than portraying such people as nut-cases or extremists.\n \n For heaven's sake, we talk about the need to look at religion as a catalyst for hate. So in other areas we're willing to no just wave things off as extremism, but take into account the factors of the issue. We should do the same with this issue as well, and consider that late term abortions are a horrific thing and keep in mind that there is, perhaps, no issue out there that would generate tremendous anger and outrage than knowing infants are being killed. Even Bill Clinton said abortion should be 'rare'. Even many pro-choicers have come out against late term abortions. Regardless of the fact that it is legal, it is still a horrific procedure. It is still killing what is essentially a baby at that very TIME if it had exited the birth canal. The infant is no less viable than one that had just been born! We don't need to shy away from looking at why this sort of thing generates tremendous outrage, anger, and hostility. It is very rare for shootings like this to happen in a vacuum--the issue itself no doubt contributed.\n \n No one is saying we shouldn't condemn violence. I'm certainly not condoning what the shooter did. But I do understand the outrage and I think we do need to consider that it's not just \"extremism\" that fuels things like this, but the horror of what these doctors do, as well. This \"extremism\" isn't happening in a vacuum.",

   "Yes, some pro-lifers believe the issue is so bad that it's time to take up arms over it. Just like some believed it was time to take up arms in other cases of infanticide, genocide, or other killing, in society. You don't seem to understand the level of outrage that exists over things like partial-birth abortion. Rather than merely waving these cases off with the cop-out moniker of \"extremism\", it would be more beneficial to also use cases like this to see why it is that people are so outraged by abortion that they would take up arms--particularly late term abortions, that even many pro-choice people are against.\n \n Should people do this? No. But there are reasons it happens, and we don't need to pretend that the horror of abortion isn't part of that reason. Outrage is never going to go away in our society when viable infants are being killed. That 900 lb elephant is still in the room even when people don't want to talk about it, as you seem to not. And since it's not going to go away (because people natually get outraged at killing infants) then we need to take it into consideration. As long as late term abortions are being carried out, people are going to be terribly, terribly outraged to levels not seen over any other issue in society IMO. Since it's not going to go away, we need to be willing to consider what it is that causes people to be so outraged that they would actually see this issue as one over which to take up arms rather than just doing nothing more than portraying such people as nut-cases or extremists.\n \n For heaven's sake, we talk about the need to look at religion as a catalyst for hate. So in other areas we're willing to no just wave things off as extremism, but take into account the factors of the issue. We should do the same with this issue as well, and consider that late term abortions are a horrific thing and keep in mind that there is, perhaps, no issue out there that would generate tremendous anger and outrage than knowing infants are being killed. Even Bill Clinton said abortion should be 'rare'. Even many pro-choicers have come out against late term abortions. Regardless of the fact that it is legal, it is still a horrific procedure. It is still killing what is essentially a baby at that very TIME if it had exited the birth canal. The infant is no less viable than one that had just been born! We don't need to shy away from looking at why this sort of thing generates tremendous outrage, anger, and hostility. It is very rare for shootings like this to happen in a vacuum--the issue itself no doubt contributed.\n \n No one is saying we shouldn't condemn violence. I'm certainly condoning what the shooter did. But I do understand the outrage and I think we do need to consider that it's not just \"extremism\" that fuels things like this, but the horror of what these doctors do, as well. \"Extremism\" doesn't happen in a vacuum.\n\n \n Are you suggesting that it is somehow legitimate for a person to murder another person out of outrage over abortion? That seems to be what you are suggesting. You repeatedly try to excuse the acts of the murderer, Scott Roeder. You also use the expression \"take up arms,\" as though Scott Roeder was engaging in a legitimate act of warfare. What he did was a criminal act, a terrorist act. It was not an act of warfare. It was a murder, a crime. \n \n Roeder was reportedly arrested before for having bomb-making equipment in his car. You want people to undestand and somehow sympathize with that? He is a terrorist. \n \n The fact that some people hate late-term abortions is NOT an excuse for this murder. It does not explain it either, because most opponents of abortion, including you I presume, would never murder someone just because they oppose abortion. You seem to want to blame the murder on late-term abortions. That's wrong. The murder is to be blamed on the murderer, who is apparently the extremist Scott Roeder. He has a history of terrorist activities. \n \n Don't try to blame this murder on the doctor who was killed. Don't try to blame this murder on abortion. Put the blame where it belongs: on the murderer. The blame lies with an extremist terrorist who believes it's okay to shoot someone dead in cold blood because the victim's life work doesn't conform to the peculiar beliefs of the terrorist.",

   "Are you suggesting that it is somehow legitimate for a person to murder another person out of outrage over abortion?\n\n \n I already answered that question, quite clearly, in the post you just responded to. I'm trying to get you to see that we need to consider the nature of the issue itself though, as a fuel to this sort of thing, rather than basically pretending it's not a factor and sweeping it under the rug, and doing nothing more than only throwing an 'extremist-tag' on the situation. The issue isn't that simple. It's like taking a case of someone who took up arms over systematic genocide because it was the only way left to save lives, and trying to take the issue of the genocide out of the equation altogether. If a person spent years and years harming gays, even killing them systematically, and then one day he was killed by a gay person, would you at least take into consideration that he had been harming gay people for years? I really think you're putting unreasonable expectations on people by expecting them to ONLY talk about this in a way that doesn't at least take into some account the fact that killing infants late term like that is naturally going to generate unbelievable outrage. And frankly, I find it pretty hard to believe that you'd be to completely divorce yourself from that factor, in thinking about the situation. This is not a completely either-or situation.\n \n The fact that the perpetrator was very possibly a terrorist doesn't change any of this. We still need to step back and think about what it is about this issue that helps fuel this sort of extremism. (again, it's not like we don't do this with OTHER issues, after all.) I think we need to step back and think about why, more than perhaps any other issue, this one generates such passion and anger. And knowing that it does so probably more than any other issue, it's odd to me that anyone would be so shocked that sort of thing happens sometimes. It doesn't make it right. It's no justification. But we need to stop pretending that what goes on in clinics like this isn't contributing as well in that it generates such tremendous feelings of outrage in people.\n \n I would also add that it's interesting on one hand you seem to not want that taken into any consideration over case like this, but you DO seem to want to use it to point out that pro-lifers might experience a 'backlash'. But if you truly believe that this issue should ONLY be viewed with no other factors than a perpetrator who committed murder, then you should be equally as eager to tell pro-choicers to not hold something like this against pro-lifers. After all, he's just some nut-case extremist to you, and the issue to you is somehow sanitized from anything that might have actually contributed to outrage here. If you don't want the issue of abortion to factor into this in any way whatsoever, then that goes both ways. So I assume this means that you don't think this murder reflects on being pro-life or the pro-life position in any way whatsoever?",

   "I already answered that question, quite clearly, in the post you just responded to. I'm trying to get you to see that we need to consider the nature of the issue itself though, as a fuel to this sort of thing, rather than basically pretending it's not a factor and sweeping it under the rug, and doing nothing more than only throwing an 'extremist-tag' on the situation. The issue isn't that simple. It's like taking a case of someone who took up arms over systematic genocide because it was the only way left to save lives, and trying to take the issue of the genocide out of the equation altogether. If a person spent years and years harming gays, even killing them systematically, and then one day he was killed by a gay person, would you at least take into consideration that he had been harming gay people for years? I really think you're putting unreasonable expectations on people by expecting them to ONLY talk about this in a way that doesn't at least take into some account the fact that killing infants late term like that is naturally going to generate unbelievable outrage. And frankly, I find it pretty hard to believe that you'd be to completely divorce yourself from that factor, in thinking about the situation. This is not a completely either-or situation.\n \n The fact that the perpetrator was very possibly a terrorist doesn't change any of this. We still need to step back and think about what it is about this issue that helps fuel this sort of extremism. (again, it's not like we don't do this with OTHER issues, after all.) I think we need to step back and think about why, more than perhaps any other issue, this one generates such passion and anger. And knowing that it does so probably more than any other issue, it's odd to me that anyone would be so shocked that sort of thing happens sometimes. It doesn't make it right. It's no justification. But we need to stop pretending that what goes on in clinics like this isn't contributing as well in that it generates such tremendous feelings of outrage in people.\n \n I would also add that it's interesting on one hand you seem to not want that taken into any consideration over case like this, but you DO seem to want to use it to point out that pro-lifers might experience a 'backlash'. But if you truly believe that this issue should ONLY be viewed with no other factors than a perpetrator who committed murder, then you should be equally as eager to tell pro-choicers to not hold something like this against pro-lifers. After all, he's just some nut-case extremist to you, and the issue to you is somehow sanitized from anything that might have actually contributed to outrage here. If you don't want the issue of abortion to factor into this in any way whatsoever, then that goes both ways. So I assume this means that you don't think this murder reflects on being pro-life or the pro-life position in any way whatsoever?\n\n \n People should not hold this murder against anti-abortion activists in general. Most opponents of abortion would never commit a crime like this, nor would they try to justify murdering someone. I pointed out in an earlier post that the National Right to Life Committee took a stance that I applaud, which was to decry the murder without in any way trying to justify it and without in any way trying to blame the murder on the murder victim. They reiterated their commitment to working for change non-violently. This is, I think, a principled position to take. \n \n To say that people are very angry over late-term abortions does not explain the activities of the extremist terrorists who are at the fringe of the anti-abortion movement. It ignores those activities. Scott Roeder, the murder suspect, has a history of anti-abortion radicalism and anti-government radicalism. Activists on the fringe of the anti-abortion movement have expressed a belief in using threats, harassment, sabotage, violence, and murder to try to stop abortions. They have employed these tactics. The 7 abortion providers who have been murdered since 1977 were not all doctors who specialized in late-term abortions. To blame this recent murder on anger over late-term abortions is to ignore the long-term terrorist activities of people on the fringe of the anti-abortion movement. \n \n My position is not that all or most opponents of abortion are to blame for this murder. Most would never murder or harm someone in the name of life. The man who murdered Dr. Tiller is apparently on the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement. I think it would serve the anti-abortion movement well to take a clear stance against this radical fringe. I think it would serve the anti-abortion movement well never to suggest that Scott Roeder was behaving reasonably or understandably when he allegedly shot Dr. Tiller.",

Most would never murder or harm someone in the name of life. \n\n \n I think you are being unrealistic. With the possible exception of a very narrow group, mostly apart from their right-wing counterparts, they possess a set of views about the nature of abortion that is not based in non-violent or humane principles. They promote a view that endorses and encourages violence based on their view of the supposedly criminal, holocaust-like nature of what is occurring.\n \n If you think a Holocaust is taking place, and you do not believe laws are just, you feel quite entitled to take matters into your own hands.\n \n You discussed John Brown and slavery earlier. John Brown, IMO, was justified. Harriet Tubman was going to join him, too, but came down with the flu. I guess if she'd been there, we'd see her and history differently, but how, it's difficult to say.\n \n The American colonists were justified in taking up arms, too.\n \n World War II would have been justified \"just\" on the basis of the Holocaust.\n \n But all this reasoning and grasp of the human dimension -- from slavery, to the colonists, to the atrocities of the Nazis -- is based in reality and facts and evidence.\n \n Unlike the bulk of anti-abortion proponents.\n \n So I do not agree with your approach, though your faith in human nature is admirable.",

One argument is that the King had previously been lax and had allowed the colonies to do whatever they wanted, and when he tried to tighten things up and raise money for expenses in the colonies, the Americans got angry because they were used to being mostly ignored and not having to pay certain taxes to the Crown.

Which I added in edit that seemed to cross your previous post.\n \n I haven't participated on any American Revolution forums, but I haven't noticed any smoke and fire from the wings, either. OTOH, apart from historians, there seems to plenty of internet debate today about the Civil War. (And not to stray too far off here on tangents, but just looking at historians and popular arguments -- I have read that there is little debate among historians about, for example, the atom bomb, and an almost entirely different view in popular discussion.)

   "People judge people and tell them what to do all the time. That's what laws and society does. Still you're right about not knowing someone else's situation and quite frankly that's why I'm pro-choice. I don't care how many abortions a women gets as long as its not coming out of my pocket she can have a million. I just don't care. To me you shouldn't realize that you're pregnant and due to give birth in a week or two and decide to have an abortion if there's no risk. I consider those people #######s. If you're that far along you might as well go along with it. \n \n Also I feel somewhat sorry for people in abusive relationships but well...I don't care. That's their problem not mine...so yeah...you're right they can do whatever the hell they want I don't care anymore as long as I don't have to see it their boyfriend can rape/kill them and I won't care. After all I'm not supposed to judge/tell people what to do right? If people take that attitude anarchy runs rampant.\n\n \n There is a zone of privacy that the laws should not interfere with, and that includes a woman's decision to have an abortion or not. And while I agree with you in general that people of good sense should decide to have an abortion before the third trimester, there are various reasons why women end up getting later abortions. Dr. Tiller helped women who intended to have their babies but who discovered late in pregnancy that the baby would likely not survive. Dr. Tiller helped women whose babies had already died in the womb. Dr. Tiller helped women who had cancer. Dr. Tiller helped women who might have died had they given birth. There are compelling and often tragic reasons why women choose late term abortions. I think we all need to be compassionate and not assume that a later term abortion is just a matter of someone irresponsible who didn't get around to having an abortion earlier or who didn't bother to use birth control.\n \n I had a work colleague who got pregnant and was excited to have a baby. Then late in her pregnancy, the doctors discovered that she had cancer that had metastasized. She considered seriously whether to have a late term abortion, to try to save her own life with cancer treatments (radiation). She chose not to, because the chances of her living long were slim whatever she did. Her baby was born. She died a few months after her baby was born. This was a tragic situation and a wrenching decision for her and her husband. She opted not to undergo radiation treatment during her pregnancy and to give birth, and she ended up dying. Would she have died if she had chosen abortion and received immediate cancer treatments? We don't know, but probably. \n \n Anyhow, I am pro-choice like you.",

   "TWO ABORTIONS IN QUESTION??? Let's see what a Harvard educated shrink who looked at Tillers abortion records which justified these late term murders of babies had to say about them. I even found it in video format so you don't have to strain your brain reading and interpreting actual written words. And you will notice at the end he comments on how many of these abortions were truly justified for medical reasons as intended by the laws of Kansas.\n YouTube - Dr. Tiller's Abortion Records Exposed\n\n \n Wasn't this psychiatrist a witness in the trial of Dr. Tiller? And weren't the charges against Dr. Tiller dismissed? So regardless of what this psychiatrist had to say about Dr. Tiller's medical records, Dr. Tiller won in court. But he then lost his life because an extremist terrorist decidedthat it was his business and his duty to murder him. \n \n The whole story of Dr. Tiller shows the extent to which he was harassed by these radical anti-abortion groups. It isn't their business why a woman in consultation with her doctor chooses to have an abortion. They are not involved, except that they are meddlesome troublemakers and some are terrorists. It is not up to Operation Rescue or any other extremist group to interfere in a woman's private decision to have an abortion in consultation with her doctor. They are harassers. And the most radical fringe are terrorists and murderers. We have seen this clearly. 8 abortion providers murdered since 1977. Clinics bombed. Sabotage, threats, intimidation. \n \n There is a constitutional right to peaceful protest. There is no constitutional right to engage in terrorism.",

Based on his qualifications, I have no reason to doubt that.\n \n I agree with some of his points, some of which are also very unrelated to abortion, in general. But differences of opinion are not uncommon in medicine. While he doesn't even know the women in question. He's not their physician.\n\n \n This video shows much more than a difference of opinion. It shows that Tiller went completely around the LAW which states that late term abortions must only take place when the health or survival of the mother is at risk. The reasons they gave for justifying late term abortions were so they could go on vacation or to a rock concert, or to get a job. Are those life threatening excuses which justify killing a viable child just days or weeks before completing its gestation cycle? Of course not, but you will never criticize what is so obviously an abuse of the law if not completely disregarding it. The doctor says at the end of the video that none of the reasons given had anything to do with threatening the life of the mother at all and didn't have anything to do with the baby not being able to survive the birth. \n \n \nAnd ultimately, the woman's right to choose -- even if she's as crazy as you, Archangel -- is hers. Including which physicians she puts her trust in. And the decision and judgement is between her and her physician. NYBOM (Not Your Business Or Mine.) Even if you think you're the Moderator or God.\n\n \n No antonia, after 9 months of pregnancy it is no longer her right to choose. ACCORDING TO THE LAW, YOU KNOW, LIKE LAWS AGAINST MURDER? THE LAWS SAY THAT THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER MUST BE IN REAL DANGER FOR A HEALTHY AND VIABLE CHILD TO BE MURDERED RIGHT BEFORE BEING BORN.\n \n I marvel at how blatant your hypocrisy is as you are outraged at the killing of this doctor who for 5,000 dollars would murder healthy babies so late in their development yet you are not outraged at all that he would murder these children for such flimsy reasons as his own records document. \n \n You sicken me as you judge our motives and anger at what this lowlife scumbag represented.

Instead of blaming Dr. Tiller, or expressing a smug satisfaction that he was murdered, I think anti-abortion activists who believe in non-violence need to take a stand against the extremist, violent faction of their movement that uses terror and murder to try to get their way.

You've now waded into the issue even though you may not realize it. You say you don't want to get into the discussion of the morality of abortion, but then you clearly take pro-choice take on things and still refuse to even acknowledge that Tiller killed infants that were very late term. Nazi doctors performed a 'legal medical service.' That it is legal doesn't mean it's ok to kill late term infants. You're going to have to accept that Tiller is not going to get a pass on this from some of us. We're too appalled.\n \n \nInstead of blaming Dr. Tiller, or expressing a smug satisfaction that he was murdered, I think anti-abortion activists who believe in non-violence need to take a stand against the extremist, violent faction of their movement that uses terror and murder to try to get their way.\n\n \n In other words, you want them to check their pro-life position at the door, and stop making that an issue for awhile. That's no more possible than it would be for you to give up your belief that gays should have equality. If someone systematically went around killing gay people, I seriously doubt you'd be demanding people not talk about that factor in the wake of the killer himself being killed by some nutcase. It's impossible for some of us just pretend late-term abortions weren't going on at his clinic. There's too much anger and outrage when infants are killed like that.",

I could, but this in my mind does not excuse Brown's direction of a cold-blooded murder. I do not blame the slaveholders for this murder committed by John Brown and his sons. \n \n Was Brown wrong to lead his raid on Harper's Ferry? I think yes. It was an act of terrorism.

Two women's medical records? A thousand? \n \n If a holocaust of millions of babies were taking place, yes, I think armed conflict, in some form, would be justified.\n \n But that would a lot more obviouos than the case made here, wouldn't it. And we should start counting, shouldn't we? Case by case.\n \n We have whole lists of established individuals for the millions in the Holocaust.

   "*laughs* At least I'm not a hypocrite. I never said terrorism wasn't justified in some people's eyes. That doesn't change it from being terrorism. Historical terrorism is still terrorism. Its just happens to be terrorism that worked to the favor of the side that later ended up in control. \n \n According to you the sky isn't blue because you say so. After all that's a one dimension, lacking any historical insight, context, or self-reflection, simple minded and dogmatic. Despite the fact that its based on facts! \n \n And I love how shut down you were by my argument that you were reduced to calling my definition one dimensional! emoticon_xagree\n \n *rolls around laughing* Your argument fails. Just admit to the hypocrisy and save face.\n\n \n Well aren't you a belly full of self-admiration. My argument doesn't fail, ryu, I simply saw from your post that it was a matter of semantics.\n \n I don't agree with how you are using the term. It's very fashionable in some political circles today to assert the term, \"terrorism\" in such a broad manner, but I think it's sloppy and intellectually dishonest.\n \n And all such persons walking around with blinders on to themselves because they are so busy patting themselves on the back for their big insight that things look very self-justified no matter which side you're on.\n \n As soon as I saw that was where you were coming from (\"Oh, that ..\"), continued dialogue on the subject looked pretty dreary and commonplace.\n \n Especially considering that you're unable to look at the world through the eyes of John Brown, because your modus operandi (\"I'm so fair-minded and able to see that all things are equal\") is completely bogus.",

Morally, it's a difficult question to answer. \n \n It is true that the abolitionists by 1859 were in a position where they had not succeeded in ending slavery, and the legal and peaceful avenues for doing so had been mostly shut off.

His life was dedicated to that purpose. \n \n This is a bioethics matter wherein religious fanatics are claiming that people (in the full sense of that meaning) exist and are being harmed, where they do not, and they aren't.\n \n They have a poor understanding of science and health, which is critical to this matter, and they see photographs of fetuses and enter into completely false suppositions about what has transpired. \n \n They're unmoved by the reality of a photograph of 120 cells and what that means about a non-existent nervous system.\n \n Wouldn't you say this is a bit different than the human beings John Brown saw and heard?\n \n \nBut who is to determine what is a great moral evil?\n\n \n We are to determine, unless you'd like them to.",

There's art glorifying Hitler as well it means Jack Squat about him as a person it just means he was a public figure. Also there's a lot of immortalized art. May not be American but Brown isn't as big a hero as you'd like him to be.

   "I think it is the opposite.\n \n \n \n No, I suggest Brown was right because he had a very rational and just argument based on a sane perception of real people really being persecuted. \n \n Roeder is wrong because he is not reality-based. \n \n We all make decisions and judgments about others and their contact with reality, and their views about justice, as a result.\n \n As I just wrote to Ryu, what if a guy with a gun walked into a stem cell research lab to defend the rights of the unborn?\n \n All things are not equal. Are you going to suggest that they are?\n \n John Brown was a revolutionary at the beginning of the American Civil War. Trying to overthrown the system of American slavery. His life was dedicated to that purpose. \n \n This is a bioethics matter wherein religious fanatics are claiming that people (in the full sense of that meaning) exist and are being harmed, where they do not, and they aren't.\n \n They have a poor understanding of science and health, which is critical to this matter, and they see photographs of fetuses and enter into completely false suppositions about what has transpired. \n \n They're unmoved by the reality of a photograph of 120 cells and what that means about a non-existent nervous system.\n \n Wouldn't you say this is a bit different than the human beings John Brown saw and heard?\n \n \n \n We are to determine, unless you'd like them to.\n\n \n The problem is that this standard allows anyone to decide that they can believe something is wrong and get a gun and blow someone away over it, and then claim they were acting justly, as a freedom fighter. Like you, I believe slavery was a terrible moral evil, and I don't believe that abortion is a moral evil. But lots of other people do believe that abortion is a terrible moral evil. If I claim that it was just and heroic for John Brown to go out and kill people to stop slavery, some opponents of abortion are going to claim the same thing about Scott Roeder. What then is the basis for my saying that Brown was a hero and Roeder a terrorist? My belief about his cause? It's just my belief, not the belief of everyone. Who says my belief is right and theirs is wrong? Me? This suggests that individuals have the right to commit murder and engage in acts of terrorism if they personally believe that the people they are murdering are wrong. It's kind of an anything goes if you believe strongly enough. The only standard is an individual's conscience. And while I believe in respecting an individual's right of conscience, I do not think individuals have the right to murder or terrorize others simply because they do not believe in what those others are doing. I believe individuals are and should be free to protest, to engage in political action, even to commit civil disobedience and accept the legal consequences, so long as their actions are non-violent. I think we have to adhere to a standard of non-violence, or we open the door to and allow vigilante justice and groups engaging in bombings and other attacks, which has been happening already with the radical terrorist fringe of the anti-abortion movement. We need to decry this not merely because we disagree with their position on abortion; we need to decry their actions because they are violent and because they terrorize people. I don't think we can argue that these people's violence is wrong because their cause is wrong, but other people's violence is good because we agree with their cause.",

You know, union soldiers don't go off marching in song about John Brown if they think he's a terrorist. And we don't have some of our most famous hymns in his honor if we think thus, either.\n\n \n After his hanging, Brown was both celebrated as a hero and vilified as a terrorist. And there were people who opposed slavery who viewed his cause as just while criticizing his methods. Lincoln was one of them. \n \n People were divided about John Brown then as they are divided about him still today. One of the big questions that some historians asked about Brown was whether he was insane. Brown believed that God had called him personally to exact vengeance on slaveholders and free the slaves. He believed in an angry God, a vengeful God. He believed that only with bloodshed would the sin of slaveholding be avenged. \n \n I think that Brown and those who supported him believed quite honestly, and probably accurately, that the peaceful means of ending slavery had been shut off. Political means of ending slavery had been stymied. Garrison's moral suasion approach had put the issue of slavery in people's faces, had forced Americans to look at the morality of slavery and to take sides. But it had not ended slavery or led down a clear path that would end slavery. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 had appeared to secure slavery and to force Northerners to be complicit in the slave system. And the Dred Scott Supreme Court ruling, which I see as critical in the events that led to war, forced slavery on the entire nation, in effect. The Dred Scott ruling, at least Chief Justice Taney's opinion, declared that Congress could not ban slavery anywhere. The ruling implied that neither could the states, that property rights, including the right to slave property, could not be abrogated by government at all. The Dred Scott ruling declared in effect that slave owners had the right to bring and to keep their slave property anywhere they wished. This made the northern states' bans on slavery meaningless. The Dred Scott ruling, perhaps more than anything, shut off political avenues to ban slavery. When peaceful avenues to make change are shut off, some people who are committed to change are likely to engage in violence and terrorism.\n \n I think the anti-abortion forces probably feel that the Roe v. Wade decision largely shut off their avenues for political change. With the Supreme Court ruling that the choice of abortion is a fundamental right falling under the right to privacy, the anti-abortion forces could not pass laws banning abortion; they could only chip away at the edges by passing laws that regulate and limit abortion. They had to hope that their regulatory laws would not be struck down by the Supreme Court. They have had some success in getting these laws passed and not struck down by the Supreme Court. But they have not been able to ban abortion outright. And with the perception that peaceful avenues to end abortion have been shut off, some anti-abortion activists have turned to violence and terrorism.",

Like you, I believe slavery was a terrible moral evil, and I don't believe that abortion is a moral evil. But lots of other people do believe that abortion is a terrible moral evil. If I claim that it was just and heroic for John Brown to go out and kill people to stop slavery, some opponents of abortion are going to claim the same thing about Scott Roeder. What then is the basis for my saying that Brown was a hero and Roeder a terrorist? My belief about his cause? It's just my belief, not the belief of everyone. Who says my belief is right and theirs is wrong? Me? This suggests that individuals have the right to commit murder and engage in acts of terrorism if they personally believe that the people they are murdering are wrong. It's kind of an anything goes if you believe strongly enough. The only standard is an individual's conscience. And while I believe in respecting an individual's right of conscience, I do not think individuals have the right to murder or terrorize others simply because they do not believe in what those others are doing. I believe individuals are and should be free to protest, to engage in political action, even to commit civil disobedience and accept the legal consequences, so long as their actions are non-violent. I think we have to adhere to a standard of non-violence, or we open the door to and allow vigilante justice and groups engaging in bombings and other attacks, which has been happening already with the radical terrorist fringe of the anti-abortion movement. We need to decry this not merely because we disagree with their position on abortion; we need to decry their actions because they are violent and because they terrorize people. I don't think we can argue that these people's violence is wrong because their cause is wrong, but other people's violence is good because we agree with their cause.\n\n \n You seem to be taking a bit more of an understanding stance of the bigger picture this morning than you have the last couple of days. You seem more willing to entertain discussion of this now than you were. We certainly need to have a standard of non-violence, but (as I tried to get you to see over the last couple of days) we don't need to pretend the controversy of abortion isn't a driving factor, either, and approach this only from the standpoint of violence-vs-nonviolence. You're no longer doing so, and I, for one, appreciate that.",

I appreciate that you're at least talking about the other aspects of this now.\n\n \n I think I'm taking the same position I was before. I am not always consistent, admittedly, because I am human. But I think I have been consistent on this particular point, or I have tried to be. My position before and now is that it is NOT okay to say that because one believes that abortion is a terrible moral evil, it is understandable or acceptable or justified for Roeder to have engaged in terrorism and murder. The same is true, in my view, for John Brown. Just because he believed and we mostly all now believe slavery was wrong does not mean that John Brown's murder of human beings was understandable or acceptable or justified. \n \n What I have tried to argue, consistently I hope, is that we cannot say that because the cause was just, the means of terror and violence are okay or are justified in some way. My understanding of Antonia's position is that she is arguing that John Brown was not a terrorist, that he was justified, because slavery was wrong, whereas Roeder is not justifed because abortion is not wrong. But this then allows any individual to engage in terrorism and murder simply because they believe something is wrong. I think that's a road we must not go down, because it would seem to justify people engaging in murder and violence purely because of their beliefs about a particular issue. That's why I think we need to embrace and adhere to the principles of active non-violence.\n \n In other words, in rendering a moral evaluation, I think we do need to divorce a person's violent actions from the cause they are espousing and judge the actions themselves as terrorist acts. Whether we agree with the cause or not should have no bearing on how we judge violent acts of terrorism. \n \n Now, if we are trying to write a historical analysis of either the violent anti-abortion movement or the Brown faction of the abolition movement, then of course we will seek to explain the motivations of the actors and place those actions in the context of the history of the movement to bring about change. I see two different purposes here. The first is to evaluate the morality of the actions, and there I think we need to use a consistent standard as I discuss above. The second purpose, that of the historical analysis, is to explain what happened and why. And for that, we try to explain people's actions and motivations in historical context without necessarily rending a moral judgment or evaluation. Can the second effort inform the first? I think so, but I think that in making a moral evaluation, we need to be careful not to let our support for a particular cause cloud our judgment of the terrorist means that some people have used.",

But I think I have established that there is a large body of opinion out there, in American popular thought, whereby John Brown looms larger than life, in a very positive way.

These are my opinions.\n \n \n \n Well, that's entirely possible. I'm not you.

I'm not giving away American history so that the anti-abortion movement can feel better about their domestic terrorist.\n \n Sorry, but to me, Roeder and John Brown are just not the same thing.

   "I think the American colonists really had no good justification for starting a revolution. The taxes imposed by the British were small, and the colonists owed the crown for the protection it had given them. One argument by scholars is that the king had allowed the colonists a huge amount of latitude to do as they pleased and not pay taxes that they should probably have been paying. When the king finally tried to tighten things up and raise some money through small taxes, the colonists got mad and rebelled. Another interesting argument by scholars is that the American Revolution was led by wealthy Americans who wanted to make money without the restrictions of the British mercantile system. \n \n I don't think there was much justification for a revolution by the Americans. We are simply taught from childhood to believe there was, because it's considered patriotic. And the rebels did launch an experiment in republican self-government that wound up serving as a model for much of the world, and they ended up being friends with the British eventually. So the end result was positive.\n\n \n I wasn't really taught anything of use about the American revolution when I was in school. Not even patriotic explanations. So I don't see my opinion as the result of any school system brainwashing because the school system didn't do anything there. My American history teacher in high school, for example, for the most part, sat around with a group of boy students, and they shot the breeze about history while girls like me sat on the outside, completely uninvolved, wondering about what the hell history was until we encountered \"other voices\" telling their stories. In the meantime, though they were the ones who owned and made history.\n \n If not for my family, American history would have died right there. I find oral story telling the most meaningful, for example, when it comes to this kind of material. In terms of the American revolution, I identify with the farmers who picked up their guns and went off to fight the British. The British were like terrorists to many of the colonists. I identify with the higher ideals and concepts being fought for.\n \n Just from reading your posts, though, in general, I'm sure you don't assert your opinions lightly or for the sake of \"shock value\" like a few others around here.

I jumped in here because I was so upset about the murder of Dr. Tiller and the apparent satisfaction that some people who oppose abortion were expressing about his murder.\n\n \n I read an LA Times and Huffingpost article about the memorial service for Dr. Tiller. His wife of 45 years, who is a church choir member, sang a sad and moving rendition of Psalm 23, solo by his casket. His children spoke, individually, too. I understand a few hundred attended, with numbers to about a thousand by the end. Off on the sidelines, was a scraggly group of far right wing religious protesters with signs about how he deserved to be killed. The HP article reported that they were with the same church that was involved in the funeral protest by anti-gay fanatics. Apparently, though, Kansas has a law about how close they could stand to a funeral with their hate-mongering signs. And it sounds like N.O.W. visually difused their disturbance by having a long line of women in t-shirts honoring Dr. Tiller on a sidewalk between them and the church service. Another doctor who performs late-term abortions and is now around seventy was also at the funeral. They say that he is one of only about two others in the country who do this procedure. The news media, in their typical way, asked if he was going now be retiring from practice. And he looked straight in the camera and let them know, that's he's never retiring. These lunatics don't care about the life of the mother, though they give it lip service. If they did, they wouldn't want to eliminate every person in the United States who performs late term abortions. How can you save the life of the mother if no one performs this procedure? Their figurative and literal death sentence to the specialty is a death sentence to women, too. But as ever, their so-called reasoning processes are not logically consistent.\n \n Oh - a veteran's group attended too. Dr. Tiller was in the Navy. So his assassin also murdered an American veteran.",

Do we really want to go there? \n \n Thoreau never said anything about this as he elevated Brown to the level of a saint or to the level of Christ in his writings.\n\n \n *Sigh* I really wasn't looking to engage in a debate on Brown. I wanted to share this piece of writing, however, since I had been compared to an anarchist who values killing defenseless innocents like a lowly coward. If so, then the accuser should be prepared to say the same thing about a number of other American heros who felt similarly about the immortalized John Brown. Starting with Henry David Thoreau. \n \n Henry David Thoreau saw quite accurately that events surrounding John Brown signaled the beginning of the Civil War. He saw, too, how history would remember him in the arts and music; and, he saw that Brown would one day be our reminder of how terrible slavery was. Thoreau was not so literal in his views of saints and Jesuses; I think his references were meant more figuratively. And, Henry David Thoreau was brave enough, like Brown, to take sides in a dispute which had reached a point whereupon, it was clear, that slavery was not going to end without armed conflict. He called the Republicans on what they were doing by distancing themselves from Brown and what was happening. As they virtually handed him over to the likes of Robert E. Lee and John Wilkes Booth, with his ticket to the show. \n \n You keep saying, too, they murdered in cold blood *just* for their beliefs; this is simply not the case. There was an armed conflict taking place in Kansas at that time and slavery was an obscenity unto itself. You neglect to mention, for example, that a couple of the men were returned to the house because it was determined that, though pro-slavery, they were not part of this conflict. They had not participated in the sack of Lawrence, threatening Free State settlers, or helping Border Ruffians from Missouri. \n \n You also mischaracterize the wife's witnessing of the event (which I have not read about and you do not cite, presumably because you are a history teacheer and therefore should not be expected to). You make it sound like Brown not only intended to kill the man, but intended to do so, in front of her. But this is not the case, either. They took them out of the house and into the dark, away from her.\n \n You also impose by implication this kind of modern disfunctional family dynamic judgment -- father ordered sons -- that is not applicable to the people in that day and age. They were grown men in an organized, ranked group against other organized, ranked groups who eventually became part of the Confederacy.\n \n In short, I think you color this piece of history through the lenses of the government and the press, if not southerners themselves, and through the eyes of a 21st century person.\n \n How can you sit there and morally judge John Brown? Why is so important to you to judge him? It was beginning of the Civil War.\n \n But I really think this is quite a digression from the purpose of the thread, so I will leave it there. Personally, I don't see any parallel between John Brown and what happened to Dr. Tiller, so I don't feel a need to destroy what John Brown did in an effort to justify an argument about Dr. Tiller's murder.\n \n There's just no comparison because there's no comparison in terms of facts or historical circumstances.\n \n Unless you are viewing the events in a very simple minded manner.",

Late term abortions when there is a grave risk to the woman's life (Note: Most pro-life proponents agree that this is a justifiable reason for abortions.)\n \n 2. Late term abortions in the case of rape or incest (Note: Most pro-life proponents agree that this is a justifiable reason for abortions.)\n \n 3. Late term abortions in the case of major risk to the woman's health. \n \n 4. Late term abortions in the case of fetal abnormality:\n a. Abnormality that would result in the born baby being unable to survive anyway.\n b. Abnormality that would lead to a very limited life (ex. autism, major disfiguration, etc.)\n \n Based on polling statistics, my guess is that most pro-life activists would object to reasons 3 and 4b (possibly also 4a) but would accept 1 and 2 as justifiable.

If you want to change it, you prove or establish the case otherwise.\n \n The burden is on you.\n\n \n The law is on your side, but science cannot prove that abortions are moral. Period.\n \n What science does say is an abortion, at any time, is ending the life of a developing human. That is an undeniable FACT.\n \n From there, it's a matter of beliefs. You can't even state your own personal opinion on the matter; you just say it's up to the woman to determine the morality herself. It all boils down to when you believe a developing human with no rights at all becomes a human being deserving of rights. Regardless of what you or I believe, neither one of us can prove our beliefs are moral. You can't seem to accept the fact that everyone bears the burden of proof on this issue.",

If somebody happens to be in the way of the gun, that's not the shooter's fault. That person should have moved. They are in control of their own body too, and if they don't choose to move, they are accepting the consequences of that action. Who are we to determine whether these people are moral in their actions? It should be left up to them.\n \n \nOh please. \n \n Children need adults to take care of them, and are educated by parents, thus, learning about responsibility and what it takes to be a responsible adult.\n \n Get real for once.\n\n \n Children need adults to take care of them, so they are not actually autonomous.

   "Tell me Antonia,... do you have a problem with a law which says that in a 3rd trimester \"life of the mother\" situation,.... that a doctor is required by law to do everything within their power to save BOTH the lives of the pregnant woman and the prebirth child in her womb?\n\n \n \n Yes, I do.

   "The point I responded to concerned existence. People who don't exist yet. \n \n You're bringing third trimester in. Whereupon, at some point, in a healthy pregnancy, I think you cross an ethical line. With state regulations rightfully kicking in. \n \n Dr. Tiller was practicing lawfully, though, in Kansas. \n \n And people are innocent in our country, until proven otherwise. I see no reason, from what has been presented on this board, to believe that Dr. Tiller violated the law.\n \n As for \"Genocide\" and \"infanticide\", well, that's pure hyperbole, and the kind of hyperbole that whooped up this madman toward his murderous act.\n \n Let me ask you this, Archangel. How can you say that you support third trimester abortions when the mother's health or life is endangered (if I recall your position correctly), if you don't think any doctor should perform this procedure?\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, show me evidence that in this day and age, with medical knowledge as advanced as it is, with womb cameras, inutero operations and all, explain to me and then prove that there is any reason at all why doctors would need to wait till the 9th month before they are able to determine that the pregnancy is a real and true risk to the mothers health. And why do you again pervert my stated opinion? I have said I support abortion for the health of the mother, but I have never said I supported late term abortion for any reason. And that's because it doesn't take 9 months to determine the pregnancy is a risk to the mothers life. If you were at all honest, you would admit that and demand responsibility from the industry you defend and support so fervently.\n \n Now, for once in your life antonia, please don't squirm and wiggle out of giving a direct answer to this legitimate question as you do in avoiding or ignoring every other damning point we reveal regarding how corrupted the abortion industry is in promoting abortions at all cost no matter how ethically wrong they are. \n \n There is a reason why there are only 2 abortionists in the whole country who do what Tiller did, and that's because only those two will create fallacious excuses and reasons to justify killing these perfectly healthy late term babies for an incredible 5,000 dollar bounty per kill. Only they would lie and manufacture reasons to commit this barbaric act of murder using such flimsy excuses from the mothers as they did.",

   "*Sigh* I really wasn't looking to engage in a debate on Brown. I wanted to share this piece of writing, however, since I had been compared to an anarchist who values killing defenseless innocents like a lowly coward. If so, then the accuser should be prepared to say the same thing about a number of other American heros who felt similarly about the immortalized John Brown. Starting with Henry David Thoreau. \n \n Henry David Thoreau saw quite accurately that events surrounding John Brown signaled the beginning of the Civil War. He saw, too, how history would remember him in the arts and music; and, he saw that Brown would one day be our reminder of how terrible slavery was. Thoreau was not so literal in his views of saints and Jesuses; I think his references were meant more figuratively. And, Henry David Thoreau was brave enough, like Brown, to take sides in a dispute which had reached a point whereupon, it was clear, that slavery was not going to end without armed conflict. He called the Republicans on what they were doing by distancing themselves from Brown and what was happening. As they virtually handed him over to the likes of Robert E. Lee and John Wilkes Booth, with his ticket to the show. \n \n You keep saying, too, they murdered in cold blood *just* for their beliefs; this is simply not the case. There was an armed conflict taking place in Kansas at that time and slavery was an obscenity unto itself. You neglect to mention, for example, that a couple of the men were returned to the house because it was determined that, though pro-slavery, they were not part of this conflict. They had not participated in the sack of Lawrence, threatening Free State settlers, or helping Border Ruffians from Missouri. \n \n You also mischaracterize the wife's witnessing of the event (which I have not read about and you do not cite, presumably because you are a history teacheer and therefore should not be expected to). You make it sound like Brown not only intended to kill the man, but intended to do so, in front of her. But this is not the case, either. They took them out of the house and into the dark, away from her.\n \n You also impose by implication this kind of modern disfunctional family dynamic judgment -- father ordered sons -- that is not applicable to the people in that day and age. They were grown men in an organized, ranked group against other organized, ranked groups who eventually became part of the Confederacy.\n \n In short, I think you color this piece of history through the lenses of the government and the press, if not southerners themselves, and through the eyes of a 21st century person.\n \n How can you sit there and morally judge John Brown? Why is so important to you to judge him? It was beginning of the Civil War.\n \n But I really think this is quite a digression from the purpose of the thread, so I will leave it there. Personally, I don't see any parallel between John Brown and what happened to Dr. Tiller, so I don't feel a need to destroy what John Brown did in an effort to justify an argument about Dr. Tiller's murder.\n \n There's just no comparison because there's no comparison in terms of facts or historical circumstances.\n \n Unless you are viewing the events in a very simple minded manner.\n\n \n I think one of the opponents of abortion first made a comparison between Scott Roeder and John Brown. I do think the comparison is useful in illuminating a moral problem regarding Scott Roeder. Was Roeder wrong because he murdered someone for a cause that you and I don't believe in? Or was Roeder wrong simply because he murdered someone, regardless of the cause he espoused? If we believe that it's okay for someone to commit murder when we believe the cause is just and the opponent appears to stand in the way of justice, then we are sanctioning what amounts to vigilante justice. We allow our belief in the cause to be a rationale for murder. \n \n John Brown, like Scott Roeder, took it upon himself to select and to assassinate men whom he regarded as the enemy. Does the fact that we may agree with Brown's cause make these murders somehow justified or less horrible? You have suggested that the context in which the murders took place, specifically warfare in Kansas, justified these murders. But we do not regard murder of civilians in Iraq as justified. We did not regard the murders at My Lai in Vietnam as justified. We do not excuse murder simply because there is a war in progress. \n \n The problem with saying that Brown's murders were okay because his cause was just and saying that Roeder's murder was wrong because his cause was unjust is that it opens the door to people justifying murder for a cause they believe in. Some opponents of abortion are saying what some opponents of slavery also said about John Brown: that the crimes committed by the murder victim justified him being murdered. In neither case do I agree with this. Who was Brown to decide that the Doyles deserved to be hacked to death? Who was Roeder to decide that Dr. Tiller deserved to be shot to death. Neither act can be justified. \n \n I think that we judge John Brown when we call him either a hero or a terrorist. And how we judge him should, I think, be based on a consistent moral standard that we also apply to Scott Roeder and to everyone. At least we should try to be morally consistent. \n \n Historical context can help us to understand the circumstances of a murder. But they should not be turned into an excuse for it. Scott Roeder's anger over abortion is not an excuse for him to murder someone.",

I don't know. Perhaps. Yes. (Though \"murder\", your choice of words, implies wrong.) I don't judge Brown, certainly. I think he was ahead of his time. I find him a courageous and insightful individual, however morally ambiguous, somewhat along the lines of what was said about him by Thoreau, Emerson, Frederick Douglas, and presumably, Harriet Tubman.\n \n I did not just mention Kansas alone, either. I asserted the atrocity of slavery and his acts in the context of the beginnings of the Civil War. \n \n There's just no parallel, factually, to abortion. Unless you are only asserting (a) he believed his cause was just (like Roeder), and (b) he took the law into his own hands when killing an other/s (like Roeder)\n \n There are many parallels that fit those two qualifications. I don't believe that either, in combination, absolutely and always puts someone in the category of terrorism or even wrong. There's a right and wrong, but the world isn't that black and white.\n \n \nBut we do not regard murder of civilians in Iraq as justified. We did not regard the murders at My Lai in Vietnam as justified. We do not excuse murder simply because there is a war in progress.\n\n \n Well, actually, we do excuse \"murder\", a great deal, simply because a war is in progress. William Calley, for example, is not sitting in a prison for the rest of his life (as he probably should); he's working as a shoe salesman, last I read. We do regard \"murder\" of civilians as justified under any number of other circumstances simply because there's a war in progress. We \"murdered\" hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians when we dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We \"murdered\" German civilians when we mercilessly bombed Dresden. If Iraqi civilians appear to represent a threat, we \"murder\" them, too. And in Brown's situation, as I mentioned earlier, they did not even pursue what we might conventionally view as vulnerable innocents. They sent away pro-slavery men who weren't involved in the three forms of pro-slavery violence. These were actively engaged in organized conflict with one another. The pro-slavery groups eventually becoming a basis for the Confederacy. With Robert E. Lee and John Wilkes Booth attending Brown's hanging.\n \n \nThe problem with saying that Brown's murders were okay because his cause was just and saying that Roeder's murder was wrong because his cause was unjust is that it opens the door to people justifying murder for a cause they believe in. \n\n \n Well, I suppose there's some problem with that, but people who are like that are going find an excuse one way or the other. I don't see slavery and abortion as anything like one another, except for the fact that there's a matter of control over others' bodies and lives, when you talk, for example, about slaves and women. \n \n \nSome opponents of abortion are saying what some opponents of slavery also said about John Brown: that the crimes committed by the murder victim justified him being murdered. In neither case do I agree with this. Who was Brown to decide that the Doyles deserved to be hacked to death? Who was Roeder to decide that Dr. Tiller deserved to be shot to death. Neither act can be justified. \n\n \n I am understanding from your argument that you put the government, then, in the driver's seat. But isn't the government ever wrong?

   "Well, you certainly defended this video, Archangel. How interesting to now hear that you were defending material you hadn't even viewed. \n \n But I'm not going to do your homework for you. It's on this thread; jyoshu posted it. So search his posts on these pages.\n\n \n I went back and looked, he posted this on his second post. Dr. George Tiller Admits to Performing Abortions the Day Before Delivery | NowPublic News Coverage\n \n Here's an excerpt from it, are you proud of what your feminist groups represent in holding this baby killer up as some sort of hero? Abortionist Tiller Admits to Performing Abortions the Day Before DeliveryHis Speech at National Education Association\n By John-Henry Westen \n \n ARLINGTON, VA, March 19, 2008 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Notorious partial-birth abortion specialist Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, KS, was caught on hidden video admitting to aborting babies a day before the mother's due date. Students for Life of America (SFLA) today released the video which was made at the Feminist Majority Foundation's annual Women's Leadership Conference held at the National Education Association (NEA) on March 9. \n \n The video reveals Dr. Tiller showcasing massive and graphic pictures of children with fetal abnormalities that he had aborted, so as to make the case for late-term abortions as necessary medical procedure. SFLA's Executive Director Kristan Hawkins, who videotaped the conference and interviewed Tiller clandestinely, commented on the gruesome pictures of aborted children Tiller showed, saying, \"One had an extra arm: could not that child had survived and received corrective surgery? Was violently killing the child the only way to go?\"\n \n \"Pro-lifers are regularly condemned for displaying pictures of aborted babies, but here the pro-abortion crowd and the NEA are more than happy to showcase these graphic images, and even gave Dr. Tiller's presentation a standing ovation,\" added Hawkins.\n \n \nAnderson Cooper discusses with her, on the video, how she had has to hide her identity in some form because she received threats from your wacko comrades when she learned they had gotten a medically necessary third trimester abortion (because the fetus had no brain or skull). This is entirely believable to me, considering the murder of Dr. Tiller, the demonstrators with their hate-mongering signs outside his funeral, and the kind of rhetoric you guys are inclined to engage in.\n\n \n Why do you just reiterate your original claims rather than respond to my statement at all? I said, and very accurately that this child was no threat to the mothers life at all. It was seriously deformed and wouldn't have survived anyway, so why the abortion?\n \n And if she was truly afraid for her safety, she never would have allowed her name to be given out over the public airwaves. It is just one more attempt to demonize the opposition by making claims that they are dangerous when it is that woman herself who is endorsing the murder of fully developed children. \n \n \nYour side presented this video as evidence which I falsified on this thread. I consider it evidence only of how you abuse the rules of evidence and logical thinking in order to reach your bizarre conclusions like \"a holocaust of millions of babies is taking place.\"\n\n \n You falsified nothing at all. You just complained and lashed out irrationally which is your MO. Show where you disproved anything in that link which jyoshu posted originally.\n \n \nHow is this an answer to my question, Archangel? You are implying that you don't believe there are legitimate reasons for abortions during the 9th month of pregnancy. But you have also said that you support 3rd trimester abortions -- which include more than the 9th month -- if the life or health of the mother is at stake.\n \n So how can you simultaneously assert that no doctor should perform this procedure if you also assert that an abortion can performed in order to save the mother's life?\n\n \n SHOW WHERE, ACTUALLY QUOTE ME ENDORSING AND SUPPORTING LATE TERM ABORTION OR STOP SAYING I DID IT.\n \n \nWho is going to perform this abortion, Archangel? After you've detroyed this specialty in medicine?\n\n \n How about actual doctors/OBGYNs rather than abortionists?\n \n \nBrother. In your last post.\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Show me where I said I support late term abortions in my last post. Quote the post by link.",

And bringing abortion back into mainstream medical practice at hospitals, etc. Though I imagine a specialist is needed under some circumstances. Some late term abortions perhaps being such an example.\n \n Another option is what they have done in the Netherlands, whereby all reproductive health services, from birth control to abortion (I don't think pre-natal or delivery, though, but I'm not sure), are provided at separate facilities. But there are plenty of them, along with plenty of practitioners (at least, compared to the U.S.). The Netherlands has the lowest abortion rate internationally (if not one of the lowest rates) as they appear to combine legalization with universal health, wide-spread and forthright education, along with easy access to all such health services. Of course, their nation is much smaller. Their system, too, allows practitioners (for example, pharmacists) who are morally opposed to certain practices not to participate, without jeopardizing the rights and health of others.",

   "*Sigh* I really wasn't looking to engage in a debate on Brown. I wanted to share this piece of writing, however, since I had been compared to an anarchist who values killing defenseless innocents like a lowly coward. If so, then the accuser should be prepared to say the same thing about a number of other American heros who felt similarly about the immortalized John Brown. Starting with Henry David Thoreau. \n \n Henry David Thoreau saw quite accurately that events surrounding John Brown signaled the beginning of the Civil War. He saw, too, how history would remember him in the arts and music; and, he saw that Brown would one day be our reminder of how terrible slavery was. Thoreau was not so literal in his views of saints and Jesuses; I think his references were meant more figuratively. And, Henry David Thoreau was brave enough, like Brown, to take sides in a dispute which had reached a point whereupon, it was clear, that slavery was not going to end without armed conflict. He called the Republicans on what they were doing by distancing themselves from Brown and what was happening. As they virtually handed him over to the likes of Robert E. Lee and John Wilkes Booth, with his ticket to the show. \n \n You keep saying, too, they murdered in cold blood *just* for their beliefs; this is simply not the case. There was an armed conflict taking place in Kansas at that time and slavery was an obscenity unto itself. You neglect to mention, for example, that a couple of the men were returned to the house because it was determined that, though pro-slavery, they were not part of this conflict. They had not participated in the sack of Lawrence, threatening Free State settlers, or helping Border Ruffians from Missouri. \n \n You also mischaracterize the wife's witnessing of the event (which I have not read about and you do not cite, presumably because you are a history teacheer and therefore should not be expected to). You make it sound like Brown not only intended to kill the man, but intended to do so, in front of her. But this is not the case, either. They took them out of the house and into the dark, away from her.\n \n You also impose by implication this kind of modern disfunctional family dynamic judgment -- father ordered sons -- that is not applicable to the people in that day and age. They were grown men in an organized, ranked group against other organized, ranked groups who eventually became part of the Confederacy.\n \n In short, I think you color this piece of history through the lenses of the government and the press, if not southerners themselves, and through the eyes of a 21st century person.\n \n How can you sit there and morally judge John Brown? Why is so important to you to judge him? It was beginning of the Civil War.\n \n But I really think this is quite a digression from the purpose of the thread, so I will leave it there. Personally, I don't see any parallel between John Brown and what happened to Dr. Tiller, so I don't feel a need to destroy what John Brown did in an effort to justify an argument about Dr. Tiller's murder.\n \n There's just no comparison because there's no comparison in terms of facts or historical circumstances.\n \n Unless you are viewing the events in a very simple minded manner.\n\n \n Let's analyze this some more. Brown's murders at Pottawatomie took place in the spring of 1856, five years before the start of the Civil War. That Brown recognized the events in Kansas as the beginning of war is probably true, but it was a war that he himself sought to provoke, and the wider war was still five years in the future. \n \n Do we excuse murder even in wartime? No, or at least we should not. We do distinguish between acts of war and atrocities and murders. The murderers at My Lai in Vietnam and their superiors who gave the orders were indeed let off, but they should not have been, as you say you agree, at least when it comes to William Calley. The distinctions we try to draw between legitimate acts of war and atrocities or murders often break down in reality, but we still try to make them. In the body of doctrine known as \"just war doctrine,\" the killing of civilians is always to be avoided. In just war doctrine, a just war must be for a just cause, and it must be fought by just means. By this standard, the Allies in WWII fought for a just cause, but they did not use consistently just means, because of the numerous civilian deaths and the bombings of cities. One might argue that there can be no such thing as a just war, but if we stop trying to create rules of conduct, especially in wartime, then we risk sinking into engaging in random slaughter. And in the case of the murders by John Brown, there was violence aplenty in Kansas, but this was not yet the Civil War, which was still 5 years away. \n \n We should judge John Brown for his acts, not just the ones we may applaud, but for the whole of what he did. You judge him yourself; you judge him positively. But can one really justify or excuse the murder of 5 men at Pottawatomie because they were Border Ruffians or because Brown thought they were? The evidence from the time suggests that Brown committed what he viewed as preventive murder, because he assumed that these five men were going to attack free-state settlers. They had actually not done so, as far as we know. Some had made drunken threats. Do we sanction the murder of people who make threats? Have those of us who are pro-choice gone out and murdered anti-abortion activists who have made threats? Would we be justified in doing so? Have those of us who oppose prejudice and discrimination gone out and murdered white supremacists like James von Brunn because they made threats? No, we have not. John Brown, in contrast, took it upon himself to lead a party of men who murdered five men because Brown decided that they deserved this because of their alleged or real threats. He appointed himself policeman, judge, jury, and executioner. \n \n In 1910, the grandson of the famous abolitionist William LLoyd Garrison wrote a biography of John Brown. Oswald Garrison Villard was a journalist and a founder of the NAACP, a supporter of racial equality, and an anti-imperialist. In the section of his book on the murders at Pottawatomie, Villard considered in detail the actions of John Brown in those murders. He wrote the following:\n \n \"From the point of view of ethics, John Brown's crime on the Pottawatomie cannot be successfully palliated or excused. It must ever remain a complete indictment of his judgment and wisdom; a dark blot upon his memory.\" (Oswald Garrison Villard, John Brown 1800-1859, A Biography Fifty Years After, 1910, 187. \n \n In Villard's assessment, Brown's actions at Pottawatomie caused the free-state people to lose the moral high ground in the battle over slavery in Kansas. Before the murders, Villard argues, the free-state men claimed that they were the victims of violence and terrorism committed by pro-slavery men who had poured into the state. After the murders, Villard argues, that argument was lost, as blood was now on the hands of the free-state men as well. Pro-slavery people could argue, \"You murder people in cold blood.\" \n \n Villard concludes his chapter on Pottawatomie with this assessment: \"For John Brown no pleas can be made that will enable him to escape coming before the bar of historical judgment. There his wealth of self-sacrifice, and the nobility of his aims, do not avail to prevent a complete condemnation of his bloody crime at Pottawatomie, or a just penalty for his taking of human life without warrant or authority. If he deserves to live in history, it is not because of his cruel, gruesome, reprehensible acts on the Pottawatomie but despite them.\" (Villard, 188).\n \n The same can be said of Scott Roeder, though many of us do not regard his aims as in any way \"noble.\" \n \n The parallel I draw is not between abortion and slavery. The parallel I draw is between murder in the name of a cause and murder in the name of a cause. And the cause does not justify the murder.",

The parallel I draw is between murder in the name of a cause and murder in the name of a cause. And the cause does not justify the murder.\n\n \n OhioProf,\n \n I understand what you're saying, but I don't agree. I think if you judge John Brown thus, you do an injustice to the obscenity that was slavery. You know full well that Brown's contemporary abolitionists spoke quite highly of him -- even elevated his dedication, to a cause greater than himself, as moreso than their own. For example, Frederick Douglas. And he was a beacon of inspiration for Union soldiers.\n \n I do not believe that people are entirely self-serving. I think people act on behalf of nobler aims, too, and sometimes sacrifice their lives for the sake of others.\n \n I notice that you have neglected to answer a number of questions I have posed you in this discussion, and more than once. For example, when exactly do you think armed conflict is justified?\n \n You have said that you don't even think the American revolutionaries were justified.\n \n Well, when out of the history of American armed conflicts, were they? Or is your position that of a pacifist?\n \n I think you are hedging.\n \n I also think there was a lot going on in Kansas and you well know it. Those \"innocent\" people were involved in a heckofalot of merde. This nation stood poised at the crossroads of its future. Slavery was not going to just take a walk away.\n \n Finally, and with all due respect, the problem I often see with history teachers is that they want to make citizens. In that process of making citizens, they think their students are too simple-minded to distinguish between a John Brown and a Scott Roeder or a William Calley or a Nat Turner, so they seek to churn out students ready to recite black and white moral principles, since they're convinced they can't think in grey.\n \n Most people are not that stupid, though. And if they are that stupid or violent, well, they aren't going to understand principles of pacifism anyway. \n \n Besides, citizens have to make themselves.\n \n I'm no longer sure if this conversation belongs on this thread or an American history thread. So I'll just continue or not (depending on whether or not interest can be sustained) wheresoever others want to take it.\n \n I do think John Brown, though, defies our typical methods of classification insofar as his actions were concerned. He is both an inspiring and heroic figure, as well as being morally ambiguous. But any view of John Brown is initimately tied up in how we view and judge slavery. John Brown represents an uncompromising willingness to see every American, not just some, as equally, equally, equally entitled to the gift of liberty. And the right to fight for it.",

   "Btw, here is what PBS has on its website, in summary of John Brown. So I hardly think my perspective is out of mainstream sentiments, even by today's standards:\n \n ----------------\n \n John Brown was a man of action -- a man who would not be deterred from his mission of abolishing slavery. On October 16, 1859, he led 21 men on a raid of the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His plan to arm slaves with the weapons he and his men seized from the arsenal was thwarted, however, by local farmers, militiamen, and Marines led by Robert E. Lee. Within 36 hours of the attack, most of Brown's men had been killed or captured.\n \n John Brown was born into a deeply religious family in Torrington, Connecticut, in 1800. Led by a father who was vehemently opposed to slavery, the family moved to northern Ohio when John was five, to a district that would become known for its antislavery views.\n \n During his first fifty years, Brown moved about the country, settling in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, and taking along his ever-growing family. (He would father twenty children.) Working at various times as a farmer, wool merchant, tanner, and land speculator, he never was finacially successful -- he even filed for bankruptcy when in his forties. His lack of funds, however, did not keep him from supporting causes he believed in. He helped finance the publication of David Walker's Appeal and Henry Highland's \"Call to Rebellion\" speech. He gave land to fugitive slaves. He and his wife agreed to raise a black youth as one of their own. He also participated in the Underground Railroad and, in 1851, helped establish the League of Gileadites, an organization that worked to protect escaped slaves from slave catchers. \n \n In 1847 Frederick Douglass met Brown for the first time in Springfield, Massachusetts. Of the meeting Douglass stated that, \"though a white gentleman, [Brown] is in sympathy a black man, and as deeply interested in our cause, as though his own soul had been pierced with the iron of slavery.\" It was at this meeting that Brown first outlined his plan to Douglass to lead a war to free slaves.\n \n Brown moved to the black community of North Elba, New York, in 1849. The community had been established thanks to the philanthropy of Gerrit Smith, who donated tracts of at least 50 acres to black families willing to clear and farm the land. Brown, knowing that many of the families were finding life in this isolated area difficult, offered to establish his own farm there as well, in order to lead the blacks by his example and to act as a \"kind father to them.\" \n \n Despite his contributions to the antislavery cause, Brown did not emerge as a figure of major significance until 1855 after he followed five of his sons to the Kansas territory. There, he became the leader of antislavery guerillas and fought a proslavery attack against the antislavery town of Lawrence. The following year, in retribution for another attack, Brown went to a proslavery town and brutally killed five of its settlers. Brown and his sons would continue to fight in the territory and in Missouri for the rest of the year.\n \n Brown returned to the east and began to think more seriously about his plan for a war in Virginia against slavery. He sought money to fund an \"army\" he would lead. On October 16, 1859, he set his plan to action when he and 21 other men -- 5 blacks and 16 whites -- raided the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry.\n \n Brown was wounded and quickly captured, and moved to Charlestown, Virginia, where he was tried and convicted of treason, Before hearing his sentence, Brown was allowed make an address to the court. \n \n \n . . . I believe to have interfered as I have done, . . . in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it be deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children, and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit: so let it be done.\"\n \n Although initially shocked by Brown's exploits, many Northerners began to speak favorably of the militant abolitionist. \"He did not recognize unjust human laws, but resisted them as he was bid. . . .,\" said Henry David Thoreau in an address to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts. \"No man in America has ever stood up so persistently and effectively for the dignity of human nature. . . .\"\n \n John Brown was hanged on December 2, 1859.\n \n John Brown\n \n --------------------",

The point is that you hold up this term, \"extraordinary means\", asserting it as the basis for one argument, when you clearly don't employ it otherwise. With all due respect, one would think, too, from your personal experiences, that you would have more empathy for how physiologically tied up in the fetus, a woman's body is, and how personal and often complex these decisions are, between family members and their physicians. You are the one wasting both of our time, and trying to trip and set people up, along with your repeated efforts to win an argument by insinuating things about character and intent.\n \n \nA human fetus is a human child which is in the fetal stage of his or her life.

   "I don't know what you think your getting at with that tone, Chester.\n\n \n What I'm getting at is your arrogance in thinking that you and you alone have THE answer to one of the more metaphysical questions that can ever be asked. Why on earth must the world accept your definitions to the exclusion of all others?\n \n \nThe Constitution (as written) says that all persons have a right the life they are living. The definitions, links and other information I have provided are what I used to conclude that a person's life begins at conception.\n\n \n Excuse me, but the Constituion says no such thing. A MUCH stronger argument, and another possible answer to the metaphysical question can be made for the argument that the Constitution equates personhood with live birth. See the Census Clause and Amendment 14 for proof. \n \n \nI believe that a person's rights should begin when their life does.... and not just when someone like you can't justify the denial anymore.\n\n \n Good for you. We in the pro-choice community will support your choice to the ultimate. Just remember that you have no right to impose that metaphysical proposition on others who do not share it.\n \n \n \n \n \nAntonia and myself were not having a debate, Chester. She insisted that it's a \"discussion.\" And the way it works is this,.. \"I get to chose the terms for my continued participation and Antonia or anyone else can do the same.\"\n\n \n Should we take that to mean that if others do NOT agree that you will go away?\n \n \n \n \nRoe v. Wade was not decided with a unanimous vote. Justices White and Rehnquist's dissents should be sufficient enough to show that the matter was not settled, even in the case of Roe.\n \n That's right. The same Justice Rehnquist that went on to become \"Chief Justice\" of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n \n And so what? \n \n Under the American system, a majority of the nine Justices is all that is required.\n \n Now, if you want to change the American system, that's a very different topic.",

   "Btw, here is what PBS has on its website, in summary of John Brown. So I hardly think my perspective is out of mainstream sentiments, even by today's standards:\n \n ----------------\n \n John Brown was a man of action -- a man who would not be deterred from his mission of abolishing slavery. On October 16, 1859, he led 21 men on a raid of the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His plan to arm slaves with the weapons he and his men seized from the arsenal was thwarted, however, by local farmers, militiamen, and Marines led by Robert E. Lee. Within 36 hours of the attack, most of Brown's men had been killed or captured.\n \n John Brown was born into a deeply religious family in Torrington, Connecticut, in 1800. Led by a father who was vehemently opposed to slavery, the family moved to northern Ohio when John was five, to a district that would become known for its antislavery views.\n \n During his first fifty years, Brown moved about the country, settling in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, and taking along his ever-growing family. (He would father twenty children.) Working at various times as a farmer, wool merchant, tanner, and land speculator, he never was finacially successful -- he even filed for bankruptcy when in his forties. His lack of funds, however, did not keep him from supporting causes he believed in. He helped finance the publication of David Walker's Appeal and Henry Highland's \"Call to Rebellion\" speech. He gave land to fugitive slaves. He and his wife agreed to raise a black youth as one of their own. He also participated in the Underground Railroad and, in 1851, helped establish the League of Gileadites, an organization that worked to protect escaped slaves from slave catchers. \n \n In 1847 Frederick Douglass met Brown for the first time in Springfield, Massachusetts. Of the meeting Douglass stated that, \"though a white gentleman, [Brown] is in sympathy a black man, and as deeply interested in our cause, as though his own soul had been pierced with the iron of slavery.\" It was at this meeting that Brown first outlined his plan to Douglass to lead a war to free slaves.\n \n Brown moved to the black community of North Elba, New York, in 1849. The community had been established thanks to the philanthropy of Gerrit Smith, who donated tracts of at least 50 acres to black families willing to clear and farm the land. Brown, knowing that many of the families were finding life in this isolated area difficult, offered to establish his own farm there as well, in order to lead the blacks by his example and to act as a \"kind father to them.\" \n \n Despite his contributions to the antislavery cause, Brown did not emerge as a figure of major significance until 1855 after he followed five of his sons to the Kansas territory. There, he became the leader of antislavery guerillas and fought a proslavery attack against the antislavery town of Lawrence. The following year, in retribution for another attack, Brown went to a proslavery town and brutally killed five of its settlers. Brown and his sons would continue to fight in the territory and in Missouri for the rest of the year.\n \n Brown returned to the east and began to think more seriously about his plan for a war in Virginia against slavery. He sought money to fund an \"army\" he would lead. On October 16, 1859, he set his plan to action when he and 21 other men -- 5 blacks and 16 whites -- raided the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry.\n \n Brown was wounded and quickly captured, and moved to Charlestown, Virginia, where he was tried and convicted of treason, Before hearing his sentence, Brown was allowed make an address to the court. \n \n \n . . . I believe to have interfered as I have done, . . . in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it be deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children, and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit: so let it be done.\"\n \n Although initially shocked by Brown's exploits, many Northerners began to speak favorably of the militant abolitionist. \"He did not recognize unjust human laws, but resisted them as he was bid. . . .,\" said Henry David Thoreau in an address to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts. \"No man in America has ever stood up so persistently and effectively for the dignity of human nature. . . .\"\n \n John Brown was hanged on December 2, 1859.\n \n John Brown\n \n --------------------\n\n \n I'm sorry I did not respond sooner. Daily life intruded! I have enjoyed reading your exchanges with Chuz Life. \n \n On the subject of John Brown, there appeared in a local newspaper here in Ohio a story today about Brown, who lived in this region. Here is a link to the story in today's Akron Beacon Journal. Ohio.com - 150-year debate on John Brown divides America\n \n I figured you would find this interesting. \n \n On the question you raised about when it's okay to use violence, this is a hard question to answer. No, I am not a pacifist. I try to live according to non-violent principles, but I do think that sometimes, violence is the only means of defending oneself or other people or defending or winning people's freedom. I do remain open to the possiblity that I am wrong about this, and I personally would use violence only in self-defense from an attack. \n \n So when is violence justified? That's not an easy question to answer. I think that if we adhere to a belief in \"the inherent worth and dignity of every person,\" which is a principle of my own faith, Unitarian Universalism, that will serve as a guide. It suggests that people need to be very careful about engaging in \"revolutionary violence\" that takes the lives of others. We need to be very, very reluctant to take up arms for a cause, no matter how much we embrace the cause. It's one thing to take up a struggle. It's another thing to take up arms and kill other people. \n \n John Brown was remarkable for his racial egalitarianism in an era when few white Americans regarded African Americans as their equals, as deserving of equal rights, equal treatment, equal opportunity, equal social acceptance. Most Republicans in Congress supported a partial equality, not full equality. Brown was an exception. So, too, was William Lloyd Garrison, who rejected Brown's use of violence. There were other white abolitionists who were true racial egalitarians, like Wendell Phillips. In the society as a whole, this was a rare way of seeing among whites. Most whites still endorsed colonization of African Americans in Africa or elsewhere. They found the idea of white and black people living side-by-side in the society as equals to be shocking, unthinkable even. Brown and Garrison were exceptions; they both insisted that white Americans would have to live alongside African Americans as equals, and they'd better get used to it. \n \n But Brown was not a believer that the lives of all people are sacred and should never be taken. His approach to ending slavery reflected his interpretation of his Calvinist religious faith. Brown believed that God is not merciful, but vengeful, and that God had chosen Brown as an instrument of his will to destroy those who sinned. And in Brown's view, slavery was the worst sin. He saw his own violence as God's punishment of those who held human beings in bondage. His belief that he was an agent of God has led scholars to engage in a long debate over whether Brown was insane or not. \n \n While I applaud Brown's racial egalitarianism, I think he was a dangerous man, a violent man, a vengeful man, a terrorist. He decided that others should die. He justified this by his religious beliefs. This is not all that different from extremist anti-abortion activists who claim that they are doing God's work by murdering abortion providers. The only difference is that these were different causes, and I agree with the anti-slavery cause, and I disagree with the anti-abortion cause. But belief in a cause does not make murdering other people right. \n \n One reason, I think, why the sectional divide over slavery got to the point of a man like Brown leading an attack on a federal arsenal is because the society had largely shut down the opportunities for the peaceful eradication of slavery. I see the framers of the constitution as leaving the matter of slavery open to future generations to decide. Garrison argued that the constitution was a proslavery document, but I think that in the minds of those Northerners who ratified the constitution, it was a neutral document, a document that left open the possibility of ending slavery through the political process. But this turned out to be impossible, as the southern power in Congress precluded political means of ending slavery. The Republicans came along with a new approach, that of blocking the admission of new slave states into the union. Republicans like Lincoln believed that by shutting off the spread of slavery, the peculiar institution would eventually collapse. Southern slaveholders feared the same thing. \n \n And then Chief Justice Roger Taney made his ruling in the Dred Scott case. I see the Dred Scott decision as central in widening the sectional divide and in making abolitionists think that there was no longer any opportunity to use political means to end slavery. Taney declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. He said that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery anywhere, and by implication, he appeared to be saying that states did not have that power either. Taney said, in effect, that slave ownership was a right, and the government could not deny to slave owners the right to go wherever they wanted or to do what they wanted with their slave property. Northerners had long argued that there was a \"slave power conspiracy\" aimed at fastening slavery on the entire nation, and the opinion of Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott appeared to them to be the fulfillment of that prediction.\n \n Anyhow, these developments, I think, help to explain the beginnings of the use of violence in the antislavery cause. But in my mind, they do not justify Brown's murders at Pottawatomie. These actions by Brown did not help to end slavery, and Brown himself denied them. Did the raid on Harper's Ferry help to end slavery? Probably, though the raid itself was a failure. However, it may have been Brown's intention all along to have the raid fail, and to become the martyr and the symbol that he did become. \n \n One movement that was very interesting in this period was the disunion movement in the North. Northern abolitionists argued that the North should secede from the Union; their motto was \"No union with slaveholders!\" Had the abolitionists convinced the North to secede, the subsequent course of history would have been very different. I don't know what that course would have been, though, because this is counter-factual history.",

It's intriguing to see mention of one of Brown's descendants, as our conversation had me pondering that he must have many such descendants today, as he had so many children. If I were one of Brown's descendants, I too, would certainly feel very proud of such a heritage.\n \n I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on this subject, though I think we share some common views on non-violence and the exceptionality of circumstances that justify when people may employ \"taking up arms\" on a cause (though obviously, on what constitutes such a justifiable scenario, we differ, there).\n \n I don't think the current trend in historical comparisons of Brown (to say, the Taliban or the religious right of today) is going to last. \n \n But history shall tell, won't it. \n \n I'm going to drop the Brown debate for now, as I've said pretty much said all I'm going to say on that subject, for the time being.

   "I agree with you, however.., there is a unique circumstance here. \n \n According to earlier posts on this thread, most third trimester abortions occur because of the grave danger to the mother or because of a less than perfect unborn child.\n \n I'm not sure what the date was when the Dr. was killed, but the first post about it was 5/31.\n \n So here we are 26 days or so since his death and I haven't of heard any women dying from complications involving thier pregnancies, and again, according to the previous posts, there must be a number of children that were born who would have met thier demise had the Dr. not been shot.\n \n Now before everybody starts calling me names, I'm not advocating what happened to the Dr. The entire subject is rife with tragedy, regardless of a persons opinion about abortion.\n \n But to the person who was already of the opinion that abortion is murder, one murder, saving four babies is a \"net\" gain of three.\n \n I suppose to the degree that a person believes abortion is murder, would be proportional to the degree of how much that person would celebrate the Dr.'s death.\n\n \n This is a pile of poop!\n \n There is no unique circumstance here buddy, the killer was wrong to do what he did, period.\n \n You people live in a fantasy world.",

   "Prove you are a human. Please explain what authority granted your definition of what is a human. \nThat's... a many-layered question. Several answers, and all. It also depends on what you mean by 'human' and the appropriate context - is it socially or biologically? Legally? A corpse is human, would that need to be included by my definition?\n \n I'll give some definitions, then some of the flaws in the definitions.\n \n Firstly, socially: I am reminded of the turing test. My authority as a 'human' comes from that fact that I am near-unanimously treated as a human.\n Problem: how many people treat their cat as a human being? If I say I'm a human and the majority disagree, what does that make me?\n \n Secondly, biologically: My DNA lies within the current range of DNA that falls into the category of 'homo sapiens'. The authority for that is the scientific community.\n Problem: This definition also applies to my toe, to a strand of my hair, to my corpse, so it depends on what you define to be 'a human'. The 'scientific definition' is also far from absolute, as are all scientific definitions.\n \n Thirdly, personally: I self-define as 'human'. The authority here is my own - how tautological!\n Problem: What if I self-define as 'human' - but have no means by which to communicate this to others? cf pro-life.\n \n In all, I cannot absolutely prove the fact that I am human; it's a non-absolute term that is almost as easy to define as 'beauty' (especially considering terms like 'dehumanising'). Even if it were not, solipism is always lurking. However, I fit the current scientific definition for one.\n \n Relating that to Chuz's position... I'm going to have to explain my 'dictionary' criticism, aren't I? OK... first, though, I would say that (in terms of the life of an individual) the scientific community has yet to come up with a definition. So Chuz cannot show that a foetus is individually 'alive' - because he can't even define 'alive'. That was (at least partly) my point.\n \n With that said... Chuz's basis for 'a foetus is a human individual' lies, largely, on this definition: Child definition #4: 'a human fetus'. \n \n The fallacy he is committing here... I don't know the proper name for it, but I'd call it guilt by association. Chuz gives us the word 'child', and we automatically conjure a mental image of definition #1 - a baby with an individual personality, rights etc. He then points out that one of the definitions of 'child' is 'a human fetus'; and expects us to move those features of the child associated with our mental image - personality, etc - to the 'human fetus'. Ergo - a 'fetus' is a 'child' which is a 'person'.\n \n However, this isn't good reasoning. To show this, another definition - at the tips of your fingers. If I were to give you the word 'nail', you may well instantly think of fingernails. You get the mental associations associated with them (definition #2), and so on. I then point out that one definition of the word 'nail' is 'a slender, typically rod-shaped rigid piece of metal' (definition #1); and expect you to move those features associated with the mental image - growing on your fingers, etc - to the 'rod of iron'. Ergo - an 'iron rod' is a 'nail' which 'grows on the end of your fingers'.\n \n In short, Chuz fails to distinguish between 'child' (foetus) and 'child' (person) - just as I failed to distinguish between 'nail' (fingertips) and 'nail' (iron rod).\n \n If Chuz wants to show that a foetus is 'factually defined' as an alive individual, similar to a child, he needs to show a direct scientific definition linking those two things - not the 'guilt by association' reasoning he's been showing so far. Even then, it doesn't make it 'absolute' - as A_O said, there is a difference between what a thing is called and what it is. But it'd be a start.",

   "Who's denying that fetus are individual organisms?\n\n \n Hi CUNx,... Presently, IANGB is the one denying this. There may be others in denial of this as well.\n \n \n Of course they are individual organisms,.. \n\n \n Do you think you could help me convince IANGB and others of that fact?\n \n \n I'm not buying the your forthcoming argument that just because something is an individual organism it has equal 'value' at all stages of development. \n\n \n I don't begrudge you anticipating my forthcoming arguments, CUNx.... But \"equal value at all stages of development\" was not the direction I was headed. \n \n \n IMO a fetus is a human but that doesn't mean its cognizant and it doesn't mean its 'equal' to its mother.\n\n \n I never said that a fetus is cognizant. In fact, I reject the notion that prebirth sentience is even relevant to the debate. And again,... my \"forthcoming argument\" is not one geared towards equating women and their prebirth children where anything other than the most basic human rights are concerned. \n \n \n The point of freedom of choice is that a woman should have control of her body.\n\n \n I agree. We all should have the ultimate right to control our bodies. But I'm hoping that YOU will agree with me, CUNxTIME,... that one person's rights end where another person's rights begin,... don't you? \n \n \n The woman must be allowed to chose make the horrible choice to terminate a pregnancy if she does not want to carry the baby to term.\n\n \n I'm sorry,... but I don't agree with you on that one at all. What you are suggesting is akin to the parent of a one year old claiming the right to kill it because they don't want to be a parent anymore. \n \n Children have a right to live their life without being molested. And they have the Constitutional right to due process and equal protection under the law as well. Any laws to the contrary are in fact Un-Constitutional. IMO.\n \n \n You don't have the right to dictate to a woman what she can or must do with her uterus, nor does the fetus have the right for that matter. Terrible but true. \n\n \n But, CUNxTime,.. I do have the right to speak out against laws which deny the rights, lives and personhood of unwanted children; and to petition the government for redress. \"Terrible but true.\"\n \n \n Hopefully, one day, the world will be such that all women want to keep their babies and all women who don't want babies will have a 100% effective contraceptive.

   "That's... a many-layered question. Several answers, and all. It also depends on what you mean by 'human' and the appropriate context - is it socially or biologically? Legally? A corpse is human, would that need to be included by my definition?\n \n I'll give some definitions, then some of the flaws in the definitions.\n \n Firstly, socially: I am reminded of the turing test. My authority as a 'human' comes from that fact that I am near-unanimously treated as a human.\n Problem: how many people treat their cat as a human being? If I say I'm a human and the majority disagree, what does that make me?\n \n Secondly, biologically: My DNA lies within the current range of DNA that falls into the category of 'homo sapiens'. The authority for that is the scientific community.\n Problem: This definition also applies to my toe, to a strand of my hair, to my corpse, so it depends on what you define to be 'a human'. The 'scientific definition' is also far from absolute, as are all scientific definitions.\n \n Thirdly, personally: I self-define as 'human'. The authority here is my own - how tautological!\n Problem: What if I self-define as 'human' - but have no means by which to communicate this to others? cf pro-life.\n \n In all, I cannot absolutely prove the fact that I am human; it's a non-absolute term that is almost as easy to define as 'beauty' (especially considering terms like 'dehumanising'). Even if it were not, solipism is always lurking. However, I fit the current scientific definition for one.\n \n Relating that to Chuz's position... I'm going to have to explain my 'dictionary' criticism, aren't I? OK... first, though, I would say that (in terms of the life of an individual) the scientific community has yet to come up with a definition. So Chuz cannot show that a foetus is individually 'alive' - because he can't even define 'alive'. That was (at least partly) my point.\n \n With that said... Chuz's basis for 'a foetus is a human individual' lies, largely, on this definition: Child definition #4: 'a human fetus'. \n \n The fallacy he is committing here... I don't know the proper name for it, but I'd call it guilt by association. Chuz gives us the word 'child', and we automatically conjure a mental image of definition #1 - a baby with an individual personality, rights etc. He then points out that one of the definitions of 'child' is 'a human fetus'; and expects us to move those features of the child associated with our mental image - personality, etc - to the 'human fetus'. Ergo - a 'fetus' is a 'child' which is a 'person'.\n \n However, this isn't good reasoning. To show this, another definition - at the tips of your fingers. If I were to give you the word 'nail', you may well instantly think of fingernails. You get the mental associations associated with them (definition #2), and so on. I then point out that one definition of the word 'nail' is 'a slender, typically rod-shaped rigid piece of metal' (definition #1); and expect you to move those features associated with the mental image - growing on your fingers, etc - to the 'rod of iron'. Ergo - an 'iron rod' is a 'nail' which 'grows on the end of your fingers'.\n \n In short, Chuz fails to distinguish between 'child' (foetus) and 'child' (person) - just as I failed to distinguish between 'nail' (fingertips) and 'nail' (iron rod).\n \n If Chuz wants to show that a foetus is 'factually defined' as an alive individual, similar to a child, he needs to show a direct scientific definition linking those two things - not the 'guilt by association' reasoning he's been showing so far. Even then, it doesn't make it 'absolute' - as A_O said, there is a difference between what a thing is called and what it is. But it'd be a start.\n\n \n This is fine but remember you just asked someone the same thing and you basically state that you really can't prove this. Human is just a word that we give meaning to so proving you are a human is no more difficult than proving a fetus is. Furthermore, Chuz Life uses \"a human\" in a generally acceptable format. The dictionary is used so we can communicate and the dictionary has that definition in it. So I don't see how it matters what we call a human or not. It is only an excuse in my book. You can call me a frog for all I care but I am still entitled to rights endowed by my Creator.\n \n It comes down to your philosophy and belief system.",

You can call me a frog for all I care but I am still entitled to rights endowed by my Creator.\n \n It comes down to your philosophy and belief system. \nI fully realise what I am asking is not provable. To quote myself from above, \"Chuz cannot show that a foetus is individually 'alive' - because he can't even define 'alive'. That was (at least partly) my point.\"\n \n My argument with Chuz is not that a foetus is provably 'unindividual' or 'individual', but that it isn't provably so, either way. I'm trying to revert Chuz's (ab)use of the dictionary back towards null. The argument has been going on for a fairly long time - looking back at Chuz's first ever response to me should show you that.\n \n To clarify: My beef is Chuz's repeated insistence that '[the dictionary shows] it is a biological fact that a foetus is an alive human individual from conception' (If you want me to provide many, many links of Chuz wielding his 'fact', I can do so). All I've done is show that, using Chuz-logic and a dictionary, it is a biological 'fact' that your fingernails are made of iron rods. And all I am still asking is that he back up his claim of 'fact' - a task which I suspect we both agree is impossible.\n \n \nA \"no\" to what?\n \n You haven't specified.\n\n A no to 'got anything else?' - the question of mine which I quoted in my post. To rephrase it: \"so that's a 'no' to the question 'got any arguments to back up your 'fact' that I have yet to deal with?', then?\".\n \n You then provided another argument, making the whole thing moot. Time to deal with it!\n \n \n[definitions snip]\nYou present here an interestingly circular way of answering my question. You have the 'zygote/foetus/embryo' link which calls them all organisms, then the 'organism' link which calls an organism an 'individual' - nicely avoiding the fact that the definition of 'individual' cannot describe a zygote, for reasons I stated in my earlier post (notably dependence on the mother). So something, somewhere, must be fishy. Either with my argument (which you haven't actually addressed yet) or with your own. So, which one was it?\n \n I found it fairly odd that, considering your 'all readers should get their own definitions', you then chose to provide us with some. The oddness was compounded when I noticed that you had used dictionary.com for all your definitions in the thread (and pretty much in general) so far - but for the definitions of 'zygote/foetus/embryo' which calls them 'organisms' you switched to Planned Parenthood. What does dictionary.com have to say about the three?\n \n Zygote - many of the definitions don't mention 'organism' at all. The few that do call it 'The organism that develops from a zygote.'; much, I imagine, as you could call a frog 'my little tadpole'. This pretty much implies that whatever a zygote is, it ain't an organism.\n Embryo/foetus (lumped together as they are very similar) - for foetuses, 'organism' isn't mentioned at all. For embryos, where 'organism' is mentioned it is always in the context of 'before full development' - this isn't surprising, as we've both agreed that in some circumstances an embryo/foetus can have rights - in those cases where abortion is illegal.\n \n Now we know that - for zygotes especially - there is minimal definition as an 'organism', the chain is broken. Let's, then, look at some of your other provided definitions for 'organism'.\n \n An organism should be 'made up of organs/organelles'. A zygote, clearly, isn't. A foetus/embryo can be, but in early cases those organs (lungs, for example) do nothing.\n An organism's organs should be 'interdependent'. A zygote/embryo/foetus (unviable) is dependent on it's mother's organs for it's nutrient and oxygen supply, so it best fits in as part of the 'mother organism'.\n An organism should be 'independent'. This, as discussed previously, is not the case.\n \n To summarise, then - a zygote is not an organism. A foetus/embryo can be an organism in it's own right - but that development happens as a gradual process. Before that point, it's simply a part of the mother's body.",

My position, which I've remained consistent in, is that the mother will takes precedence over the rights of the fetus up till the 3rd trimester.\n \n My conclusions are based on the fact that no one should have the right to control a person's decisions about their own bodies and until a fetus reaches a certain point it exists at the sole discretion of its host.\n \n \n I guess you could boil it down to that.\n \n Again, I never said that it doesn't have any rights ...just that ONE person's right supersede the fetus' rights on every level.\n \n In a perfect world there would be no unwanted pregnancies, no abortions, no rapes, no starving children, no war, everyone would have a job and love it, people would always make the right choice on the first try...maybe you could talk to your god about that!!!\n\n \n Sleep happens,.... you have the last word tonight, CUNx",

   "Another opinion", 
   "Just to chime in, in any discussion about the Constitution, it is important to note the state of abortion law in the US at the time of our founding since the intention of the founders is reflected in the state of laws that existed at that time. Where abortion law is concerned, we inherited laws concerning abortion from English Common Law and didn't change those abortion laws for many decades into our individual nationhood. This is telling, since it shows that the founders did not consider early fetuses as people but as, essentially, part of the woman's body. However, there is enough arguement within common law about the rights of late term fetuses that there could be a case made there. The dividing line was \"quickening\" which essentially happens at around 18 weeks.\n \n Here is a summary of US abortion law history, directly from Roe vs Wade - where the SCOTUS justices added it to their summary since it formed part of their deliberation process. As a reminder, this summary was written in 1973 at the time of the Roe vs Wade decision, where there were very restrictive abortion laws in place, so any reference to laws \"currently\" in place would refer to those restrictive laws. From section VI of FindLaw | Cases and Codes (Note: The numbers intersperced into the text are reference numbers for supporting documentation. I did not delete them or in any other non-specified way edit the text. My only edits were to skip the sections, as noted, and to add the bolding, underlining and coloring of the text.):\n \nIt perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common-law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century.\n \n 1. Ancient attitudes.\n ...<skipped as less relevant for this thread<\n \n 2. The Hippocratic Oath. \n ...<skipped as less relevant for this thread<\n \n 3. The common law. It is undisputed that at common law, abortion performed before \"quickening\" - the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy 20 - was not an indictable offense. 21 The absence [410 U.S. 113, 133] of a common-law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. These disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became \"formed\" or recognizably human, or in terms of when a \"person\" came into being, that is, infused with a \"soul\" or \"animated.\" A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth. 22 This was \"mediate animation.\" Although [410 U.S. 113, 134] Christian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the precise time of formation or animation. There was agreement, however, that prior to this point the fetus was to be regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide. Due to continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of life, Bracton focused upon quickening as the critical point. The significance of quickening was echoed by later common-law scholars and found its way into the received common law in this country. \n Whether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed. Bracton, writing early in the 13th century, thought it homicide. 23 But the later and predominant view, following the great common-law scholars, has been that it was, at most, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited [410 U.S. 113, 135] passage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \"quick with childe\" is \"a great misprision, and no murder.\" 24 Blackstone followed, saying that while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), \"modern law\" took a less severe view. 25 A recent review of the common-law precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke and that even post-quickening abortion was never established as a common-law crime. 26 This is of some importance because while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law, 27 others followed Coke in stating that abortion [410 U.S. 113, 136] of a quick fetus was a \"misprision,\" a term they translated to mean \"misdemeanor.\" 28 That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was uncritical and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due probably to the paucity of common-law prosecutions for post-quickening abortion), makes it now appear doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus. \n \n 4. The English statutory law. England's first criminal abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 1803. \n ...<the rest of part 4 skipped due to less relevance to this thread<\n \n 5. The American law. In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the pre-existing English common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a woman \"quick with child.\" 29 The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860. 30 In 1828, New York enacted legislation 31 that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti-abortion statutes. First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter second-degree manslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it \"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose.\" By 1840, when Texas had received the common law, 32 only eight American States [410 U.S. 113, 139] had statutes dealing with abortion. 33 It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening but were lenient with it before quickening. Most punished attempts equally with completed abortions. While many statutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that provision soon disappeared and the typical law required that the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose. \n \n Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. 34 The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health. 35 Three States permitted abortions that were not \"unlawfully\" performed or that were not \"without lawful justification,\" leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts. 36 In [410 U.S. 113, 140] the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code, 230.3, 37 set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 205. \n \n It is thus apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity [410 U.S. 113, 141] to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy. \n\n So, at the time of our founding and deeply into the progress of our country, abortion laws were fairly lax. That cannot help but play a major role in any Constitutional interpretation.",

Any new definition of personhood could only come into play in US law, then, by a large enough vote to introduce a new personhood ammendment defining it as such. Given that attempts at such personhood ammendements have failed at the state level, this shows that there is very little chance of such an ammendment succeeding at the federal level - at least if it sticks to defining personhood starting from conception.",

Our main difference, and presumably the main difference between the different proponents of various Constitutional interpretations, is in the strength of an implied arguement and whether or not one only sticks with what it very explicitly written, not implied. Either way, if one accepts the premise that a right to privacy is implied, then current laws at the time of our founding would be a reflection of what was considered private.",
