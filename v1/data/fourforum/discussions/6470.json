   "\n \n \n This is my guess, the game needs to have a teamwork to be a sport.\n \n\n \n Teamwork is not entirley neccesarry. Look at wrestling or javelin, discuss, and individual running event, etc. Competition is a definite, there has to be some specific team or individual, of field of individuals, in which competition takes place and only one true winner emerges. And some sort of physical athletic exertion beyond normal means. Also, it would not be considered a sport if there were any type of judges, judging something like a routine. That basically means figure skating is not a sport, niether is ball room dancing. In these type of \"games\", one is more in direct competion with oneself and not directly with other competitors. No one has to react to a triple sow cow in the same manner as a running back juking to the left. anything with a routine, not a sport.\n \n I would not consider Golf a sport, no elevated physical athletic exertion\n Baseball = sport. Exertion plus competition\n Football = sport. Exertion plus competion\n Darts = game. No exertion\n \n The Stone\n Hunting = game. No athletic exertion\n bowling = game\n running events = sport\n walkathon = those people should just be shot anyways. Frickin' losers\n cheerleading with pretty girls - social event\n \n And I absolutely hate Umpires. Seriously, is blindness a prerequisite for the job?",

Now, if it were a matter of the rules, then the manager has the right to protest the game before the next pitch is thrown. So you know.\n\n \n \n Ya, it's kind of pointless to argue a call (unless you're a coach and want to pump your team up by getting ejected) but it should be ok to ask for a clarification.\n \n Example: \"was that a called strike or was it swinging\"\n \n I consider myself somewhat an expert of baseball rules, having read the rule book cover to cover a couple of times and read a few trivia books.\n \n A couple things that are weird:\n \n Many people talk about a pitch being on the black. Since the black is not part of the 18 inches of plate, it is a ball if it only crosses over the black.\n \n \n \n Here's something specifically to Bassman on the policy of what umpires should do. There is no one on base with only 2 umpires, so the field umpire is behind first base. The batter is a lefty. He checks his swing and the umpire at the plate calls it a ball. The catcher asks for an appeal to the first base umpire. I know that the rules say they can make the appeal, but I'm wondering about what the policy is for the first base umpire. Do they just say what they think happened (even if they don't see it perfectly clear) or must they see definate evidence that it was a swing (for example see the bat perpendicular to their line of sight)? I ask this because this happened to me, as strike 3. It was clear I didn't swing and the coach from the third base dougout shook hands and said \"sorry about blue\" shaking hands. We had the tying run on second, I was the leadoff hitter, and that was ball four. So instead of first and second with the number 2 batter up, we lost by a run.\n \n By the way that reminds me of a quote in the hall of fame, something like this:\n \n \"being an umpire is the only job, other than the presidency, that every American can do better\".\n \n \n On the topic of sports, I don't think it matters whether it's a sport or a game. Whether I'm playing a sport or a game, I'm getting the same benefit out of it. \"A rose by any other name stinks as much\".",
