   "For all the rhetoric about being friends of the common man, the worker, the poor, the democratic party is remarkably silent on the biggest enemy of these individuals, the Federal Reserve and its' inflationary policy.\n \n If the amount of money in circulation was kept stable, or better still, no new dollars produced, each year a dollar you earned would be worth more, and the people of each generation would be better off than the last.\n \n Over time, individuals would use their rising prosperity to work shorter hours, retire earlier, provide the best opportunities for their children, eat and live better, and have more enjoyable lives.\n \n Under a regime of inflation, the reverse is true. Each year, every dollar you earn is worth less. Every dollar you save is worth less. To compensate, you work longer hours, retire at an older age, eat worse, live worse, live in smaller and less convenient locations, provide less opportunities for your children, and in the end, impoverished and unable to work at 70, go cup in hand to social security to beg for money stolen from your grandchildren.\n \n The only real winners in this scam are the speculative investors who have access to easy credit because of it, who win big getting in early on speculative bubbles, make their millions, and contribute little of value to the consumer - giving us do-nothing dot-coms, and overpriced housing few really want, and fewer still can afford.\n \n The neocons have their excuse for going along with this scam, they truly don't care if the middle class is impoverished as long as their friends on wall street can make an easy buck out of it, but what about the democrats? Are they simply the same as the republicans with different rhetoric, or should we give them some kind of moral credit and put it down to ignorance of economics?\n \n Either way, all the social policies and half-assed schemes to help the poor mean nothing when a dollar they earn now is worth three cents by the time they retire.",

   "A few things come to mind here.\n \n First, neither party is for the common man. If you elect a buch of wealthy people to run your country, you end up with a country run to the benifit of wealthy people. There is no plot or scheme there, just common sense. The rich, old money pricks we have in congress think like rich, old money pricks. They make their decisions based on those thought processes.\n \n Second, the elite in this nation have done a damn fine job of convincing people that inflation is necessary for prosperity and that deflation is to be avoided at all costs. The problem with this is that it is wholly at odds with the theory of capitalism. \n \n Under a capitalist system, producers are supposed to be hard at work providing us the highest quality goods at the lowest possible price (the whole \"competition\" thing). They are supposed to be constantly working, striving, and innovating to find ways to provide us with ever cheaper goods in order to gain an advantage over their competion. Essentially, captialism is a system where price deflation is not only (in some circumstances) healthy, but where it is a desirable economic result.",
