   "Wednesday, June 13, 2007\n Bob Barr on DADT\n \n Last week at the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, several of the candidates (including Dr. Ron Paul) were asked their opinions on the military's policy of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" which effectively prohibits openly gay or lesbian Americans from serving their country in uniform.\n \n All ten of the candidates indicated their general support for the policy, though some were more vocal than others.\n \n Now former Georgia Congressman Bob Barr, a Republican best known for his authorship of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which prohibits federal recognition of same-sex relationships (even legal marriages in states like Massachusetts or civil unions in states like Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont), has come out swinging against DADT.\n \n In an article titled \"Don't Ask, Who Cares\" in today's Wall Street Journal (available on line -- unfortunately, only to subscribers), Barr says:\n \n As a conservative Republican member of Congress from 1995 to 2003, I was hardly a card-carrying member of the gay-rights lobby. I opposed then, and continue to oppose, same-sex marriage, or the designation of gays as a constitutionally protected minority class. Service in the armed forces is another matter. The bottom line here is that, with nearly a decade and a half of the hybrid \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy to guide us, I have become deeply impressed with the growing weight of credible military opinion which concludes that allowing gays to serve openly in the military does not pose insurmountable problems for the good order and discipline of the services.\n \n Congressman Barr emphasizes the conservative nature of his opinion:\n \n The fact is, equal treatment of gay and lesbian service members is about as conservative a position as one cares to articulate.\n \n Why? First, true conservative political philosophy respects the principles of individual freedom and personal privacy, particularly when it comes to what people do in private. The invasive investigations required to discharge a service member are an unconscionable intrusion into the private lives of American citizens. Worse, while supporters of don't ask, don't tell claim the policy only regulates behavior and not identity, the distinction is disingenuous. A service member could be discharged for being overheard remarking that, \"I can stay later today since my partner will be taking the dog for a walk.\"\n \n Second, and on a more practical level, the ban on gays openly serving in our armed forces is hurting a military that is stretched thin, putting further strain on an institution conservatives claim to love. The U.S. has fired over 11,000 people under the current policy, and in the process has lost over 1,000 service members with \"mission-critical skills,\" including 58 Arabic linguists.\n \n Later in the article, Barr points to a study led by former Secretary of Defense William Cohen (also a former Republican Senator) that concluded that DADT has cost American taxpayers upwards of $360 million.\n \n Bob Barr's piece is quite persuasive, yet it fails to mention that the armed forces of America's allies -- including Israel and Great Britain -- have integrated their ranks with openly gay and lesbian soldiers and sailors without an adverse effect on performance or morale. He does note that the majority of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan say they would be comfortable serving with openly gay comrades -- no doubt because most of them have already done so, despite the failed Clinton-era policy.",

   "Great article. Hits the nail on the head.\n I can't help but think that the military's policy on gays, which excludes all gay service regardless of whether they \"tell\", is one of the few remaining distinctive examples of pure prejudice towards gays.\n \n Even the excuse of \"morale\" involves a propagandic twisted admission of the prejudice. The \"morale\" suffers, because some anti-gay people in the unit can't handle working alongside gay people, and so the gay person must leave.\n \n Can you imagine if we tried to employ that for any other issue like race (whoops. already been done), religion, gender, or national heritage?\n \n The homosexual exclusion policy has no real justification. It has obfuscation which pretends that it doesn't exist, but gays who are kicked out because somebody found an online profile or somebody else outed them prove this to be false. \n It has a skewed weighting whereby people can't handle the presence of others are favored by having the object of their prejudice removed. (I thought the military had something called \"discipline\".)\n It has double-standards and pretense, but nothing of substance to back it up.\n \n And it's a long-time overdue for being removed.",

   "I agree that DADT is still marginalizing for gays, and that it's bad policy. And like Bob Barr, I believe that because I am conservative. But I also think it's important to remember that there are two sides to the coin--it's there to not only keep the military from having to deal with gays (which is not good since they should be open to it), but it's also there as a policy to help keep gays from having to deal with backlash if someone finds out they are gay (in theory, of course). The real issue here is that this shouldn't be a problem in the first place. The military and people in the chain of command shouldn't be concerning themselves with the personal lives of people in this regard. If the military were doing what they should be doing rather than worrying about such matters, DADT wouldn't be necessary in the first place.\n \n But if DADT were just suddenly removed with nothing put in place to protect gays, it would probably make things worse for them. The military could then legally discharge people even under the slightest suspicion, even if they haven't said a word about it.

   "Government reports on military service by gays -- these are the DOD ones:\n \n I. Crittenden (1957)\n A Navy study, popularly referred to as the Crittenden Report, concluded as early as \"1957 that homosexual service members did not pose a greater security risk than heterosexual personnel.\" The Secretary of the Navy appointed a board to evaluate the Navy's policies and procedures governing homosexual service members. No major changes were recommended, in part because of the military's reluctance to \"liberalize standards ahead of the civilian climate.\" \n \n The findings did acknowledge that many more homosexuals were likely serving in the Armed Forces than the small number that had been involuntarily discharged. The report noted that \"there have been many known instances of individuals who have served honorably and well, despite being exclusively homosexual.\"\n \n The board also found no factual data to support the premise that homosexual service members \"necessarily\" posed a security risk. Research indicated that factors unrelated to sexual orientation constituted security risks and that the type of sexual activity mattered less than the \"matter of indiscretion.\" \"According to the report, intelligence officers sometimes considered heterosexual relations more of a security threat than homosexual conduct.\"\n II. PERSEREC (1988-89)\n Thirty years after the Crittenden Report was completed, the Defense Department commissioned a study on conditions related to trust violations, including drug abuse, credit history, and homosexuality. The Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC) prepared two reports which examined whether gay, lesbian and bisexual service members posed security risks or were otherwise unsuitable for service. \"The first report, released in December 1988, confirmed the Crittenden findings and found no data to support the ban on gays in the military.\" The results were quickly swept aside in a wave of criticism from the Pentagon. In a memo to PERSEREC's director, then-Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Craig Alderman, Jr. accused the center of exceeding its authority and called the research flawed. PERSEREC issued a second report in January 1999, which further challenged the rationale that homosexuals were unsuitable for service.\n \n [...]\n \n PERSEREC's second study looked for connections between sexual orientation and suitability of service by comparing data on discharges for homosexuality and unsuitability. \"According to the findings, gay service members fared better than their heterosexual counterparts in most areas of adjustment, including school behavior and cognitive ability.\" The report noted: \"These results appear to be in conflict with conceptions of homosexuals as unstable, maladjusted persons.\" In the aftermath of the first report's release, the second report was never submitted to the Pentagon.\n III. RAND (1993)\n In 1993, then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned a study by RAND's National Defense Research Institute in conjunction with a presidential memorandum calling for an end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the military. President Clinton's memo called for a policy that was \"practical,\" \"realistic,\" and \"consistent with high standards of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion.\" The resulting RAND report identified a single policy option that could meet President Clinton's guidelines - a policy based on clear standards of conduct equally applied to all military personnel.\n \n The report proposed a 'Standard of Professional Conduct' as a workable replacement for the ban on gays serving in the military. Such a standard would address unfair discrimination and privacy concerns by prohibiting inappropriate conduct from any service member. RAND's recommended single standard of conduct did not require a significant overhaul of then-existing regulations, the report notes. However, the researchers did recommend that private, sexual activity between consenting adults be decriminalized.\n \n Researchers at RAND took a multi-dimensional approach to their task. First, they studied \"analogous institutions and experiences.\" Analogous institutions included foreign militaries and domestic fire and police departments that prohibited anti-gay discrimination. The history of racial integration in the U.S. military was examined as an analogous experience. \"Second, they considered public opinion both within and without the Armed Forces. Both the foreign militaries and the local fire and police agencies reported few problems caused by the presence of openly-gay members. The report noted that leaders from the foreign militaries surveyed did not believe that their organizational effectiveness had been compromised by their policies.\" Despite opposition, the report concluded that strong leadership and a clear commitment permitted the successful racial integration of the United States military in the 1940s. Furthermore, \"the researchers found that public opinion in the early 1990s was more supportive of allowing gays and lesbians to serve than public opinion favorable to racial integration in the 1940s.\"\n The website provides links to PDF versions of the original reports.\n \n Even the DOD's own experts recommend against discrimination, and can find no sound basis for precluding openly gay men and women from service. Every other military in NATO but Turkey's has successfully banned discrimination, but the military mentality in the United States remains closer to that of a Muslim state than a modern, Western nation.\n \n If those hostile to gay servicemembers can find nothing unconstitutional in unjustifiable discrimination, perhaps they might consider the cost in dollars and lost expertise.",

   "Regarding the question of constitutionality of banning gays from the military I'll make the following argument.\n \n It is constitutional. I'll use Amendments 9 which reads \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" I'll argue that it is a right to serve in the army unless you are physically unable to. Because Homosexuality is not a disease, and further no one has posted any direct evidence on how, unlike say a sight disorder, it would preclude an individual from serving, I see no reason not to allow it.\n \n Reading the Constitution closely, there are actually a lot of rights loopholes. As it stands I do not believe the Constitution has an equal rights for women in it, yet we treat it as if we do for the goals and aims of the country and because it makes the most amount of sense. I would submit to you that all minorities should be treated with the same equality. This is not to say they get preferential treatment, only that they cannot be discriminated against. Now, since homosexuality is not a crime, and there are no submitted reasons to state how it hurts society, I submit that my argument is the stronger.",

We had racial segregation laws for the comfort of white people. When those laws were eliminated, white people had to get over their discomfort or live with the discomfort. The same is true, I think, of heterosexuals sharing showers with gay people. They just have to get over their discomfort or live with it, because allowing gay people to serve in the military benefits the military and by extension the entire society. The military needs the positive contributions of gay people. And people in the military already know how to live with discomfort. They do it all the time. \n \n You might then argue that people should get over their discomfort about men and women showering together. But in fact there is no immediate reason for the military to change the current arrangements of separate showers for men and women. Women do serve in the military, and showers have not been a bar to the military benefitting from women's service. People have argued that showers are a bar to the military benefitting from gay people's service. \n \n To me, allowing gay people to serve openly and honestly in the military will do a great service for the country, by enabling many talented, intelligent, committed, patriotic people to serve in our armed forces.",

   "Personally, I think that answer is a convenient cop out. What the heck are people worried about, anyway? The reason they don't shower together is simple--it's because of decency standards and modesty. Most women don't want men being able to see them with no clothes on. For that matter, a lot of men feel the same way about women seeing them. It has nothing to do with anyone \"showing enough responsibility\" to do it.\n \n I think Steeeeve's point (or whoever brought that up) was to note that there is a double standard there. We allow women the latitude of not letting men who are attracted to them see them with nothing on, and we allow men the latitude of not letting women see them with nothing on--and that is the default. It's the same sort of reasoning we have separate men's and women's restrooms. But if a man says 'I don't want another MAN to be able to see me with nothing on,' then that's bad to say for some reason. Then we've crossed some line or something. That's a double standard.\n\n \n So, should they just have seperate showers for each man and each woman, because one person might not want another man to see them with nothing on (which would still occur if gays were banned from serving)? I think you should give a little more credit, both to soldiers, and to homosexuals. :xbanghead \n \n Perhaps you could show us where, in the history of the Army, that Gays have caused such problems as you seem to be implying (in the showers, etc.). :xbanghead \n \n I also personally do not see any problem with having unisex showers in the army - these are professionals, and even if someone steps out of line, they can be discharged, now can't they?\n \n I personally think that DADT should be repealed, and openly gay servicemen/women should be allowed into the army.",

   "If she is elected, it will be interesting if she will indeed undo her husband's work like that.\n\n I don't see why not. DADT was not really Clinton's choice in the first place.\n Like I mentioned earlier, there exists a military homosexual exclusion law which forbids ALL gay military service. It was passed in 1993, after Clinton took office, as a response to Clinton's talk of allowing gays in the military.\n It was passed by enough of congress to make it veto-proof.\n \n In other words, Congress basically sunk Clinton's stated plan of allowing gay military service out of the gate. Not much Clinton could do to just allow gays to serve. It was essentially a Clinton defeat on one of his first political moves.\n \n In 1993, a majority of the public still wanted gays in the military. Not many people know of Congress's move to concrete the gay exclusion. I think it didn't get much press because Congress was doing something in direct opposition to the American public's wishes. Clinton ran on a platform of allowing gays in the military. I never heard of any congressional platform on tanking that ideal.\n \n Clinton did the only thing left available to him. He told the military to back off. Quit focusing so much time and money on the issue of gays in the military. Stop asking each and every incoming recruit \"the\" question.\n It was the only compromise Clinton had available, IMO.\n \n And as I stated, it wasn't his choice either...\n \n And to put it more exactly, Hillary wouldn't be revoking \"DADT\". \"DADT\" is a directive by Clinton to not focus on the gays as much. But DADT IS NOT the rule that kicks gays out of the military.\n If Hillary let gays in the military, it would be her fighting against the legislation which forbids them in the military. The legislation passed by Congress. She'll be in a political battle, exposing the harm the policy has done to our nation and how much $$$$ it costs, to get Congress to pass legislation revoking their 1993 law, so she can sign it and get the homosexual exclusion policy off the books.",

   "Its a great argument if it is a rebuttal of a previous claim. Look, person 1 says (and I know it wasn't you) \"it is unconstitutional\"...person 2 says \"no it isn't because x,y,z\"...and then you come along and say \"saying its not unconstitutional is a bad argument for it\".\n It never was an argument for it!\n\n \"rebuttal of a previous claim\"?\n As you pointed out, I never made the previous claim.\n \n And no, it's not a \"rebuttal of a previous claim\". It's addressing the fact that while the argument \"it's not unconstitutional\" is a defense of the gay exclusion policy, it is not a justification for it.\n \n Just because something is not unconstitutional doesn't mean we should do it. And when there are plenty of good reasons NOT to do it, \"unconstitutional\" doesn't mean anything.\n \n It may not be unconstitutional to mandate that people have to cover their mouth when they yawn. But it's also a lame law that shouldn't be on the books in the first place.\n \"unconstitutional\" is not the only argument there is against ideas for law, or existing law.\n \n \n \nYou brought up the argument of no one propositioning in the shower.\n\n Sigh. And IN we start with the twisting of words to avoid what was REALLY said ...\n What I said was the following:An absurd and outright falsehood that it (i.e. DADT places limits on appropriate behaviour in a unit, and if they cross them, too bad, out they go) is a \"perfect description of DADT\".\n Can you show me ANYBODY who was kicked out under DADT for \"flaunting\" their sexuality all over the place or propositioning straights in the showers?\n Because I can show you examples of gays who were kicked out because an anonymous call to the base told them they were gay.\n I can show you gays who were kicked out because they had an online profile which stated they were gay.\n This #### about gays being kicked out because of indecent sexual behavior? It's an absurd lie.\n The argument was that DADT goes GROSSLY BEYOND what Mutz was claiming DADT did. It's like saying that a law forbids people from driving too fast. But what the law ACTUALLY STATES is that people are not allowed to drive period.\n \n If you want a law that forbids gays from acting improperly in the showers, I will add my approval as long as it is equitable across \"gay / straight\" lines and also addresses straights who make improper advances.\n \n THAT is what I ACTUALLY said.\n But we might as well get on to what you're trying to spin my words into... emoticon_ic \n \n \n \nLikewise would it happen that a male would proposition a female in a shower?\n\n ????\n Considering DADT doesn't affect any male propositioning a female in the shower, I am again not sure as to the relevance.\n \n \n \nIf that is not the real argument for keeping them separate then please give me one and we can see if that applies equally to the situation of homosexuals and straights in the same showers.\n\n 1) No. It's not my real argument at all.\n You're twisting the hell out of the real argument, avoiding my real point, which is reminding me oh so clearly of the way things were when I left...\n 2) I quite frankly don't care what the \"real argument is for keeping them separate\".\n Not my concern.\n We're talking about DADT.\n \n \n \nYou answer by stating that heterosexuals just aren't responsible enough. An odd claim from someone like you. Seems your response is an elitist view on the situation if you think homosexuals are more responsible in the shower with members of the attracted sex than heterosexuals. Imagine someone stating the opposite...you'd get all up in arms.\n\n Quite frankly, because gays have been showering with the same gender for a LONG time. We typically DO behave ourselves. I know I did when I was in the military.\n So if somebody stated the opposite, it would get back to my ORIGINAL post and what I ORIGINALLY said (imagine that!) and I would challenge them to SHOW ME WHERE a gay person had supposedly not behaved themselves in the shower.\n \n And on the heterosexual side of things? I can show you NUMEROUS examples of heterosexual MILITARY impropriety. Even from personal experience.\n Like I said earlier (must be annoying for you to come back to what I REALLY said earlier), what DADT ACTUALLy kicks out is not typically gays \"misbehaving\" in a way that involves improper sexual advances towards other straight military men.\n \n And just for the record, this whole \"showering together\" argument is lame getting out of the gates.\n How many times do military men ACTUALLY have to shower together?\n I worked on a sub, and we showered separately.\n I think civilians have more gyms with open areas where people are showering in full sight of other men than the military has situations where showers are like that.\n \n \n \nGays, however, have been showering with straight men in the military (for years under DADT), and all o' them uncontrollable animal instincts to hump everything in sight when they see a nekkid man-arse doesn't seem to have emerged, despite the fearmongering of right-wingers. \n\n :)\n I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop that I have seen DOZENS of times before.\n The pretense that DADT is all that is keeping those damn horny gays in check, and when DADT is revoked, all those gays are going to start trying to hump everything in sight...",

Because it is the Supreme Court that ultimately determines what the law is, to paraphrase John Marshall. You can argue in theory that changing the Court should not change the law, but it has happened throughout our history. Courts do not lightly or frequently dismiss or overturn precedent, but they do it. \n \n And the reality is that justices are humans after all, and they do rule on the basis of how they regard the world, and national priorities, and morality. The ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick was based to a large degree on how the justices perceived morality at the time. 17 years later, the new justices decided that this understanding by the earlier court had been wrong. \n \n We humans are imperfect, and our courts do not operate simply by adherence to a theory, nice as the theory may sound. They live in the world as they understand it, and they bring their human understandings to their roles as justices. Earl Warren was known to ask repeatedly of the Court's rulings, \"Is it fair?\" He thought continually of the impact of the Court's rulings on real people.\n \n As for usurpation, people have railed about usurpation with courts labeled liberal, and people have railed about usurpation about courts labeled conservative. One person's usurpation is another person's correct reading of the constitution. I am not suggesting that I agree with anything and everything the Supreme Court has ruled.

   "Why avoid the question still? My question was why bar women and men from showering with each other? The only \"answer\" that has been stated is that straight men are irresponsible...a claim that seems odd to me.\n\n \n Odd? How so? How many cases of heterosexual male rape are there of women every year, in or outside the military? Now, then, how many cases are there of homosexual male rape of straight males in comparison? I don't know the answer to either question, but I'll bet the issue of homosexual male rape of straight males is virtually non-existent, outside prisons, and even then, most of the rapists are sexually frustrated straight men.\n \n There's a rational basis to separate males from females to some extent because males tend to be larger, stronger, and more violent and aggressive. But gay males on average are no larger, stronger, or more violent and aggressive than straight males. (Paradoxically the twits who argue that straight men should be afraid of gay men in the showers are often the first to push the contradictory stereotype that gay men are feminised sissies! emoticon_wow ) Further, they have been showering with straight males ever since the military discovered showers, with no increased incidence of male-on-male rape that I know about.\n \n Now, maybe you have some idea of where to look for relevant rape statistics, but on the face of it, while I see reason to segregate men and women in potentially sexual situations, I don't see the same reasons, either historically or rationally, for segregating gay and straight males. \n \n As for privacy, troops surrender privacy rights in the military. You can't know what is going on in anyone's head, and in any case, the implication that most straight males go about in perpetual fear their bodies are attractive to all gay men is baffling. Sorry, but most straight males aren't all that attractive. Their butts are usually safe even from casual glances!",

That's slightly different from declaring it unconstitutional.\n \n My own view is that the current Supreme Court would certainly not find the ban unconstitutional, because of the leeway that the courts have given the military.

The courts are as sensitive to political pressures as any other branch of government and do not wish to be painted as weakening the military. If, however, some other branch of government were to issue a similar order, I think its constitutional validity would be very much in question, even with current courts.\n \n Many in the military do not agree with the allegations made in support of DADT; neither do the experts charged with investigating the issue; neither do the armies that have already abolished discrimination.

   "On the question of the constitutionality of DADT, this touches on the question of what consitutional rights people in the military have and what rights they give up when they enlist. DADT involves the right of free speech, because the policy requires that gay military personnel not tell anyone their sexual orientation. This whole area of free speech rights of military personnel is a contentious one, and court rulings in this area have been mixed. \n \n It will be interesting to see what happens in the case of Lieutenant Ehren Watada, whose court martial is scheduled for next month. It's unclear if the court martial will even happen, because his lawyers are arguing that the court martial would be double jeopardy. (A previous court martial ended in a mistrial.) If Watada does face a court martial, the question of free speech rights will be central. Besides refusing to deploy to Iraq, Watada made speeches expressing his view that the war in Iraq is illegal. He has been charged with \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\" for his speeches and statements about the war.

The legislature, as elected officials, are charged with the task of dealing with the impact on human beings when they craft the law. Now there are cases where societal impact and constitutionality overlap; anti-segregation is one such example. But if the supreme court rules based on constitutionality then that should be covered. That's why so many times, amendments have been the precedent in making sure civil rights are granted (though not in every case). If amendments are in place granting the rights people are entitled to, then SCOTUS doesn't have to resort to the 'impact-on-humans' litmus test as much ... the constitution will have that covered. And IMO that's the correct way for the system to work.\n \n There is a constant tension going on there between constitutionality as the litmus test and societal-impact as the litmus test.

Earl Warren was known to ask repeatedly of the Court's rulings, \"Is it fair?\" He thought continually of the impact of the Court's rulings on real people.\n\n \n Yes, Earl Warren would ask, \"Is it fair?\" But that is not the same as asking, \"Is it Constitutional.\" The ultimate, and only, question the Court is charged with answering is the latter question.\n \n \nAs for usurpation, people have railed about usurpation with courts labeled liberal, and people have railed about usurpation about courts labeled conservative. One person's usurpation is another person's correct reading of the constitution. I am not suggesting that I agree with anything and everything the Supreme Court has ruled. There have been some notoriously bad rulings. What I am suggesting is that there has never been a Supreme Court that couldn't be accused of usurpation by someone.\n\n \n Yes, it is entirely possible for liberal courts and conservative courts to usurp their power.

It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.\n \n There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.\nhttp://www.constitution.org/fed/federa78.htm ",

The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\n\n \n \nthere is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n \n You should read it sometime...",

   "If equal protection means what you think it means then what is the reasoning behind the 19th amendment?\n\n \n In the 1870s, a woman brought a suit in which she alleged that in being denied the right to vote, she was being deprived of a right guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court agreed with the woman that she was a citizen, but they ruled that the U.S. constitution did not protect the right to vote. They ruled that voting rights were up to the states. To win the vote, women either had to change the laws in each of the states or get a constitutional amendment ratified to prohibit states from denying the right to vote on the basis of sex. They sought to do both, working state by state and also pushing for what came to be called the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. \n \n This was also the reason for the earlier ratification of the 15th amendment. Although some at the time saw the right to vote as a right that ought to be protected by the 14th amendment, the states had historically been the ones to determine who had the right to vote. Therefore, Congress passed and the states ratified the 15th amendment, which prohibited states from denying the right to vote on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. \n \n In more recent decades, the Supreme Court has moved in the direction of ruling that voting is a fundamental right protected by the 14th amendment. But for most of U.S. history the Supreme Court did not regard voting as a fundamental right protected by the U.S. constitution. Who got to vote was left up to the states.",

   "I can't take credit...Justice Scalia spoke about that in speech I heard awhile back and I have been pondering it ever since. Turns out he spoke the truth. The chances of us getting amendment this day in age are pretty small and it already was difficult. By the justices deciding certain things are in the constitution they have mostly taken it out of the legislative branch...which is the easiest way to change the law...and left it to only be changes by 9 people. That is certainly not \"flexible\" by any means.\n\n \n When you speak of justices deciding \"certain things are in the constitution,\" you might cite as an example the decision in Bush v. Gore, which was such a creative and unique interpretation of the 14th amendment, the majority declared that the decision could not stand as a precedent for any other decision! And how did Scalia rule on that one? Gee....he ruled for the creative and unique interpretation of the 14th amendment. \n \n My argument to you is that people have always regarded the rulings of justices as \"making law\" and \"usurping the role of the legislature,\" because there is no way to make rulings without angering someone. There have been justices on the right, including Scalia, and justices on the left and justices in between who have made rulings that people have charged are inventing the law rather than interpreting it. It could not be otherwise. Important clauses in the constitution are vague, and in interpreting the meaning of the constitution, justices have to decide on a meaning that is often unclear. The 14th amendment, for example, is both broad and vague. The establishment clause of the first amendment is not clear in its meaning. You may argue that the meaning of various clauses is perfectly clear....to YOU. But others will disagree with you about the meaning as you see it. People see through different eyes.",

They intentionally left the specific meaning of the amendment to be determined by people in the future, which would mean, in effect, the Supreme Court. The framers of the 14th amendment also deliberately used broad language, to cover not only the freed slaves, but everyone. They anticipated that other people in the future would require the protections of this amendment.

   "Due process is a vague term? I figured you would go with something like \"cruel and unusual punishment\" but due process? That term is blatantly obvious: Due process is the normal process a government grants you whether it be trial, vote, or what have you. Due process is merely a procedural guarantee. It meant this then and it should mean that today. \n\n \n Well, yes, but it doesn't guarantee the procedure! Presumably the framers had some idea of what \"due process\" was in their day, but is that the same idea we have today? Not necessarily. And I agree that \"cruel and unusual punishment\" is something that is very sensitive to cultural context. For example, in the culture of the Bush administration, torture doesn't count.\n \n \nAs for \"unenumerated rights\"...that isn't in the constitution. If you mean \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,\" then that is even more clear. Enumeration just means \"list\". \n\n \n Oh c'mon, stop picking at nits. If the Constitution says there are \"rights\" that aren't \"enumerated\" in it, that's pretty deliberately vague. What \"rights\" are they, and how can we determine what they are? The writers left that for future generations.\n \n \nHaving judges \"change\" the constitution seems to make it more rigid instead of flexible. \n\n \n They aren't changing it. They are applying it to real people alive in their day, who have needs, understandings and expectations different from people alive when it was written. If society today decides that gay human beings are equal to straight ones, then constitutional guarantees of equal protections MUST apply. They can only not apply if judges and legislators assume that gay people aren't equal human beings, which is the current condition, as it used to be with slaves and women. \n \n I beg to differ with that assessment.\n \n \nSo if the writers knew what they were doing and had a meaning then do you propose that they also said \"we mean this when we write but no one is bound by the meaning we write\". That seems rather silly.\n\n \n Well, if we followed the meaning of the founders all that faithfully, we would still have slaves and women would still not be allowed to vote. After all, they could have specified that \"we the people\" included slaves and women, but they did not. They assumed the standards of their day, which are not the standards of ours. And hopefully the standards of tomorrow will be more inclusive still.\n \n \nI just don't understand how you can argue words have no meaning.\n\n \n Since I do not argue that, you are forgiven for not understanding it.\n \n \nIf equal protection means what you think it means then what is the reasoning behind the 19th amendment?\n\n \n It had to be spelled out for patriarchs.

The history of the idea of substantive due process is a bit complicated, but I encourage you to read about it.\n\n \n Have read about it. It basically came out of no where and started with Dred Scott. How you get a substantive component out of that is beyond me and as far as I can tell it was just made up.\n \n Furthermore, the idea of \"substantive due process\" has evolved over the years to what it is today. It started out with only \"fundamental rights\" being protected by super duper due process (ie substantive due process) but then that wasn't enough to get abortion and sodomy so they pretty much took out that rule and now it means you have to convince the court its a good idea or the law is unconstitutional.\n \n So to say its a \"bit complicated\" is an understatement.

   "In the 1870s, a woman brought a suit in which she alleged that in being denied the right to vote, she was being deprived of a right guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court agreed with the woman that she was a citizen, but they ruled that the U.S. constitution did not protect the right to vote. They ruled that voting rights were up to the states. To win the vote, women either had to change the laws in each of the states or get a constitutional amendment ratified to prohibit states from denying the right to vote on the basis of sex. They sought to do both, working state by state and also pushing for what came to be called the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\n \n This was also the reason for the earlier ratification of the 15th amendment. Although some at the time saw the right to vote as a right that ought to be protected by the 14th amendment, the states had historically been the ones to determine who had the right to vote. Therefore, Congress passed and the states ratified the 15th amendment, which prohibited states from denying the right to vote on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. \n \n In more recent decades, the Supreme Court has moved in the direction of ruling that voting is a fundamental right protected by the 14th amendment. But for most of U.S. history the Supreme Court did not regard voting as a fundamental right protected by the U.S. constitution. Who got to vote was left up to the states.\nExactly, so we evolved a \"right to vote\" in the constitution...out of no where. How is this not confusing to you?",

It actually is quite easy to see this. One need only look at the fact that the phrase is a contradiction in terms. For a institution that supposedly relies on reason, substantive due process is more properly understood as a joke. The interesting thing is that both liberals and conservatives (and I use these terms strictly in their legal meaning) both agree that the decision in Lochner v. New York was wrong. This case used the doctrine of substantive due process to strike down a law which limited the number of hours per week that one could work in a bakery. This use of substantive due process is universally lambasted.\n \n But, fast-forward a mere 70 years later, and the use of substantive due process employed in Roe v. Wade is universally celebrated by liberals, whereas most conservatives disagree with this decision as well. The interesting thing is this: how can one universally disagree with substantive due process in one case, while universally celebrating its use in another case? The only answer to that is that one is not looking for the law to win, but for their own personal values to win. The standard is what they personally want, rather than what the law requires. But this is not the basis of judicial decision making established by the Constitution. And that is not my subjective opinion; it an objective observation made from the document itself.\n \n \nI for one hope that we're entering a time when the court swings back toward the center, away from so much substative due process.\n\n \n Well, I for one hope that we enter a time when the court moves toward the only legitimate basis of decision making. And on such a basis, the indicator is not how much substantive due process is used, but rather whether it is ever used. It is not legitimate, and any decision that relies on it is de facto incorrectly decided.",

I realize what people mean by it when they say it but it isn't in any dictionary I am aware of. That fact is irrelevant though. What is relevant is what the amendment says and it doesn't talk about protecting rights not listed in the constitution other than to say you can't construe the constitution to deny them. What they are is irrelevant so being vague or not doesn't matter.\n \n \nActually, they did decide Bowers had been incorrectly decided. The Constitution still protects the same way it did, it's just that the previous court got it wrong.\nWell it didn't reverse the idea that homosexual sodomy is not a \"fundamental right\" which was the idea I was getting at.\n \n \nThey were still wrong. They had to write the amendment because misogynists wouldn't accept that women were full citizens any other way.\n \nHow can you possibly say they were wrong when your standard of what the constitution means is based on the judges that made that decision?\n \n \nI don't think you understand the concept of monarchy. It certainly isn't the Supreme Court. They don't make law. They prevent the legislature from acting unconstitutionally. Of course, being human, they will make the occasional mistake, but it's probably better they stop the politicians occasionally than have them do whatever the hell it is they please the way you want them to.\nYet having them decide which laws are good and which laws are bad based upon nothing more than what they feel is right seems to be more of a threat to democracy than elected politicians. Not to mention it was the system set up.\n \n \nBecause it stops majorities who think the way you do from overriding the rights of minorities by legislative fiat. I can understand why you'd be upset with that, but I think it's a good thing. Imagine what would happen to you if you were in a minority with your rights on the slab. I'll bet you'd be grateful to a Constitution then!\nWho are you to say I'm not a minority? A little pre-judging there...maybe because of the way I type? \n \n Your suspicious words aside, if you feel that an all-power judge will always be a check on the legislature then you are dead wrong. There is no check for them to take away rights or limit minorities. I find an unelected body more of a threat to minorities than an elected body. \n \n Still you result based though. Instead of going with what the proper procedure is you automatically go for what the best result would be. If that is the case we really shouldn't have a constitution but just have a few folks who make decisions about what should be best for this country....after all, the document is outdated, right!? :xbanghead",

Again, I would simply contest your assertion that this transformation has happened for over 200 years.\n \n As an aside, the manifest problem with stare decisis is that it certainly can be abused. Like, for instance, when the Suprme Court uses stare decisis to justify the holding in Roe v. Wade, but then in Lawrence v. Texas completely ignores stare decisis.

That is a fairly recent phenomenon, as has been demonstrated by Jonathan O'Neill in his work Originalism in American Law and Politics: A Constitutional History. What courts have always done, until fairly recently, is to assert that some interpretation of the Constitution gets us to the original meaning of the document. That has shifted, and now the role of courts is no longer viewed as adopting methods to get us to the original meaning.\n \n In short, throughout most of our Constitutional history the goal of the courts have been to get us to the original meaning of the Constitution. There of course were different interpretations throughout our history. But the disagreement was whether the court decision arrived at the original meaning. Now, however, that has changed. Now disagreement does not take place on the basis of how close the decision is to the original meaning. Original meaning is no longer the end (or purpose) of Constitutional interpretation. And this is a fairly recent phenomenon in our history.\n \n On another note, it's hard to argue with someone who does not believe there is such a thing as a correct answer to legal questions. But I doubt you are able to disagree with any court decision on such a theory. This would include the decisions in Dred Scott, Lochner, Plessy, and ironically, Bowers.",

This distinction is important, because the Court did not assert that women were not citizens, in contrast to the earlier and infamous Dred Scott decision, in which Justice Taney asserted that black people were not and could never be citizens under the constitution. The Court did not assert that constitutional protections did not apply to women. The issue before them was whether the constitution guaranteed the right to vote, and the Court ruled that it did not.",

   "On another note, it's hard to argue with someone who does not believe there is such a thing as a correct answer to legal questions. But I doubt you are able to disagree with any court decision on such a theory. This would include the decisions in Dred Scott, Lochner, Plessy, and ironically, Bowers.\n\n \n I did not think I was arguing. I thought I was analyzing. Were you trying to argue with me?\n \n You and I obviously see the issues raised in constitutional questions very differently. I do not believe that the Supreme Court should adhere to a rigid standard of trying to discern the specific original intent of the framers. I think that the Supreme Court has to have evolving standards to meet changing social conditions. I think the Supreme Court must take into account the impact of its rulings on real people. I personally do not want the Supreme Court to operate solely in the realm of legal theory, shorn of human considerations. To be blunt, the framers are all dead. The people affected by rulings today are live human beings. The impact of rulings on live human beings matters more than the thinking of the framers, in my view. \n \n Does that mean we toss out the window what the framers sought to create? No. The framers clearly, through the Bill of Rights, sought to protect human liberty. They intentionally did NOT specifically enumerate all of the rights that they thought should be protected, because they did not want to limit the protection of rights to those named specifically in the Bill of Rights. I think the Supreme Court should look to the spirit of the framers in crafting a Bill of Rights. But I think the Supreme Court should reject a narrow reading of the constitution that limits rights only to those that are specifically named. \n \n Chief Justice John Marshall did an expansive reading of the constitution, which angered people who considered themselves to be strict constructionists. Marshall viewed the constitution not as a strait jacket but as a guide. He did not simply look for what the framers intended; he interpreted the constitution as providing for expansive federal power and for protection of property rights, which he viewed as essential for the future of the republic. He was in philosophy and in his rulings a Federalist. People in the Jeffersonian camp, the Democratic Republicans, railed at what they saw as Marshall's injection of his political philosophy and party politics into his interpretation of the constitution.\n \n To say that the early justices followed a consistent formula or \"standard\" of seeking to adhere to the wishes of the framers is contrary to my understanding of how these early jurists ruled. Marshall sought to leave the the Federalist legacy of a strong central government through his interpretation of the constitution. \n \n Jumping forward in time to the ratification of the 14th amendment, the framers of this amendment intentionally wrote the amendment to be broad in scope, and they intentionally left it to future generations to give specific meaning to the clauses in the amendment, such as \"due process\" and \"equal protection.\" They did not seek to name or to limit the rights that would be protected by the amendment; instead they deliberately left that to future generations. Just as the framers of the original constitution and the Bill of Rights did NOT seek to limit rights to those enumerated, the framers of the 14th amendment did not intend to limit the rights protected to a specific list. Nor did they specify which people they intended to protect with the amendment; they wrote the amendment to protect all people. \n \n I disagree with those who argue that the Supreme Court must stick to a narrow standard of what the framers specifically intended or wrote in making its interpretations. I think that the spirit of the framers in protecting human rights should be the guiding principle, not a specific list of rights that can be picked out of the constitution. The framers did not intend to limit rights to those they specifically enumerated. Our Supreme Court should not limit them in that way either.",

   "What I am suggesting is a new idea is the idea that the job of courts is not necessarily to determine what the original meaning of the document is. That is a fairly recent phenomenon, as has been demonstrated by Jonathan O'Neill in his work Originalism in American Law and Politics: A Constitutional History. What courts have always done, until fairly recently, is to assert that some interpretation of the Constitution gets us to the original meaning of the document. That has shifted, and now the role of courts is no longer viewed as adopting methods to get us to the original meaning.\n \n In short, throughout most of our Constitutional history the goal of the courts have been to get us to the original meaning of the Constitution. There of course were different interpretations throughout our history. But the disagreement was whether the court decision arrived at the original meaning. Now, however, that has changed. Now disagreement does not take place on the basis of how close the decision is to the original meaning. Original meaning is no longer the end (or purpose) of Constitutional interpretation. And this is a fairly recent phenomenon in our history.\n \n\n \n O'Neill's is an interesting book, though I think his argument is more complicated and nuanced than you suggest here. Also, you seem to buy his argument wholesale, offering no critical analysis of it. \n \n One of O'Neill's points is that originalism fell into disfavor partly because of its association with substantive due process. This is ironic, given your passionate argument that substantive due process is wrong and is simply an invention of the Supreme Court. \n \n The turning point, in O'Neill's view, away from originalism was the so-called constitutional revolution of 1937, or the shift on the Supreme Court toward support for New Deal programs and the movement on the Court toward a pragmatic response to contemporary social and economic and political conditions. Of course, that's not a terribly recent development. This shift took place 70 years ago. Your argument that all of this happened quite recently seems, well, to stretch the idea of recently. Also, I can certainly find instances earlier than the New Deal era of the Supreme Court not exhibiting a rigid adherence to originalism. Think about the ruling in Muller v. Oregon, for example, in which the Court responded to the Brandeis Brief, which presented a wealth of \"sociological data\" about the impact on women of working long hours in factories and shops. That ruling was in 1908, just 3 years after Lochner, and it was at least a temporary repudiation of originalism in favor of pragmatism and a response to social conditions. \n \n While O'Neill seems to like the doctrine of originalism, he concedes that its proponents have not made much headway in bringing the doctrine back, and even conservatives do not subscribe wholly or necessarily to this doctrine. He notes that \"American constitutional jurisprudence is best described empirically as an amalgam of plural modalities of argument that depend on competing conceptions of legal authority, which are never able wholly to displace one another.\" This is fine with me. I would rather see decisions in which justices consider a variety of factors, including social conditions and the impact of their rulings on real people, than to see the justices adhering to a rigid doctrine of originalism. \n \n My own view, which you seemed to want to hear, is that we should not embrace originalism as the standard by which justices rule. I think that it's entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, to take social reality into account and to take the social impact of rulings into account in making rulings. Part of the fallacy of the ruling in the Lochner case was that the justices pretended that workers and employers had \"liberty of contract,\" when in truth, employers had far more power than workers, and workers had few rights and few protections on the job and little practical liberty freely to contract. \n \n As a citizen and an ordinary person, I honestly do not care about the constitutional theory on which the justices' rulings rest. I care about the impact of those rulings on ordinary people. You may call this a results driven argument, and it is. That's because people are affected by the results much more than by the theory. \n \n Are there Supreme Court rulings that I oppose? Of course. I oppose them not because they violate a doctrine or theory of how to interpret the constitution that is close to my heart. I oppose them because the rulings have harmed real people. The Dred Scott ruling harmed African Americans. The Plessy v. Ferguson ruling harmed African Americans. The ruling in Lochner harmed working people. The ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick harmed gay people. \n The ruling in Minersville v. Gobitas harmed Jehovah's Witnesses and anyone who practiced a non-mainstream religion. These are just a few examples. \n \n I think the Court should consider a variety of factors in making its rulings, and what those factors are, exactly, should depend on the case before the Court. I think that the Court should honor the broad principles laid out by the framers without being overly concerned with trying to figure out exactly what the framers meant by this clause or by that clause. I think that in most cases the Court should consider the likely impact of its ruling on real people and should consider whether its ruling will do harm to people. I think the Court should honor the principle that the people have rights protected by the constitution without limiting the people's rights to what is explicitly enumerated in the constitution. I think the Court should honor precedent but not be held hostage to precedent. Like you, I think that the Court should overturn precedent when the justices think that the precedent is wrong. \n \n I am, to be honest, uncomfortable talking about what I think the Supreme Court ought to do, because as a history professor, that is not what I do. I teach about what the Supreme Court has done, not what I think it should have done or should do in the future. I never tell my students what should have happened; I encourage them to analyze what did happen and then to draw their own conclusions about what it means and what they think of the Court's rulings. My opinion of what the Court did or should do is not relevant to our classroom discussions, and I am admittedly uncomfortable expressing my opinion about what the Supreme Court should or should not do. \n \n Finally, on the question of whether I think Don't Ask, Don't Tell should be ruled unconstitutional, my answer is that I don't know. I would have to hear the arguments in the case and listen to both sides. I think this is probably a complicated question, involving issues of the degree of freedom of speech that people serving in the military are guaranteed by the constitution. What are the limits of that speech, and what kind of balancing test should justices apply? I would have to listen and think carefully about that before I could advance an opinion.",

   "Again, unenumerated is not a word and is not in the constitution. I realize what people mean by it when they say it but it isn't in any dictionary I am aware of. That fact is irrelevant though. What is relevant is what the amendment says and it doesn't talk about protecting rights not listed in the constitution other than to say you can't construe the constitution to deny them. What they are is irrelevant so being vague or not doesn't matter.\n\n \n It is nevertheless a vague amendment. The original point which seems to have been lost somewhere was that the Constitution is not always precise, and for good reason, leaving wiggle room for interpretation.\n \n \nWell it didn't reverse the idea that homosexual sodomy is not a \"fundamental right\" which was the idea I was getting at.\n\n \n As I recall, Lawrence v. Texas was decided on the grounds of privacy (14th Amendment due process). It may not have gone as far as saying there is an absolute right to have homosexual sex that cannot be abridged under any circumstances, which would be ridiculously sweeping, but it still circumscribed the ability of government to limit the right of consenting adults to enjoy it in private. Scalia et al. were most upset, because they appear to think the government does have a place in the bedroom to police private consensual activities that they personally disapprove of.\n \n So I have to wonder whether you think there is any right to privacy at all to be found there? Does government have the right under the Constitution to control private consensual activities that do not have a negative impact on others? If so, then that needs to be changed.\n \n \nHow can you possibly say they were wrong when your standard of what the constitution means is based on the judges that made that decision?\n\n \n What? I am not allowed to agree with some decisions and disagree with others? Sorry, but I think that Bowers was wrongly decided and Lawrence was correct. The standard I use is which decision most enhances the liberty of the individual at the expense of the power of the state. You know, this pesky \"life, liberty and pursuit of happiness\" notion that the founders came up with.\n \n \nYet having them decide which laws are good and which laws are bad based upon nothing more than what they feel is right seems to be more of a threat to democracy than elected politicians. Not to mention it was the system set up.\n\n \n But they aren't deciding on a whim or whether it feels good or bad. They are deciding based on precedent, and prevailing societal views of where justice lies. They don't usually just do whatever they damn well please. I certainly do not think that Lawrence was making law; it prevented government from infringing individual rights. It stopped government from making unjust laws that imposed undue burdens on everyone, and especially on one particular class, namely gay Americans. (As you will doubtlessly recall, O'Connor found that anti-sodomy laws were constitutional, but that their unequal application to gays was not. I think she should have gone that step further as the majority did, but hey... these are all only opinions, after all.)\n \n How did they become undue burdens? Well, they always were, it has just taken people a bit of time to realise it.\n \n \nWho are you to say I'm not a minority? A little pre-judging there...maybe because of the way I type? \n\n \n We are talking about equal rights for gay Americans. Are you gay or bisexual or transgendered? Because if not, you are part of the majority.\n \n \nYour suspicious words aside, if you feel that an all-power judge will always be a check on the legislature then you are dead wrong. There is no check for them to take away rights or limit minorities. I find an unelected body more of a threat to minorities than an elected body. \n\n \n And being a member of a minority whose liberty was threatened not so many years ago in many states, I fear the tyranny of the majority. Unbridled democracy is no more than mob rule, and it needs a rein. Representative democracy is one such rein, but a judiciary protecting constitutional rights is a protection against populist politicians willing to pander to prejudice.\n \n Of course the system isn't perfect. Of course the court will make mistakes. And of course, the judiciary isn't all powerful -- if people are sufficiently moved, they can always amend the Constitution to tie its hands -- and they have tried. God help us if they ever succeed.\n \n I wouldn't trust an all-powerful judiciary any more than an all-powerful legislature. That is why I admire the checks and balances system of the American government, but you seem to want to knock one of the checks out. I think that's an appallingly bad idea.\n \n \nStill you result based though. Instead of going with what the proper procedure is you automatically go for what the best result would be. If that is the case we really shouldn't have a constitution but just have a few folks who make decisions about what should be best for this country....after all, the document is outdated, right!? :xbanghead\n\n \n Who is going through an improper procedure? The people challenging the constitutionality of DADT through the courts? It's perfectly proper. Part of the function of the courts is to protect individual liberties against government power. The people are entitled to get a hearing.\n \n You know, the law and constitutionality isn't something where you can get an eternally correct answer as in mathematics. It's an evolving institution that has to work for today's society, not that of 200 years ago. Obviously, you don't like the direction it's been moving in, but accusing judges of making laws because they make a few decisions you happen to disagree with to limit government power is not a rational or fair criticism.\n \n It is interesting in this context that a study of voting patterns in the Rehnquist court showed that the conservative judges were more likely to vote to stop legislation as unconstitutional than the liberal ones -- as indeed, one might expect on the assumption that liberals are more receptive to government participation in the lives of citizens. But no-one on the right seems to be willing to call the Scalias of the court \"activist judges\" when they agree with their decisions.",

The original point which seems to have been lost somewhere was that the Constitution is not always precise, and for good reason, leaving wiggle room for interpretation.\n How is that even remotely vague? Regardless, vague doesn't mean you don't use a standard approach for finding what vague terms meant. Some terms might be vague but there is plenty of evidence to indicate what words meant at the time or perhaps what common thought was etc etc. The point I try to make is you can't go from \"some terms are vague\" to \"therefore it means whatever I want it to mean today...and it evolves after that\".

Well, they always were, it has just taken people a bit of time to realise it.\nThey certainly did make law...they created a new right of the constitution. Prevented government from infringing rights? This first implies there is a set of rights outside of government. I'd like to know where these come from and furthermore where does the constitution say they are protected? \n \n Again, you seem to only be focused on the result and not how you got there. If the constitution specifically said \"No Gay Marriage Is EVERY Allowed\" and a court said \"that amendment is unconstitutional because it goes against the spirit of the constitution\" would you say that is a good decision?\n \n \nWe are talking about equal rights for gay Americans. Are you gay or bisexual or transgendered? Because if not, you are part of the majority.\n \nThat's not what you said...we were talking just about minorities. It seemed a little racist to me but if you didn't mean it that way I'll let it go.\n \n \nAnd being a member of a minority whose liberty was threatened not so many years ago in many states, I fear the tyranny of the majority. Unbridled democracy is no more than mob rule, and it needs a rein. Representative democracy is one such rein, but a judiciary protecting constitutional rights is a protection against populist politicians willing to pander to prejudice.\nYet the rights have to be in the constitution first to protect them. Who is to say 9 people who are free to do as they please won't limit rights? In fact, they already have done this. If I get 5 people up there that hate gays and we take your view of what the judiciary does then I'd say you are going to be changing your mind about how we look at the constitution.\n \n \nOf course the system isn't perfect. Of course the court will make mistakes. And of course, the judiciary isn't all powerful -- if people are sufficiently moved, they can always amend the Constitution to tie its hands -- and they have tried. God help us if they ever succeed.\nThey are the most powerful branch though.

That is why I admire the checks and balances system of the American government, but you seem to want to knock one of the checks out. I think that's an appallingly bad idea.\nActually I want to put a check into the judiciary. If the constitution is \"up to interpretation\" then why is there anything wrong with President Bush assuming powers he doesn't have? That was just his interpretation of it. The obvious check on this is the judiciary saying you do not have that power or the legislature impeaching him. If the judiciary assumes power then what is the check on that? Impeaching? Hardly. If you have 5 justices do what the democrats like then why would the democrats impeach them for assumption of power? \n \n \nWho is going through an improper procedure? The people challenging the constitutionality of DADT through the courts? It's perfectly proper. Part of the function of the courts is to protect individual liberties against government power. The people are entitled to get a hearing.\nFine, you like proper procedure for that but when it comes to looking at the letter of the law you seem to want them to look at what society likes or what the world likes instead of seeing what the law says. Just like in my example of a contract having no meaning you have rendered the constitution useless. \n \n \nYou know, the law and constitutionality isn't something where you can get an eternally correct answer as in mathematics. It's an evolving institution that has to work for today's society, not that of 200 years ago.

You also seem to forget that I disagree with the decision because they are making law not because I didn't like the outcome. \n \n You really do have a result based mind and I do not. I think the sodomy law was rather dumb and pointless. On the opposite side I think someone burning a flag is a sicko and would like to see them in jail but that's not what our constitution says. \n \n \nIt is interesting in this context that a study of voting patterns in the Rehnquist court showed that the conservative judges were more likely to vote to stop legislation as unconstitutional than the liberal ones -- as indeed, one might expect on the assumption that liberals are more receptive to government participation in the lives of citizens. But no-one on the right seems to be willing to call the Scalias of the court \"activist judges\" when they agree with their decisions.\nWhat does declaring something unconstitutional have to do with anything? I'm not worried about that, I'm worried about the means to get to the decision. You can declare every law that comes to the court unconstitutional and so long as you did so using a proper reading of the constitution then I could care less. An \"activist judge\" is not one who strikes down laws but one who uses \"prevailing society or world views\" to make decisions that are outside what the law states.",

If the constitution specifically said \"No Gay Marriage Is EVERY Allowed\" and a court said \"that amendment is unconstitutional because it goes against the spirit of the constitution\" would you say that is a good decision?\n\n \n I take it this is a laboured effort to be droll? No, this is why the forces of discrimination have been desperate to get a constitutional amendment passed, so that a court cannot recognise equal rights for gay Americans. This is what they fear will happen: equality for gays, and they can't stand that for religious reasons. So they want to write bigotry into the Constitution and prevent the judiciary from offering equal protections under law.\n \n \nThat's not what you said...we were talking just about minorities.

That's why we have the 9th Amendment, so that rights cannot be restricted just to those specifically listed.\n \n \nWho is to say 9 people who are free to do as they please won't limit rights? In fact, they already have done this. If I get 5 people up there that hate gays and we take your view of what the judiciary does then I'd say you are going to be changing your mind about how we look at the constitution.\n\n \n They would be going against the pirit of the Constitution, and that would make their decision wrong.\n \n \nThey are the most powerful branch though. And they are to be the weakest.\n\n \n Oh come off it, don't exaggerate! They're a pretty conservative bunch, hardly at the vanguard of judicial reform. So they stop some egregious abuses of government power. Is this a constitutional disaster?\n \n \nActually I want to put a check into the judiciary.\n\n \n There are plenty of checks already. Judges can be impeached, courts can be reversed by constitutional actions, so if their actions are so outrageous, there are constitutional remedies already.\n \n \nIf the constitution is \"up to interpretation\" then why is there anything wrong with President Bush assuming powers he doesn't have? That was just his interpretation of it. The obvious check on this is the judiciary saying you do not have that power or the legislature impeaching him. If the judiciary assumes power then what is the check on that? Impeaching? Hardly. If you have 5 justices do what the democrats like then why would the democrats impeach them for assumption of power? \n\n \n It hasn't stopped Bush from assuming every power he wants. He deserves impeachment, but politically speaking, it won't happen -- too many Republicans. Democrats aren't in power all the time, either, and it takes a thumping majority to make an impeachment, whether of a president or justice, stick.\n \n I think you are grossly exaggerating the power and effect of the judiciary. All it's done with Lawrence is admit gay human beings have a right to privacy. You claim there is no such right, but you're wrong.\n \n \nI wouldn't like it to move at all. It is a legal document.

   "By not enumerating rights specifically.\n Why would it have to? That doesn't make it vague. The list of rights is already in the constitution. The ones outside are rather irrelevant to the purpose of the amendment. This amendment is one of the least vague ones in my opinion.\n \n \n\n Why would you care about that?\nGood question. Why is there even a \"rational\" and \"strict\" test formed in this amendment.\n \n \nI take it this is a laboured effort to be droll? No, this is why the forces of discrimination have been desperate to get a constitutional amendment passed, so that a court cannot recognise equal rights for gay Americans. This is what they fear will happen: equality for gays, and they can't stand that for religious reasons. So they want to write bigotry into the Constitution and prevent the judiciary from offering equal protections under law.\nIf the amendment is blanket equal protection then no form of discrimination is legal. This would mean all laws regarding the draft, age to marry, etc etc are unconstitutional. No one on the court even believes this.\n \n Also, you didn't answer the question. Are you or are you not a result based thinker when it comes to the constitution?\n \n \nI am no more racist than you are homophobic.\n \nI don't know how racist you are and you don't know if I am or am not homophobic. All I'm saying was your comment came across as racist to me. You claim you didn't mean it that way and I accept that.\n \n \n \nNope. That's why we have the 9th Amendment, so that rights cannot be restricted just to those specifically listed.\nHave you ever read the 9th amendment? How on earth can you say that rights not listed are actually constitutional rights from that amendment.\n \n \nThey would be going against the spirit of the Constitution, and that would make their decision wrong.\nHAHA, the \"spirit\" of the constitution huh? I guess that answers my question above about declaring an amendment unconstitutional.\n \n It seems the spirit of the constitution is to at least have it followed. You certainly disagree with this principal.\n \n \nOh come off it, don't exaggerate! They're a pretty conservative bunch, hardly at the vanguard of judicial reform. So they stop some egregious abuses of government power. Is this a constitutional disaster?\nI would say it is a constitutional disaster. They have failed to uphold the document as they should. \n \n \nThere are plenty of checks already. Judges can be impeached, courts can be reversed by constitutional actions, so if their actions are so outrageous, there are constitutional remedies already.\nBoth of those are extremely unlikely and difficult to do. Like I said, if the republicans or democrats have 5 people up there that will do what they want instead of what the law says then why would they ever be impeached? A majority rules political supreme court is what you want? It seems that is the opposite of what you want.\n \n\n It hasn't stopped Bush from assuming every power he wants. He deserves impeachment, but politically speaking, it won't happen -- too many Republicans. Democrats aren't in power all the time, either, and it takes a thumping majority to make an impeachment, whether of a president or justice, stick.\nMy point exactly. You won't have republicans stopping Bush for doing something wrong because in the end they like the result. This is exactly what your result based thinking leads us to. Extend this to the Supreme Court...you get a congress that approves 5 politicians to be on the bench and they won't impeach them so long as they give out results that favor their parties wants. \n \n Maybe you will see the danger of having no independent standard when the court swings grossly against what you wish to happen. \n \n \nI think you are grossly exaggerating the power and effect of the judiciary. All it's done with Lawrence is admit gay human beings have a right to privacy. You claim there is no such right, but you're wrong.\nThere are plenty of people that claim no right to privacy exists. You have to really have some faith if you want to claim the constitution speaks of a blanket right to privacy somewhere. If making up stuff in the constitution and having it be supreme law is not power then I don't know what is.\n \n \n\n You would like us still to be in the legislative environment of 1776?\n1789 you mean (the year the constitution went into effect). And yes, except for the obvious exceptions due to amendments. \n \n \nI believe in a Constitution that protects the liberty of the individual against the authority of the state. You believe in a fossilised legal document. That's the difference. \nOr stated another way, I believe in the constitution and you don't. The constitution doesn't give blanket liberty of the individual over the states. In fact, it sets up a framework for which the federal government is to operate. The Bill of Rights and a few other amendments actually limit a little farther but like the 10th amendment specially says: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n This amendment, by the way, is in conjunction with the 9th amendment if you ever bother to read the history behind it. If Prof is reading this then I encourage him to read some stuff by Kurt Lash since I believe Prof is into history a bit.\n \n\n If the law can reasonably be interpreted as unconstitutional, then it should be struck down. There is every reason to find a sodomy law unconstitutional because it interferes with the liberty and privacy of the individual for no good reason. They may have believed they had a good reason when those laws were first passed, but we now know such a reason is spurious.\nBut you are guaranteed liberty 100%. It can be taken away with due process....people fail to see that part of the amendment.\n \n \nWe need to learn from our mistakes, and not go on repeating them because the law is fossilised.\nYou are the one wanting to fossilize the law. My method makes the law more free flowing and flexible than yours ever will. Having the constitution be limited means that laws can come and go with a simple majority vote. By taking things out of the democratic process via an unelected body you create a rigid and unchangable law system which declares 9 czars and leaves us as a bitter country. It also politicizes the judiciary (this is obviously happening now) and threatens the very justice you claim to seek.\n \n You argue for a constitution that doesn't exist. You have claimed I am made at the way it is but the truth is you wish it to mean what you want it to mean. You seem to think the only purpose of the constitution is to have liberty as this is the \"spirit\" of the constitution so therefore every thing else is irrelevant in that document.\n \n An odd, dangerous way of thinking.",

They compromised and added the Bill of Rights in order to win the support of the antifederalists. But the original framers did not intend rights to be limited to those on the specific list. \nI don't mean to be a pest but can we get over the word \"enumerated\". It has no special meaning. The word means \"listed\" so lets just go with that. And you are correct that they felt rights existed outside the constitution. However, it is very clear that these are not protected by the constitution other than the fact that the ones that are listed couldn't be used to deny the ones that are not. This is hardly the same thing as saying a state couldn't deny them. \n \n Furthermore, you state the federalists didn't want the Bill of Rights because of this very reason. In a sense this is true because the constitution without the amendments is only a list of things the federal government CAN do. The Bill of Rights is the opposite with things you CAN'T do. They felt the federal government might take the later approach and assume they CAN do more because the Bill of Rights didn't say they couldn't do it. Oddly enough this is exactly what happened. Every branch of federal government assumed power on the notion that it didn't say they couldn't. This includes the judicial branch by the way. What you fail to state is that the constitution was a federal document and that a goal was to leave local governments power to regulate as they please. This is very evident in the fact that many state religions existed after the 1st amendment was passed. The argument was that the federal government was not one to restrict what is or is not a right but that state and local government can decide what is best for them. The idea is obviously called federalism and it should be what we have today.\n \n I do not wish to claim that the federal government should have power to restrict certain things. In fact, I don't. The federal government really has no authority to limit abortion, gay marriage (other than federal tax issues), and things of that nature but they do thanks to the expansion of the commerce clause (another victory for the \"constitution has no real meaning\" folks).\n \n \nThe post-Civil War framers of the 14th amendment did not list the rights that would be protected from state abrogation for the same reason. They did not want to protect only a narrow list of rights. Their intention was to protect rights broadly and to protect the rights of all people, not just one specific group.\nYou don't have to list them because everything is a \"right\" unless you have a law against it. The point is not that rights exist but that they exist until the process has been done to take them away. There is no indication that I know of that where the 14th amendment was to mean the courts define what \"rights\" are valuable and protected. It is unreasonable to think this is so.",

   "O'Neill's is an interesting book, though I think his argument is more complicated and nuanced than you suggest here. Also, you seem to buy his argument wholesale, offering no critical analysis of it. \n \n One of O'Neill's points is that originalism fell into disfavor partly because of its association with substantive due process. This is ironic, given your passionate argument that substantive due process is wrong and is simply an invention of the Supreme Court.\n\n \n It may seem ironic, although I do not really think it is. Let me try to explain. Originalism holds that the purpose of interpreting legal documents (i.e., the purpose of the judiciary) is to ascertain and apply the original meaning of that document. The interesting thing about the Lochner decision is that certainly that court was essentially claiming to have reached an interpretation that squared with the original meaning of the Constitution. So, even in the Lochner decision, we see that the purpose of the Court was viewed as ascertaining original meaning.\n \n The mistake I (and countless others) assert that the court made in Lochner was not in their goal of attaining original meaning, but that their decision did not actually ascertain the original meaning. And this is the same objection I (and countless others) have with the doctrine of substantive due process. Their mistake simply was the fact that the Constitution did not include a Constitutionally protected \"liberty to contract.\" It takes no studies of social conditions to demonstrate this. It requires no discussion or research on the question of whether and who has more bargaining power in today's climate: the employer or the employee. As the liberty to contract is not protected by the Constitution, it is subject to regulation through the normal means of legislation.\n \n \nThe turning point, in O'Neill's view, away from originalism was the so-called constitutional revolution of 1937, or the shift on the Supreme Court toward support for New Deal programs and the movement on the Court toward a pragmatic response to contemporary social and economic and political conditions. Of course, that's not a terribly recent development. This shift took place 70 years ago. Your argument that all of this happened quite recently seems, well, to stretch the idea of recently.\n\n \n In my view, the doctrine of substantive due process essentially leads us to the proposition that there really is no such thing as a correct answer to a legal question. This is an opinion you seem to hold yourself. It is this idea that I have said is a development of recent legal history. In citing \"legal history\" we are not limited simply to the history of our republic. Our legal traditions have a foundation: they developed out of the legal movements in Europe (particularly England). When considered in this context, 70 years most ceratinly is a fairly recent development. Though, I would argue that your position (that there are no correct answers) is most certainly a fairly recent development in our tradition.\n \n \nAlso, I can certainly find instances earlier than the New Deal era of the Supreme Court not exhibiting a rigid adherence to originalism. Think about the ruling in Muller v. Oregon, for example, in which the Court responded to the Brandeis Brief, which presented a wealth of \"sociological data\" about the impact on women of working long hours in factories and shops. That ruling was in 1908, just 3 years after Lochner, and it was at least a temporary repudiation of originalism in favor of pragmatism and a response to social conditions.\n\n \n Again, I have not said anywhere that departures from originalism have not happened in our history. I have said that any such departures are illegitimate. Now, when my claim is that \"departures from originalism are illegitimate,\" it really is no response to that claim to say, \"Well, departures from originalism have occurred.\"\n \n \nWhile O'Neill seems to like the doctrine of originalism, he concedes that its proponents have not made much headway in bringing the doctrine back, and even conservatives do not subscribe wholly or necessarily to this doctrine. He notes that \"American constitutional jurisprudence is best described empirically as an amalgam of plural modalities of argument that depend on competing conceptions of legal authority, which are never able wholly to displace one another.\" This is fine with me. I would rather see decisions in which justices consider a variety of factors, including social conditions and the impact of their rulings on real people, than to see the justices adhering to a rigid doctrine of originalism.\n\n \n As you know, I would rather see the Justices exercising their authority legitimately, even if doing so results in tremendously horrific, distasteful, or even unjust decisions.\n \n \nMy own view, which you seemed to want to hear, is that we should not embrace originalism as the standard by which justices rule. I think that it's entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, to take social reality into account and to take the social impact of rulings into account in making rulings. Part of the fallacy of the ruling in the Lochner case was that the justices pretended that workers and employers had \"liberty of contract,\" when in truth, employers had far more power than workers, and workers had few rights and few protections on the job and little practical liberty freely to contract.\n\n \n Regarding Lochner, I simply reference my comments above.\n \n But regarding your vision of the judiciary, I simply can't disagree more. The reasons I disagree with your vision is that it essentially transforms the judiciary into a purely political branch of government where justices weigh arguments and evidence and then proceed to determine if a policy is a good one or not. This sounds a lot like what Congress does. And any objective look at the Constitution itself, as well as the history surrounding its ratification, shows that the Judiciary was never intended to operate the way Congress does. Lifetime appointments and removing the ability to lower judicial salaries were both protections intended to insulate the judiciary from considering the very things you want them to consider. They are not there to make people happy or to produce good policy.\n \n \nAs a citizen and an ordinary person, I honestly do not care about the constitutional theory on which the justices' rulings rest. I care about the impact of those rulings on ordinary people. You may call this a results driven argument, and it is. That's because people are affected by the results much more than by the theory.\n\n \n I will not say that your concern about the impact of the law on ordinary people is misplaced. I share this concern. I simply disagree that the judiciary either has the authority to base decisions on those concerns, or even that it would be desirable that they do so in the event that they did have that authority.\n \n \nAre there Supreme Court rulings that I oppose? Of course. I oppose them not because they violate a doctrine or theory of how to interpret the constitution that is close to my heart. I oppose them because the rulings have harmed real people. The Dred Scott ruling harmed African Americans. The Plessy v. Ferguson ruling harmed African Americans. The ruling in Lochner harmed working people. The ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick harmed gay people. \n The ruling in Minersville v. Gobitas harmed Jehovah's Witnesses and anyone who practiced a non-mainstream religion. These are just a few examples.\n\n \n The problem with this standard is that it is wholly subjective. What is the definition of harm? Do you think that Jerry Falwell was harmed by Larry Flynt's Penthouse Publication (I'll spare the specific details, of which I'm sure you are aware)? If he was harmed, then would you support a different decision in Hustler v. Falwell?\n \n In virtually every court decision someone is going to be \"harmed.\" Which is why I think the courts should only consider the law factor--and not consider in the least the harm factor--in their decision making.\n \n \nI think the Court should consider a variety of factors in making its rulings, and what those factors are, exactly, should depend on the case before the Court. I think that the Court should honor the broad principles laid out by the framers without being overly concerned with trying to figure out exactly what the framers meant by this clause or by that clause. I think that in most cases the Court should consider the likely impact of its ruling on real people and should consider whether its ruling will do harm to people. I think the Court should honor the principle that the people have rights protected by the constitution without limiting the people's rights to what is explicitly enumerated in the constitution. I think the Court should honor precedent but not be held hostage to precedent. Like you, I think that the Court should overturn precedent when the justices think that the precedent is wrong.\n\n \n I'll simply add a comment regarding your desire for the court to \"honor the principle that the people have rights protected by the constitution without limiting the people's rights to what is explicitly enumerated in the constitution.\"\n \n I simply do not see how a court is supposed to divine what rights deserve protection; for that is all it could do. An acknowledgment that other rights exist that are not written down in the Constitution is not an acknowledgment that such rights are protected by the Constitution. And it most certainly is not a license for judges to sit up in their chambers to determine what those rights are. Why bother writing down any specific rights in the Constitution, if the simple acknowledgment that \"rights exist\" would do the trick?\n \n \nI am, to be honest, uncomfortable talking about what I think the Supreme Court ought to do, because as a history professor, that is not what I do. I teach about what the Supreme Court has done, not what I think it should have done or should do in the future. I never tell my students what should have happened; I encourage them to analyze what did happen and then to draw their own conclusions about what it means and what they think of the Court's rulings. My opinion of what the Court did or should do is not relevant to our classroom discussions, and I am admittedly uncomfortable expressing my opinion about what the Supreme Court should or should not do.\n\n \n I did not know that you were a history professor. That would explain why you respond to my posts with a great deal of history. I must say that I meant no ill-will in my continual observations that you were responding to my posts with history. I simply did not (and still do not) think such responses actually meet my claims. No big deal though. The discussion has been interesting nonetheless. \n \n I am also glad that in your history classes you simply teach about what the Supreme Court has done. I am also glad that feel that your opinion of what the Court should do is not relevant to classroom discussions.\n \n I would, however, point out that this is a forum and not a classroom. You might be able to tell that I think theory matters a great deal. But I cannot fault you if you do not wish to go down that road.",

The reason Bork called it an \"inkblot\" is because it states the obvious. \n \n The amendment reads: The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.I just put it down as a reference\n \n From this text it seems clear of what they are asking. Before I get to that we can first look at a similar use of words. Consumer Reports states that you can't use their findings to support or promote your product. Now, how does this relate? Well the 9th amendment says you can't use their listed rights to deny or disparage other retained by the people. It is similar in that Consumer Reports is not making any claims about said product in that statement. Likewise the 9th amendment is not claiming any support for the rights outside the constitution. The fact that they exist is irrelevant to the amendment. \n \n It was supposed to be a full proof way for the federal government to not assume more power than it already had. To draw that these non-listed amendments are indeed protected by the constitution is crazy...they are only protected against the constitution. \n \n \nFarber argues that the framers certainly believed that people have rights beyond those they thought of to list in the Bill of Rights and even beyond those they could envision in their time. The framers, he argues, did not see the constitution as granting rights, but as protecting natural rights from government usurpation.

Oringinalism requires one to know the understanding of the text at the time of adoption. The fact that some framers thought government shouldn't limit rights certainly doesn't speak to what the 9th amendment means.

In fact, early versions of the amendment (which were combined with the 10th...but called something different) make this even more clear.\n \n To quote Kurt Lash: \n \n \nIn two prior articles, I presented a\n substantial body of evidence indicating that the Ninth was conceived and\n received as a federalist provision preserving the people's retained right to local\n self-government.10 This is how its drafter James Madison understood the Clause\n and this is how scholars and judges construed the amendment for more than one\n hundred years after its enactment.\nSource: The Inescapable Federalism of the Ninth Amendment by Kurt Lash",

   "This is a very important question, and one that brings up, of course, the question of what the ninth amendment means. I just read a good new book on this subject, by law professor Dan Farber. It's entitled Retained by the People. Farber argues that the little-used and virtually ignored 9th amendment, if understood as the framers intended it, is the source of unenumerated rights, or rights not listed in the constitution. He argues that we ought to turn to the 9th amendment rather than to the due process clause as the constitutional provision that guarantees rights not specifically named in the constitution. Farber thus makes an originalist argument, but it's an originalist argument very different from that of Antonin Scalia or Robert Bork, who scorn the 9th amendment. Wasn't it Bork who called the 9th amendment an \"inkblot?\"\n\n \n All arguments based on originalism are not created equal. And the thing about originalist arguments is they can actually be judged to be correct or incorrect. In this instance, I would say that Farber is mistaken.\n \n A true originalist argument, for example, would hardly maintain that the framers intended the Constitution to bind the state legislatures. Thus, though Congress could not abridge the freedom of speech, state legislatures were perfectly free to do so in ways that Congress could not. Indeed, the doctrine of incorporation (at least as applied today) is quite suspect under an originalist interpretation.\n \n And again, what is the purpose of listing specific rights in the Constitution, if simply acknowledging that rights exist would have sufficed? The purpose of listing rights in the Constitution is to list those rights which deserve Constitutional protection. It is a special category of rights. It is taking a look at the pool of rights that exist, and picking out which ones will be protected by the Constitution.\n \n \nFarber argues that the framers certainly believed that people have rights beyond those they thought of to list in the Bill of Rights and even beyond those they could envision in their time. The framers, he argues, did not see the constitution as granting rights, but as protecting natural rights from government usurpation. This was also Jefferson's vision in the Declaration.\n\n \n I do not doubt, nor do I contest, that the framers certainly believed that people have rights beyond those listed in the Bill of Rights. But though I have not read Farber's book (perhaps I'll have to take a look at it as my interest has been piqued), I seriously doubt that he can demonstrate that the framers believed those rights to be enshrined within the Constitution to the level of calling them Constitutionally protected.\n \n I would be a little more specific than Farber when he says the founders viewed themselves as protecting natural rights. Indeed they did. But they certainly did not think themselves as drawing out all natural rights for Constitutional protection. Otherwise the simple statement that \"all natural rights are hereby protected by this Constitution\" would have sufficed. No, they must be viewed as having drawn out certain specific natural rights for protection.\n \n And, regardless, we are still left with the problem of judges determining what exactly qualifies as a natural right. This is wholly subjective and based on various philosophical principles. Hence, it is far more likely that the agreement of 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the State legislatures will arrive at a natural right, than the mere agreement of 5 individuals from a very unrepresentative sample of the country. In short, what I have said is that those rights which survive the amendment process are far more likely to be natural rights than those rights which merely survive the majority deliberation of 9 judges.\n \n \nPhyllis, you asked for a few examples of rights that the constitution protects that are not specifically listed? There are obvious ones, such as the right to marry and the right to privacy. Yes, the list could be endless, because the framers saw human rights as expansive, not as limited. I agree with Farber's argument that the constitution was not created to limit rights but rather to limit the government's abridgement of rights. And that's an originalist analysis. \n\n \n First of all, I have not said that the Constitution was intended to limit rights. Rather I have said that the Constitution lists the specific rights which have been singled out for protection.\n \n Second, I realize that marriage and privacy are wholly appealing as fundamental human rights. I won't bother discussing whether these are natural rights (not because I agree, but because the point is moot); I will simply assume that they are. But the problem is this: it has not been demonstrated that all natural rights were intended to be protected by the Constitution. And, furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that judges have been given the task of discovering what a natural right is, nor has it been demonstrated that they have the authority to declare those natural rights as Constitutionally protected.\n \n \nThe Supreme Court does not \"invent\" new rights, just as the constitution does not \"invent\" rights and legislatures do not \"invent\" them. The theory of the framers was that rights exist, and one role of the constitution and limitations on government was/is to protect those rights. As Jefferson argued, and John Locke before him, they are natural rights. Jefferson acknowledged that natural rights come from the Creator.\n\n \n The argument is not that the Supreme Court has invented new rights. The argument is that they have invented new Constitutional rights. I have no problem acknowledging that rights exist. I have no problem acknowledging that rights are endowed to men by their Creator. But what happens if a Supreme Court decides that, as God is the Creator of rights, one must look to the Bible to determine what rights human beings have? Or alternatively, what happens if a Supreme Courts decides that it must look to the Koran to determine what natural rights exist? That is quite problematic.\n \n In short, one can acknowledge with profound consistency that rights exist that are not listed in the Constitution, and at the same time acknowledge that those rights are not protected by the Constitution.",

   "Phew, I'm having a hard time keeping up.\n \n \nThe framers of the original constitution made the argument that the constitution should NOT have a bill of rights because, they said, to list rights could result in rights being limited only to those listed, which was not their intention. The federalists argued that the constitution did not need a bill of rights, because the limitations on the national government in the constitution itself were sufficient to protect the rights of the people, and they pointed to the existence of state protections of rights in their constitutions. The framers, Madison in particular, did not want to see rights limited only to the ones that might happen be listed.\n\n \n Again, I have not disputed that the framers did not want the fact that they chose to list certain rights in the Constittution to be interpreted that they felt that only those rights exist in the universe. Hence they penned the 9th Amendment. But all the 9th Amendment does is acknowledge the existence of such rights. It does not even begin to suggest that those rights not listed are nevertheless protected. And it certainly does not even begin to suggest that judges are charged with the duty of discovering what a natural right is. And, most certainly of all, it does not even begin to suggest that judges have the authority to establish new Constitutionally protected rights.\n \n \nThe early supporters of the constitution agreed to add a bill of rights as a compromise with the antifederalists, who felt strongly that the new constitution made the national government too powerful and that without a bill of rights, the government would become despotic and trample on the rights of the people. So the federalists (supporters of the constitution) agreed to insert a bill of rights as amendments in order to get the constitution ratified by the states. They succeeded, and Madison oversaw the process of inserting a bill of rights, which became the first 10 amendments. Madison felt that the ninth amendment was of great importance, because he felt it made clear that rights to be protected were not limited to those specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. However, the 9th amendment has been largely ignored, and some recent conservative justices have sneered at it. But it's there.\n\n \n I have never seen the suggestion that Madison viewed the 9th Amendment as acknowledging that rights not enumerated were nevertheless protected. I certainly don't have a problem with the 9th Amendment. I do, however, have a problem with much of the dogma being uttered with regard to the 9th Amendment.",

   "From this text it seems clear of what they are asking. Before I get to that we can first look at a similar use of words. Consumer Reports states that you can't use their findings to support or promote your product. Now, how does this relate? Well the 9th amendment says you can't use their listed rights to deny or disparage other retained by the people. It is similar in that Consumer Reports is not making any claims about said product in that statement. Likewise the 9th amendment is not claiming any support for the rights outside the constitution. The fact that they exist is irrelevant to the amendment.\n\n \n That's one interpretation of the amendment, and it does not square with what James Madison said about the amendment.

Why not simply have one Amendment which read: all human rights are hereby protected by this Constitution?\n\n \n The reason the framers added the Bill of Rights as the first 10 amendments was because the antifederalists, the opponents of the constitution, were advocating that the states not ratify the constitution. The biggest criticism of the antifederalists was that the constitution lacked a bill of rights, and in part because of this, they thought the constitution would create a despotic government. Madison and the other federalists argued that the constitution did not need a bill of rights, because the rights of the people were already protected by the separation of powers and the limitations that the constitution contained on federal power. But they wanted the states to ratify the constitution. In order to get the constitution ratified, the federalists, the supporters of the constitution, agreed to add a bill of rights, and that satisfied enough of the antifederalists so that the constitution was ratifed. Madison thus added a bill of rights as a political compromise with antifederalists. \n \n Madison still worried, though, that adding a bill of rights that listed specific rights would prompt people to think that other rights not listed were not protected, and this narrow interpretation of the people's rights would allow the federal government to expand its power and trample on people's rights. He thought that adding the 9th amendment would make clear that the rights listed in the bill of rights were not the only rights held by the people that the federal government could not take away. \n \n Of course, at the time the constitution protected the rights of the people only from abrogation by the national government, not by the states. The states had their own constitutions with their own protections. It wasn't until the ratification of the 14th amendment, and the subsequent interpretations of that amendment by the Supreme Court, that constitution protected the people's rights from abrogation by the states.\n \n The 9th amendment is there, and we have Madison's words to give us insight into why it is there. But this amendment has been used very little in the history of constitutional law, much like the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment, which was effectively nullified by the Supreme Court in the Slaughterhouse Cases.",

   "And as I mentioned earlier, unfortunately for the judges, words have meaning. They have not been given the authority to pontificate what counts as a natural right, nor have they been given the authority to squeeze their personal and subjective philosophical or moral judgments into the Constitution. \n \n Or are you suggesting that those powers not expressly denied to the judges are reserved by them? That because there is no explicit list of what they can do, they therefore have authority to do anything? That Judicial power, in fact, has no meaning. That would indeed be an interesting take on Article III. What would happen of Congress adopted that methodology? Perhaps they could come up with interesting powers on the basis that the word \"Armies\" is not explicitly defined in Article I?\n\n \n There's a lot to discuss in what you have written here, which is why I am responding to pieces of it at a time. In fact, judges HAVE been given the power to decide what counts as a right, simply because they have done it, and it's become accepted \"settled law.\" For example, in Loving v. Virginia and in other cases, the judges said that marriage is a right. The judges over time have further made distinctions between what they call \"fundamental\" rights and other rights. Of course, you'll surely object to all of this because none of it is explicitly stated as a power of judges in the constitution. \n \n The question of whether judges have powers not specifically denied to them is an interesting question. In fact the constitution is silent about this. The problem is that Article III says so very little about what the Supreme Court is empowered to do or not empowered to do. Is the Court empowered to do whatever it deems necessary in order to exercise the \"judicial power?\" Or isn't it? That is not clear from the wording of the document. It wasn't clear to people in the early years of the republic. \n \n Early interpreters of the constitution differed with each other over how it was supposed to be read and understood, and specifically what powers the different branches had in the absence of specific limitations in the constitution on those powers. Chief Justice John Marshall, who did so much to shape constitutional law in our nation, was for the most part a loose constructionist. He tended to see the national government, particularly the Supreme Court, as able to do whatever the constitution did not specifically bar it from doing. When the constitution was silent about the powers of the Court, Marshall interpreted this as meaning the Court could act, since nothing barred them from acting. This infuriated strict constructionists like Jefferson, who thought the constitution should be read as allowing the federal government to act only when it was granted specific authority to act. Marshall was not much of a supporter of civil rights, except for property rights. He was a supporter of the Federalist Party's vision for the nation, and he promoted, through his rulings, an expansive view of federal power, writing that the government had the power to act unless the constitution specifically prohibited the government from acting. \n \n So in answer to your question, how you read the constitution on this matter depends on how you decide to interpret it. And in reality, the Supreme Court has over time stepped in and ruled on what rights the constitution protects and under what circumstances. The Supreme Court has also ruled that rights are not absolute, and they have created balancing tests to balance the rights of the people versus the interests of the government.",

   "Like James Madison, Alexander Hamilton also opposed including a bill of rights in the constitution. Hamilton argued in The Federalist, No. 84 that a bill of rights was unnecessary because the federal government was a government of delegated powers and was not granted the power to intrude upon fundamental personal rights. Also like Madison, Hamilton feared that including a bill of rights that enumerated specific rights could allow the federal government to extend its power to deny other rights not specifically enumerated. Hamilton wrote as follows:\n \n 'I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"",

The interesting thing about Loving is that it was settled perfectly fine on Equal Protection grounds. There was not even the slightest need to advance a Due Process argument. But that is not really an important point to this discussion. What I would like to do here is to try and make a distinction that I think helpful. The distinction that I would like to make is between the power to do X and the authority to do X.\n \n You suggest that the fact that judges have done X is prima facie evidence that shows that judges have been given the power to do X. I would be more specific here. I would say that the fact that judges have done X is prima facie evidence that judges had the power to do X. However, I would not say that that fact shows that judges were given that power. It is entirely possible that they exerted power without actually having been given that power. This is the distinction between the power to do X and the authority to do X. An example should help.\n \n Suppose I am sitting on a park bench reading a newspaper. While I am minding my own business, an expert pickpocket comes by and grabs my car keys. He proceeds to get in my car and drive it to Timbuktu. Upon realizing that my car has been driven off, I promptly alert the authorities. After locating the pickpocket, the authorities take him into custody.\n \n Now, suppose that quick-thinking pickpocket, after remembering his grade school course on the Constitution, were to tell the authorities, \"It's okay guys. I had the power to drive that car! There really is no crime here. Everything is a-okay!\" What do you suppose the authorities would say? What question would they ultimately be interested in? It would not be the question of whether the thief had the power to drive the car. He obviously did. Rather, the authorities would be interested in whether the thief had the authority to drive the car. He did not. So we see that the exercise of a certain power does not entail that the exercise of that power is legitimate.\n \n Contrast that with the following. If I were to tell someone, \"Please drive my car to Timbuktu, and here are the keys,\" I certainly could call the authorities if that person were to obey. However, the authorities are not going to take this individual into custody because he had the authority to drive my car. He exercised that power legitimately.\n \n And hence we see the difference between the exercise of power and the legitimate exercise of power. It is a matter of consent. The exercise of power is done by fiat; the legitimate exercise of power is done by consent.\n \n That was a rather long way to say this: I do not contest what the Supreme Court has done in history. What I contest is that in certain instances they should have done some things differently. That is another way of saying they exercised their power illegitimately. I have previously said why I think they should have done those things differently, and there is no reason to go back into that.\n \n At this point, then, I suppose it is possible that this discussion may not be able to move any further. I think you know what I argue ought to happen with respect to Constitutional interpretation. I know, generally, what your responses are to my argument. I will simply reiterate that I do not believe that when I say, \"The Supreme Court ought to do X,\" that it is a gripping refutation of that claim to simply say, \"Well, the Supreme Court did X.\" I have thoroughly enjoyed this lengthy discussion, but I am likely to slow down with my posting unless I find something that really needs a response. \n \n \nThe question of whether judges have powers not specifically denied to them is an interesting question. In fact the constitution is silent about this. The problem is that Article III says so very little about what the Supreme Court is empowered to do or not empowered to do. Is the Court empowered to do whatever it deems necessary in order to exercise the \"judicial power?\" Or isn't it? That is not clear from the wording of the document.

The Supreme Court has also ruled that rights are not absolute, and they have created balancing tests to balance the rights of the people versus the interests of the government.\n\n \n One thing that is certainly necessary for this question to be adequately answered is a Constitutional theory. I have given you the theory I believe not only to be the preferable one; I have given you the theory that I think to be correct according to historical standards. At this point, that is all I can do.\n \n Again, I have thoroughly enjoyed this. But, as I said (perhaps to the delight of many other forumgoers), I may slow down with my responses simply because I'm not certain we need to continue covering the same ground. I hope my argument for originalism has been forceful. I have done my best to make it so. To the degree that I have not done so, I do not suppose that to be a fault of the theory. Rather, I would think it more likely a fault of its defender.",

In the case of the Supreme Court, when it came to John Marshall's loose construction of the constitution, for example, some, notably Jefferson, regarded Marshall's opinions as the Supreme Court stealing the car. There was great consternation among some political leaders, especially Democratic Republicans who favored a strict construction of the constitution, over Marshall's assertion of Supreme Court powers that were nowhere expressly stated in the constitution and over his expansion of the power of the federal government. In their view, Marshall probably looked like your car thief, stealing the constitution. However, no police ever came to arrest or to stop Marshall or the Supreme Court. Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans, grudgingly accepted Marshall's rulings, and the executive branch enforced them. The executive and the legislative branches abided by the Marshall court's rulings. (I recall one exception, an instance later in history when President Andrew Jackson simply ignored and refused to enforce a Supreme Court ruling regarding the rights of Indians to their land. This was one striking exception to my point.) \n \n My point is that the people consented to the rulings of the Supreme Court and to the Court's power to make its rulings by accepting the Court's rulings and abiding by them. The executive branch consented by enforcing the rulings, and the legislature consented by abiding by the rulings. Even those who disagreed with the Court's rulings accepted them and abided by them. In that way, the response to the Court's rulings gave them and the Court and its rulings legitimacy. That legitimacy was further bolstered by subsequent Supreme Court rulings that honored precedent and affirmed the legitmacy of prior decisions. The judges have been given the power to rule as they have because we the people, and our elected representatives, have accepted the Court having that power. \n \n The stamp of John Marshall is still on the Supreme Court. Folks who get upset over loose construction of the constitution have to look back all the way to Marshall for establishing that legacy.",

And until about 40 years ago, the amendment was hardly used in litigation or in the rulings of the justices. But in the Griswold decision, Justice Goldberg, in his concurring opinion, pointed to the 9th amendment as the basis for the Court sustaining the right to privacy, which Goldberg said was one of the rights of the people that had not been enumerated in the bill of rights but which was nevertheless to be protected from government abrogation.",

   "Steeeve,\n \n Here is an interesting quotation from Madison's proposal of a bill of rights to the House in 1789. Madison was talking about the need to protect the rights of the people by preventing the government from exercising undue power to deny the people's rights. Notice what he says at the end of this paragraph about protecting the minority from the majority:\n \n \"In our government it is, perhaps, less necessary to guard against the abuse in the executive department than any other; because it is not the stronger branch of the system, but the weaker: It therefore must be levelled against the legislative, for it is the most powerful, and most likely to be abused, because it is under the least control; hence, so far as a declaration of rights can tend to prevent the exercise of undue power, it cannot be doubted but such declaration is proper. But I confess that I do conceive, that in a government modified like this of the United States, the great danger lies rather in the abuse of the community than in the legislative body. The prescriptions in favor of liberty, ought to be levelled against that quarter where the greatest danger lies, namely, that which possesses the highest prerogative of power: But this [is] not found in either the executive or legislative departments of government, but in the body of the people, operating by the majority against the minority.\"\n \n Here we see Madison's concern for protecting the rights of all people, including protecting the minority from abrogation of rights by the majority.",

Thomas Jefferson saw the constitution as limiting the power of the federal government and giving more power to the states.

They need to be independent of popular whim to do their job. That doesn't mean they aren't or shouldn't be swayed by public opinion, but they shouldn't be mere puppets to it. Like it or not, one of the functions of the courts is to protect minorities from the legislative whim of majorities. \n \n And yes, I do think those unenumerated rights are protected by a Constitution designed to prevent government from overstepping its legitimate powers.\n \n \nI don't mean government has rights I mean that the right is a society created one in our system of government.

And people at the time regarded it as such. You are in good company with your opinion. \n \n The constitution was a more conservative document than the Declaration in many respects. The framers wrote the constitution partly to reign in what they regarded as liberty run amuck under the ineffectual Articles. They decided that the nation needed a far stronger central government in order to check the excesses of the people and also the states. They didn't actually have popular consent to write a new constitution; the delegates were sent to Philadelphia to try to fix the Articles. They decided to scrap them entirely and write something new. The antifederalists were very upset by the new constitution, because they regarded it as a usuraption of the people's liberty. In what people at the time saw as the contest between power and liberty, the antifederalists regarded the constitution as a terrible seizure of power at the expense of liberty. The addition of a Bill of Rights helped to soothe, but it did not eradicate, all of the antifederalist objections. \n \n Our discussion has, I think, illuminated the enormous significance of James Madison in American history, because of his role in writing and shaping the constitution. Those who subscribe to an originalist doctrine of constitutional interpretation will certainly spend a great deal of time with Madison, reading his notes on the convention and what he wrote about the Bill of Rights, of which he was the primary author. Madison was brilliant. He was less ideological in many ways than the rivals Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. Madison listened to his opponents, and he took their arguments seriously and incorporated the views of different people into his own thinking. Although he initially thought a bill of rights unnecessary, he changed his thinking on this somewhat to acknowledge the reasons for including it, and he embraced with passion the task of writing a bill of rights. Some have presented Madison as inconsistent, as waffling between strict and loose constructionist positions. I think his willingness to be flexible was a strength. After all, the founders were trying to figure out how to create a republic with a government that worked, after the government under the Articles that had failed. Madison sought to balance power and liberty, to create a stronger central government while using the separation of powers and federalism to ensure that liberty would be preserved. \n \n Steeeve has argued that Madison sought, in adding Amendment 9, to check the expansion of national government power, and that is true. Madison wrote about this. Madison's reason for wanting to check the expansion of federal power with Amendment 9, and with the Bill of Rights generally, was to ensure that the rights of the people would be preserved, that the national government would not expand its power to trample those rights.",

   "That's right that it did not matter that the amendment did not apply to the states at the time, but you were the one who raised the point that the amendment did not apply to the states, and I agreed with you that it did not. \n I must have misunderstood your point then.\n \n\n Madison intended the 9th amendment to prevent the federal government from assuming powers by abrogating rights of the people that had not been enumerated. You leave out from your argument what power Madison feared the federal government would exercise.....the power to take away the people's rights. He wasn't simply fearful of government exercising more power; he was fearful of government exercising more power for the purpose of denying people rights, by using clauses like the \"necessary and proper\" clause. He said this in his discussion of the bill of rights, when he presented a draft of the bill of rights.\nHe feared the federal government would assume power. If a right existed that was within the realm of federal power (perhaps some interstate commerce thing...i dunno) then the amendment does not say the federal government cannot pass a law to prevent this. The amendment means exactly what it sounds like it means....don't use the constitution as a tool to assume power to deny rights. \n \n However most of the rights really were state issues. But the amendment didn't and doesn't speak to the states. The state government could deny all marriage and this would not butt heads with the 9th amendment. In other words, those \"un listed\" amendments are not constitutionally protected amendments like the 1st amendment (for example) is.\n \n \nThere has, of course, been much argument among later Supreme Court justices and constitutional theorists about the scope and meaning of this amendment. And until about 40 years ago, the amendment was hardly used in litigation or in the rulings of the justices. But in the Griswold decision, Justice Goldberg, in his concurring opinion, pointed to the 9th amendment as the basis for the Court sustaining the right to privacy, which Goldberg said was one of the rights of the people that had not been enumerated in the bill of rights but which was nevertheless to be protected from government abrogation.\nIt was used a number of times and in every case the amendment means what I am saying it means. Even text books at the time taught it the way I mean it...as a federalism amendment.\n \n One only needs to look at what Madison said during the Bank of the United States speech to understand the 9th amendment.",

And your claim that it exits to prevent government from taking away people's rights is simply not true given the fact that the document lists several instances under which those rights may be infringed.\n\n \n The constitution was created mainly to establish a federal government that actually worked. But Madison and the other framers sought, as I said earlier, to balance power and liberty. They regarded the Articles as having allowed an excess of liberty. But Madison also wrestled with how to create a strong national government that would not trample on the people's liberties. (Some borrowed from the classical republican tradition to argue that only in a small republic could the liberties of the people be safeguarded, but Madison rejected this. He proposed that only in a large republic could the liberties of the people be safeguarded, through the balancing of different and competing interests.)\n \n Les is right that the framers did concern themselves with safeguarding the liberties of the people. Madison was certainly concerned with this, and he believed that the separation of powers and federalism would achieve this. The antifederalists charged that this system was an insufficient safeguard, and they demanded that the framers add a bill of rights to the constitution. \n \n Your point, Phyllis, that the framers did not regard liberties as absolute is true. You note several provisions of the constitution that suggest this. On the other hand, the constitution does contain provisions to safeguard liberties, and this was a concern of the framers, especially in the context where the antifederalists were stridently demanding that liberties be protected. Throughout our constitutional history, the Supreme Court has sought to determine when a law or a policy that takes away liberties violates the rights of the people and is unconstitutional and when a law or a policy that takes away liberties is constitutional because it advances a legitimate state interest in protecting the people. \n \n There are really two issues that folks have raised here. (1) Are liberties absolute, according to the constitution and constitutional history? The answer to that is no, and the Supreme Court has not held that liberties, even those explicitly named in the Bill of Rights, are absolute. (2) What liberties or rights do the people have that the constitution protects? This is the more difficult question, because of Amendment 9. The constitution clearly protects the rights named in the Bill of Rights and in several subsequent amendments. But Amendment 9 says that there are other rights held by the people that the government may not take away. What are they? The constitution is silent. Who gets to determine what they are? Again the constitution is silent. Into that silence the Supreme Court has stepped and has, over time, determined that various specific rights are \"fundamental\" and cannot be taken away by legislative bodies. Does the constitution specifically grant the Supreme Court the power to make those determinations? No. Does the constitution bar the Supreme Court from making those determinations? No. \n \n It was actually Chief Justice Marshall who first stepped in to fill the constitutional silence by ruling that property rights are protected by the constitution. In the 19th century, especially the early 19th century, the greatest rights issues to come before the Supreme Court involved property rights, and the thorniest property rights issue involved the right to own slave property. In the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, other kinds of rights issues came before the Court and became Central in American life.",

   "Good. Elected judges are a bane to be avoided at all costs. They need to be independent of popular whim to do their job. That doesn't mean they aren't or shouldn't be swayed by public opinion, but they shouldn't be mere puppets to it. Like it or not, one of the functions of the courts is to protect minorities from the legislative whim of majorities. \ncan you show this to be true? The answer is no and I'd like to see otherwise (although truthfully that is what they are doing now but that begs the question).\n \n How can you say in one sentence the judges should be independent and in the very next say they should sometimes be swayed by public opinion and then in the next say they should protect the minority from the whims of the majority? You went from listen to no one to listen to the majority to listen to the minority.

If the government got rid of murder laws you would have a right to kill. \n \n This point is rather moot I'd say.\n \n \n \nThe Federalist papers are not instruments of government. The DoI is such an instrument, in effect, because it declared a rebellion of part of the state against the center. It's a document of state, if not an actual law, whereas the papers are merely published opinions. That's not to say the papers are irrelevant as to reading the intent of the founders, but I'd put the DoI first in establishing and interpreting rights. The original intent of the founders isn't always sacrosanct or applicable to modern life, but the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is.\nI'd have to disagree pretty strongly here.

My argument to you is that Madison DID intend the amendment to provide constitutional protection from federal  abrogation of rights not enumerated in the constitution. \nNo, the amendment was about federalism. So to the extent of which powers are limited to the federal government (and don't look at the powers they have today as the powers they are supposed to have) the federal government is not supposed to restrict beyond that. This, however, is not covered in the 9th amendment but rather the 10th...other than the 9th telling the federal government not to assume power you don't have in the constitution.\n \n \nThis is an issue that legal scholars have debated, actually.

He was not saying that the federal government could step in to prevent states from denying rights; he was saying that the federal government could not itself deny the people these other rights.\nThey may be debating it but Madison was very clear on the amendment and the reasoning from states for the amendment is even more clear. There was no debate until recent times about this. \n \n People look only at his speech in congress regarding this amendment and construe it to mean something it doesn't. Looking at his speech to the Bank of the United States and to letters to Jefferson along with text books at the time and court cases close to that time period indicate the amendment was without a doubt a federalism protection amendment as the 10th amendment is. Even the original drafts of this amendment and state submitted drafts indicate this to be true.\n \n \nJustice Goldberg articulated this in his concurring opinion in the Griswold case, which was one of the first modern cases to rely in part on the 9th amendment. His discussion of the 9th amendment there is clear and compelling, I think.\n I reject the Griswold decision as it is not using any facts whatsoever.\n \n The concurring opinion makes a similar argument to what you make. Goldberg states somewhat correctly that \"These statements of Madison and Story make clear that the Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights which the Constitution guaranteed to the people\". The last part I contend with as it already assumes the amendment means the constitution guarantees rights outside the constitution. It only guarantees they exist...not that they are protected by the constitution. This cannot be inferred from what Madison said in Congress either.\n \n Goldberg goes on to say \"To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever.\"\n \n This seems like an odd conclusion. The justice seems to contend that the 9th amendment mean that by saying something is not in the first 8 amendments that you are construing them to deny a right retained by a person. This point simply begs the question though as the justice assumes the rights are embedded somewhere in the first 8 amendments. In fact, it is almost ironic in that the justice construes the first 8 amendments to mean things they don't and then construes the 9th amendment to take away the peoples right to self government on this issue. And if the claim is that the right in question is not in the first 8 amendments then how could it be said you are construing those amendments to deny this right?\n \n I must say the logic does not follow to the conclusion Justice Goldberg comes up with.

Why was that?\n \n \nOn the other hand, the constitution does contain provisions to safeguard liberties, and this was a concern of the framers, especially in the context where the antifederalists were stridently demanding that liberties be protected.\n\n \n I have not suggested otherwise.\n \n \n(2) What liberties or rights do the people have that the constitution protects? This is the more difficult question, because of Amendment 9...But Amendment 9 says that there are other rights held by the people that the government may not take away.\n\n \n With respect, that is not what the 9th Amendment says at all. It says that the mere fact that certain rights were enumerated may not be interpreted to mean that there are, therefore, no other rights. It is a rule of interpretation. And contrary to your assertion here, Amendment 9 has nothing to say with respect to the questions of what those rights are, whether government may take those rights away, or if so, under what circumstances it may do so.\n \n And most certainly of all, Amendment 9 certainly does not give a license to judges to determine what rights not enumerated deserve Constitutional protection.\n \n \nWhat are they? The constitution is silent. Who gets to determine what they are? Again the constitution is silent. Into that silence the Supreme Court has stepped and has, over time, determined that various specific rights are \"fundamental\" and cannot be taken away by legislative bodies. Does the constitution specifically grant the Supreme Court the power to make those determinations? No. Does the constitution bar the Supreme Court from making those determinations? No.\n\n \n So we are back to the argument that those powers not expressly prohibited to the Supreme Court are thereby reserved to it? What a disaster that is. I raise my question again: what if Congress decided that it should operate on this principle. What if it decided that, since the word \"Armies\" is not explicitly defined in the Constitution, that the word \"Armies\" can therefore be construed to mean whatever Congress happens to decide at any given moment?\n \n \nIt was actually Chief Justice Marshall who first stepped in to fill the constitutional silence by ruling that property rights are protected by the constitution. In the 19th century, especially the early 19th century, the greatest rights issues to come before the Supreme Court involved property rights, and the thorniest property rights issue involved the right to own slave property. In the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, other kinds of rights issues came before the Court and became Central in American life.\n\n \n A Constitutional right to property can reasonably be ascertained simply by looking at the 5th Amendment. Without commenting on a specific case, a face value look at the document makes the claim that there are property rights in the Constitution a reasonable one.\n \n A general and relatively undefined right to privacy, however, cannot be said to reasonably stem from a face value look at the Constitution.",

   "If you have a standard for approaching the constitution that looks at original meaning then social whims will do much less damage if any. It is idiotic to say that since it might happen from time to time then we should just go ahead and make it acceptable.\n\n \n What we are dealing with here is the expansion of the concept of human morality. Society no longer regards gay people as immoral because they are gay. Therefore it is reasonable to expect courts to interpret the Constitution appropriately.\n \n \nIt seems you system of thinking is the one that needs no constitution. If a judge is the one that gets to decide what is or isn't \"constitutional\" then you have rendered the document rather useless.\n\n \n On the contrary, Steve. What is happening is that gay Americans, for the first time, are being brought within the framework of the Constitution, from which they had been excluded because society previously regarded them -- no, US -- as criminal or diseased. We aren't, and even judges are finally beginning to figure this out.\n \n Why would you object to this?\n \n \nI don't question judicial review....I only think you should review within the meaning of the constitution and not the meaning of the public that very day or what the justices mood is that day or what France thinks that day.\n\n \n This is what judges have been doing, given the developing consensus that gays are human beings with equal rights. Judges haven't driven this consensus; they have been following it, and pretty slowly at that. The Supreme Court isn't activist at all; it's pretty conservative, especially on gay rights.

   "The problem I have here is that your theory requires a significant jump that has not (in fact, can not) be substantiated by any facts in our history.\n\n \n Except Supreme Court rulings that for some reason you have problems with. I'm not arguing in a legal vacuum here. I just find the reasoning behind rulings such as Griswold and Lawrence persuasive. Privacy is protected -- if it isn't, why bother with a Constitution at all?\n \n \nThe exact theory I am referring to is the leap from the explicit claim that \"there are rights outside of the Constitution,\" to the inference that those rights are therefore protected by the Constitution.\n\n \n Again, if rights aren't protected by a Constitution, what is the point of one? Any monarch can establish a government. to establish a legitimate, representative and democratic one requires protection of rights against tyrannical majorities and government both. That is what the Constitution aspires to do -- it's not there merely to establish the mechanics of government, but also to set limits on government powers over individuals.\n \n \n It is a leap that requires justification, and I have not seen a reasonable defense of this claim.\n\n \n You didn't read Ohioprof's posts? I haven't as much legal or historical expertise, but they sounded pretty convincing.\n \n \nIn fact, a look at the text of the document as well as the history behind it suggests that non enumerated rights are not protected by the Constitution against legislative regulation.\n\n \n Legislation might regulate how a right is recognised. It cannot abrogate a right. The Constitution says legislation must respect such rights.\n \n \nOf course I have not even hinted at a personal wish that the judiciary had not evolved its powers of judicial review. But, even assuming your theory, I simply am not willing to say that the judiciary is better at protecting individual rights than the legislature is. In fact, a strong argument (based on historical evidence) can be made for the opposite view.\n\n \n Legislatures are famous for protecting the rights of people...? Sorry, Phyllis, but I just don't share your touching faith in politicians. I don't have much faith in judges, either, which is why I am content to see them set against each other.\n \n \nI have yet to see a basis on which to determine what a basic right is. You cite the Declaration of Independence. Well, that certainly is quite broad, and without an underlying philosophical theory, it is impossible to apply those broad declarations to a specific situation.\n\n \n That is one of your fair points, Phyllis, and I agree I have dodged it. I don't know how to define a basic right objectively in a way that everyone would agree with, and in mitigation, neither does anyone else. It's an issue that scholars far more erudite than you or I have been struggling with for generations, and we are not going to resolve it on a messageboard. Generally, I appeal to the Golden Rule, as it seems to underly much human philosophy, theology and jurisprudence.\n \n However, as a metaphysical point, I believe they do exist, and if we deny them, we become less empathetic, less human. It turns us into tyrants and torturers. I think that perhaps human rights might be better defined by describing when they are abrogated, rather than trying to set out what they are a priori.\n \n DADT is a denial of human rights. So were sodomy laws. Pragmatically speaking, I would say we can define a human rights violation when humans consistently protest against an unjust law that isn't concerned with the protection of other humans. We have to take their word for it. When gay people consistently claim that laws against marriage, or discrimination in the military are human rights violations, I think society needs to take that seriously.\n \n While I can't prove objectively that homosexuality is a basic right, I think you would not wish to live in a society that claimed sexual activity could be criminalised by government on some whim. That would be an infringement of your human rights.\n \n \nHow is a judge to decide what a basic right is? Should he look to the Bible? After all, we are endowed with rights by our Creator right? So must the judge look to the Bible in order to decide what a basic right is? Or perhaps the Koran?\n\n \n I agree, this is a good question. Rather than some scripture, which I have no patience for, I would ask the judge to look at the Golden Rule. Would he or she treat homosexuals the way he or she would want to be treated, or some different way? Does the judge feel he or she has any rights over his or her own body?\n \n \nNow, I know you and I disagree. And I know that I am unlikely to change your mind. But hopefully you can at least see where I'm coming from.\n\n \n And correspondingly, Phyllis, I hope you can understand my view. I put people over the law. However, I accept that the law cannot be changed on a whim, because that doesn't protect the people.\n \n However, my point is that we are not dealing with transient whims here; gay Americans are no longer seen as the moral, legal and mental pariahs that excluded them from constitutional protections. So what is the problem with including them now with everyone else?",

Here is what James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson about what he saw as the problem of trying to list rights that the constitution would then protect:\n \n \"there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude. I am sure that the rights of conscience in particular, if submitted to public definition would be narrowed much more than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power.'' 5 Writings of James Madison, 271-72 (G. Hunt ed. 1904).\n \n The constitution is silent about who should determine when the federal government has denied the people rights in a way that runs afoul of the constitution. That leaves such questions to be determined by the Supreme Court through judicial review, which the Supreme Court assumed as its primary duty with the ruling in Marbury v. Madison. Steeeve says that we can reasonably assume that \"judicial power\" meant judicial review, and most people at the time of Marbury v. Madison who were paying attention apparently agreed, as there was no significant outcry against the Supreme Court's practice of judicial review, though Thomas Jefferson seethed with anger over what he regarded as the Supreme Court's usurpation of power that he believed properly belonged to the legislative branch. \n \n You ask whether the constitution means that the powers not expressly denied to the Supreme Court are reserved to it. Our only guide in the constitution itself is Article III, which doesn't address this question specifically. However, since, in John Marshall's words, it is the duty of the court to say \"what the law is,\" then it is up to the Supreme Court to interpret the constitution and to determine when the rights of the people, reserved to them by the bill of rights including the 9th amendment and by the 14th amendment, have been violated by acts of government in violation of the constitution. The duty of judicial review leaves to the Supreme Court the proper role of making such determinations. Nothing in the constitution says that the Supreme Court must read the constitution as saying that rights are limited only to those enumerated. Indeed, the ninth amendment explicitly says the opposite of that. It is up to the Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review, to determine when the rights of the people have been violated in a way that is unconstitutional, and that means when any rights that have been violated, not just those that have been specifically enumerated. The 9th amendment supports this, as do the words of James Madison himself, who is the author of the 9th amendment. \n \n Steeeve argues for a limited reading of the 9th amendment, suggesting that Madison did not intend for the constitution to protect rights from federal abrogation not specifically enumerated in the constitution. I will argue that this interpretation is refuted by the words of Madison himself, which I have quoted. Madison said explicitly that he feared that if the constitution listed rights, the Congress would use this list to limit the scope of the people's rights and regard the rights of the people as more narrow than they are. \n He finally agreed to add a list of rights because of the promise made to the antifederalists and his pragmatic approach to getting a new constitution passed. He added the 9th amendment, according to Madison himself, in order to guarantee that the federal government would not extend its powers to deny rights not specifically enumerated.",

The legislature, under the state constitution, had to vote on the proposed constitutional amendment twice before it could go to the voters. They did not vote for the amendment in sufficient numbers, and so the issue did not go to the voters. They did exactly what the state constitution called for the legislature to do: vote on the proposed amendment. Not enough of them voted for the amendment. They followed the process called for in the Massachusetts constitution. \n \n The idea that the legislature somehow blocked the democratic process by not voting for the amendment twice is a fallacy being spun by the anti-gay marriage forces. First the opponents of same-sex marriage charged that \"unelected judges\" subverted the democratic process by declaring that gay couples have a right to marry under the state constitution and not allowing the legislative process to decide who can marry. Now the legislative process has been followed and the result is that gay couples can still marry. And of course the anti-same-sex marriage forces are whining that the legislature has subverted the democratic process, even though the legislature followed the process called for in the state constitution.\n \n People elect their legislators. If the people of Massachusetts are really so upset about the legislators' votes for same-sex marriage, they can elect other legislators. That's how the process works. \n \n I don't think it's clear at all that the voters would have supported the proposed constitutional amendment had the measure gone to them. Polls indicate that a majority of people in Massachusetts now support same-sex marriage. Of course that's poll data, not a vote.

   "Except Supreme Court rulings that for some reason you have problems with. I'm not arguing in a legal vacuum here. I just find the reasoning behind rulings such as Griswold and Lawrence persuasive. Privacy is protected -- if it isn't, why bother with a Constitution at all?\n\n \n I have no problem saying specific areas of privacy (if one really must call it that) are protected. That is obvious from the 4th Amendment. But consider this question: if the framers wanted to protect privacy generally (and I mean extremely generally), why would they write the 4th Amendment?\n \n There certainly is no evidence (and you have really not shown otherwise except to say that you happen to like it a certain way) to show that the 9th Amendment was a source of rights. That is to say, it has not been shown that the 9th Amendment, in declaring that other rights are retained by the people, that such declaration amounts to, \"those rights are also protected by the Constitution.\" But, even if such evidence existed, there certainly is not evidence granting judges the authority to decide what those rights are. \n \n \nAgain, if rights aren't protected by a Constitution, what is the point of one? Any monarch can establish a government. to establish a legitimate, representative and democratic one requires protection of rights against tyrannical majorities and government both. That is what the Constitution aspires to do -- it's not there merely to establish the mechanics of government, but also to set limits on government powers over individuals.\n\n \n I have not said that the Constitution does not protect rights. It most certainly does. But does it protect ALL natural rights? I do not think so.\n \n And an interesting thing about the Constitution is that the framers supposed themselves to have adequately protected individual rights by simply establishing the mechanics of government. That is, until the Anti-Federalists raised a huge stink about that.\n \n \nYou didn't read Ohioprof's posts? I haven't as much legal or historical expertise, but they sounded pretty convincing.\n\n \n I have been reading the Prof's posts. So far, there has not been any evidence presented that the acknowledgement that \"other rights are retained by the people\" was intended to be a declaration that \"those rights are secured by this Constitution.\" The argument really has amounted to \"the framers did not say that those rights weren't protected by the Constitution,\" which is an interesting tactic indeed.\n \n \nLegislation might regulate how a right is recognised. It cannot abrogate a right. The Constitution says legislation must respect such rights.\n\n \n The problem we have been discussing is what, specifically, are the rights that exist outside of the Constitution? That is going to be a question of vast disagreement and discussion.\n \n \nLegislatures are famous for protecting the rights of people...? Sorry, Phyllis, but I just don't share your touching faith in politicians. I don't have much faith in judges, either, which is why I am content to see them set against each other.\n\n \n Consider the legislative progression addressing slavery prior to the Dred Scott decision. Or, consider the Civil Rights reforms enacted by Congress which the Court tossed in 1883. Or, consider the social reform laws which Lochner struck down.\n \n I share your distrust of both politicians and judges. But if mistakes are to be made, I would much rather them be made by politicians (whose decisions I can easily change) than by judges (whose decisions I virtually cannot).\n \n \nThat is one of your fair points, Phyllis, and I agree I have dodged it. I don't know how to define a basic right objectively in a way that everyone would agree with, and in mitigation, neither does anyone else. It's an issue that scholars far more erudite than you or I have been struggling with for generations, and we are not going to resolve it on a messageboard. Generally, I appeal to the Golden Rule, as it seems to underly much human philosophy, theology and jurisprudence.\n \n However, as a metaphysical point, I believe they do exist, and if we deny them, we become less empathetic, less human. It turns us into tyrants and torturers. I think that perhaps human rights might be better defined by describing when they are abrogated, rather than trying to set out what they are a priori.\n\n \n I'm glad that you can see where someone might find this is troublesome. I for one find it hard to see how one can decide when a right has been infringed when there is no objective way to know what they are. This is precisely the problem, in my view.\n \n And an additional point that I would make is that judges are in the exact same boat as you and I on the question of defining what natural rights exist. They are no better situated to determine the answer to this question than anyone else.\n \n \nDADT is a denial of human rights. So were sodomy laws. Pragmatically speaking, I would say we can define a human rights violation when humans consistently protest against an unjust law that isn't concerned with the protection of other humans. We have to take their word for it. When gay people consistently claim that laws against marriage, or discrimination in the military are human rights violations, I think society needs to take that seriously.\n\n \n Of course, that is your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion. But suppose someone disagrees with you? Indeed, most of history has disagreed with you. \n \n I agree that society should take such claims seriously. But on the other hand, I do not necessarily think that all such claims are created equal. That is to say, it is not necessarily so that everyone claiming discrimination is having a human right violated.\n \n I applaud your effort here. It is hard to articulate what specific natural rights exist. Indeed, it is very hard. I am not here suggesting that I know any better than you on what specific rights exist (or even that I disagree with you). I am suggesting, however, that we collectively are better at answering these fundamentally difficult questions than judges are.\n \n \nWhile I can't prove objectively that homosexuality is a basic right, I think you would not wish to live in a society that claimed sexual activity could be criminalised by government on some whim. That would be an infringement of your human rights.\n\n \n Again, we seem to agree that what a human right is can be quite subjective. I have not said anything as to the question of what I think qualifies as a human right, or on what basis I would have to justify such claims. The interesting thing about my Constitutional approach (at least I think it is interesting) is that deciding what rights exist outside the Constitution and what theory is best is not needed for judicial decisionmaking.\n \n I, of course, have my own ideas about what natural rights exist, and on what basis they exist. But I tend not to get into such discussions because my theory of the Constitution does not require it.\n \n \nI agree, this is a good question. Rather than some scripture, which I have no patience for, I would ask the judge to look at the Golden Rule. Would he or she treat homosexuals the way he or she would want to be treated, or some different way? Does the judge feel he or she has any rights over his or her own body?\n\n \n This is an interesting principle to apply. Though I think if it were put into practice, it could produce some undesirable consequences.\n \n Suppose a convicted murderer appeals his conviction claiming that his fundamental human rights have been violated. If the judge were to exercise the Golden Rule, I suppose that he could side with the murderer on the grounds that, if he were in the murderer's shoes, he would not want to be executed.\n \n I am not trying to be argumentative. I am simply trying to bring up some points I think worth pondering.\n \n \nAnd correspondingly, Phyllis, I hope you can understand my view. I put people over the law. However, I accept that the law cannot be changed on a whim, because that doesn't protect the people.\n \n However, my point is that we are not dealing with transient whims here; gay Americans are no longer seen as the moral, legal and mental pariahs that excluded them from constitutional protections. So what is the problem with including them now with everyone else?\n\n \n I do understand your viewpoint, and I have tried to disagree respectfully. I happen to like discussing things with people I don't agree with.\n \n And simply for the sake of clarification, please do not try to infer anything about my own personal feelings merely from the constitutional theory I propose. I am not saying that you have done that. I am just stating it for you or any other would be readers who would find that clarification helpful. My discussion has not been that there is a problem with including gays with everyone else; I have merely been discussing, generally, that judges do not have authority to command such inclusion whatever its independent merits might be.",

   "Except that the words of Madison show that he never intended that the constitution protect only those rights that were listed or explicitly named. Here is what James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson about what he saw as the problem of trying to list rights that the constitution would then protect:\n \n \"there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude. I am sure that the rights of conscience in particular, if submitted to public definition would be narrowed much more than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power.'' 5 Writings of James Madison, 271-72 (G. Hunt ed. 1904).\n\n \n I don't think Madison's words show what you say they do. They certainly show he believed there to be other rights. But I have not seen any indication that shows that he either held the belief that non enumerated rights were protected by the Constitution (other than through the processes established of course), or that he believed judges were charged with the duty of enforcing non enumerated rights the same way they would enforce the enumerated rights.\n \n I'm really not trying to be a pest. You have gone to a great deal of trouble to cite the history. But I simply do not think the history backs up the \"non enumerated\" view of the Constitution.\n \n \nThe constitution is silent about who should determine when the federal government has denied the people rights in a way that runs afoul of the constitution. That leaves such questions to be determined by the Supreme Court through judicial review, which the Supreme Court assumed as its primary duty with the ruling in Marbury v. Madison. Steeeve says that we can reasonably assume that \"judicial power\" meant judicial review, and most people at the time of Marbury v. Madison who were paying attention apparently agreed, as there was no significant outcry against the Supreme Court's practice of judicial review, though Thomas Jefferson seethed with anger over what he regarded as the Supreme Court's usurpation of power that he believed properly belonged to the legislative branch.\n\n \n As I recall regarding Marbury v. Madison, there was some outcry at the State level. But, that aside, it seems that the above suggests that the Supreme Court granted itself the power to do this when it assumed judicial review. I do not think that the Supreme Court can grant itself powers, and this will go back to my distinction between power and authority. The important question for me is whether the Constitution was intended to grant judges this power. You say the Constitution is silent on this. It is. But we are not limited to explicit declarations. We have other tools, such as history, structure, etc. from which we can draw reasonable conclusions. I have said I believe those tools point in my direction.\n \n \nYou ask whether the constitution means that the powers not expressly denied to the Supreme Court are reserved to it. Our only guide in the constitution itself is Article III, which doesn't address this question specifically. However, since, in John Marshall's words, it is the duty of the court to say \"what the law is,\" then it is up to the Supreme Court to interpret the constitution and to determine when the rights of the people, reserved to them by the bill of rights including the 9th amendment and by the 14th amendment, have been violated by acts of government in violation of the constitution. The duty of judicial review leaves to the Supreme Court the proper role of making such determinations. Nothing in the constitution says that the Supreme Court must read the constitution as saying that rights are limited only to those enumerated. Indeed, the ninth amendment explicitly says the opposite of that. It is up to the Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review, to determine when the rights of the people have been violated in a way that is unconstitutional, and that means when any rights that have been violated, not just those that have been specifically enumerated. The 9th amendment supports this, as do the words of James Madison himself, who is the author of the 9th amendment.\n\n \n This, of course, leaves us with a government \"by the judges.\" I do not agree that this was intended. Of course, I still disagree with you on what the 9th Amendment means, and also on what the words of James Madison show.\n \n But that objection aside, we are still left with the question of how a judge is supposed to determine what is a natural right. So, in effect, it seems your position leaves us with a system under which 5 unelected and fairly unrepresentative individuals determine what rights we have. I disagree that the Constitution does this.\n \n An interesting aside to this is the unfortunate fact that under this theory, I can never know what rights I actually do have. It literally can change from day to day depending on what 5 individuals happen to think. If those 5 individuals decided it worthwhile to deprive me of my right to free speech, well, I have no claim against them. This seems to me to fly in the face of the Constitution and our history.",

   "I have not said that the Constitution does not protect rights. It most certainly does. But does it protect ALL natural rights? I do not think so.\n\n \n Let me fill out a couple of things. I do disagree with you there. The Constitution is not carte blanche for the government to override any rights that aren't enumerated whenever it suits it to do so. We need the judiciary because we cannot rely on the legislature.\n \n \nThe problem we have been discussing is what, specifically, are the rights that exist outside of the Constitution? That is going to be a question of vast disagreement and discussion.\n\n \n True, however, as long as the court errs in recognising rights as opposed to curtailing them, it will be acting in the spirit of the Constitution.\n \n \nI share your distrust of both politicians and judges. But if mistakes are to be made, I would much rather them be made by politicians (whose decisions I can easily change) than by judges (whose decisions I virtually cannot).\n\n \n I'd rather stop the politicians in their tracks. They can cause less damage that way. An independent judiciary can at least review laws impartially. In principle, at least, though I'd have to admit this current court is not impartial. Politicians, however, are never impartial.\n \n \nI'm glad that you can see where someone might find this is troublesome. I for one find it hard to see how one can decide when a right has been infringed when there is no objective way to know what they are. This is precisely the problem, in my view.\n\n \n I think it's not that difficult to see where rights have been infringed. You just have to look to see where the pain is. Of course, one can always turn a blind eye to pain and claim it doesn't exist because one doesn't feel it personally. I don't much care for that POV.\n \n \nAnd an additional point that I would make is that judges are in the exact same boat as you and I on the question of defining what natural rights exist. They are no better situated to determine the answer to this question than anyone else.\n\n \n Often they are better situated than politicians indebted to some interest group.\n \n \nOf course, that is your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion. But suppose someone disagrees with you? Indeed, most of history has disagreed with you. \n\n \n Most of history agreed with slavery and denied women the vote. Should we go with that? I think we can see where justice lies. When the law turns a blind eye to justice, that's reason for revolution. \n \n \nI agree that society should take such claims seriously. But on the other hand, I do not necessarily think that all such claims are created equal. That is to say, it is not necessarily so that everyone claiming discrimination is having a human right violated.\n\n \n It is in this case, unless you care to make an argument that denial of equal rights to gay people is not irrational and harmful discrimination. Do you make this argument?\n \n \nI applaud your effort here. It is hard to articulate what specific natural rights exist. Indeed, it is very hard. I am not here suggesting that I know any better than you on what specific rights exist (or even that I disagree with you). I am suggesting, however, that we collectively are better at answering these fundamentally difficult questions than judges are.\n\n \n I don't see how we are any better or worse situated than judges. And I do not trust \"collective\" wisdom, because that can lead to the tyranny of the majority, and often has done. There's plenty of room for judicial review of mob rule.\n \n We saw this in the Terri Schiavo case. Republican mob rule sought constantly to interfere; judicial review slapped them down over and over. The judges were right, and the legislature was wrong. Thank heavens for judges.\n \n \nAgain, we seem to agree that what a human right is can be quite subjective. I have not said anything as to the question of what I think qualifies as a human right, or on what basis I would have to justify such claims. The interesting thing about my Constitutional approach (at least I think it is interesting) is that deciding what rights exist outside the Constitution and what theory is best is not needed for judicial decisionmaking.\n\n \n Well, perception of what is or isn't a human right can be subjective, however, when a policy harms people, I think we can say it infringes their rights. It may be difficult to stipulate in advance what is a right, but when we see pain resulting from policy, we can conclude that rights are infringed.\n \n \nI, of course, have my own ideas about what natural rights exist, and on what basis they exist. But I tend not to get into such discussions because my theory of the Constitution does not require it.\n\n \n Well, this is a gay rights thread. I appreciate that people like to discuss the Constitution in abstract, legalistic terms, and more power to them. I, however, am interested in the real impact on real people. The law exists not to serve itself, but to serve people. When we lose track of that principle, the discussion loses meaning for me.\n \n \nSuppose a convicted murderer appeals his conviction claiming that his fundamental human rights have been violated. If the judge were to exercise the Golden Rule, I suppose that he could side with the murderer on the grounds that, if he were in the murderer's shoes, he would not want to be executed.\n\n \n I don't think this fully applies. A murderer has infringed someone else's right to life. That right has to be defended. The Golden Rule doesn't forbid the punishment of people who have injured others. The death penalty is a different issue, and should be prohibited not necessarily on the grounds of the golden Rule, but because absolute certainty in conviction is hard to come by.\n \n One can't compare gay love to murdering someone, in any case.\n \n \nI am not trying to be argumentative.

The legislature, under the state constitution, had to vote on the proposed constitutional amendment twice before it could go to the voters.

They did exactly what the state constitution called for the legislature to do: vote on the proposed amendment. Not enough of them voted for the amendment. They followed the process called for in the Massachusetts constitution. \n \n The idea that the legislature somehow blocked the democratic process by not voting for the amendment twice is a fallacy being spun by the anti-gay marriage forces. First the opponents of same-sex marriage charged that \"unelected judges\" subverted the democratic process by declaring that gay couples have a right to marry under the state constitution and not allowing the legislative process to decide who can marry. Now the legislative process has been followed and the result is that gay couples can still marry. And of course the anti-same-sex marriage forces are whining that the legislature has subverted the democratic process, even though the legislature followed the process called for in the state constitution.\n \n People elect their legislators.

That is certainly not something I am taking issue with. I don't think there is a question here of whether they followed correct process. This ultimately goes back to the question of whether gay marriage is something that should be voted on. The Massachusetts legislature felt it should not; many other states have felt it should. I find myself torn on this; I can certainly see why gay marriage proponents don't like the idea--I wouldn't want my marriage voted out of legality. Yet on one hand gay marriage proponents claim marriage is subject to change and evolution by society, but when society takes it up on whether to change it or not, they balk, not wanting society to touch it, saying it shouldn't be a voteable issue. In the end I think it best not to vote on these matters because I view amendments like this as an over-intrusion of the govt. into people's lives anyway. This issue of whether they followed correct process is a different one from whether or not their concerns of over the public voting for the amendment influenced their actions. Personally, I think it's a little naive to assume that the danger of the public voting for this amendment wasn't at least part of the motive to not let the public vote.

   "Steeeve argues for a limited reading of the 9th amendment, suggesting that Madison did not intend for the constitution to protect rights from federal abrogation not specifically enumerated in the constitution. I will argue that this interpretation is refuted by the words of Madison himself, which I have quoted. Madison said explicitly that he feared that if the constitution listed rights, the Congress would use this list to limit the scope of the people's rights and regard the rights of the people as more narrow than they are. \n You refer to the speech by Madison to Congress. All that shows is that Madison clearly didn't want the federal government to assume power they did not have. This is a far cry from saying they are therefore constitutional rights (as protected). \n \n \nHe finally agreed to add a list of rights because of the promise made to the antifederalists and his pragmatic approach to getting a new constitution passed. He added the 9th amendment, according to Madison himself, in order to guarantee that the federal government would not extend its powers to deny rights not specifically enumerated.\nagain, this doesn't mean they are protected by the constitution. In merely means you can't assume the power to deny it from the lack of mention in the constitution. If \"right\" in question, for example, dealt with interstate commerce then congress would have the power to regulate that. \n \n \nHere is a link to an essay by Randy Barnett, on Answers.com, that clearly explains the controversy that we have joined here over how to interpret the 9th amendment. Barnett discusses the two different schools of interpretation of this amendment. Steeeve is advocating one school of interpretation, while I am advocating the other school. Barnett explains the issues in a way that illuminates the heart of the controversy, I think:\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/amendme...on?cat=biz-fin\n He often argues against Kurt Lash who presents better evidence and rebuts the points made by Barnett.
