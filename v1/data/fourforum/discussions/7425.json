   "This is a very strange argument that seems to hinge on the use of the word 'support', or the phrase 'pro-troops'.\n I actually don't understand how it is possible to be either 'pro' or 'anti' troops in the same way that one can be pro-war or anti-war. These viewpoints are based on whether one thinks we have good reasons for the war, or that the war is a horrible mistake.\n However, the war is not just the troops, and the troops are not the war. The troops are human beings just like the rest of us, even though a small number seem to have become somewhat inhuman over recent years.\n I have complex feelings about the soldiers in Iraq, British, American or otherwise. I do not support the war, I believe it to be an ideological error on the part of politicians. I feel compassion for the troops out there, I do not want any of them to die, and now that we've gone ahead and done it I want them to do their jobs as effectively and safely as they can; I believe a total sudden pullout would be as disastrous as any worst case occupation scenario.\n I feel that the soldiers we have sent to Iraq are the victims of the politicians' and terrorists' wars just as much as the civilians who have died around the world in the last few years. I imagine that some soldiers have performed some heroic deeds, but some have made terrible mistakes, and grouping them all together as 'the troops' and demanding that people either be 'pro' or 'anti' doesn't make any sense to me, literally as well as emotionally.\n \n All I can say is that in the narrow, black-and-white spectrum of views exhibited by most of this forum on this particular issue, I would have to say I support the troops, but only insofar as I support most human beings who are not in direct control of their lives, members of the military and civilians embroiled in conflict being foremost among this category. \n However I do not believe in the ideology behind the war, and do not believe our leaders' rhetoric concerning the war.\n I do not see how it can be misunderstood that these two views are irreconcilable.",

You've chosen to look at one minor aspect of being anti-war, the fact that it could possibly have some impact on morale, and pretend that outweighs every other consideration. If the troops have to suffer a dip in morale now so that they won't have to die in some hellhole for no good reason later, then that's the way it has to be. It would be great if we could tell the administration that their war policies are stupid and have it have no impact on troop morale, but if we can't we can't. Getting Bush to stop spending our soldiers lives for his own political gain is the important thing, and if we have to hurt their feelings briefly to save their lives than so be it.\n \n \n\n Supporting a constant one-sided media drumbeat that mostly just questions what they're doing, as well as only reporting the bad news of their work and rarely ever their successes, yeah you're anti-troops.\n\n And now you're just making stuff up.

You're taking every person who ever said anything against the war and glomming them together into one big composite \"liberal\", and assigning that composite whichever traits you like least from the members you used to construct it.
