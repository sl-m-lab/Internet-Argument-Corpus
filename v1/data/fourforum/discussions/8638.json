   "After the end of military operation of Georgian Army in Kodor gorge the official Tbilisi has begun full-fledged construction works at the territory of the gorge. Well, all began with decision about prompt widening of local runway for the aircraft because small airplanes can't land there in winter. The construction of military sites began at the same time.\n To all appearances Georgians are continuing to prepare for US planed war against Iran. Americans will be able to use this runway as a reserve. Among military objects which are being built in Kodor gorge they will get a chance to choose among prison, hospital and mortuary. And of course some part of prisoners of war from the Middle East will be sent here. It's well-known that such group of buildings were created in Gori, place near South Ossetian boarder. \n It's clear that Tbilisi will use it in case of soon beginning of military operation against Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And the war against Iran is not far away; I think that Israel will get approval from Washington for revenge against Iran for its Hezbollah support.",
