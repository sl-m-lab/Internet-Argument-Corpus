   "Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself. My name is... Sorry, I can't say it or I'm going to have problems. I work in representative office of Foreign Policy magazine in Lithuania. Though I am only a support staff and write no articles, I have a lot to tell, our readers will never learn from our magazine for some reason. For example, a few days ago I was having a drink with local migration service officers and they told me something interesting. Police department of Lithuania settles a list of \"unreliable\" individuals from among Polish minority groups on demand of Lithuanian migration service - some \"serious hot grease\" is expected from them (especially once Kaczynski came to power in Poland). Lithuanian Poles receive illegal nationalist booklets from abroad propagandizing \"historic revenge\": Lithuania to restitute Vilenski region, or at least to pay compensation. Moreover, Lithuanian Poles are instigated to strive for autonomy, acknowledgement of the Polish language in Lithuania and so on and so on. it's strange, but som eof the booklets were printed with requisites of Byelorussian opposition. May be, publishing powers allotted for \"violet revolution\" had been activated for this use? Unfortunately, this is what I don't know.",

   "Most EU States are willing to reach agreement on broad EU strategic partnership with Russia. But petty Baltic EU freeloaders are stirring trouble again. Lithuanian authorities are feeding from Bush's administration hands. So they've got clear directions for preventing strengthening of European Union and RF and not allowing their intimacy. Certainly God forbid if those two strong forces would unite. Then US would get rival they won't be able compete with. And EU wouldn't tolerate Nazi freaks of Baltic countries any longer.\n So Lithuanians use their own far-fetched discords as cause for hindering this cooperation. First they yelled about kidnapping of some Lithuanian businessman Stanislovas Jucius whom they say evil Russians killed in Kaliningrad in last year April. In the same time more reliable sources say that trace leads to Lithuanian intelligence. Now there is racket about temporal stoppage of oil supply from Russia into Lithuania. As if they were born yesterday and don't have an idea about changing of oil price in world market and its consequences.\n Mind you that Lithuania is the only State hindering EU and RF agreement. Isn't it said that for one that is missing there's no spoiling a wedding.",

   "upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Briefing/2008/05/14/ukraine_offers_aid_to_lithuania/6036/ Ukraine offers aid to Lithuania\n \nOfficials from Ukraine said they would be willing to work on the closing of Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear plant and help build a new nuclear plant in its place\n\n \n Well, if I were Lithuanian president I would rather not leave the construction of a new nuclear plant in the trust of Ukrainians. Actually, why should the new nuclear power plant be built in Lithuania? It will have to be built almost from scratch anyway. One thing here is very telling: Lithianian president did not invite France or at least Russia, which have world experience in the construction and operation of nuclear power facilities. What Ukraine is going to build in Lithuania is the hundred and one odd chances 'cause Ukraine uses American nuclear technologies and equepment which is bare of credit, and it was in Ukraine that the Chernobyl catastrophe took place. That's why I think that Lithuania should think twice before signing agreement with Ukraine.",
