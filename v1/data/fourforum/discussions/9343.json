   "3 uncalled to think..\n \n Three on wantons decoy as watch, close and complete. Ritual calculations are poor. Once I dress in green, I got my marks in thinking.\n But as green origins marks become bad I got the panics to lose to my lucks in whole.\n \n Add to more in facts I belong to no party. I am Hong Kong secular. I also admit for not very good to both on green or blue.\n \n What I watch for wanton getting ritual calculations is poor.\n \n Second uncalled wantons get my passes away aunt. She got the close to dragon pulses by breathing dragon gas and she live in simple house although she is rich and got several large houses..\n \n Lastly complete wantons get in voodoo. They feed by people meats as great and full. They eat the flesh and drink the bloods of others for longer lives and much to more on lucks.\n \n \n Add a sum not only Jesus, we are all A-frames after we get our birth.\n \n Other wanton right to watch are sexy starlets.\n Other wantons right to closed are fortunes.\n Other wantons right to complete are powers.\n \n What a sexy A-Frame we are.\n \n Bear in minds and bore in steels your slates should clean.\n Outer steps to 3 uncalled thinking get by psycho dramas get by felt about truths.\n \n You get your tickets sat on front as close or dressed and beauty circles as watching take you're a-Frames.\n Or you are bloody actors.\n \n Donkey works uncalled to give.\n Do not blame on ways of balls on black, if you are red in china.\n \n Expiated on expiry dates may there.\n My donuts are yellow.\n All agree to good.\n I love India carpets and red in must.\n But china red mulch panned by all to some.\n Teach the deer to fence the world. A he china world may set up.\n \n Merger pushy annex our courts.\n Mulct in red and hands are favor.\n ---------Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3---------",
