Incidentally he was also placed on the \"mountain of God\". The mountain of God is also known as Mount Zion, known today as the Temple Mount. Eden was inside of the first Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n \n You really are pathetic pinhead, as well as epically ignorant just as I suggested in my original post in response to your Op which I quoted for effect. Here's a link to the biblically accurate commentary which explains Ezekiel 28 with historical and scriptural authority. Not that you'll understand or comprehend any of it, but here goes anyway. Read it and weep.\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Commentaries - Chuck Smith - Transcriptions for the C2000 Series\n The rebuke of the king of Tyre in chapter 28:\n \n The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the throne of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thy heart as the heart of God (Eze 28:1-2):\n \n Now immediately this causes us to think of Second Thessalonians, chapter 2, where it declares that the antichrist is going to come and stand in the temple of God and declare that he is God and demand to be worshipped as God in the last days. So the prince of Tyrus becomes an interesting type of the antichrist, declaring himself to be God and setting himself up as a god. Now this indeed did happen. The king of Tyrus assumed the god role and proclaimed himself to be God and began to demand the worship of the people.\n \n Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel (Eze 28:3);\n \n That is what he was saying of himself, that he was wiser than Daniel. Of course, it is interesting that again Daniel is mentioned who was a contemporary to Ezekiel. And already Daniel's fame was no doubt being spread abroad, and probably because of his interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream. That probably brought Daniel to instant fame and recognition, because after he had interpreted the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar made him one of the chief counselors for the Babylonian kingdom. And so Daniel's fame, especially, of course, among the children of Israel, had spread abroad.\n \n So Ezekiel, who was a contemporary to Daniel, lived at the same time in Babylonian captivity, makes mention of Daniel, not only here but in other passages. And here the wisdom of Daniel is referred to.\n \n With thy wisdom and with thy understanding you have gotten riches, you've gotten gold and silver into your treasury: And by thy great wisdom and by your trafficking [that is, the merchandising] you have increased your riches and your heart is lifted up because of your riches (Eze 28:4-5):\n \n The Bible tells us that it's hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Then it qualifies it and says, \"How hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" Jesus said, \"It's easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 19:24). The Bible says that they that will be rich will fall into divers temptations or lust which drown men's souls in perdition. But again the Bible says, \"If riches increase, just don't set your heart upon them.\"\n \n Now that was the problem with the king of Tyrus, his heart was set upon his riches. He was increased with riches and his heart was lifted up because of his riches.\n \n Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because you have set your heart as the heart of God; Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, and the awesome of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am a god? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD (Eze 28:6-10).\n \n And so his destruction is predicted. And though he declares himself to be God, when the enemy comes over the wall, you're not going to move him to thinking that you are God. You'll die like a man.\n \n Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD (Eze 28:11-12);\n \n Now, at this point there is a switch and we go behind the scenes and God is now addressing Himself unto Satan. And this is probably one of the most graphic descriptions of Satan that exists in the Bible. And he isn't, contrary to popular notion, wearing a red suit, holding a pitchfork and having a forked tail. And some evil sinister-looking creature with pointed ears and a goatee.\n \n Thou sealest up the sum (Eze 28:12),\n \n It means you are the sum total. You've got it altogether. You are the sum total.\n \n you are full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. You have been in Eden the garden of God (Eze 28:12-13);\n \n Yes, he was there and was talking to Eve and tempting her to eat of that fruit that God had forbidden.\n \n every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, gold: and the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that you were created (Eze 28:13).\n \n So here is a description of Satan prior to his... of course, prior to his fall, after his fall, he had been in Eden, but every precious stone is covering and all.\n \n And there are some who say that Satan is the author of music because of \"the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.\" And so that Satan is the author of music. I think that that is just stretching the point beyond breaking. I can't stand that type of biblical exposition that takes a verse like this and then builds an entire case from it. And how that music is evil because Satan was the originator of music because he was the one with the tabrets and pipes and so forth. And so that music is satanic in its origin and all and that he is the master over music. That's stretching scripture; it's taking it out of context. It is taking one verse and just blowing it beyond its intent and beyond what it declares. And yet, there are those foolish and ignorant men who will take some kind of a passage like this and try to make a big discourse out of it and a big theory and come down on all kinds of musical instruments and everything else. Of course, some book has been written lately against rock music and saying it's of Satan and this is the scripture that proves it. If they can find proof of that in this scripture then they have done phenomenal bit of scriptural jugglery.\n \n Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth (Eze 28:14);\n \n Now he was an anointed cherub. A cherub, of course, is an angel. Cherub is singular; cherubim is plural. Now we find in the scriptures that there are the four cherubim that are about the throne of God, plural, of cherubs. Satan once, no doubt, dwelt there near God in the heavenly scene. In fact, he would seem to have had a very high standing at one time. So high that when Michael was contending against, having respect for the position that Satan once held in high authority in the heavenly scene, Michael did not bring any railing accusation against him when they were disputing over the body of Moses, but Michael just said, \"The Lord rebuke you.\" Satan did have an extremely high position prior to his fall in the heavenly kingdom. \"The anointed cherub that covereth.\"\n \n I have set thee so: you were upon the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. And you were perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee (Eze 28:14-15).\n \n Now, here is what makes Satan not the opposite of God. \"You were perfect in all of your ways from the day that you were created.\" But Satan was a created being. God is self-existent. He has always been. Satan was created. So that it is wrong for us in our minds to think of Satan as the opposite of God. He opposes God, but he in no wise is the opposite of God. And we ascribe to Satan much more power and much more than what he actually is if you think of him as the opposite of God. And thus, we should never consider or think of Satan in the terms of the opposite of God. God stands alone in the universe. The infinite, eternal God. There is nothing to compare with in likenesses or opposites. He is alone. The eternal God.\n \n Satan was a created being, an anointed cherub. If he is the opposite, or to be thought of as the opposite, it might be of Michael or of Gabriel, these two angels that seem to have much authority and power in heaven, who remain true unto God. But never think of Satan as the opposite of God. You're ascribing much more to him than what actually is. And that is dangerous.\n \n He was perfect until the day that iniquity was found in him. What is the iniquity that was found in him? If you turn back to Isaiah chapter 14, Isaiah gives us a little insight into this iniquity that was found in Satan. Verse 12, chapter 14 Isaiah, \"How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer, son of the morning. How art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations. For thou hast said in thy heart,\" here is the iniquity, \"In your heart you said, 'I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the Most High.'\"\n \n The five \"I wills.\" And that is the exercise of my will against the authority of God. \"I will exalt myself. I will sit in the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the stars. I will be like the Most High.\" In one of Shakespeare's plays there is that phrase, \"Flee ambition, for by this sin the angels fell.\" Satan's ambitious plans against God's authority, \"I will, I will.\"\n \n So up until that point, he had been a model, perfect in all of his ways. \"Until iniquity was found in thee.\"\n \n And by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. For thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before the kings, that they may behold thee (Eze 28:16-17).\n \n Now going back again to Isaiah 14, it's an interesting thing that when we look upon Satan, and one day you will have a chance to look at him, and when you do, you'll be astonished. Verse 15 of chapter 14 Isaiah, \"Yet,\" you said I'm going to be like the Most High, \"yet, thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying, 'Is this the man that made the earth to tremble and did shake kingdoms?'\" Wow, is that the one that gave me such a bad time? Wow! \"So I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee.\" It's gonna be an awesome experience, an awesome sight when that day comes.\n \n Now the question, of course, does remain: when did God create Satan? And when did Satan fall? Now his fall, no doubt, came before his coming into the Garden of Eden to tempt Eve. Therefore, I would have to conclude that his fall came before Genesis chapter 1, verse 3, which speaks of God beginning the re-creative processes saying, \"Let there be light.\" And the fact that darkness covered the face of the deep. God is light; in Him is no darkness at all. That darkness that enshrouded the world must have been satanic in its origin, as he is the prince of darkness.\n \n Now, there is what is known as a gap theory. Of late there has been an endeavor to more or less discredit the gap theory. But I still hold it open in my own mind as a very viable option. One of the chief verses that they use to destroy the gap theory is when God gave the law. He said, \"For six days shalt thou do thy labor and the seventh day thou shalt rest. For in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and all that is in them, and on the seventh day God rested.\" And taking that in a very literal, narrow sense, it would mean that the creation days did take place somewhere around six thousand years ago or six to ten thousand years ago. And thus, the whole universe is only six to ten thousand years old, and we can't really prove that this position is wrong. It is quite possible it is.\n \n You say, \"Well, how do you explain then the fossils? And the dating processes that show that the earth is millions of years, or whatever.\" And of course, there is, number one, the challenging of the dating methods, which is a legitimate challenge, because a part of that lava flow from Kilauea in Hawaii that big flow in 1973 was taken to three different laboratories that have their specialty of dating processes through the carbon argon and so forth. And the three laboratories taking these samples from the 1973 flow of Kilauea came up with age dates of anywhere from 180 million years to 250 million years old. And yet, it was chipped right out of the flow of 1973. So there is reason to question and challenge the accuracy of the dating methods, because in dating, you have to assume that there was so much argon in the beginning. And this assumption is made, and so much lead in the beginning an all, and those are assumptions that we really don't know.\n \n The second argument is how old was Adam the day God created him? You say, \"Well, he was a day old.\" Well, then did he have teeth? How big was he? So that when God created Adam, there were, no doubt, what we would call age-dating factors built in. So that if you looked at Adam the day that God created him, you'd probably say, \"Well, he must be thirty years old at least. Look at the skeleton development, the muscular development, look at the teeth and all. Well, he must be thirty years old.\" So that God created him not as an infant, but as a man with age-dating factors. Now, of course, we know God could do anything, so that God could have created the earth with fossils already in its structure. With age-dating factors there, if He so chose to do so. Now, the problem that I see with this using... for in six days, God created the heaven and the earth and all that is in them, the problem I see with that is that that would have to then include Satan and when did God then create Satan in this six-day creation period, you see. And then when did Satan fall? And how is it that he got into the Garden of Eden so early.\n \n Now, the gap theory, which I do feel has a great deal of credence and is probably best set out by Pember in his book Earth's Earliest Ages. Take Genesis 1 as an account of original creation. \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\" In the beginning, whenever that was. How many billion years ago, there is no date. No estimate. And that the earth perhaps was a part of Satan's kingdom as the anointed cherub that covered. And in a beautiful mineral kingdom upon the earth, until the day that iniquity was found in him and he was destroyed and cast out. And at that time, the earth became wasted and desolate and darkness covered the face of the deep. And that what you have then in Genesis from verse 3 on is the re-creation of the earth, in order that man might inhabit it in his present form. But what types of animals, creatures that are all there in the fossil record could have existed in the billions of years prior to Genesis verse 3, chapter 1. And thus, all of the ages would be all accounted for, because we don't know when the original creation took place. And there are viable arguments, and of course, the fact that Satan came along so early; he had already fallen to tempt Eve, and that there was darkness over the face of the deep and all. All tend to give credence to this gap theory and that the earth was somehow disheveled and destroyed at Satan's rebellion in sin against God.\n \n And a literal reading of verse 2 can read, \"but the earth became wasted and desolate.\" And it is not consistent with God's creative acts to create something wasted and desolate. When God creates it, He creates it perfect. God saw the light that it was good. God saw the land that it was good. God saw the animals; they were good. It isn't consistent with God to create something wasted and desolate, without form and void. So there are some arguments, very powerful arguments for the gap theory, and I have not in my own mind totally set it aside as not worthy of consideration. I think that it has some very worthy points, and thus I have no firm set in my own mind as far as creation is concerned. It's still an open chapter, an open file, and I await further information.\n \n I know that God could have created the whole thing just ten thousand years ago, six thousand; I have no problem with that. But I also realize it could have been billions of years ago, and that between Genesis 1 and 2 you have a long gap, at which time somewhere in there Satan was created and Satan fell and rebelled against God, and the whole system was brought into a chaotic state. The earth became wasted and desolate, with form and void and all. So, you can't be dogmatic in my mind on these things, though I know many people are dogmatic on it.\n \n Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of the traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee (Eze 28:18).\n \n Satan will ultimately be cast into the lake that is burning with fire, and this is the reference to it here. Right now Satan has great liberties. God has allowed him these liberties. They are liberties within boundaries. Satan works within prescribed boundaries that God has placed upon him.\n \n When he came to God concerning Job, he said, \"You've put a hedge around him. I can't touch him.\" God put the boundaries upon Satan, the perimeters in which he can work. As far as I'm concerned, he still has too much liberty. When Jesus comes again and establishes the kingdom of God upon the earth, Satan will at that point be bound and placed into the abusso, the bottomless pit, where he will stay for almost a thousand years. Right out towards the end of that thousand-year period, he'll be released again for a short season to deceive people and to create a rebellion against the Lord, that the Lord might be righteous when He makes the final judgment. For there will be those who will have been born during the Kingdom Age or those who have lived into the Kingdom Age who have never really made a real commitment of the their lives to Jesus Christ, will have to live righteously by force during the Kingdom Age. But towards the end, they'll be given their opportunity to express what has been in their heart the whole time--the rebellion against God that is there. And then at the culmination of this final rebellion, Satan will be cast into the Gehenna, the lake burning with fire, and there the final judgment of God upon him as is expressed here.\n \n All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more (Eze 28:19).\n \n No more freedom, liberty, anything else.\n \n The judgment of Sidon now. He turns from Tyre, from the prince of Tyre, to this sister city of Sidon up the coast.\n \n And again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD. And they shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD (Eze 28:20-24).\n \n Notice there is nothing said about ultimate destruction or complete destruction or never be rebuilt. Sidon still exists on the ancient site of the city of Sidon, and it's still a city there to the present day.\n \n Verse 25, God speaks now of the regathering of His people Israel.\n \n Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel [speaking of the present day] from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen (Eze 28:25),\n \n Now that is not yet come. That will take place when the invading Russian army is destroyed.\n \n Then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God (Eze 28:25-26).\n \n That's, of course, going on into the Kingdom Age when God has finally brought His judgment upon all of the nations for the treatment that they have given to the Jews.\n So, Chapter 28 is making a correlation between the King of Tyre in the first half and Satan in the second half. There is more of course but the point is it isn't about Adam's eviction from the Garden of Eden at all, nor about the evils of capitalism in any way. The very suggestion reveals your bigotry and prejudice against Gods word and His value system. \n \n Oh, and by the way, you can't possibly describe or encapsulate any chapter of any book in the bible with one small paragraph and hope to accurately capture it. So in the future, before starting a thread which asserts the bible contradicts itself, at least understand the material first, ok?",

And it was so. 8 God called the vault \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day.\n \n 9 And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. \n 11 Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day.\n \n 14 And God said, \"Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. 16 God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day.\n \n 20 And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.\" 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" 23 And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day.\n \n 24 And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. \n 26 Then God said, \"Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\"\n \n 27 So God created mankind in his own image, \n in the image of God he created them; \n male and female he created them.\n \n 28 God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" \n 29 Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. \n 31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day.Genesis 2\n \n 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.\n \n 2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\n \n Adam and Eve\n \n 4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.\n 5 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth[a] and no plant had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, 6 but streams[b] came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 7 Then the LORD God formed a man[c] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.\n \n 8 Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 9 The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n \n 10 A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. 11 The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin[d] and onyx are also there.) 13 The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.[e] 14 The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n \n 15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.\"\n \n 18 The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\"\n \n 19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.\n \n But for Adam[f] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs[g] and then closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib[h] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.\n \n 23 The man said,\n \n \"This is now bone of my bones \n and flesh of my flesh; \n she shall be called 'woman,' \n for she was taken out of man.\"\n \n 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\n \n 25 Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.\n \n The fact is that all of you atheists have no interest at all in what is true and you prove this in every post by focussing on lies and perversions of the truth.

And you are offering no real rational evidence to the contrary; just innuendo and speculation based on your own personal prejudices. In chapter 1 it states an end result, chapter 2 gives details as to the events themselves. There is no factual contradiction or misstatement of the facts at all. \n \n \n Who says I am an atheist? I just do not take the bible as truth it must be questioned just as any ancient book being written by people who knew nothing of the world and had to make up stories to explain existence.\n\n \n Claiming a belief in God while denying the most basic truths regarding Him and His value system makes you a religious poser at best and massive hypocrite at worst. I suggest you are both since you reject Gods morality as well as the very foundational beliefs of our very creation with your incendiary and blasphemous accusations.\n \n You claim as a homosexual, that the multiple Old and New Testament references to homosexuality being an abomination to God must necessarily mean that the bible is inspired by Mens prejudices rather than by Gods morality giving you the justification to reject any other parts that don't meet with your particular personal preferences. \n \n The only problem with your subjective reasoning is that the bible was either inspired by the Lord, a Liar or a Lunatic. It is either all correct or it is all a lie. We aren't offered the freedom to pick and choose what we will accept and believe in Gods Word. By you picking and choosing what you will believe you are in fact bringing God down to the level of a flawed humanity and calling Him a liar since you will argue that some of what He purports to be true in His word is in fact a lie. \n \n You must live with the consequences of that disbelief Matthew whether you like it or not you will be held responsible for calling God a liar. Here's what I mean Matt, if you have any wisdom at all you will take these words to heart.\n \n  Hebrews 4:12-13 enforces the claim of the Word to sovereignty and absolute authority:\n \n \"For the word of God [is] quick [alive], and powerful, [effective - vindicating itself] and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\"\n \n Also:\n \n \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\" Matthew 24:35.\n \n Between these two passages it is made clear that in addition to Gods word being the absolute and eternal truth, it is also the final arbiter and discerner of the condition of our hearts condition. It is the eternal truths in Gods word that will convict you of your lack of faith in Him in life as you are confronted with His holy nature on that final day. You will clearly understand that you were guided by your lusts of the flesh rather than Gods truth when you rejected His value system because it conflicted with your preferred sinful lifestyle.",

   "You really are pathetic pinhead, as well as epically ignorant just as I suggested in my original post in response to your Op which I quoted for effect. Here's a link to the biblically accurate commentary which explains Ezekiel 28 with historical and scriptural authority. Not that you'll understand or comprehend any of it, but here goes anyway. Read it and weep.\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Commentaries - Chuck Smith - Transcriptions for the C2000 Series\n [INDENT]The rebuke of the king of Tyre in chapter 28:\n \n The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the throne of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thy heart as the heart of God (Eze 28:1-2):\n \n .....\n \n\n I cut out a large portion as it takes up space and is a waste to keep repeating it. Besides the person you used is doing nothing more than ignoring the obvious and desperatly trying to make something out of nothing. The passges are about the king of Tyre not Satan, not Adam or a young earth creation. He can't even figure out who is speaking and of whom is being spoken of, contradicting himself by the second paragraph. \n \n \n .......\n \n \nSo, Chapter 28 is making a correlation between the King of Tyre in the first half and Satan in the second half. There is more of course but the point is it isn't about Adam's eviction from the Garden of Eden at all, nor about the evils of capitalism in any way. The very suggestion reveals your bigotry and prejudice against Gods word and His value system. \n\n \n Actually he is in a sense speaking of capitalism, but the results of abusing the concept and not the idea itself, but still no Satan just as with capitalism he is talking about the King having gone from good to bad.\n \n \n \nOh, and by the way, you can't possibly describe or encapsulate any chapter of any book in the bible with one small paragraph and hope to accurately capture it. So in the future, before starting a thread which asserts the bible contradicts itself, at least understand the material first, ok?\n\n \n I would suggest you pay closer attention to your references before you chastise someone while doing the same thing",

In chapter 1 it states an end result, chapter 2 gives details as to the events themselves. There is no factual contradiction or misstatement of the facts at all. \n\n \n Nonsense In genesis 1 god creates a man and a woman in genesis 2 the man is alone and God recreates a woman. If what you say is true then genesis 1 should be 2 and 2 should be 1\n \n\n Claiming a belief in God while denying the most basic truths regarding Him and His value system makes you a religious poser at best and massive hypocrite at worst. I suggest you are both since you reject Gods morality as well as the very foundational beliefs of our very creation with your incendiary and blasphemous accusations.\n\n \n I don't now or ever have rejected God. I reject his azzzhole anti gay bigoted idjit followers who wrote a antigay bigoted misogynistic fairy tale book. The lack of respect for a book does not mean a disbelieve in God. God is not the bible.\n \n \n\n You claim as a homosexual, that the multiple Old and New Testament references to homosexuality being an abomination to God must necessarily mean that the bible is inspired by Mens prejudices rather than by Gods morality giving you the justification to reject any other parts that don't meet with your particular personal preferences. \n \n The only problem with your subjective reasoning is that the bible was either inspired by the Lord, a Liar or a Lunatic. It is either all correct or it is all a lie. We aren't offered the freedom to pick and choose what we will accept and believe in Gods Word. By you picking and choosing what you will believe you are in fact bringing God down to the level of a flawed humanity and calling Him a liar since you will argue that some of what He purports to be true in His word is in fact a lie. \n \n You must live with the consequences of that disbelief Matthew whether you like it or not you will be held responsible for calling God a liar. Here's what I mean Matt, if you have any wisdom at all you will take these words to heart.\n \n  Hebrews 4:12-13 enforces the claim of the Word to sovereignty and absolute authority:\n \n \"For the word of God [is] quick [alive], and powerful, [effective - vindicating itself] and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\"\n \n Also:\n \n \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\" Matthew 24:35.\n \n Between these two passages it is made clear that in addition to Gods word being the absolute and eternal truth, it is also the final arbiter and discerner of the condition of our hearts condition. It is the eternal truths in Gods word that will convict you of your lack of faith in Him in life as you are confronted with His holy nature on that final day. You will clearly understand that you were guided by your lusts of the flesh rather than Gods truth when you rejected His value system because it conflicted with your preferred sinful lifestyle.\n\n \n You have no idea what it is to hear Gods voice or see His face. You are locked into a book and have put God in a box. You have no idea. You live by the law you will die by the law.",

   "27 So God created mankind in his own image, \n in the image of God he created them; \n male and female he created them.\n \n 18 The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\"\n \n But for Adam[f] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs[g] and then closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib[h] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.[/B]\n \n 2:18 contradicts 1:27 It makes no logical sense. If God created mankind both male and female equally at the same time why did he find it necessary to create a suitable helper in 2:18. However if you put in Lilith it makes sense. Adam demnded Lilith to submit to him in all things. Lilith refused to submit to Adam because she was an equal creation with Adam and refused to have anything to do with Adam. So when God moved Adam to the garden Adam was alone so God created Eve out of Adam so that she would submit to him. \n \n \n \n Who says I am an atheist? I just do not take the bible as truth it must be questioned just as any ancient book being written by people who knew nothing of the world and had to make up stories to explain existence.\n\n \n I am sorry but I think it is hysterical that when God went to find a helper for the man he made all the birds and fish and finally livestock first and when he couldn't get Adam to agree to a horse or a sheep then he put him to sleep and made woman from his bone. So men are mud people and women are mud people bone people and as for equal there wasn't a living creature God made that didn't come before Eve. Hardly a good start for a young couple.",

You are invariably referring to Islam, Judaism and Christianity being those three religions that believe in only one God. Well, yours is a typically corrupted world view which I reject whole heartedly as true and accurate.\n \n Islam is a cult which picked and chose principles from Judaism and Christianity a full 500 years after Christ lived and died for the sins of Man.

Of this irrefutable fact NO born again believers disagree, anywhere.\n \n \nThe bible is true because the bible clearly states it is true. \n\n \n Yes, that is correct. And since it is the actual inspired word of our Creator/Father God, the Holy Spirit convicts us of that Truth if we humble ourselves before Him. It is the only written authority deemed worthy to state its truthfulness and supremacy as the source of absolute truth on Earth.\n \n \n Why then does God warn of the punishment for changing the Bible and warn of those who will try and corrupt it's teachings? Both of which have occurred but to what degree only God knows.\n\n \n Because as an omnipotent and omnipresent God, He saw well in advance that people/powers that be would one day corrupt both His words and His principles as we have seen occur. And for those of us who retain a belief in and follow Gods word simply and fully, the Holy Spirit within us guides us to its truths and we are not misled by the corruptions which men and institutions have adopted and promoted. For example:\n \n Corruption by Catholicism beliefs:\n \n The Lord Jesus Christ's gospel compared to the rituals and sacraments of the priest in the catholic religion will tell us the cold, hard facts. There is one way to Heaven according to the Holy Bible, not many, as false cults teach. Please examine the proven truth, for yourself, presented without prejudice.\n \n John 14, verse 6 says, Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n \n Catholic Church says\n \n Salvation through the church\n Saved by good works\n Through the pope and priest, sin is forgiven\n Catholic doctrine claims itself as the only true church\n The title, Vicar of Christ, is claimed by the pope\n It is taught that the pope is infallible -- he only, and priest can interpret scripture\n The ritual of mass and the teaching of purgatory\n The above is only a small portion of the doctrines believed and taught in Roman Catholicism.\n \n Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/6004788",

And for those of us who retain a belief in and follow Gods word simply and fully, the Holy Spirit within us guides us to its truths and we are not misled by the corruptions which men and institutions have adopted and promoted. For example:\n \n Corruption by Catholicism beliefs:\n \n The Lord Jesus Christ's gospel compared to the rituals and sacraments of the priest in the catholic religion will tell us the cold, hard facts. There is one way to Heaven according to the Holy Bible, not many, as false cults teach. Please examine the proven truth, for yourself, presented without prejudice.\n \n John 14, verse 6 says, Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n \n Catholic Church says\n \n Salvation through the church\n Saved by good works\n Through the pope and priest, sin is forgiven\n Catholic doctrine claims itself as the only true church\n The title, Vicar of Christ, is claimed by the pope\n It is taught that the pope is infallible -- he only, and priest can interpret scripture\n The ritual of mass and the teaching of purgatory\n The above is only a small portion of the doctrines believed and taught in Roman Catholicism.\n \n Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/6004788\n\n \n I don't question that there has been corruption, intentional and accidental, my point though is more about the unwillingness to accept anything that doesn't conform to the already established belief. What the religion is supposed to be is first then scripture is interpreted to conform instead of scripture deciding what the religion is supposed to be.",

My point was to find an article that casted doubt on the entirety of the Israelite history (and specifically one that mentioned the lack of evidence for the Israelites' captivity in Egypt and the Exodus). I was just going to drop this quote from the wiki article for Abraham:\n \n \nIt is generally recognised by scholars that there is nothing in the Genesis stories that can be related to the history of Canaan of the early 2nd millennium: none of the kings mentioned is known, Abimelech could not be a Philistine (they did not arrive till centuries later), Ur could not become known as \"Ur of the Chaldeans\" until the early 1st millennium, and Laban could not have been an Aramean, as the Arameans did not become an identifiable political entity until the 12th century.[11] Joseph Blenkinsopp, Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Notre Dame, notes that the past four or five decades have seen a growing consensus that the Genesis narrative of Abraham originated from literary circles of the 6th and 5th centuries BCE as a mirror of the situation facing the Jewish community under the Babylonian and early Persian empires.[12] Blenkinsopp describes two conclusions about Abraham that are widely held in biblical scholarship: the first is that, except in the triad \"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,\" he is not clearly and unambiguously attested in the Bible earlier than the Babylonian exile (he does not, for example, appear in prophetic texts earlier than that time); the second is that he became, in the Persian period, a model for those who would return from Babylon to Judah.[13] Beyond this the Abraham story (and those of Isaac and Jacob/Israel) served a theological purpose following the destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple and the Davidic kingship: despite the loss of these things, Yahweh's dealings with the ancestors provided a historical foundation on which hope for the future could be built.[14] There is basic agreement that his connection with Haran, Shechem and Bethel is secondary and originated when he became identified as the father of Jacob and ancestor of the northern tribes; his association with Mamre and Hebron, on the other hand (in the south, in the territory of Jerusalem and Judah), suggest that this region was the original home of his cult.[15]\n\n \n \n But none of those are my \"best one.\"\n \n My 'best one' would be either creation (Gen 1) or Noah's flood (Gen 7). Since there is already a creation/evolution forum, I would go with Noah and give you this list of 100 categories of evidence against the flood.\n \n CHRISTIAN PWNAGE: 100 Categories of Evidence Against Noah&#8217;s Flood\n \n Have fun.",

   "Pappi is supposed to have some higher than normal intelligence in your opinion? On what do you base this opinion, pray tell. It must be his own boasting like JJ who claims some superior intellect because like JJ, pappi shows no reasoning beyond that of the usual arrogant simpleton who thinks more of himself than he ought to. \n \n After all, if pappi had even the most basic intelligence to recognize his spiritual nature as a human being then he would know that he was created rather than evolved and that his God is worthy to be acknowledged and humbled before as his King of Kings and Lord of Lords. But lo, he is proud and arrogant as he mocks and rejects both God and His Messiah who came to die for his sins on Calvary's Cross. That makes pappi more ignorant than the lowest animal because it knows without doubt that God is God, and is worthy of all praise.\n \n So be sure to never elevate these atheists in their own minds and leave room for them to believe they have any superior knowledge or understanding because that just feeds their delusions and sense that they can attain enlightenment on their own merits since we both know that is impossible and an exercise in futility.\n\n \n Bitter table for 1?\n \n I don't boast.

   "Here, rotate on this one (many sublink articles on the subject):\n \n Much Evidence Exists for a Worldwide Flood\n \n By the way, Jesus spoke about Noah. He also prophesied his own resurrection, which occurred just as predicted. When you can bust the resurrection then you will have falsified Christianity. Shouldn't be too hard for a person of your intellect - if you were that smart. I don't think you're that smart, and I think you'll fail just like every other spiritually-challenged infidel has, but I'll give you the opportunity anyway.\n\n \n I don't know why even bothered, but I went through all 17 links, and refuted them all. There weren't even any good pieces of evidence. This was honestly pathetic. \n \n 1. An argument involving the Japanese tsunami, and trying to equate superfaults to the \"fountains of the deep\" from the bible. The article is debunked here: Questioning Answers In Genesis: The Japanese tsunami and ICR's 'faulty' understanding of tectonics and uniformitarianism\n \n 2. Polystrate Tree Fossils (trees growing through layers): \"Well, they were not a problem to explain in the 19th century, and are still not a problem now. John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains. An interesting feature of these examples is the presence of vertebrate fossils (mostly small reptiles) within the infilling of the stumps.\" Whole article killing this argument: \"Polystrate\" Tree Fossils\n \n 3. No argument in this article (argument is purely biblical). They talk about how scientists describe a large flood of the black sea caused by the melting of ice sheets at the end of the ice age. They say survivors fled and settled all over the place and surely would have talked about this flood, possibly resulting in the flood myths. The website argues that this was a big flood, but not THE flood because Noah's flood was global and left no survivors.\n \n 4. Their argument is that there are tons of flood stories, therefore Noah's global flood must have happened. They list various similarities and their occurrences among the stories (favored family 88%, forewarned 66%, because of wickedness of man 66%, global 95%, animals saved 67%, boat 70%, etc.) These were primitive people who believed that natural disasters were caused because the gods were angry. That has been commonly believed throughout much of history. The flood was very large and covered all the land they knew of, leading to terms like 'global.' How could anyone ACTUALLY know if a flood covered the entire globe? It's obviously an exaggeration. Boats would be the obvious way to survive water, and animals are still around, so they must have been saved... the argument that Noah's flood must have happened because there are so many flood stories is just dumb. Using that same logic, you could argue that Gilgamesh's flood was the real one, or any of the other stories. \n \n 5. This is about the 6 million 'annual' layers known as the Green River oil shales that seems to indicate 6 million years of accumulation. Their first argument is a weak one, showing that occasionally more than one layer can happen in a year, citing \"One study in a modern lake documented that 300-360 laminae had formed in 160 years.\" Assuming that is correct, the minimum age would still be around 3 million years, over 500 times older than the creationist age of the earth. The rest of the arguments are just as bad (probably worse). They question how fish could be left untouched by predators long enough to fossilize. They then ask how birds could have been fossilized in a lake. These are simply arguments that question how things could ever fossilize at all. Fossilization is rare, but not impossible, and in an area like this with lots of mud and regular layering is ideal for creating fossils. The whole of the creationist varve (layering) arguments is busted thoroughly here: Answers in Genesis BUSTED!: Rocks of Age: How Varves show the Earth Old\n \n 6. They try to answer how the Himalayas could have been covered by water. They argue that if the earth was completely flat, water would cover the earth 8000 ft deep. The Himilayas are 29,000 feet deep, but they argue that the continents, mountains and everything could have been formed during the flood (which is really dumb). If the earth was more or less flat, the where did the water come from? The water would have already been covering the earth. It couldn't have been any type of ground water because water is less dense than the crust of the earth, and would have came to the top. The pressure would have also been so great that the water would have shot out of the orbit of earth, and the energy would have been so great that everything (including Noah) would have died from that. It couldn't have been in the atmosphere, because there is nothing to hold it up there. Even if there was some way to hold it up there, it would block sunlight and create unliveable temperatures on earth and extreme pressures that wouldn't allow for life. That much water would also kill everything when it fell from the sky. \n \n 7. Arguments against Carbon dating. (Note that none of these articles have any references to non-creationist papers. There are no scientific papers to back up any claims or numbers). This page explains all the things about carbon dating (how we know it is accurate, things that can't be carbon dated, things that contaminate samples) in a pretty short, easy to understand way: Carbon Dating\n \n 8. This is a pretty dumb argument about the Himalayas forming. It basically argues against a slow steady process and says that since there were times of more rapid mountain growth, it throws a wrench into the whole idea. This is wrong, and the \"rapid\" growth they mention is \"several kilometers of vertical uplift since the beginning of the Pliocene about five million years ago.\" Beside the fact that the time period mentioned is ridiculously longer than YEC allows for, it's also a dumb argument in general. Here is a simple article detailing the formation of the Himilayas, including both the slow and \"rapid\" parts. The Himalayas - Geology - Formation of the Himalayas\n \n 9. This article basically argues that some mud cracks could have been formed by the flood instead of by other means (most notably droughts around the time of the flood). Unfortunately for him, there are ways to tell what caused various cracks. From a religious site (article trying to justify a regional Noah flood while showing why the global wasn't possible): \"The mud cracks can form only under drying conditions that cause the mud to shrink and form polygonal cracks. The evaporite mineral compounds in the layers are deposited in the correct chemical order predicted by the solubility of each kind of ion in these compounds and whose increasing concentrations during the evaporation of water would cause them to precipitate in a predictable depositional sequence as the water volume decreased. Such evaporite deposits would be expected to occur where a marine sea was once present and to disappear when the sea became completely dry. Therefore, one could expect these evaporites to be at the top of the supposed Noachian Flood deposits when the water supposedly receded and the land dried out, but certainly not in different levels in between older and younger fossiliferous \"Flood deposits\".\" Yes, Noah's Flood May Have Happened, But Not Over the Whole Earth | NCSE\n Also, Answers in Genesis BUSTED!: Flood Geology Hanging Out to Dry\n \n 10&11. These are about the Grand Canyon, which I've already discussed. They mention the Tonto Group of strata and how it hasn't been dated. They say they can't imagine the ocean being over the continent like that, but in reality it was. Geology of the Grand Canyon area - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n 12.Hualapai Indian flood story. Same arguments as #4, but with the additional error of thinking that evidence for a global flood can be found in one individual region.\n \n 13. Not really an argument against anything, just a random thought that the crust of the earth could have \"a few dozen times about an axis perpendicular to the earth's spin axis.\" They give no driving force, no evidence, no nothing, but it seems a good way to try and explain some of the crazier things necessary for a huge flood. One problem I would see with this, is that if the crust started spinning, the inertia would send people and animals flying (along with the tsunamis, which was the original point).\n \n 14. This is about Red Butte in Arizona, and basically ties into the whole Grand Canyon thing, where they say the flood carved everything out. I've already discussed why this is wrong in previous post(s). \n \n 15. They try to say various sandstones (Coconino and the Navajo) were laid down by the flood, but unfortunately it's all bunk: CC365.1: Coconino Sandstone deposition environment.\n \n 16. Discussed a paper where a guy found fossils in Bermuda in a quarry, and concluded that the ocean must have been 70 feet higher in the past. That is refuted here (although I'm not entirely sure how this is supposed to be evidence for a flood anyway): Reinterpretation of a Stage-11 21-m Sea Level High Stand Deposit on Bermuda: Meg\n \n 17. This one is laughable. A catastrophic event 251 million years ago wiped out forests and killed off most of the life on earth. Scientists call this the Permian-Triassic extinction event, but after explaining the whole thing, the article basically says \"But the flood could have done it.\" I don't even know why they bothered to mention this. They even say \"From the account given in the biblical text, more land creatures would have survived than marine creatures, since land creatures were preserved on a giant barge.\" I always thought flood advocates claimed that most sea critters survived? \n \n Anyway, there ya go. I love how they take different geological features that happened millions of years apart and try to say they are all the product of the same flood that happened over the course of a couple months. \n \n I answered these knowing full well that I would probably just get a <flush< and have you ignore the list of evidence against the flood yet again. I also expect you to throw up another link to random \"evidences\" or just get off the issue all together. Since I don't expect you to even click the anti-flood links from my other posts, I'll ask just one:\n \n ****How could the meandering shape of the Grand Canyon be formed in any other way than a river over the course of millions of years, knowing that floods erodes in (basically) straight lines?",

Further, in other Old Testament passages that refer to rape, different Hebrew words are used (Judges 19:25, 20:5; 2 Samuel 13:14, 32; Zechariah 14:2).\n \n Does Deuteronomy 22:28-29 command a rape victim to marry her rapist?\n\n \n \n Doesn't matter because none of any of your holy book matters, is in effect, so this conversation is irrelevant to anything that matters. \n \n I only mention this because you believe in this cr4p and therefore are bound by the law in your mind.",

   "You're deluded. From the following link:\n \n Second, it is important to understand that the Hebrew words used in Deuteronomy 22, verses 25 and 28 do not necessarily indicate rape. In verse 25, the Hebrew word chazaq is used, and it essentially means \"seize,\" or \"take hold of.\" In verse 28, a different Hebrew word taphas is used, and while it has a very similar meaning to chazaq, it is not the same word. In both verses 25 and 28, the Hebrew word shakab is used, and while it literally means \"lie down,\" it is used throughout the Old Testament to refer to sexual intercourse. So, both verses 25 and 28 describe a man seizing and having sex with a woman. While this is a possible description of rape, it does not explicitly refer to rape. Also, the differences in the Hebrew words between Deuteronomy 22, verses 25 and 28, could be interpreted as verse 25 referring to rape, with verse 28 referring to consensual sex. Further, in other Old Testament passages that refer to rape, different Hebrew words are used (Judges 19:25, 20:5; 2 Samuel 13:14, 32; Zechariah 14:2).\n \n Does Deuteronomy 22:28-29 command a rape victim to marry her rapist?\n\n \n So it would mean what prostitution? Seriously what is the money for? What is the group of passages dealing with. Rape whether it be violent or not. I suggest you read Deuteronomy 22 and it is highly unlikley that verse 28 is referring to consensual sex alone or at all.",
