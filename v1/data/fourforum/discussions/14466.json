There is no mass support for repealing Obama's healthcare reform. A July 12 Rasmussen poll says that only 53% want the whole thing repealed. Only 44% strongly support repeal while 33% is strongly opposed to repeal. Health Care Law - Rasmussen Reports.\n \n Other issues will likely trump healthcare reform.\n \n \nThen there's the corporate bailout bill that everybody opposed because they didn't want their taxes going to the people who bankrupted their own business in the first place, proving that they couldn't manage money.\n\n \n Which started with Republican George W.

   "At this point I would have to say no.\n \n 1. The Republicans have nominated too many tea partiers when tea partiers don't come close to representing the mainstream electorate.\n\n \n Actually, they largely ARE the mainstream electorate. The goals of the Tea Party are listed as ..\n  1. Identify constitutionality of every new law: Require each bill to identify the specific provision of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to do what the bill does (82.03%).\n 2. Reject emissions trading: Stop the \"cap and trade\" administrative approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. (72.20%).\n 3. Demand a balanced federal budget: Begin the Constitutional amendment process to require a balanced budget with a two-thirds majority needed for any tax modification. (69.69%)\n 4. Simplify the tax system: Adopt a simple and fair single-rate tax system by scrapping the internal revenue code and replacing it with one that is no longer than 4,543 words -- the length of the original Constitution.(64.9%).\n 5. Audit federal government agencies for constitutionality: Create a Blue Ribbon taskforce that engages in an audit of federal agencies and programs, assessing their Constitutionality, and identifying duplication, waste, ineffectiveness, and agencies and programs better left for the states or local authorities. (63.37%)\n 6. Limit annual growth in federal spending: Impose a statutory cap limiting the annual growth in total federal spending to the sum of the inflation rate plus the percentage of population growth. (56.57%).\n 7. Repeal the health care legislation passed on March 23, 2010: Defund, repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (56.39%).\n 8. Pass an 'All-of-the-Above' Energy Policy: Authorize the exploration of additional energy reserves to reduce American dependence on foreign energy sources and reduce regulatory barriers to all other forms of energy creation. (55.5%).\n 9. Reduce Earmarks: Place a moratorium on all earmarks until the budget is balanced, and then require a 2/3 majority to pass any earmark. (55.47%).\n 10. Reduce Taxes: Permanently repeal all recent tax increases, and extend permanently the George W. Bush temporary reductions in income tax, capital gains tax and estate taxes, currently scheduled to end in 2011. (53.38%). (From Tea Party movement - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ) These are very mainstream ideals. The recent 'racism' thing is a straw man put out by the NAACP, which is nowadays just a politics-driven Democrat special interest group like any other.\n \n \n2. Any political gain the Republicans could have had from Obama's mishandling of the oil spill has been countered by the Republican Party flying cover for BP.\n\n \n Much of this has to do with the focus of the media. Polls indicate people feel the federal govt. really messed up. By all indications it looks like the oil spill is for Obama what Katrina was for Bush, except the oil spill is more reprehensible because it was avoidable, unlike a natural disaster which couldn't have been prevented.\n \n \n3. A poll I heard about last week shows only a plurality lead over the Democrats and this lead is only 4 or 5 percentage points. Considering how bad the economy is and how angry the public was supposed to be over Obama's healthcare plan, it is astonishing that the incumbent party is still doing so well in the polls.\n\n \n That's what happens when you have people clinging to a president over sheer political allegiance rather than thinking for themselves.\n \n \n5. The Republicans will be blamed as much as the Democrats are for the economy considering the Republicans' opposition to extending unemployment benefits.\n\n \n That remains to be seen. Clearly Republicans have done a pretty good job of showing that it's just another case of extending something we can't afford.\n \n \nFor the Record I left the Republican Party following Clinton's acquittal with 10 Republican votes in 1999.
