You know, people with such a visceral reaction to the thought of gay sex -- men humping other men, men frenching and making out, etc. -- have to be careful not to fixate on thoughts like naked men grinding into each other, or 69ing, or even just holding hands because worrying or thinking about things like that can start to intrude on their thoughts at the most inopportune times. Like when they're making love to their wives. It's hard, once the mental image of a sex act has been implanted in one's mind, to keep it out of your mind during sexual situations. The mind has a way of sorting sex-related images and playing them all when you're aroused.\n \n Gosh, I hope that doesn't happen to you...",
