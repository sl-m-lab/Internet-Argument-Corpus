   "It appears that this whole thing was a hoax.\n \n New York Sun:\n \n \n\"Ms. Shvarts is engaged in performance art,\" a Yale spokeswoman, Helaine Klasky, said. \"She stated to three senior Yale University officials today, including two deans, that she did not impregnate herself and that she did not induce any miscarriages. The entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman&#8217;s body.\"\n \n Ms. Klasky went on to suggest that Yale would not have permitted a project of the sort described in the student newspaper. \"Had these acts been real, they would have violated basic ethical standards and raised serious mental and physical health concerns.\"\n\n \n I love this part: \"Had these acts been real, they would have violated basic ethical standards and raised serious mental and physical health concerns.\" Well, even if they weren't real, I still think it raises serious mental health concerns.\n \n More:\n \n \n Yale University officials issued a strongly worded statement Thursday night explaining that a student's shocking claim that she had artificially inseminated herself \"as often as possible\" and then took drugs to induce miscarriages for her senior art project was \"creative fiction.\"\n\n In other words, she lied. This type of thing really makes Yale look great. Perhaps this is the reason that Justice Thomas has a 15 cent sticker on his Yale Law degree?",
