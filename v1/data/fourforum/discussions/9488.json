   "The majority of the one million new Iraqi refugees are living abroad are residing in Jordan and Syria. They are Sunnis that are highly educated people who left Iraq with little to nothing. The Iraqi refugees are the real victims of this war and they have the most to gain in the return of civility to Iraq.\n \n The Iraqi Refugees Task Force would be a bridge between the international NGO's and the Iraqi people in need of help. By assisting the NGO's in communication and planning of the reconstruction of Iraq. Task teams will be established trying to utilize the Iraqi refugees in their former line of work. Task Teams will be established to perform the following tasks; Banking, engineering, construction, policing, employment agency, education, oil, farming, import, legal and medical. \n \n Jordan and Syria being the host nations of many of the Iraqi Refugees will be looking for Sponsor Nations to help underwrite the cost of the tasks working in partnership with the international NGO's. The United Nations will be the leading NGO working closely with the Arab League and the leaders of Iraq in the coordination of the Iraqi's \"wish list\" that will be worked into the Iraq Master Plan of Reconstruction. This is a break-down of some of the tasks of the Master Plan of Reconstruction. \n \n 1. Banking- A non-profit Iraqi bank needs to be established for the people of Iraq. This bank will specialize in micro no-interest loans for the Iraqi people. These loans will be in three main categories. \n o Start-up and or support of small business\n o Buying and or building or fixing a family home\n o Farming\n 2. Engineering- Universities and private engineering firms from around the world taking on pro-bono projects. This non-profit engineering group will network with specific Iraqi civil engineering projects with the international engineering community. \n 3. Construction- Pro-bono international construction consultants will work on Iraqi Wish List on the larger and more complex civilian infrastructure projects. Such as fresh water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, power plants, highways and bridges. \n 4. Policing-Jordan and Syria with the support of the international financial community must take the leading role in the training of Iraqi local security forces. Recruiting from the Iraqi refugees from within their nation as well as from Iraq. \n 5. Employment- A non-profit employment agency needs to be established to help the Iraqi refugees within and outside of Iraq to find jobs in Iraq. This is probably one of the biggest parts to restoring civility within Iraq. \n 6. Education- Nations, cities, corporations, and wealthy people will be encouraged to sponsor a school project in Iraq.\n 7. Farming- This is where the greatest opportunity for the western nations to help in the improvement of the Iraqi people way of life. With the western made farming tools and farming technology Iraq could become the bread basket of the Middle East once again. \n 8. Import- A non-profit Iraqi Import Agency needs to be formed to help manage the flow of humanitarian aid into Iraq. This Import agency will work with her sister agencies on the reconstruction of Iraq.\n 9. Legal- The Iraqi refugee lawyers need to form legal teams to help assist in the international and national efforts in helping Iraq. Establishing the \"Rule of Law\" and settling property disputes within Iraq will be two of the main issues that need to be addressed.\n \n The majority of the Iraqi refugees are professional in the education, medical, legal and business fields. They need to be able to return to Iraqi with some sense of security. Only by revising the flow of Iraqi refugees and establishing security will peace and prosperity come about. The Iraqi refugees outside Iraq can become a link between the Iraqi people and the international NGO's in the reconstruction of Iraq. The NGO's must help the Iraqi people to work together as one people by helping the Sunni, Shiite, and Kurd. This can happen by getting them to work together on the Iraqi New Deal.\n \n Once the Iraqi people can see light at the end of the tunnel, then the momentum of change for the better will flourish. This must start at the bottom on the streets of Iraq and work its way up into the government. The complexity of security of Iraq must be addressed on a broader base than the military or governments can do on there own. A better balance between military and humanitarian spending, as well as balance between government and the non-governmental organizations is needed. \n \n http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",
