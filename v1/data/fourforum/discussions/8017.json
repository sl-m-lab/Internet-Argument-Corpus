   "Technical Report: Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by Same-Sex Parents \n ABSTRACT\n A growing body of scientific literature demonstrates that children who grow up with 1 or 2 gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive, social, and sexual functioning as do children whose parents are heterosexual. Children's optimal development seems to be influenced more by the nature of the relationships and interactions within the family unit than by the particular structural form it takes. \n \n \n CURRENT SITUATION\n Accurate statistics regarding the number of parents who are gay or lesbian are impossible to obtain. The secrecy resulting from the stigma still associated with homosexuality has hampered even basic epidemiologic research. A broad estimate is that between 1 and 9 million children in the United States have at least 1 parent who is lesbian or gay.1 \n \n Most individuals who have a lesbian and/or gay parent were conceived in the context of a heterosexual relationship. When a parent (or both parents) in a heterosexual couple \"comes out\" as lesbian or gay, some parents divorce and others continue to live as a couple. If they do decide to live separately, either parent may be the residential parent or children may live part-time in each home. Gay or lesbian parents may remain single or they may have same-sex partners who may or may not develop stepparenting relationships with the children. These families closely resemble stepfamilies formed after heterosexual couples divorce, and many of their parenting concerns and adjustments are similar. An additional concern for these parents is that pervasively heterosexist legal precedents have resulted in denial of custody and restriction of visitation rights to many gay and lesbian parents. \n \n Increasing social acceptance of diversity in sexual orientation has allowed more gay men and lesbians to come out before forming intimate relationships or becoming parents. Lesbian and gay adults choose to become parents for many of the same reasons heterosexual adults do. The desire for children is a basic human instinct and satisfies many people's wish to leave a mark on history or perpetuate their family's story. In addition, children may satisfy people's desire to provide and accept love and nurturing from others and may provide some assurance of care and support during their older years. \n \n Many of the same concerns that exist for heterosexual couples when they consider having children also face lesbians and gay men. All parents have concerns about time, finances, and the responsibilities of parenthood. They worry about how children will affect their relationship as a couple, their own and their children's health, and their ability to manage their new parenting role in addition to their other adult roles. Lesbians and gay men undertaking parenthood face additional challenges, including deciding whether to conceive or adopt a child, obtaining donor sperm or arranging for a surrogate mother (if conceiving), finding an accepting adoption agency (if adopting), making legally binding arrangements regarding parental relationships, creating a substantive role for the nonbiologic or nonadoptive parent, and confronting emotional pain and restrictions imposed by heterosexism and discriminatory regulations. \n \n Despite these challenges, lesbians and gay men increasingly are becoming parents on their own or in the context of an established same-sex relationship. Most lesbians who conceive a child do so using alternative insemination techniques with a donor's sperm. The woman or women may choose to become pregnant using sperm from a completely anonymous donor, from a donor who has agreed to be identifiable when the child becomes an adult, or from a fully known donor (eg, a friend or a relative of the nonconceiving partner). Lesbians also can become parents by fostering or adopting children, as can gay men. These opportunities are increasingly available in most states and in many other countries, although they are still limited by legal statutes in some places. \n http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;109/2/341\n (Rest of report at web-site...)\n \n \n Also:\n AAP SAYS CHILDREN OF SAME-SEX COUPLES DESERVE TWO LEGALLY RECOGNIZED PARENTS \n The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says children who are born to, or adopted by, one member of a gay or lesbian couple deserve the security of two legally recognized parents. Therefore, a new AAP policy statement, \"Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by Same-Sex Parents\" supports legal and legislative efforts that provide for the possibility of adoption of those children by the second parent or coparent in same-sex relationships.\n \n The statement says there is a considerable body of professional literature that suggests children with parents who are homosexual have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment and development as children whose parents are heterosexual.\n http://www.aap.org/advocacy/archives/febsamesex.htm",

   "The Supreme Court refused Monday to block a gay woman from seeking parental rights to a child she had helped raise with her partner. \n \n Justices could have used the case to clarify the rights of gays in child custody disputes stemming from nontraditional families. \n \n They declined, without comment, to disturb a ruling of Washington state's highest court that said Sue Ellen Carvin could pursue ties to the girl as a \"de facto parent.\" The girl is now 11. \n \n The case had brought a contentious issue to a court that has shied away from gay rights disputes. \n \n Lawyers for the girl's biological mother, Page Britain, told justices that the state court decision in this case and others around the country \"pave the way for children to have an unlimited and ever-changing number of parents.\" \n \n Carvin's attorneys had said the court has never agreed to hear a case involving parenting or visitation disputes arising from same-sex relationships, a recognition \"that state courts can best provide the case by case attention these matters require.\" \n \n Carvin and Britain had lived together for five years before they decided to become parents. Britain was artificially inseminated and gave birth in 1995 to the daughter, known as L.B. in court papers. The girl called Carvin \"Mama\" and Britain \"Mommy.\" \n \n The couple broke up in 2001 and the following year, when the girl was 7, Carvin was barred from seeing the girl. After Carvin went to court, Britain married the sperm donor. Justices were told that the father lives in Thailand. \n \n The court's action does not end the case. Carvin must now prove that she is a \"de facto parent\" defined by the state court as someone who though not legally recognized, functions as a child's actual parent. \n \n The case paints a nasty battle between the two women. Britain says she wanted to have the girl baptized in a Catholic church and that her former partner wanted to take L.B. to a Buddhist temple. \n \n Carvin contends she was the active parent. \n \n The case is Britain v. Carvin, 05-974.\n http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8HK99C80.html\n \n (To bring up a recent case on the legal status of gay *parents*...)",

   "Isn't Love Gay?\n \u00a9 Kekoon Publishing, 2008\n \n I continue to be appalled by the myths of our puritanical society, one of which depicts gays and lesbians as unqualified to nurture and provide a healthy, loving home environment. Now what consistently seems to be over looked are some common realities. Love and nurture do not determine the sexual identity of a child nor are love and nurture determined by one's sexual identity. \n \n Children need good, loving, healthy environments where they can thrive with quality discipline and preparation for life as an adult. If the question is, what will be harvested from today's seed in the year 2040, then shouldn't we examine the soil we plant that seed in for it's fertility? All that is required to be have Human Fertility is the ability to reproduce sexually. However, this is not all that is required to plant a child into this world. I contend that there are two stages of Human Fertility, one to reproduce life and the other to produce life. After all, even a crack addict can make a baby but can a crack addict raise a child? Sure, but not without there being serious adverse consequences. \n \n A non-rehabilitated crack addict can loose her rights to raise her child based on the factual evidence that she has simply lost the ability to produce a healthy environment for that child. Let's seriously consider that a person or people who lack the ability to sexually fertilize a child with each other retain their ability to produce a fertile environment for a child. Yet, they may loose, and in many states have lost, the right to that ability due to their sexual orientation. How can this be morally right? It is vital that we plant children in environments that are fertile for producing life, environments that enable children to positively contribute to the overall wellness of our Nation's future socioeconomic wellness. The law can not take away from healthy and free individuals the ability to reproduce a child but the law has taken away their ability to produce a child.\n \n Even basic Milano Method affirms that positive contributions to society are not weighed by which sexual orientation you are, ie; heterosexual women are not contributing more positively than lesbian woman, and visa versa with our men. Per the positive contributions of men and women, there is only one rule which can be applied, healthy individuals produce healthy communities, healthy communities produce healthy counties, cities, states,nations and so on. Worst case scenario using the MYTHedology of the puritanical mentality, gays and lesbians adopt children and they grow up to be gays and lesbians. Now, if they are good contributing members of society then what would be the harm in that? \n \n If love, quantifies that I am a man or that I am a woman, then why isn't love gay? Perhaps it is not gay because being male, female or even gay does not define one's capacity or ability to love. Our society needs people who can share a healthy dose of love to these young wounded lives. There is in fact no clinical evidence that one's sexual identity breeds any more corruption in society than does another's sexuality. Rather, statistics have consistently proven the only distinction made between gay and lesbian contributions to society is that they do not have the ability to fertilize one another. This being the case, why then are only a handfull of states permitting gays and lesbians to adopt? \n \n Too many children are waiting, needing good, loving, safe homes. Too many good people, regardless of sexual orientation, are desperately waiting to foster and adopt children. Due to the shortage of available foster and adoptive house holds, so many waiting children are at greater risk of being placed with desperate, money motivated, careless heterosexual \"homes\". Seems to me, the children are better off being returned to their former unhealthy environments where at least the violators aren't strangers. \n \n Love and Light go with you all,\n \n Ms. Rachel E.
