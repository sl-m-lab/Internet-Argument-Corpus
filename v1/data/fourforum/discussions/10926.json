I stated which then you distorted that the great civilizations of mankind practiced it early on. I never stated that they were found on it. Your dishonesty know no bounds. The Greeks openly practiced homosexuality for decades. The Spartan training cycle had massive homosexuality. And the Romans weren't exactly discreet about it. Several of their Emperors and early leaders had forays into homosexual behaviors.\n \n \nAnd show how long they survived as a civilization and what led to their demise if you can.\n\n \n Greece fell because it failed to unite properly against the Roman Threat. Sparta was annihilated because it failed to update its military. Phalanxes are easily out maneuvered by legionnaires. If Greece had united and kept up innovation in its military, it could have held out much longer against the Romans then they did as individual city states or regional alliances with obsolete militaries. I realize your understanding of history is extremely limited (see the whole collapse of US moral society if we elect hillary thread, which you have been absent from since I posted). Rome fell because it got too large to manage and its economy was based on constant war. Relying upon the constant influx of gold from conquered nations will help you grow, but when you run out of people to dominate, economic problems arise. Plus years of poor governance with Emperors looking out for themselves instead of the Empire lead to its downfall. The Roman Empire truly ended with the fall of Constantinople, which is interesting in itself as the Romans should have won that battle by every measure.\n \n \nAnd then prove that their collapse wasn't due to God withdrawing His Grace from them as He most assuredly will from us, and how He did with the other great Civilizations that came and collapsed before us.\n\n \n Are you serious? Roman and Greece fell due to poor governance and poor foresight by its leaders. God had nothing to do with it. \n \n You can't even prove your interpretation of your religion is right.

They do apply. They are still moral laws that God holds us to. But just as the penalties for homosexuality aren't enforced in this current Age of Grace even though it is still condemned, so is adultery and other sins of the flesh condemned even though the penalties for committing them are no longer enforced. Here is Lev. 20 again. It deals with child sacrifice, spiritism, the occult, adultery and many other sinful practices that are an abomination to God. And none of the death penalties they called for in the OT are even suggested to be enforced today by either Jews or Christians. What is so telling if you want to ask the question is why the Jews don't enforce these laws anymore. But I have told you why Christians don't.\n Lev 20:1 \n HEN the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n Lev 20:2 \n \"Again, you shall say to the children of Israel: 'Whoever of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who gives any of his descendants to Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.\n Lev 20:3 \n 'I will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from his people, because he has given some of his descendants to Molech, to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name.\n Lev 20:4 \n 'And if the people of the land should in any way hide their eyes from the man, when he gives some of his descendants to Molech, and they do not kill him,\n Lev 20:5 \n 'then I will set My face against that man and against his family; and I will cut him off from his people, and all who prostitute themselves with him to commit harlotry with Molech.\n Lev 20:6 \n 'And the person who turns to mediums and familiar spirits, to prostitute himself with them, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from his people.\n Lev 20:7 \n 'Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God.\n Lev 20:8 \n 'And you shall keep My statutes, and perform them: I am the LORD who sanctifies you.\n Lev 20:9 \n 'For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.\n Lev 20:10 \n 'The man who commits adultery with another man's wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress, shall surely be put to death.\n Lev 20:11 \n 'The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.\n Lev 20:12 \n 'If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have committed perversion. Their blood shall be upon them.\n Lev 20:13 \n 'If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death.

They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.\n Lev 20:21 \n 'If a man takes his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness.

It just shows your lack of an actual arguement.

He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.\" (Leviticus 20:9)\n \n \n \"If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has discovered her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from her people.\" (Leviticus 20:18)\n \n \"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.\" (Leviticus 25:44-45)\n \n \"Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.\" (Leviticus 19:27)\n \n \"...and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.\" (Leviticus 11:7)\n \n \"...do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear material woven of two kinds of material.\" (Leviticus 19:19)\n \n \"But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are an abomination to you.\" (Leviticus 11:10)\n \n \n And here's a link for you explaining Leviticus and the cultural/historical implications of it.

   "You weren't accused of changing your stance-you were accused of cherry picking quotes to suit yourself, which you are completely guilty of. Somehow, you don't see it. Are you that simple? Or do you just not read what people post in response to you? You harp on about the one verse of Leviticus, while completely ignoring all the other things Leviticus says are \"abominations\". No one else is mentioning adultery. I think we can all agree that adultery is immoral. What about the rest? I have a small selection for you to address below.\n \n I asked you why homosexuality is an \"abomination\" still, but the other sins listed in Leviticus were not. \n \n \n And what is so hard for you to comprehend that I NEVER SAID THE OTHER SINS IN LEVITICUS WERE NOT SINS ANYMORE!!! I said that the penalty of death for those sins, just as for homosexuality, are not enforced in this Age of Grace.\n \n \nYou were the one who's stuck on adultery. I never mentioned it, and in fact asked you about other things listed in Leviticus. You never answered, instead saying I was stupid for not reading your post about adultery, \n\n \n No TQ, my point was that all of the sins in chapter 20, and I even posted it, not just adultery, that called for the death penalty were still sins to God but now covered by Grace in this Age. Jesus died to cover those sins, so the penalties for them aren't paid for here. What is so hard about that to comprehend? It is totally consistent with the rest of the bible.\n \n \nthe exact post that I replied to! If you want to continue attacking me, so be it. It just shows your lack of an actual arguement. Or, you can tell me why homosexuality is considered a sin worthy of damnation while none of the others listed below (which are also from Leviticus) are not:\n \n \"For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.\" (Leviticus 20:9)\n \n \"If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has discovered her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from her people.\" (Leviticus 20:18)\n \n \"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.\" (Leviticus 25:44-45)\n \n \"Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.\" (Leviticus 19:27)\n \n \"...and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.\" (Leviticus 11:7)\n \n \"...do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear material woven of two kinds of material.\" (Leviticus 19:19)\n \n \"But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are an abomination to you.\" (Leviticus 11:10)\n \n And here's a link for you explaining Leviticus and the cultural/historical implications of it. I know you won't agree, but I also know you won't have any reason to disagree. Let the insults begin!\n \n Leviticus significance\n\n \n TQ, if your going to do a sleazy cut and paste from a link, then at least cite the source, ok? And I answered your question above just fine.

It's my understanding that what happened when Jesus came is not that the moral code no longer matters anymore. Rather, there was no longer the need for the punishments for breaking that moral code.

I want to know why only that one line in Leviticus is clung to by modern day christians. I quoted a few other rules that are also in Leviticus that modern day christians don't care about. There is just that one line that they still say applies. Either they all apply, or none of them apply, so which is it? If Leviticus is still valid, I would expect christians to be picketing Red Lobster retaurants and writing hateful letters to modern farming organizations, two groups which explicitly break the laws laid down in Leviticus.

   "Right, if we go with this interpretation then either we should still try to obey the law because Jesus told us that all the law stems from his two commandments to love God and love one another. OR Christ's sacrifice makes these laws irrelevant to use unless they directly contradict those two commands (as incest, adultery, prostitution obviously do). So either you must aim to obey the entire law (and treat every sin as being of equal significance, as Jesus taught) or you must explain empirically why a committed same-sex relationship is in contradiction with either loving God or loving your neighbour.\n\n \n I might not do this question justice but what the heck.\n \n God placed woman to give man company.\n He didn't place man to give man company.\n God stated to the couple to be fruitful and multiply. Same sex relationships can't do that.\n \n Your logic for same-sex relationships could equally be applied to incest, pedophilia, adultery, etc... In context of Christianity.\n \n It is only the out of context logic and current beliefs of a secular society that we even allow for same sex relationships.\n We ommit incest?

You've taken all the extras and tossed them aside as near pointless to how you desire to pursue the core.\n Much like how a jet plane racer might start ditching what he's believe to be unnecessary weight to get a faster, more easy to maintain plane...even if others see such items discarded as being necessesary to flight.\n \n \n With that 'everyone gets into heaven' attitude since the free gift of salvation is pushed on to everyone regardless of whether they want it.\n What's to prevent me from just doing as I please?\n Doing what feels good to me?\n \n You still push the notion of not doing harm (because that's not love) to others but, who determines what love and harm are?\n You?\n \n Some still see gay love as harmful. To the participants and to the society they live in. Should they disregard their perceptions that this is harmful because you want them too?
