   "Should a 3 year limit be added to statutory rape laws, in order to prevent the criminalization of an 18 year old having sex with his 17 year old girlfriend? I believe Texas is the only state with this law in place, and it seems like an excellent law.\n \n This seems very reasonable to me, because making criminals out of two consenting people with a very small age gap goes against the spirit of Statutory rape laws, which are designed to protect older people from taking advantage of younger people.

   "Old argument for me on this board, really. As in earlier threads, I'm sticking with my position, that:\n A) claiming that rape of a minor is worse than an adult is unfair, as the suffereing and consequences are not so different (it's just our protectiveness towards children that makes us extra sensitive) and that automatically considering adult rape as less traumatic is a serious dissservice to the adult rape victims.\n and\n B) rape should always be considered primarily from the view of consent. If consent is given, the act should not be prosecuted. Which would lead to VERY RARE cases when an actual consensual relationship would be left alone. I'm quite fine with the \"reverse burden of proof\" being applied to such cases, though.",

   "I think statutory rape laws should be changed. Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the US, impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was in his forties. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, married a 16 year old girl when he was in his thirties. James Madison, 4th President of the US, dated a 15 year old girl when he was in his thirties. I have a hard time believing that girls of that age back then were more ready for sexual relations than they are today. In fact, the opposite is probably true. I notice in discussions with people about the topic that some people make no distinction between statutory rape and forcible rape. To them the distinction doesn't matter and someone who had an intimate relationship with a 16 or 17 year deserves to be just as harshly punished as someone who raped another person at knife point. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.",
