   "Hi there everyone. It's been a long long time but I'm finally back on 4forums and well it's been an interesting ride to say the least. Basically I left for awhile due to some internal family issues that needless to say are not resolved but daily, seem to improve over time. \n \n Basically I left So Cal around mid January when my father had gone on a literal crusade for my soul. He went with me to a capus crusade for christ conference where college students from all over california were going for praise and worship. Not to mention I was being paid to setup the entire event as well so it was nice. However after running sound for a few of the main sermons I slowly began to realize that this was a ploy. \n \n Turns out they held workshops on how to turn your gay and lesbian friends strait for jesus, and also had confessionals to where gay and lesbian college christians could go to try to \"fix\" their evil ways. I was sick. Not only was I being brainwashed and bombarded by this anti gay propoganda but I was being paid to actually run the event!\n \n Through all this my father became even more zealous until finally on the car ride back from San Deigo he compared me being gay to screwing donkies and sodomy. He continued by having on christian radio the whole time, and said he would never accept me being gay.\n \n sadly that tore it with me. I had enough. I knew a couple of gay roomates back in virginia and unknown to me they roomed with 2 other gay roomates including the owner of the house. Needless to say I returned to virginia looking for work, and reflecting on the horrible incident which scarred me in the navy and also ended my career altogether.\n \n Leading up to moving my father went into a rampage. Cursing at me and saying that if I left I would be the cause for my mother's death, I was emotionally shattered and destraught and desperate for an escape. \n \n I took up an offer from the house owner who offered to pay for my ticket. needless to say I accepted. I arrived in virginia scared and anxious but free. Later on to my horror I realized that I was caught in a web of lies by this person. My two roomates failed to tell me who exactly this person or his boyfriend was. Turns out the man was 54 and his lover 26. Not only that but he was a OCD control freaks and very odd.\n \n Needless to say the unwanted advances were more than unpleasant at the very least and I put my foot down at once. After it became appearent I was not going to be some sort of house boi for this man, I was nothing more than a renter. Well needless to say I had no money and couldnt find work in the shattered economy of the commonwealth.\n \n So after many sessions of verbal abuse and even physical threats along with the news of my grandfathers failing health, I came back to california and went back to the only place I had which was my parents.\n \n Leaving taught my family one thing especially my father. I wouldnt change and I wouldnt be controlled. So now I sit here writing to you unemployed, looking for work as a college student. My family knows I have a boyfriend, and that also I'm not afraid of who I am and I'm proud. Slowly but surely my self confidence and sense of will has come back. \n \n And things are looking on the upside if not for the unfailing support and care of my boyfriend, who has been with me since I've been back and has helped me deal with the issues and drama of my family. Just a couple of days I picked up a copy of \"Stranger At The Gate\" by Mel White.\n \n It really is an amazing book so far and has moved me with this mans tesimony to his struggle with being a closeted gay and being in the inner circle of the right wing people who have waged war on equality and gay rights since the early 80's. I havnt finished the book but so far it shakes me to the core jsut knowing how far we have to go to overcome this senseless bigotry and musguided propaganda by people who play on fears and ignorance all in the name of the almighty dollar.\n \n So needless to say I'm sorry for the long post, but I'm back and trying to stay afloat. Last week I went to the veterans clinic in Corona and was shocked when they diagnosed me officially with PTSD \n \n or post traumatic stress disorder. My life has been changed since that day on december 31st 2007, and I will always deal with it. But oddly enough I dont feel afraid or anxious by it. It's jsut a reminder of the time when I fought for the right to live and the fight to be who I am.\n \n And also for those in California if your reading this, just keep your ears open and alert for day of decision. Or the day when the Cali supreme court makes a ruling on prop 8. I personally will be in west hollywood that day either cheering for equality, or marching in the face of an unjust piece of legislature. Either way I'm back and cant wait to keep the discussions going.",

No one should have to go through the hell that you did.\n\n \n \n Well it's not religion but rather the people behind it who's distorted views hurt people. And although I didnt want to have to deal with all this it's better to have gone through it for me being who I am than living a lie still not being happy with who I am.",
