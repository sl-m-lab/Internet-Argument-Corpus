I mean, I can already hear that soft tissue could possibly survive thousands of years, but millions?\n \n http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7195\n\n \n 1. I think we now possess tissue that may yield some insight into dinosaur DNA, but I recall reading an article on this same discovery that says it will not yield a complete description of the DNA and that Jurasic Park is still out of reach.\n \n 2. I think the creationists have little to celebrate here. Firstly, just because something seldom happens doesn't mean it never happens. The Ice Man proved that bodies can be nearly perfectly preserved without embalming fluids. Secondly, the softness of the tissue could have been revived by the soaking in fluids. Likely the tissue had been encapsulated for these millions of years and was not subject to extreme drying.\n \n \"To see what remained of this internal structure, Schweitzer soaked samples of the core of the bone in a solution that dissolved the calcium compounds.  This left what she describes as \"a flexible vascular tissue that demonstrates great elasticity and resilience\". \n \n For comparison, she then examined ostrich bones, as these birds are the largest and closest living relatives of T. rex. She found similar structures when she removed the calcium from the ostrich bones and treated the mixture with enzymes to break down collagen fibre in the bony matrix.\"",

   "Well, it is pretty interesting.\n \n To answer your questions: There is no expectation that any DNA will be recovered. DNA does not preserve well. Even under perfect conditions, DNA degrades with time.\n \n Schweitzer repeated the work with other fossils - three times in fact. However, in every case, the samples were from large bones of large dinosaurs. Some of the structures that appear to be cells or even red blood cells, but it is not known what they are made of. One comment was that it would be mush in the shape of the cell. The article you linked says that traces of protein had been extracted from Iguanadon bone. Again, large bones from large animals. Prior to that there were what appeared to be red blood cells extracted from another T. rex (I think). In that case, all that remained was heme, and iron compound that makes up part of hemoglobin.\n \n Who knows what information they'll get from these samples.\n \n Of course, creationists claim that this means that the earth can't be old. These must be fossils that are only about 4,500 years old - died in the flood, you know.\n \n Carl Weiland of AIG in Australia (an M.D. by the way) wrote an article. An example of the great care creationists take in their research is Weiland's statement that Schweitzer is associated with \"Montana University.\" There is no such place. Schweitzer is an assistant professor and researcher in molecular paleontology at N.C. State University. She was working at the Museum of the Rockies when she did this research. She had earned her Ph.D. from Montana State University in 1995.\n \n There was some speculation at the time of one of the previous finds about how the interior of a dinosaur bone could remain for millions of years without complete mineralization. I pointed out that all samples came from very large bones. What was suggested was that as the bone is mineralized from the outside in, the outer layers become impervious to water and thus seal the middle before it is completely mineralized. While the structures degrade, they are protected and remain in place.\n \n It's just another example of how creationists start from the conclusions and then selectively distort the evidence to support mythology.",
